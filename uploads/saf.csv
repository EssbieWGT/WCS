The company added that it still hopes to develop its South Dakota site.

Colorado-based Gevo had obtained a $1.46 billion loan through the U.S. Department of Energy to build a jet fuel plant at Lake Preston, South Dakota. Company officials told the North Dakota Monitor on Thursday that it instead will push ahead with making jet fuel at the Richardton, North Dakota, ethanol plant it bought last year. Gevo is working with the Department of Energy to transfer the loan to expand the North Dakota site.

Red Trail Energy at Richardton in 2022 became the first ethanol plant in the country to capture and store carbon dioxide, taking advantage of its location in an area with the right geology for permanent underground storage.

Gevo plans to expand the North Dakota ethanol plant, which turns corn into fuel. It would convert the ethanol into higher-value aviation fuel in a process it calls alcohol to jet. Carbon capture is a key part of making sustainable aviation fuel.

“We don’t have to share pipelines. We don’t have to wait. We’re already doing it,” CEO Pat Gruber said of carbon capture at the North Dakota site.

Company previously broke ground in SD

Gevo’s South Dakota site relied on the planned Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to take carbon dioxide captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota.

But the future of that project in South Dakota is in doubt because of landowner resistance, which has contributed to two rejected Summit permit applications in South Dakota and a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines adopted by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Larry Rhoden.

North Dakota attorney general says legal action against South Dakota pipeline law not an option

In 2022, Rhoden attended and spoke at Gevo’s groundbreaking near Lake Preston, where it proposed to build its plant in South Dakota. Rhoden was lieutenant governor at the time. Then-Gov. Kristi Noem said in a press release on the day of the groundbreaking that “businesses are choosing South Dakota because we are ‘Open for Business,’ and we give them the opportunity to succeed.” The press release described the Gevo project as the “largest economic investment in South Dakota history.”

On Thursday, Rhoden’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In Iowa, where Summit is based, the company is seeking to change its pipeline permit. Summit wants to remove North Dakota as the designated end point for the pipeline.

A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the change “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota,” reported the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

Gruber said the jet fuel production in North Dakota would be 30 million gallons a year, half of what was planned for South Dakota. But he said the 500 acres at Richardton could allow for expansion.

He said the jet fuel plant would cost about $500 million. Gruber noted that is substantially less than $2.6 billion it planned to spend on the South Dakota site.

Gevo is hosting a meeting Monday to answer questions for farmers and others in the Richardton area. The meeting will be from 6 to 7:30 Mountain time at WIX Barn near Richardton.

ND location provides access to oil industry

Gruber said building in North Dakota also opens the door to Gevo selling its carbon to the oil industry. North Dakota oil producers could buy the carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas into the well to help the well produce more oil.

“This is a great opportunity for us, and we sit right next to Bakken,” Gruber said, referring to the Bakken Formation. North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, with most of it coming from the Bakken.

Oil industry and state leaders have touted enhanced oil recovery as a way for North Dakota to sustain oil production for decades to come and continue to provide the state with tax revenue.

Gruber said Gevo has started discussion with oil companies, but he said the infrastructure to make enhanced oil recovery possible is still years away.

Ethanol plants are seen as a prime source for carbon dioxide because the gas is captured from the fermentation process of turning corn into ethanol instead of from the burning of fuel.

“It’s pure, concentrated CO2,” Gruber said.

Another benefit of carbon capture for Gevo is the ability to sell carbon credits to other industries with high carbon emissions. Gevo in September announced it is partnering with Biorecro North America on carbon credit sales generated at the North Dakota facility.

‘Matter of when’ with SD site

Gruber said he was grateful that the Department of Energy is working with Gevo on transferring the federal loan, though there are steps remaining to complete the process. Gevo filed a document with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday of its intent to use the loan money in North Dakota.

As for the future of the eastern South Dakota site, Gevo officials said it remains a great industrial location and will be developed.

“The are other things we can do at that site,” said Paul Bloom, Gevo’s chief business officer. “It’s a matter of when.”

But the Gevo officials said the demand for sustainable aviation fuel meant the company could not wait for the Summit pipeline. Summit had hoped to be operating in 2024 but has yet to start construction as it tries to secure all the permits it needs.

“We can’t sit around for that,” Gruber said. “We’ve got a mission here.”

Las Vegas, NV, Oct. 16, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) supercharged an industry driven by strong growth and a blazing pace of innovation.

From a packed exhibit hall and standing-room-only crowds, to a dazzling NBAA Aircraft Connection and nearly nonstop announcements, the 2025 NBAA-BACE showcased an industry ready to take on the future.

Business aviation’s most powerful event, NBAA-BACE took place Oct. 14-16, 2025, at the Las Vegas Convention Center and Henderson Executive Airport (HND).

“From the moment we opened the doors, it was clear this NBAA-BACE would be a monumental gathering for our industry,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “With boundless energy and great vibes, this show captured all that is unique and exciting about business aviation.”

The 2025 show led off with an unforgettable performance by multiplatinum artist, pilot and aviation champion Dierks Bentley, who shared how his career in music-making has been interwoven with his love of aviation. On the keynote stage, Bolen presented aerospace visionary Steuart Walton with business aviation’s highest honor, NBAA’s Meritorious Service to Aviation Award.

A dizzying array of new technologies, never-before-seen aircraft and business ventures were unveiled at NBAA-BACE, including the world debut of Textron Aviation’s new Cessna Citation Ascend midsize jet and Otto Aerospace’s Phantom 3500 business jet, featuring advanced laminar-flow design.

Newly formed company BOND chose NBAA-BACE for its launch as a fractional provider, announcing its large order of 50 Bombardier Challenger 3500 and Global 6500 jets. Real Jet, a business aviation brokerage firm, also made its rollout at the show.

Blockbuster deals and innovation milestones marked the convention from start to finish. Bombardier announced its Global 8000 had achieved a max operating speed of Mach 0.95, becoming the world’s fastest subsonic civil aircraft.

With an all-new format this year, the NBAA Aircraft Connection buzzed with the full diversity of high-tech business aircraft, from pistons to turboprops and jets. Gulfstream exhibited nearly its entire line, with a mockup of the just-revealed G300 making its NBAA-BACE debut.

The new Tribute to Flight Pavilion hosted vintage airplanes from a Learjet 23 and World War II aircraft to the Jet Age alongside cutting-edge models, such as Game Aerospace’s aerobatic GB1 GameBird.

In the convention center’s entryway atrium, Archer Aviation showed off its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) Midnight. Next to the futuristic eVTOL, the all-new NBAA-BACE Creator Studio, powered by Signature Aviation, provided a venue to connect with some of the most high-profile social media influencers and podcasters in business aviation.

On the show floor, Boom Supersonic, the startup developing a faster-than-sound jet, exhibited at NBAA-BACE for the first time. Skyryse demoed its simplified flight control system to enhance safety and make aircraft easier to operate. Attendees had a chance to see uAvionix air traffic management systems for safely integrating advanced air mobility into the nation’s airspace.

At a timely newsmakers lunch on the show’s media day, Rep. Sam Graves (R-6-MO), Congress’ lead transportation policymaker, spoke about the urgent push in Washington to modernize the nation’s air traffic control system. Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), spoke about the importance of the industry’s unified collaboration on safety leadership.

CNBC’s Phil LeBeau moderated a discussion with the CEOs of Bombardier, Embraer Executive Jets, Flexjet and Textron Aviation on business aviation’s future, the role of AI and ongoing workforce challenges.

NBAA-BACE provided countless opportunities to foster connection and promote new ideas.

The interactive NBAA Flight Deck hosted conversations with top leaders on the next generation of airspace, safety and the fast-moving business aviation market. In a year of intense focus on aviation safety, NBAA hosted the association’s latest National Safety Forum, NBAA Single-Pilot Safety Standdown and NBAA Small Operators Symposium.

The inaugural NBAA-BACE Military Connect presented a special program designed for veterans, by veterans, for those exploring a civilian career in business aviation. Military Connect offered a full slate of sessions, networking opportunities, job search tools in the Career Zone and access to hundreds of potential employers.

At an overflowing and exuberant YoPro Networking Reception and Helpy Hour, the NBAA Young Professionals (YoPros) celebrated their annual hands-on community service project. NBAA Collegiate Connect gave students a firsthand look at jobs in business aviation, with advice from industry pros at a range of career stages and tips for breaking into the industry.

At the show’s Awards Luncheon, NBAA’s 2025 Top 40 Under 40 were recognized and Aviation Personnel International CEO Sheryl Barden received business aviation’s highest honor, the NBAA Meritorious Service to Aviation Award, to a standing ovation.

In total, there were more than 75 education sessions at NBAA-BACE on hot topics, from the latest thinking about leadership, maintenance, operations, regulations and more.

Before and after the show, NBAA-BACE offered five Professional Development Program (PDP) courses to help people in the industry level-up their careers. The show also held its inaugural “Maintenance Track,” which allowed participants to qualify for up to eight hours of inspection authorization (IA) renewal credit.

The 2025 NBAA Tax, Regulatory and Risk Management Conference gave a timely look at aircraft transactions in a shifting tax-and-tariff environment.

The Business Aviation Sustainability Summit charted the industry’s mission to net-zero emissions, innovations and the market for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can reduce aviation’s lifecycle carbon emissions by as much as 80%. Las Vegas-area airports also made SAF available throughout 2025 NBAA-BACE.

“The 2025 NBAA-BACE fired the imagination, inspired an industry and highlighted the breakthroughs and pioneers ushering in a bright new era in business aviation,” Bolen said. “Business was conducted and connections made. This show had a tremendous vibe.”

Investment in clean, innovative fuels such as SAF, methanol, and ammonia with 45Z SAF tax credit maximum value reduced by 43% in H.R.
1’s drastically shortened availability timeline for the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.","H.R. 1, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act (OBBBA), enacted on July 4, 2025, expands the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) by extending it through 2029 and loosening eligibility requirements associated with transportation fuels’ carbon intensity (CI). Simultaneously, amendments to the 45Z credit within H.R. 1 dramatically reduce the maximum per-gallon credit value available to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers: from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon. Together, these and other changes to 45Z are expected to: (1) cost taxpayers $25.7 billion from FY25-34 (despite repealing the higher credit value for SAF), (2) expand tax credits for conventional biofuels that already benefit from other federal support and have limited greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential, and (3) limit federal incentives for domestic production of innovative fuels like SAF. 45Z as modified will not decrease GHG emissions of domestic fuel or promote production of domestic clean fuels.

Background

Congress created 45Z in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. The IRA set the maximum credit value at $1.00/gallon for eligible clean fuels, which included those with a CI of less than 50 kg CO2e/mmBTU produced in calendar years 2025-2027. Additionally, SAF was granted a higher maximum credit value of $1.75/gallon. Congress also required the tax credit to be adjusted annually for inflation. Fuels that earned other tax credits, like 45V (hydrogen production) or 45Q (carbon sequestration), were not allowed to stack these credits with 45Z. When the IRA was passed, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the 45Z credit (in place from 2025-2027) would cost about $2.9 billion over FY25-28.

The IRA made other changes to federal biofuel tax credits, including eliminating the biomass-based diesel credit, the second-generation biofuel credit, and other alternative fuel tax credits with the intent of replacing them with the technology-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. In addition, the IRA created the standalone 40B SAF tax credit, available in calendar years 2023-2024 (i.e., the two-year period before 45Z became operative). Fuels that reduced lifecycle GHG emissions by at least 50% could earn a credit of $1.25/gallon, up to $1.75/gallon on a sliding scale for each percent reduction in GHG emissions. Beginning in 2025, 40B was folded into 45Z, maintaining the maximum rate for SAF of $1.75/gallon.

Table 1: IRA fuel tax credits

Significant H.R. 1 Amendments to 45Z

One of the most significant changes to 45Z within H.R. 1 is a provision excluding emissions associated with indirect land use change (ILUC) from a fuel’s CI score. Ignoring ILUC can decrease CI scores of certain land-intensive conventional biofuels like corn ethanol and soy biodiesel by ignoring up to 20-25 g CO2e/MJ, yielding higher per-gallon tax credits for these fuels. ILUC-related GHG emissions are generated from land use conversion (e.g., clearing grasslands or forests – releasing carbon in the process – to replace food production on lands converted to biofuel crops) and other market-mediated effects not directly related to the biofuel crop. ILUC-related GHG emissions of biofuels derived from feedstocks that do not require dedicated land, such as agricultural and forestry residues and wastes, or feedstocks that may improve land systems (e.g., winter crops on seasonally fallow land, perennials on marginal land) may be more favorable and may be indirectly affected by this change if it encourages the continued reliance on conventional biofuel feedstocks.

In addition, H.R. 1 stripped the special SAF rate of $1.75/gallon, dropping it to $1.00/gallon to match all other clean fuels. This modification limits the incentive for domestic investment in new or expanded SAF facilities. SAF is still expensive to produce, as it is a nascent industry, and requires more support than other clean fuels to reach commercial scale. Many SAF producers factored the $1.75/gallon credit value into their business models and are now facing serious risks to investment and production capacity with the newly lowered credit value. SAF production facilities are currently positioned in states ranging from California to Montana with expansion planned in the West, South, Northwest, and Midwest in coming years. However, it is not clear how much of the planned expansion will proceed, as project developers around the country reckon with these changes.

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the new 45Z, including H.R. 1 changes, will cost taxpayers $25.7 billion through its expiration in 2029. When the IRA was passed, JCT estimated that 45Z would cost about $2.9 billion over four years. The significant expansion in cost from the 2022 estimate to the 2025 estimate is not tied to an increase inpublic benefits (such as reduced emissions); rather, the order-of-magnitude increase in cost results from Congress’s decisions to weaken the law’s carbon accounting requirements and allow a broader set of conventional biofuel producers to claim the credit.

Table 2: Summary of 45Z modifications in H.R. 1 compared to the IRA

Impacts of 45Z Modifications

The changes made to 45Z will cost taxpayers more while undermining U.S. competitiveness, innovation, and climate progress.

H.R. 1 changes to 45Z will benefit:

Domestic corn ethanol and soy biodiesel industries, with more gallons of current conventional biofuel production eligible for the tax credit at higher per-gallon tax credit rates compared to those under the IRA version of 45Z, mainly due to the new version’s directive against counting ILUC emissions. Increased production of corn ethanol and soy biodiesel could occur at the margin due to 45Z incentives, but domestic corn ethanol consumption growth is constrained by infrastructure, limited purchases of high-ethanol fuel blends, and flat or declining gasoline consumption nationwide. The corn ethanol industry could experience growth if domestic alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel production scales, however the new 45Z disincentivizes this industry, which is still in early stages of development. Even without significant volumetric growth, these industries will benefit from higher per-gallon subsidies.

Soy-based renewable diesel production is especially likely to benefit from higher per-gallon tax credits. As a mature and expanding industry, soy-based renewable diesel does not need taxpayer funding. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are also more expensive than diesel fuel, so unless oil prices increase significantly, production will likely be dictated largely by existing biofuel policies mandating a certain level of consumption each year, such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), not by the availability of 45Z credits. As a result, taxpayer dollars are not actually needed to incentivize production of these fuels, making changes to 45Z a windfall for conventional biofuels.

H.R. 1 changes to 45Z will disadvantage:

Taxpayers, since billions of dollars are expected to be spent annually on duplicative tax credits for carbon-intensive, mature biofuels that would be produced anyway under policies like the RFS and LCFS, which already mandate biofuel consumption. 45Z’s expansion and extension is unlikely on its own to spur additional job growth or economic investment in new production facilities nationwide.

Industry investment in innovative fuel production, including companies investing in high-paying jobs across the country to produce fuels for growing markets such as SAF and fuels utilizing clean hydrogen to produce clean ammonia, methanol, etc.

U.S. competitiveness and economic growth, since financial incentives will be shifted toward existing, mature industries like soy-based renewable diesel – an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars – instead of toward new, innovative fuels that generate significant economic growth, business investment, and international investment opportunities.

U.S. positioning as a global leader in SAF production, because companies will likely shift planned SAF investments to other countries, given the decreased financial incentives for domestic SAF production and uncertainty around federal policy.

Climate and environment, with less stringent carbon intensity reduction requirements for 45Z-eligible fuels and less funding directed at much-needed clean alternatives like SAF. The statute no longer requires consideration of the emissions resulting from the potential conversion of carbon-rich land like forests and wetlands which could occur withincreased corn- and soybean-based biofuel production. The production of conventional biofuels now subsidized by 45Z is also associated with worse water, air, and soil quality and diminished wildlife habitat.

Issues to Watch

With statutory changes to 45Z included in H.R. 1, the next step is for the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue new guidance relating to the implementation of those statutory changes. Some issues to watch over the coming months include:

How the removal of ILUC considerations within 45Z carbon intensity scores will be implemented at Treasury/IRS.

Whether and how Treasury/IRS or Argonne National Lab’s GREET model will incorporate certain farming methods (known as Climate Smart Agriculture, or CSA) such as no-till farming into CI scoring for 45Z. This is generally a way for biofuels to reduce their CI scores. There is a lot of uncertainty around the impacts of certain CSA practices, while others can be accurately estimated. Depending on the type of CSA practices that are credited, the implementation of those practices, and their incorporation into CI scores, the environmental benefits of biofuels could be improved or further eroded. Nothing in H.R. 1 authorizes Treasury to reduce a fuel’s carbon intensity score based on CSA practices. The biofuel industry has advocated for their broad inclusion in 45Z. CATF supports the inclusion of highly certain practices with quantifiable impacts, such as enhanced nitrogen efficiency fertilizers and reduced fertilizer use.

Final Renewable Volume Obligations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency for calendar years 2026 and 2027, which will dictate U.S. biofuel consumption as part of the RFS mandate. In June 2025, EPA proposed significantly higher mandates for biomass-based diesel consumption for 2025 and 2026.

Investment in clean, innovative fuels such as SAF, methanol, and ammonia with 45Z SAF tax credit maximum value reduced by 43% in H.R. 1. SAF production expansion announcements across the U.S. may also be affected by H.R. 1’s drastically shortened availability timeline for the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.

U.S. fuels policy should support innovative fuels to reduce emissions and grow the U.S. economy. H.R. 1’s changes to 45Z fail to deliver either of those objectives. Instead, they will cost taxpayers billions to subsidize mature industries with limited public benefit.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/02115443/airplane-runway-web.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:00:32.762806

Exogenous shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly disrupt the regional aviation landscape, just as they disrupt other aviation segments.","The regional aviation segment of the airline industry—which focuses on short-haul flights, uses smaller aircraft, and often services less-trafficked routes—encompasses about 6,000 aircraft in operation, with roughly 40 percent of these located in North America, 23 percent in Asia–Pacific, and 20 percent in Europe. Regional aviation accounts for about 9.3 million flights per year, and its roughly one-quarter share of the global commercial aircraft fleet provides about 11 percent of total commercial aviation seats. Prevalence of regional routes varies by geography (Exhibit 1).

Despite its global importance, regional aviation has not experienced the same dynamic postpandemic recovery as other parts of the aviation industry. The segment is not always well understood, and there are disagreements about its potential for further recovery and future growth.

In this article, we examine ten commonly held opinions about regional aviation. Drawing on detailed data analysis and interviews with industry executives, we aim to debunk myths, add to general understanding, and inform stakeholders about significant developments and uncertainties within the sector.

Myth one: Regional aviation is a homogeneous segment

Reality: The segment is diverse in terms of aircraft types, missions, and operator uses

Regional aviation is a remarkably heterogeneous sector. For instance, it relies on a variety of aircraft types, which can be grouped into several distinct categories. At the smaller end of the spectrum are turboprops holding fewer than 50 seats, typically used for shorter and lower-demand routes. Larger turboprops, with more than 50 seats, provide greater capacity and range. Regional jets can be divided into three main classes: small regional jets (about 48 seats on average), intermediate regional jets (about 74 seats on average), and large regional jets (about 108 seats on average). In addition, a new generation of small narrowbody aircraft (examples include the Airbus A220 and the Embraer E195-E2) has emerged. These models extend the mission profile traditionally served by regional jets, offering improved efficiency, greater range, and more passenger comfort, and thereby expanding the potential role of regional aircraft in airline networks.

With regard to missions, regional aviation can serve a wide range of roles. For instance, smaller aircraft can service less trafficked routes, either connecting to a hub as feeders or providing the foundation of a point-to-point, regional operation. The smaller gauge of these aircraft allows for more frequent service to small markets when compared with larger aircraft—enabling a more robust schedule and improved connectivity—because airlines can spread demand across more departures while maintaining stable load factors. Regional aircraft are also less expensive to operate, with lower costs per trip compared with larger narrowbody aircraft, translating into better economics for lower-traffic markets with limited demand. What’s more, regional aircraft service can provide vital access to remote locations—flying what are typically referred to as Public Service Obligations (PSO) routes. Finally, because smaller aircraft need less runway length, they are sometimes better suited for flying in and out of constrained airports (including inner-city airfields with tightly bounded footprints, such as London City Airport).

Regional aircraft are popular with a variety of operator types:

Network airlines use regional aircraft to enable hub feeding from secondary cities, and to provide service on thinner short-haul routes outside larger hubs.

Point-to-point specialists, such as independent regional airlines, often stock their fleets with smaller aircraft. Some might sign franchise agreements with larger airlines to benefit from their better-known brands and wider reach.

Contract carriers operating regional flights on behalf of other airlines—using a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) in which the CPA carrier does not assume commercial risk—often rely on smaller aircraft. In many cases, crew contractual provisions called “scope clauses” set boundaries on the types of aircraft, routes, and crew that can be included under these agreements.

Airline operators flying PSO routes (which are typically subsidized by governments) often use smaller aircraft to service remote or underserved regions where demand would not sustain a purely commercial route.

Myth two: Regional aviation’s postpandemic recovery has been uniformly sluggish

Reality: Certain subsegments, such as small narrowbodies, have had stronger recoveries than others

Global aviation has, in aggregate, fully recovered to prepandemic capacity levels. Regional aviation has, as a whole, lagged a bit behind. There is nuance, however, within regional aviation subsegments.

Regional service using small narrowbodies has fully recovered (with 19 percent more flights in 2025 than in 2019)—possibly as a result of the versatility and positive unit economics that these newer platforms can provide for carriers. Service using large and intermediate regional jets is inching toward prepandemic levels (still down 11 percent and 6 percent, respectively, when compared with 2019). But service using smaller regional aircraft and turboprops has experienced a much slower recovery—lagging significantly behind 2019 levels in total number of flights (Exhibit 2). Pilot shortages, aging fleets, and limited manufacturer investment may have all played a role in these results.

The precise shape of recovery varies by region. In North America and Europe, smaller regional jets and turboprops make fewer flights than they did in 2019, but during the same time frame, small narrowbody flights are up 63 percent in North America and 27 percent in Europe. Growth in Asia–Pacific and Central and Latin America has been limited to narrowbodies. Africa is the only region in which the segment has fully recovered across all aircraft types.

Myth three: Most regional city pairs are adequately served

Reality: Even within mature markets, there are significant opportunities for expansion

About 85 percent of regional aircraft services operate on routes shorter than 1,000 kilometers. From 2005 until the onset of the pandemic, the number of such routes steadily increased across most regions. Since the pandemic, however, this growth has stalled, with many regions flattening or even reversing the trend (Exhibit 3).

Some routes may have lost travelers to other modes of transportation, such as rail. Rising airport charges, or taxes, may have also played a part. (Looking at the three largest airports in each country, airline charges rose 67 percent from 2019 to 2025 in Germany, 35 percent in France, and 12 percent in the United Kingdom.) Whatever the cause, the drop in connectivity in some markets is striking. The German domestic route count is at just 38 percent of what it was 20 years ago.

In some regions, low connectivity could present opportunities. Underserved markets are not always easy to identify, but a simple proxy could be to look for city pairs where there is connecting traffic but no nonstop service (Exhibit 4). Many such markets show up in each region. While the majority of these are thin markets with fewer than ten daily passengers each way, some have more substantial traffic.

Our analysis indicates that there are still significant opportunities to directly connect underserved domestic European or intra-European city pairs that offer sufficient demand—particularly in places where low-cost airlines are absent and rail infrastructure falls short in terms of either capacity or quality. The individual business cases, however, depend on achievable ticket prices and associated costs (such as airport fees).

Myth four: Network carriers benefit from up-gauging their short-haul operations to improve economics

Reality: Using smaller-gauged regional aircraft on feeder routes can improve yield and offer other advantages

For larger airlines, regional and short-haul connections are essential to feed long-haul operations—bringing in the passengers that fill those widebody intercontinental aircraft. Using aircraft with larger capacity (a practice often described as “up-gauging”) on feeder routes can help network airlines capture economies of scale and lower the cost per available seat kilometer (CASK).

But on those short-haul routes, network carriers face intense competition from alternatives such as low-cost airlines, rail connections, and highways. The use of large feeder aircraft can result in too many empty seats if there is insufficient demand for regular connections. To fill these larger feeder aircraft, ticket prices for the “back of the plane” are often reduced.

This creates significant pressure on margins and can produce unwanted behavior: Some passengers will take advantage of those low fares to connect domestically through larger hubs instead of flying nonstop. This can lead to an increase in low-yielding, short-haul-to-short-haul connections. The resulting additional passengers at larger hubs can also overload airport operations and exacerbate the challenges of delays and operational irregularities. The larger the gauges of the aircraft in the feeding network, the more intense these effects can become.

Using smaller-gauge aircraft could provide a few different advantages for network airlines. Regional aircraft can be used to provide direct, point-to-point connections, addressing customer needs while easing pressure on congested hubs. Smaller aircraft can also help optimize capacity and yields for feeder flights into hubs, especially on lower-demand routes. Lastly, smaller aircraft can allow network carriers to operate in markets where there are infrastructure limitations (such as short runways) or economic challenges (resulting in fewer travelers who can afford to fly).

Myth five: Regional aircraft have an inherent cost disadvantage versus narrowbody aircraft

Reality: Newer regional jets have shrunk the gap in unit costs, while maintaining lower costs per trip

Smaller aircraft have fewer seats, but some costs—such as landing fees, fuel consumption, and pilot salaries—don’t reduce proportionally in line with aircraft capacity. The pilot of an aircraft with 200 seats isn’t paid 2.5 times more than the pilot of an aircraft with 80 seats.

New-generation regional jets and small narrowbody aircraft deliver about 3 percent lower CASK compared with older standard narrowbody models, but they have a roughly 16 percent disadvantage relative to the latest-generation standard narrowbodies. Despite this, new-generation regional jets and small narrowbody aircraft could remain a better choice for less-trafficked city pairs, as their per-flight operating costs are nearly 50 percent lower than those of newer standard narrowbodies.

The implication of closing per-seat cost gaps is that regional aircraft might be deployed more flexibly. They could potentially be used to increase the frequency of flights, or to connect additional city pairs, without creating an unacceptable increase in unit costs.

Myth six: Regional aircraft can’t compete with narrowbody aircraft when it comes to customer experience

Reality: Larger aircraft have some comfort advantages, but regional aviation also offers customer experience benefits

Larger aircraft typically offer roomier cabins, more washrooms, and quieter rides. Jets can also operate at higher altitudes that allow pilots to overfly bad weather, unlike turboprop aircraft that might need to take longer paths around weather or pass directly through turbulent air.

That said, an air traveler’s customer experience can be affected by many touchpoints along the journey—not just the flight itself. While larger aircraft often get preferable airport gate positions and can use more comfortable jet bridges, it’s also true that security, boarding, and deboarding can be faster and less chaotic at the smaller airports that are often frequented by regional aircraft.

Some newer turboprop aircraft also offer quieter and more comfortable rides. Nico Neumann, CEO of Deutsche Aircraft, says new technology allows turboprop aircraft to operate at up to 30,000 feet, with cabin insulation that reduces noise to 78 decibels—similar to cabin noise levels in regional jets. And despite the higher average age of regional aircraft, there can be opportunities to upgrade cabin interiors. American Airlines recently announced plans to retrofit some regional jets with in-seat power and satellite Wi-Fi, and to develop larger overhead bins.

André Alves, network planning director at Iberia, says that the airline’s regional operations often achieve customer satisfaction levels that are comparable with narrowbody operations. He says smaller aircraft are preferred by some customers, who find it more comfortable to not have a middle seat and appreciate the shorter boarding and deboarding processes. Alves adds that regional operations can also excel at reliability and punctuality, which are among the major factors that determine customer satisfaction.

Myth seven: Regional operators are just as exposed to exogenous shocks and downturns as the rest of the aviation industry

Reality: Regional aviation as a whole is less vulnerable to industry volatility, though some regional airlines face elevated company- and region-specific risks

Regional aviation often experiences relatively limited volatility, reducing risk for shareholders. This is especially the case when regional carriers operate under CPA-type agreements.

Globally, 54 percent of regional aircraft are used to provide network connectivity for major network airline partners, often under CPA agreements. In these collaborations, the major airline partner sells tickets while the regional aviation company focuses on operations. The regional operator earns revenue based on block hours flown or completed flights (often using a cost-plus arrangement) instead of tickets sold, so the commercial risk is transferred to the network airline.

Because of factors such as these, profit variability among CPA operators is significantly reduced, and profit variability for regional operators as a whole appears lower compared with the broader commercial airline sector (Exhibit 5).

Volatility can also be limited on PSO routes (such as those providing connectivity to remote areas) that a government deems essential and thus chooses to subsidize. About 23 percent of regional aircraft serve these routes. Because demand is tied to political priorities instead of fluctuating passenger traffic, these services are less affected by economic downturns or changes in the route’s market profitability.

While CPAs can provide stability and reduce risk, they can also limit profitability. And despite lower overall volatility—driven largely by CPA agreements—the smaller size of regional operators, and the region-specific risks they face, mean that the chances of volatile financial performance, bankruptcies, bailouts, and M&A activity increase. Exogenous shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly disrupt the regional aviation landscape, just as they disrupt other aviation segments. Smaller fleets and a narrower network can result in considerable company- or region-specific risks, given that there are fewer options to redeploy capacity to capture better returns than there would be in a more global network. What’s more, regional operators aren’t able to hedge returns by leaning on more profitable long-haul operations. No model is perfect, but regional aviation could benefit from new thinking about its commercial and operational approaches.

Myth eight: Shifting regulations and consumer sentiment regarding sustainability will create significant hurdles for regional flying

Reality: Regional aviation can lead the way in sustainable flying

Sustainability is an important issue for aviation stakeholders. Regulatory requirements, customer demand, and corporate commitments to decarbonization could all push regional aviation companies to prioritize sustainability in their long-term business models.

Several factors contribute to regional aviation’s environmental impact. For one, carbon emissions are proportional to jet fuel consumption: Given that smaller aircraft consume more fuel per seat, it follows that their carbon emissions will be proportionally higher than those of larger aircraft. On the other hand, conventional turboprop aircraft typically operate at 8,000 meters or below, an altitude at which the formation of contrails—which can contribute to global warming—is minimized.

New-generation small narrowbody aircraft burn, depending on the mission, approximately 15 percent less fuel per available seat kilometer versus previous-generation standard narrowbodies that are still widely in service, thus producing lower emissions. New-generation standard narrowbodies are more efficient on a per-seat basis (because they contain more seats), with approximately 4 to 7 percent lower fuel burn per available seat kilometer versus new-generation regional jets and small narrowbody aircraft. But on a per-trip basis, newer-generation standard narrowbodies burn 3 to 6 percent more fuel than newer-generation small narrowbodies and regional jets. Because smaller aircraft are easier to fill with passengers, changes can be amplified by higher load factors.

Regardless of how regional aviation’s environmental impact is measured, many feel that the segment can become a lighthouse for sustainable flying. Maarten Koopmans, managing director of KLM Cityhopper—a regional subsidiary airline of KLM—projects that new technologies (such as alternative powertrains) and fuels (such as sustainable aviation fuel) could first reach scale in regional aviation. It’s worth noting that using a fuel mix that includes 10 percent or 20 percent sustainable aviation fuel on a short-haul flight incurs a premium that can be less than $10 per passenger—much lower than the premium on long-haul flights.

Myth nine: Regional aviation is a driver of innovation

Reality: There is much opportunity for innovation with smaller aircraft—including using new propulsion technology—but the sector could benefit from bolder experimentation

At an average age of approximately 17 years, the regional passenger aircraft fleet (including turboprops, regional jets, and smaller narrowbodies) is significantly older than fleets in other aircraft categories. Standard narrowbodies are on average 11 years old. The average age of widebodies is 12 years.

The regional aviation sector is due for new aircraft—ideally, powered by innovative technology. Hybrid-electric, battery-electric, or even hydrogen-fuel-cell powered engines could help address rising concerns about sustainability and decarbonization (in the same way that electric and hybrid powertrains have helped decarbonize the automotive sector). The aircraft manufacturer ATR has announced plans to complete the first flight of a hybrid-electric regional aircraft by 2030. Other major OEMs have shared plans to introduce alternative powertrains, but exactly when these new platforms will take flight remains unclear.

Longer aviation innovation cycles can result from the intense effort and high costs involved in securing certification for a new model. These costs can reach $300 million to $500 million for small aircraft with 19 or fewer seats; for larger aircraft, the certification costs can easily be ten times more. Because smaller aircraft are less expensive to get certified and have lower energy needs (they weigh less even when full of passengers and generally travel shorter distances), regional aviation is well positioned to become the segment in which alternative propulsion first reaches scale. Regional aviation can seek to identify and capture demand opportunities that will enable more innovation.

It's important to note that innovation can also be applied to business models. The US charter airline JSX operates smaller-gauge regional aircraft in North America and advertises “private air travel, booked by the seat, at attainable fares.” As a public charter operator, JSX benefits from less onerous security screening standards and can use general aviation terminals, with check-ins as late as 20 minutes before departure. The focus on streamlined processes and elevated customer experience includes hangar-to-hangar satellite Wi-Fi, low-density seating, and complimentary snacks and drinks.

Myth ten: eVTOL and electric regional aircraft could replace traditional regional aviation

Reality: eVTOL air taxis are more likely to disrupt conventional helicopter and high-end road mobility services, and electric regional aircraft still need to prove their applicability

The electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft segment has attracted about $16.5 billion of investment since 2018. Multiple eVTOL vehicles now in development could potentially offer safe, quiet, convenient, and sustainable air taxi service.

The battery capacity technology of today’s eVTOLs limits their payloads to about four passengers, and they can only carry those passengers for relatively short distances. These limitations mean that, in the near term, eVTOLs are unlikely to challenge regional aviation. Instead, eVTOLs are more likely to disrupt conventional helicopter service and high-end road mobility services (such as luxury buses or black-car SUVs).

Electric conventional takeoff and landing (eCTOL) aircraft could potentially address demand for short hops from smaller regional airports. Lower-demand, point-to-point connections between regional airfields that are unprofitable using turboprop aircraft today could become viable with the lower CASK figures promised by future eCTOL aircraft. The lower price of electricity compared with fuel and the reduced maintenance costs for electric powertrains could enable cost savings for the operator, similar to the operating cost savings of electric vehicles versus internal combustion engine vehicles. McKinsey research indicates the market for flights that could be suited for eCTOLs could exceed $100 billion by 2035.

However, eCTOLs’ range and payload will be limited, their offer competes with rail in many locations, and eCTOL technology still needs to prove its readiness for adverse weather and winter operations.

Regional aviation plays a critical strategic role within the airline industry. Regional aircraft are indispensable for providing connectivity, flexibility, and cost-effective solutions in thinner markets, while also alleviating congestion at major hubs. Although the pace of regional aviation’s recovery has varied across regions and subsegments, advancements in technology, evolving business models, and shifting network strategies could help to secure the enduring importance of regional aviation within the broader ecosystem.

For stakeholders across the value chain, opportunities are significant. Operators can harness regional fleets to strengthen network reach and profitability. OEMs can tap into growth in emerging markets and next-generation platforms. Lessors can unlock value through strategic life cycle management. As the industry faces mounting sustainability demands, regional aviation is uniquely positioned to serve as a proving ground for alternative fuels and propulsion technologies. Far from being a peripheral player, the sector is poised to be at the center of adaptation and innovation—while continuing to improve reliability and customer experience to meet travelers’ ever rising expectations.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/travel%20logistics%20and%20infrastructure/our%20insights/small%20planes%20big%20changes%20the%20evolving%20business%20of%20regional%20aviation/small-planes-big-changes-2091789481-thumb-1536x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:00:37.512369

Yet, it also comes with a heavy environmental cost. The industry is responsible for nearly 3% of global carbon emissions a figure expected to rise as air travel grows. To address this challenge, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) have emerged as a critical solution for reducing aviation’s climate impact.

What Are Sustainable Aviation Fuels?

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are alternatives to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. They are made from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, municipal waste, or even advanced processes like capturing carbon directly from the air. Unlike conventional fuel, SAF can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, depending on the feedstock and production method.

What makes SAF particularly appealing is its compatibility. It can be blended with existing jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without the need for modifications. This makes SAF a practical, immediate pathway for decarbonizing aviation while longer-term solutions, such as hydrogen or electric aircraft, are still being developed.

The Industry Shift Toward SAF

Major airlines and aviation hubs around the world are increasingly committing to SAF adoption. Carriers such as United Airlines, Lufthansa, and KLM have already begun incorporating SAF into their operations. Airports in Europe and the U.S. are setting up dedicated supply chains, while governments are introducing incentives and mandates to accelerate production.

For many stakeholders, SAF is not only an environmental necessity but also a business opportunity. Investments in SAF production facilities are growing, driven by the rising demand for low-carbon air travel from both passengers and regulators.

Benefits Beyond Carbon Reduction

While emissions reduction is the most widely recognized advantage, SAF offers other benefits too. Using waste and residues as feedstock reduces reliance on fossil fuels and helps build a circular economy. SAF production also opens doors for regional job creation, particularly in areas with strong agricultural or bio-based industries.

Additionally, SAF supports airlines in meeting global climate targets, such as the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Challenges on the Horizon

Despite its promise, SAF is not without hurdles. Production costs remain higher than conventional jet fuel, and current supply is limited. Scaling SAF requires significant investment in infrastructure, technology, and policy support. Ensuring that feedstock sourcing is sustainable, without competing with food supply or causing deforestation, is another critical factor.

Yet, the momentum is undeniable. With technological advancements, supportive regulations, and collaborative industry efforts, SAF production is expected to grow rapidly in the coming decades.

Looking Ahead

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are not just an alternative fuel they represent a shift in how the aviation industry approaches its future. By combining innovation with environmental responsibility, SAF provides a bridge between today’s reliance on fossil fuels and tomorrow’s cleaner aviation solutions.

Takeaway Point: Sustainable Aviation Fuels are a game-changer for the aviation industry, offering a realistic and scalable path to reducing carbon emissions while keeping the world connected. Their success depends on collaboration across industry, government, and communities to ensure a cleaner, more sustainable future for flight.

This paper argues that rising aviation emissions, which are disproportionally driven by the wealthy, pose a serious threat to climate goals. Using the UK’s Jet Zero strategy as a case study, it explores how policymakers and industry promote speculative technologies—efficiency gains, electric and hydrogen aircraft, sustainable aviation fuels, carbon capture, and offsetting—to justify continued aviation growth. We critically assess these claims: electric aircraft are limited to short routes; hydrogen faces major storage and infrastructure barriers, and green hydrogen remains scarce. SAFs, often derived from land-intensive crops, risk deforestation, biodiversity loss, and higher net emissions. Second generation SAFs, such as used cooking oil, are scarce, and power-to-liquid is speculative and prohibitively expensive. Carbon capture is unproven at scale, and offsetting enables airlines to claim reductions without cutting actual emissions. These “solutions” align with a political agenda that prioritises economic growth and airport expansion. We argue that this techno-optimism delays real action. Rather than gambling on future breakthroughs that may never materialise, policymakers should pursue immediate demand-reduction strategies and support a just transition—ending frequent-flyer incentives, shifting short-haul flights to rail, removing aviation fuel subsidies, and retraining workers for low-carbon sectors.

Introduction: aviation and the climate crisis

It is no longer necessary to watch a Hollywood movie to imagine what a climate disaster might look like; glancing at the newsfeed will often suffice.Footnote1 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first to exceed 1.5°C warming above pre-industrial levels. It brought catastrophic flooding to West Africa and Valencia, and drought to southern Africa. In southern California, where a perfect tinderbox had been created by extreme wet-then-dry conditions known as hydroclimatic whiplash, the start of the new year saw wildfires wreak havoc (Kolbert, Citation2025). 2025 also saw destructive floods in Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, northern China and Texas, while in Britain many crops failed due to drought. Climate breakdown is proceeding more quickly than previously anticipated (Hansen et al., Citation2025). We are, warns UN secretary-general António Guterres, on the ‘highway to climate hell’ (United Nations, Citation2024). And climate is only one among many vectors of environmental breakdown. ‘Planetary boundaries’ are being crossed at a rate of knots – seven out of nine at the latest count (Gayle, Citation2024).

Against this backdrop, the need to rapidly decarbonise could not be more pressing. Britain is currently off track to meet its target of ‘net zero’ by 2050 (CCC, Citation2024), and three quarters of its primary energy still comes from fossil fuels (Energy Institute, Citation2025). Nowhere is the scale of the deficiency clearer than in aviation. According to the 7th Carbon Budget of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), an advisory body to the British government, in 2023 UK aviation emissions were 69% higher than in 1990; they account for 8% of UK emissions, with international flights the principal driver of expansion (CCC, Citation2025, p. 222).

In this paper, we scrutinise aviation decarbonisation strategies, with Britain’s Jet Zero plan as the case study. We read Jet Zero as a gamble predicated on a series of technologies and policies that are highly unlikely to achieve their goals. We assess the prospects for electric and hydrogen aviation, efficiency savings, carbon capture and storage, offsets, and sustainable aviation fuel. We then tease out the implications for policy.

Our focus is on Britain, due in part to its historic responsibility for the climate crisis. In cumulative CO2 emissions Britain ranks eighth in the world, but if we factor in its empire (ruled from London) the position is higher, and it reflects Britain’s pivotal role in the dissemination of fossil-fuel use worldwide (Evans & Rydén, Citation2005; Ritchie & Roser, Citation2020). Against this fossil-imperial backdrop, Britain’s Nationally Defined Contribution (NDC) to reducing emissions falls short of an equitable share (Civil Society Equity Review, Citation2023; Gabbatiss, Citation2023). In part, too, our focus on Britain relates to its legal commitment to a target of ‘net zero’ by 2050, following a law passed in 2008 when Labour’s Ed Miliband was Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. Ever since, it has positioned itself as a ‘climate leader’ (DESNZ & Miliband Citation2024). The increasing climate-impacting significance of aviation and the role the sector plays in the government’s vision for making Britain ‘the world’s best-connected place to do business’ makes its ‘Jet Zero’ programme an exemplary lens through which to study the friction between ‘growth’ and sustainability (Stewart, Citation2025b).

Jet Zero was set up under Boris Johnson’s premiership, the declared aim being to steer the aviation industry toward ‘sustainability’. With particular clarity that programme manifests the ‘technological solutionism’ and ‘technofixes’ that dominate policymaking on decarbonisation, and above all on aviation. Technofixes refer to questionable claims regarding what technology can achieve in order to reduce the pressure to address social and ecological problems in other ways. There are obvious reasons that governments succumb to this way of thinking (e.g. line of least resistance regarding potentially unpopular behavioural change) and obvious attractions for corporations in propagating it (the camouflage it offers for prioritising profits over the habitability of Earth).

Technological solutionism, similarly, recasts ‘complex social situations either as neatly defined problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimised (Morozov, Citation2013, p. 5). Examples of technological solutionism abound in UK government pronouncements and policies today, be it the programme for ‘a digital health service powered by cutting-edge technology’ as a solution to an ailing NHS, or the quest to make Britain ‘the world leader’ in AI in order to ‘turbocharge growth’ (Department for Science, Innovation & Technology et al., Citation2025; Streeting, Citation2024). Jet Zero is cut from the same cloth. It seeks to sidestep politically difficult questions pertaining to the social purposes of transport, leisure and work, instead reaching for technological trump cards.

Those technofix range from the unproven to the unrealistic to the downright harmful. It is important that we strip back the futurist veneer of the promises and policies of sustainable aviation, debunk the obfuscatory language deployed, and carefully scrutinise the claims made.

We submit that ‘sustainable aviation’ represents a reckless gamble on new technologies, some of which are unproven and many of which are likely to be unscalable. It melds flimsy promises from the aviation industry, in its attempt to pre-empt government intervention, with empty bluster from governments keen to placate a climate-concerned electorate. Ultimately, its function, if not the motivation, is to provide a smokescreen, one that lingers until the current government is out of office, leaving its successors – not to mention human society and other fauna and flora – to face the heat. In short, in Britain, as is largely the case elsewhere, techno-utopian fantasy is writing the official script. The result is a diversion of attention from the practical changes needed, which we shall summarise in the final section.

Jet Zero and aviation emissions

Consultation for Jet Zero began in July 2021 under Boris Johnson’s premiership. It built upon the previous ‘Net Zero Strategy’ and ‘Transport decarbonisation plan’ to chart a course for aviation to reach net zero by 2050 (Department for Transport, Citation2021; HM Government, Citation2021a). With the aim of helping the aviation sector decarbonise, the consultation centred on a Jet Zero Council – ‘a forum bringing together government, industry and academia to speed up change’ (Department for Transport, Citation2022b, p. 4). In July 2022, the Jet Zero strategy document was published. It was constructed chiefly of assumptions and promises borrowed – naïvely, as we show below – from the aviation sector, in particular from the industry organisation Sustainable Aviation, mediated through government-industry partnership bodies (Department for Transport, Citation2022a, Citation2024a). Largely frozen out were climate scientists and the environmental groups and NGOs that seek to protect the interests of Earth and its inhabitants.

A key assumption that the Jet Zero strategy reproduces is that in its emissions calculations and scenarios CO2 emissions are foregrounded. This risks obscuring aviation’s true climate impact. As much as two-thirds of aviation’s global-heating impact stems from non-CO2 emissions and cloud formation. The actual impact of aviation on global heating may be tripled once these non-CO2 emissions are factored in (EUASA, Citation2020; Lee et al., Citation2021). To put this in perspective, a return flight from London to New York, generating one tonne of CO2 per passenger on average, has an actual impact equivalent to around three tonnes (Kommenda, Citation2019). According to the CCC (Citation2020), three tonnes is the total annual level of per capita emissions to which Britain must be restricted by the mid-2030s, if the 1.5C target is to remain even possible.Footnote2 We should also consider military aviation. Aviation makes up a third of the Ministry of Defence’s (MOD) self-reported CO2 footprint, and the MOD accounts for 50% of UK government emissions (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Citation2024).Footnote3 If we factor in the non-CO2 effects, military aviation alone could account for as much as a third of total UK government emissions. Military aviation emissions are forecast to rise, as Britain increases its military spending in line with the NATO-wide target of 3.5% of GDP. This target, if met, would lead to extra emissions across NATO member states estimated at 1320 million tCO2e over the next ten years – the equivalent of the annual emissions of Brazil (Parkinson, Citation2025).

Rather than exercise caution in a situation where underestimating impacts will generate real effects that cannot simply be ‘taken back’, the government’s response to the question of non-CO2 effects has been ‘wait and see’.Footnote4 It promises to channel some funds into research in the area, while refusing to incorporate any of the existing research into its calculations on the climate impact of aviation (HM Government, Citation2024a). This is short-sighted and self-serving: it frames uncertainty as a reason for current lack of action and misrepresents what the ‘uncertainty’ is telling us. Consider by contrast the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Although it has been widely criticised for its capture by the aviation industry (Carrington, Citation2025), even it takes care to point out the significant impact of non-CO2 aviation emissions on global heating. Its research shows that non-CO2 emissions’ effects increase alongside the projected growth in CO2 emissions (Lee et al., Citation2023). In other words, these obscured contributions of aviation to climate breakdown will only grow in significance unless the sector’s overall CO2 emissions are reduced.

As noted in the introduction, Jet Zero’s projections point to significant growth in numbers of passengers, flights and distances flown. For example, a 2020 government report projected that by 2050, passenger miles flown will be twice the 2017 figure and six times the 1990 figure (Department for Transport, Citation2020a). The picture is similar in Europe, with the latest figures suggesting that EU air traffic could reach more than 2.3 times the 2019 level by 2050 (T&E, Citation2025). Aviation, by the government’s own admission, is set to comprise fully a quarter of Britain’s GHG emissions by 2050, and will be the industry with the greatest carbon emissions (HM Government, Citation2018; Sustainable Aviation, Citation2020). This means that even if the proposed technofix were to work as promised, in 2050 the sector could be burning as much fossil kerosene as in 2023 (T&E, Citation2025).

Jet Zero and its technofixes: efficiencies, batteries, hydrogen

The Jet Zero report set 2019 as the peak year for aviation CO2 emissions, following which they would decline to 21 million tonnes (Mt) in 2050. At that point, aviation will be ‘net zero’ – assuming that those 21 Mt are captured and stored, or offset. Before we examine the proposals for reaching that goal, it is worth pointing out that airline emissions are already on track to exceed the 2019 peak (Topham, Citation2024). That the plan is already faltering is an early warning of its inadequacy. We predict that it will not get back on track. A key reason is that the strategy assumes that technology can be relied upon to solve the problem. This emulates the strategy of transition to electric vehicles in the road transport sector, but without the proven technologies that that sector can point to.

One prominent technofix is efficiency improvements. These, Jet Zero predicts, will account for a major share of aviation carbon savings by 2050. Such forecasts, however, are based on wishful thinking; the empirical evidence leans strongly against them. According to the International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT) the real-world fuel efficiency of aircrafts – otherwise known as block fuel – increased by 1.3% per annum (pa) between 1960 and 2024 (Hameed & Rutherford, Citation2025; see also Kharina & Rutherford, Citation2015; Zheng & Rutherford, Citation2020). Over the same time period, the metric valueFootnote5 – which measures how efficient an aircraft is technically designed to be – increased by even less: only 1% pa.Footnote6 Almost all of the scenarios developed by major international aviation organisations in the last few years forecast efficiency savings at less than 1% pa (IATA, Citation2024). The 1.4% pa efficiency gain on which Jet Zero relies, Finlay Asher, a former aircraft engine designer at Rolls Royce, told us, is ‘wildly optimistic’. There are ‘no large step-changes in efficiency around the corner and it takes 10–15 years to certify a significant new aircraft and engine design. So, anything we do see in 2035 – e.g. new designs entering service – will not be the predominant aircraft in service in 2050, due to the 20–30 year lifetime of aircraft’.

A deeper problem with efficiency gains are their rebound effects (York et al., Citation2022). Improvements reduce costs which spur demand, leading to more miles flown. According to the CCC (Citation2020), if demand is not constrained, Britain’s aviation industry will grow at an average rate of over 2% pa over the coming decades. While there are different scenarios, there is a shared expectation that numbers of passengers, flights and distances flown will grow (Leggett, Citation2025). Globally, the sector is set to double by 2040, with growth at an average 3.5% pa (IATA, Citation2023). Needless to say, Earth’s systems care little that less kerosene is required per passenger if more in total is being burnt due to air travel’s overall growth (Dobruszkes & Ibrahim, Citation2022).

Other technofix look to alternative fuels. At the inception of the Jet Zero plan, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, identified ‘biofuels and electric aircraft’ as a key focus (Department for Transport, Citation2020b). The model is similar to the electric vehicles (EVs) strategy for road transport: a ‘business as usual’ approach that assumes ever-growing sales, little or no demand management, and a high-stakes gamble on technology. In road transport, the strategy is fraught with problems, not least the emissions from extraction and manufacturing processes, and the capacity of renewable energy production: replacing all vehicles with EVs risks exceeding the global carbon budget (Morgan, Citation2020). But while decarbonising road transport is deeply problematic, it is technically feasible. Adopting a similar strategy for aviation is not simply problematic; it is, at least for the foreseeable future, delusional. Jet Zero’s promotion of electric planes is exemplary in this regard. Shapps’ claim that they offer ‘boundless possibilities’ (Department for Transport, Citation2019) is questionable, given the well-documented challenges they face. Due to the weight of batteries – which, unlike fuel, don’t burn off as you fly and are much less energy dense – electric flights will only be viable for short journeys with few passengers (Walker, Citation2019). The maximum range of the tiny nine-seater prototype ‘commuter plane’ developed by leading firm Eviation is 460 km – about the distance from London to Newcastle (Weitering, Citation2024). These aircraft remain a long way from commercial operation and the past five years for the sector has been a story of delays and tempered expectations (Kaminski-Morrow, Citation2020; Sampson, Citation2025), if not outright insolvency, as in the case of German electric aerospace company Lilium (Westerheide, Citation2025). The industry consensus is that for flights of 1,500 km or longer – which make up 80% of aviation emissions – battery-powered flight is unfeasible (Air Transport Action Group, Citation2021; Pfeifer, Citation2019; Schwab et al., Citation2021). In other words, electric planes are a substitute less for jet planes than for buses and trains: an airborne taxi service for well-heeled travellers seeking to avoid congested roads and trains.

Another technofix promoted by the Jet Zero consultation is hydrogen flight (HM Government, Citation2021b). Hydrogen doesn’t suffer from the problematically low energy density by mass of lithium batteries, but because its energy density by volume is far lower than jet fuel it requires much bigger and heavier onboard storage tanks. Hydrogen planes would also require very extensive modifications to airport infrastructure. The source of hydrogen is another concern. Only one percent is currently ‘green’ – i.e. produced with renewable energy. It is over thrice the price of ‘grey’ hydrogen, which itself is four times as expensive as kerosene (Henderson, Citation2021). Grey hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, with CO2 released as a waste gas – around 830 million tonnes each year (Pirani, Citation2020). If those emissions are captured and sequestered, the hydrogen is known as ‘blue’. Recent studies warn that blue hydrogen could be worse for the climate even than burning fossil gas, due to methane loss during its production plus the high energy inputs – still, typically, from fossil fuels (Howarth & Jacobson, Citation2021; Schlissel & Juhn, Citation2023).

It is also worth noting that there are corporate and geopolitical pressures behind the push for some technologies over others (Balanyá et al., Citation2020). In Britain, oil companies have strategically misrepresented the costs of blue hydrogen whilst asking the taxpayer for billions of pounds in subsidies (Ambrose, Citation2021). The myth of a green transition to hydrogen-powered aviation serves the interests of states rich in oil and gas deposits and of the fossil-fuel companies that extract them, fearful that their assets will become stranded (Noussan et al., Citation2021). We are not using the word ‘myth’ lightly. Willie Walsh, Director-General of the International Air Transport Association, admits that no long-haul hydrogen flights will be possible until ‘beyond 2050’ (Topham, Citation2021). Airbus has ‘suspended’ its plans to develop hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft, citing ‘slower than expected developments in technology’ (Hepher, Citation2025). Boeing, likewise, sees little potential in hydrogen-powered flight before 2050 (Raymond, Citation2023), and other industry experts forecast the most optimistic date for its long-haul viability as the 2050s or 2060s (Transport Select Committee, Citation2022). Switching to hydrogen, moreover, would require astronomical sums for investments in energy, storage and infrastructure, and could add decades to the ‘net zero’ transition in aviation, according to a CCC spokesperson (Hollinger, Citation2021). Moreover, burning hydrogen releases much more water vapour than the equivalent jet fuel, meaning it would contribute to global heating via contrails (Forster et al., Citation2023). In short, hydrogen is only ‘green’ in prohibitively expensive form, it offers no realistic alternative to kerosene in the near to medium future, and even its medium-term applications are limited to short-haul flights. Green hydrogen production may be ramping up, but often in problematic ways. European-owned green hydrogen projects in north Africa, for example, stand accused of displacing local populations and occasioning serious environmental harms, whilst siphoning off tens of millions of litres of water in areas with high levels of water insecurity. The hydrogen produced is largely exported to Europe, rather than contributing to a green transition locally. These activities, according to a recent report, reflect a broader strategy whereby Europe is externalising ‘the climate costs of its energy consumption’ in ways that entrench ‘extractivist neocolonial structures’ (Greenpeace & MENAFEM, Citation2025, p. 44).

Take off for economic growth?

Jet Zero was the brainchild of a Tory government whose goals for aviation dovetailed with those of the industry itself. This was tacitly acknowledged in the way in which aviation industry representatives referred to government plans. An example was the 2018 reportThe Future of UK Aviation (HM Government, Citation2018), in which the then aviation minister, Liz Sugg, framed the expansion of aviation as a given for future development. The Minister of Transport under Rishi Sunak went further, stating in Parliament that the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate (more on which below) ‘is part of our approach to ensure that the rationing of flights through ‘demand management’ is ruled out’ (Hansard HC Deb., Citation2024).

Expectations that the incoming Labour government of 2024 might take a different tack found support in the fact that its minister for Energy Security and Net Zero was (and at time of writing still is) Ed Miliband, while its prime minister, Keir Starmer, had voted against Heathrow expansion when it had been put to the Commons in 2018. Such predictions were quickly scotched, as environmental considerations found themselves trumped by the economic growth drive, centred on the expansion of energy infrastructure, IT infrastructure (such as data centres), housing, and, of course, aviation.Footnote7 The most vocal growth booster in government, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, explicitly stated at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos that in any conflict between growth and ‘net zero’, the latter ought to come second (Stewart, Citation2025a).

In relation to the Jet Zero plan, then, the new government opted for continuity. It established a Jet Zero Taskforce (Department for Transport, Citation2024b), formed overwhelmingly of the CEOs of aviation companies and oil companies, plus a smattering of representatives from the renewable fuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) industries (HM Government, Citation2024b). And when the CCC, in its 2024 report to parliament assessing progress towards net zero, reiterated the call for a halt to all airport expansion (2024), the government doubled down on its commitment to increase aviation (HM Government, Citation2024a). The aviation sector responded warmly. Kenton Jarvis, CEO of easyJet, spoke for the industry as a whole when he praised Starmer’s government for its ‘recognition of the importance of aviation and the crucial role it plays as an enabler of economic growth’Footnote8 (Alexander & Reeves, Citation2025).

Under particular scrutiny in this regard has been the decision to support airport expansion, with a third runway at Heathrow already approved, along with a huge extension to City Airport (Department for Transport, Citation2025b). The extra flights would be considerable, potentially increasing from 480,000 a year to 720,000 at Heathrow alone (Leggett, Citation2025). Plans to almost double the capacity of London Luton Airport have been approved by the Transport Secretary – notably going against the recommendations of the Planning Inspectorate, whose report found that the environmental harms of the expansion outweighed the public benefits (Planning Inspectorate, Citation2025). Similar plans to increase the capacity of Gatwick by over 100,000 flights per year have received backing from the Transport Secretary (Topham, Citation2025). Amid protests from environmentalists, and from some prominent Labour supporters such as the ‘eco-entrepreneur’ Dale Vince, the government insists that there is no tension between expanding the aviation sector and meeting its carbon emissions targets. For the former Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Jonathan Reynolds – who, with Reeves, voted in favour of Heathrow expansion in 2018 – airport expansion and decarbonisation ‘go hand in hand’ (‘Today’, Citation2025). But how exactly might this work? Reeves provided the answer. When pressed on why Starmer had completed a U-turn on airport expansion, she invoked the rapid development of sustainable aviation fuels. SAF, she claimed, has become a ‘game-changer’ in the expansion debate – a technological ticket to guilt-free flying (Georgiadis & Pickard, Citation2025).

The government’s message, in short, is that a contradiction no longer exists between its commitments to economic growth and environmental sustainability. A growing aviation industry is compatible with the ‘net zero’ mission, thanks to efficiency gains and technological breakthroughs – in particular in SAFs.

The HEFAlump in the room

That government spokespeople such as Reeves extol SAF as the elixir of sustainable aviation comes as no surprise. As the prospects for electric and hydrogen-fuelled aviation have experienced a series of setbacks in the early 2020s, SAFs have returned to the forefront of debates around decarbonising aviation. On 1 January 2025, the government’s SAF mandate came into force which requires flights to be fuelled by two percent SAF, rising to ten percent in 2030 and twenty-two percent in 2040 (Department for Transport, Citation2024c). The mandate also includes a revenue certainty mechanism for producers, but this is yet to be implemented (Department for Transport, Citation2023). Despite being hailed a ‘game-changer’ by the Chancellor, there are considerable doubts around the sustainability, scalability and efficacy of SAF as an alternative to kerosene. After examining these issues in detail, it will become clear why this central pillar of the plan for sustainable aviation is so flimsy.

First of all, SAF is not ‘green’ in the way one might think. Burning it produces a similar amount of CO2 to kerosene. It is primarily in its production that the GHG savings are factored in. This green arithmetic should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis, as SAFs have the potential, especially when land use is changed to produce crops for biofuel, to actually increase the net GHG emissions, thereby contributing more to global warming than burning fossil fuels (EUASA, Citation2025). The UK government defines three types of SAF. The first is called HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) – this is fuel made from animal fats and vegetable oils. The second is non-HEFA biofuels which can be produced from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), alcohol from food crops (‘Alcohol to Jet’ (AtJ)), and from non-food crops, woody crops, and forestry and agricultural waste – this latter group is ‘second-generation biomass’. The third is power-to-liquid synthetic electrofuel (PtL), which is generated using captured carbon and hydrogen (BP, Citation2023; Department for Transport, Citation2024c). Of the three, HEFA is the most established and by far the cheapest of the three methods. However, it has some major downsides, as we shall see, which explains the government’s decision to include a steadily increasing cap on HEFA fuels in its SAF mandate.

The best-known HEFA-using aviation entrepreneur is Richard Branson. In the mid-2000s he arranged for coconut oil to part-fuel a flight from London Heathrow to Amsterdam. The event garnered a burst of media attention, but the sustainability implications were troubling. To have fuelled that short hop with 100 percent coconut oil would have required three million coconuts (Dale, Citation2008). The entire global crop would supply Heathrow for only a few weeks – and it is one of 18,000 commercial airports worldwide. Following this stunt, coconut oil was never used in a Virgin flight again. The Virgin flight drew attention to intrinsic problems of using HEFA. Energy crops such as palm oil or coconuts are not sustainable in any reasonable definition of the term. For energy production they’re a sub-par use of land: solar panels convert solar energy for human-use much more efficiently. In competing with agricultural crops, their downsides are legion (DeCicco, Citation2016). They contribute to GHG emissions from land-use change, and to land-ownership concentration; they cause food price rises, food insecurity, deforestation, peat burning, water shortages, and biodiversity loss. To give but one example, in 2019 alone, the palm oil suppliers to Neste, the world’s largest biofuel producer, were accused of deforesting at least 10,000 hectares and setting 13,000 forest fires (Milieu Defensie, Citation2020). The scale of the potential demand is radically incommensurable with the availability of land to produce biofuel. If 100% of global jet fuel in 2050 were to be produced from SAFs derived from seeds and oilseeds, it would require a staggering two billion acres to grow – five times the cropland area of the United States (Qualman, Citation2024).

Biofuel crops produce GHG emissions in other ways too (Dale, Citation2007). Their inputs include large quantities of energy and fertilisers, a major source of nitrous oxide, as well as hydrogen – largely from fossil gas – for the hydrotreatment of oil (Hughes, Citation2021). Biomass from plantation-grown trees is seen by many in the aviation industry as the new cornucopia, but it suffers from all the same drawbacks. Branson’s proposed solution after the coconut debacle was to pivot to algae, a solution which attracted sizable investment from major oil companies eager to give their polluting activities a green veneer. As a water-based crop, algae appealed in part because it was seen as a way to circumvent the issue of land use change. In 2008 we predicted that algae would not be a viable option (Dale, Citation2008), a forecast that was confirmed a decade and a half later when ExxonMobil was the final fossil-fuel investor to abandon the project (Westervelt, Citation2023).

Used cooking oil: flying on fumes and fraud

Britain’s government is well aware of the significant limitations of HEFA-based biofuels.Footnote9 This is reflected in its decision to impose a cap on HEFA-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is set to fall from 71% in 2030 to just 35% by 2040. It has also ruled out fuel made from food, feed, or energy crops as eligible for designation as SAF (Department for Transport, Citation2024c). Yet even with these measures, the government’s consistently optimistic projections for new technologies fall short of what is needed to meet the SAF mandate. At present, Britain has only one operational SAF facility: the Phillips 66 Humber refinery (USDA, Citation2025).

This helps explain why, as of 2023, a staggering 97% of the UK’s SAF supply came from used cooking oil (UCO). Only 8% of this originated domestically (due to its limited total supply), with the bulk imported from Malaysia and China (Purvis, Citation2025). China, the world’s largest UCO producer, is already struggling to meet demand from Europe and the US, while Malaysia has reportedly exported more ‘used’ cooking oil than it actually produces (Goulding Carroll, Citation2022). These discrepancies have raised serious concerns about virgin vegetable oil being fraudulently mixed into the UCO supply (T&E, Citation2024). If confirmed, some UCO-derived SAF is in significant respects more damaging even than kerosene, especially where palm oil plantations – linked to deforestation – are used to meet the demand.Footnote10 Importantly, even where UCO is authentic (i.e. verified waste rather than virgin oil), it is not only a finite waste resource, for which demand is already outstripping supply, but its environmental cost remains high as it displaces use from other, arguably more important, sectors such as domestic biodiesel and animal feed – which in turn further drives deforestation (T&E, Citation2021b).Footnote11

For sustainable fuel, attention has consequently shifted to other sources. One is CO2 extracted from the air by Direct Air Capture technologies and converted into SAF, also called Power to Liquid (PtL) (Keith et al., Citation2018). This may offer potential in the distant future but currently is far too expensive at £94.50/gigajoule (GJ), compared with the £16/GJ it costs to refine jet fuel from crude oil (IEA, Citation2023b). The process is also extremely energy intensive. It would take 468–660 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy to replace the ‘UK’s fossil jet fuel consumption’(The Royal Society, Citation2023). To put that into perspective, in 2023 Britain’s total electricity consumption was 266 TWh (Statista, Citation2025).

Other sources include forestry residues – such as bark, branches, and sapling thinnings, municipal and business waste, and industrial offgases – but these are not a serious alternative. They compete with more pressing uses: decarbonising electric power, fuelling ground transport, and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). Waste and offgases, in contrast, do look potentially promising. In 2021 we spoke to two companies which together have received over £50 million in government funding to construct the first wave of non-HEFA SAF plants – Velocys and Lanzatech (Department for Transport, Citation2025a).

Velocys

Of the 27 million tonnes of waste collected annually by Britain’s councils and businesses, a Velocys representative told us, much consists of water, and recyclable substances such as metals and ‘inerts’. These are removed. The remainder is heated using the Fischer–Tropsch process (Steynberg, Citation2004). Contaminant gases are washed out and what remains, chiefly hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is converted to SAF. The Fischer–Tropsch process is a proven technology that dates back to the 1920s, but questions remain as to whether it is capable of delivering sustainable fuel in sufficient quantities, and in time to achieve the government’s Net Zero target. Several obstacles merit attention.

First, SAF from waste is expensive to produce – at least twice the cost of fossil jet fuel (The Royal Society, Citation2023). Producing fuel to meet the high quality and safety requirements necessary to keep a passenger jet in the air is more complex – and thus more costly – than producing biodiesel for buses, trucks or tractors. This leads to the second problem: the amount of municipal waste available is hugely insufficient. Even if all of the available Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) were converted, it would only meet about ten percent of UK jet fuel demand (The Royal Society, Citation2023). One might reasonably ask if this limited supply would not be better used to meet the needs of land vehicles without viable alternatives in sectors such as agriculture. Third, as with PtL fuels, the energy requirements are prohibitive. Britain is predicted to fall significantly short of its 2030 green energy target – despite having revised this down in December 2024 (Cornwall Insight, Citation2025). Globally, energy-transition investment actually declined in 2024, and currently stands at just over a third of the amount required to reach net zero by 2050(Corradi, Citation2025). There simply is not sufficient surplus renewable energy to warrant its diversion to SAF.

The recent development of SAF production, moreover, does not inspire confidence. None of the Velocys projects have reached commercial production. The promise was that its plant in Immingham would start supplying British Airways in 2024, but the site is still ‘a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side’ (Plucinska et al., Citation2025). If it does eventually open, it will presumably draw power from the national grid, fuelled to a very substantial amount by non-renewable energy, seriously denting any green credentials it may have had (NESO, Citation2025). On top of this, its direct GHG emissions will be considerable. Over its entire lifetime including combustion, SAF from municipal solid waste produces up to two thirds as much CO2 as fossil kerosene (The Royal Society, Citation2023).

In short, Velocys, like most alternative SAF projects, has not demonstrated commercial-scale viability and there are strong grounds for scepticism. Its case is not atypical. According to a Reuters investigation, of the 165 SAF projects announced by airlines worldwide over the past 12 years, only ten have produced commercial quantities of fuel (Plucinska et al., Citation2025). The oil giant Shell has scrapped construction of its SAF plants in Singapore and in Rotterdam (Almeida, Citation2025). In Britain, there are two other proposed MSW-to-SAF projects, both of which have received government funding (Department for Transport, Citation2025a). One, from the American firm Fulcrum, was set to be twice the size of Velocys’ Immingham facility. However, when their flagship plant in Nevada – the first of its kind – was finally opened after years of delays, it was beset by a multitude of problems including nitric acid corrosion of pipes, massive nitrous oxide emissions and a huge overestimation of the amount of fuel it would actually be able to produce (Howard, Citation2024). The fiasco ended with Fulcrum filing for bankruptcy in 2024 (Hussain, Citation2024). According to research by Andrew Rollinson, most large-scale commercial gasification plants fail. The technology, he notes, ‘has high risks associated with multiple pathways for fire, explosion, and the release of environmental toxins’ (Rollinson, Citation2018). Even if we were to set aside the criticisms of the technology raised above, there is little reason to believe that Velocys’ project will be the kind of success story the government is hoping for.

Lanzatech

LanzaTech’s core technology is ingenious: Clostridium bacteria combine carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produce ethanol, for conversion into jet fuel (AtJ). Its ideal locations are blast furnaces, the offgases of which include carbon monoxide and hydrogen. LanzaTech anticipated that its facility adjoining the Port Talbot steelworks would yield 80,000 tonnes of fuel annually. Although this sounds impressive, we learned from a LanzaTech representative that it represents ‘0.6 percent’ of Britain’s jet fuel usage. As steel production shifts away from fossil fuels in pursuit of its net zero goals, moreover, the supply of those offgases will dwindle – and indeed the last blast furnace in Port Talbot closed in 2024. Hence, LanzaTech has had to look beyond the steel industry, but the feedstocks they have found contain little or no hydrogen, which must then be manufactured. They are exploring DAC-to-SAF projects, but here, again, the energy needs are colossal, and the bottleneck is the availability of renewable electricity.

Other possible feedstocks would include forestry waste, which we discussed above, as well as sources of ‘second-generation bioethanol’, such as straw. These too face many competing uses, the available quantities are low, and the jet fuel would be expensive – perhaps two to four times dearer than kerosene. LanzaTech’s CEO, Jennifer Holmgren, notes that using recycled CO2 or CO costs far more than refining oil, and bringing the cost curve down could take ‘30 or 40 years’ (Gertner & Payne, Citation2021). Production cannot, needless to say, be scaled up at will: it takes three years, at minimum, to get a plant up and running, and only then can the efficiency improvements be transferred to future projects. Construction of LanaTech’s plant was due to commence in winter 2024, but this deadline was missed. The company hopes to begin production in 2026, but notes that this timeline is ‘subject to securing the legislation, investment and off-take agreements that are needed to move forward to a final investment decision’ (LanzaTech, Citationn.d.; Smith, Citation2025).

The aviation industry knows that synthetic fuels cannot be ramped up quickly. As to SAFs in general, in Britain, as the Sustainable Aviation group admits, annual production of 600 kt won’t be achieved until the mid-2030s at the earliest. Even the lowest usage scenario it envisages ‘would exceed globally available waste oils and fats’ and would require ‘substantial new volumes of oil crops’ (Sustainable Aviation, Citation2020).

Carbon capture and storage

Even if one were to set aside scepticism regarding the technological assumptions underpinning the Jet Zero strategy – to accept, for instance, that fuel efficiency will improve at an unprecedented rate, that electric and hydrogen aircraft will overcome existing technical and financial barriers to constitute a meaningful share of the fleet, and that SAFs can be scaled commercially without inflicting further ecological harms – the framework remains fundamentally reliant on negative emissions technologies. This reliance persists even under the most optimistic scenarios, raising critical questions about the feasibility and integrity of the Jet Zero pathway.

By 2050, the Jet Zero strategy anticipates that approximately 21 MtCO₂ will need to be removed annually for the aviation sector to achieve ‘net zero’. (The Sustainable Aviation group (2020) projects an even higher figure, estimating that at least 26 MtCO₂ will need to be either offset or removed each year; and the CCC (Citation2020) suggests that aviation will require around 40% of the UK’s total negative emissions capacity by mid-century.) This raises serious ethical concerns regarding the allocation of limited carbon removal resources to a sector characterised by extreme inequality in access and impact. Globally, just 1% of the population is responsible for half of all aviation emissions (Niranjan, Citation2025), while only 2–4% of people fly in any given year (Gössling & Humpe, Citation2020). In the UK, the disparity is equally stark: 15% of the population accounts for 70% of flights, and half of the population does not fly at all in a given year (Hopkinson & Cairns, Citation2021). Moreover, the wealthiest 10% of Britons generate more emissions from aviation alone than do the poorest 20% from all their activities combined (Baltruszewicz et al., Citation2023). Citizens of the Global South, meanwhile, typically take between zero and one flight per year. The disproportionate allocation of financial and carbon budgets to what is effectively a luxury activity for the affluent raises serious questions of environmental justice and equity.

Even if we leave morality to one side, there remain significant doubts regarding the storage capacity for CCS, and the yawning gap between the diminutive scale of monitored and verified carbon removal and the gargantuan scale required for the Jet Zero sums to add up (de Coninck & M. Benson, Citation2014; Ketan, Citation2021). There are currently forty-one CCS facilities in the world, of which 82.5% are used to aid the extraction of oil in mature wells (Zero Carbon Analytics, Citation2024). In most countries, CCS is unregulated. Those forty-one plants are expensive, potentially dangerous, and are failing to meet their targets (Weyler, Citation2022; Zoledziowski, Citation2022). A recent report on Norway’s Sleipner and Snøhvit pilot plants revealed unexpected behaviour of CO2 in even the most intensively studied of aquifers, a reminder that the danger of leakage is all too real (Hauber, Citation2023). In its most recent roadmap, the International Energy Agencynotes that the history of CCS is one of ‘unmet expectations’ and delayed deployment, that ‘removing carbon from the atmosphere is costly and uncertain’ and that the technology remains ‘unproven at scale’ (IEA, Citation2023a). Its entire efficacy has been called into question by the IPCC, with serious doubts raised over the technology and its claims to carbon neutrality (Robertson, Citation2022; Sekera & Goodwin, Citation2021).

While funding, especially from the polluting industries, should be invested into CCS research and trials, one should also recognise that its primary purpose, today, is as a technofix, built on insecure foundations and geared to short-circuiting difficult political decisions and supporting fossil-fuel giants (Anderson & Peters, Citation2016; Laville, Citation2021; Quiggin, Citation2024). Even the US climate envoy under the Biden administration, John Kerry, admits that CCS risks becoming a dangerous distraction from the need to reduce emissions, while former US vice-president Al Gore dismisses it as ‘an absolute fraud’ (Breeze, Citation2024; Harvey, Citation2023).

Offsets

The solutions discussed so far are vastly overestimated in the Jet Zero programme, manifesting a blasé disregard for scarcities, realistic timescales, and technical obstacles. Yet all are based on technologies that do, or might one day, function. Offsetting, by comparison, is an outright scam. That it is accorded a prominent role in Jet Zero – even in its ‘high ambition’ scenario, offsetting is billed as providing the second-largest ‘reduction’ in emissions, after CCS – is scandalous.

Offsetting is the right to pollute in one location purchased by certificates declaring its reduction in another, relative to ‘business as usual’ – certificates that can then be traded on carbon markets. The logic by which it functions is questionable, to say the least. It’s as if, when a factory poisoning a Malaysian river reduces its pollution ahead of a regulatory deadline, a factory in Liverpool were thereby licensed to discharge mercury into the Mersey. Of carbon offsetting, the great majority relates to protecting areas from future deforestation. Forests, alongside ocean and peatland, are vital carbon sinks that absorb half of human emissions; many of these are losing their ability to absorb carbon (Greenfield, Citation2024; IPCC, Citation2023). Halting deforestation plays, naturally, a vital role in climate change mitigation. But this should not give licence to corporations to continue pumping CO2 into the atmosphere somewhere else (Milman, Citation2018). The carbon credit system into which offset certificates are poured, moreover, is ripe for corruption and fraud (Chan et al., Citation2023). This was made abundantly clear when multiple studies into the world’s largest carbon offsetting certifier revealed that ninety percent of their offsets were utterly worthless (Guizar-Coutiño et al., Citation2022; West et al., Citation2020, Citation2023).

Reforestation schemes may prima facie appear more justifiable, but they too are flawed. Crucially, they fail to take into account the fact that trees are not interchangeable units. Old forest is a complex ecosystem with dense understories; it cannot be ‘replaced’ by plantation silviculture (Monbiot, Citation2021). Moreover, trees take decades to grow and if they are then caught in wildfires for example, they release all the carbon they have been absorbing (Hodgson, Citation2021). People inhabit the places where the offset industry wishes to site plantations. Their fields, livestock and livelihoods are in the crosshairs of carbon offsetting projects. The quantity of land required is staggering – a forest the size of the Isle of Wight would need to be planted every year just to keep up with the carbon footprint of the Royal Air Force (Defence Committee, Citation2023; MoD, Citation2023; Moseman et al., Citation2025). Carbon credits concerned with reforestation and funding renewable energy have been linked to a litany of social and environmental harms. For example, projects connected to Chevron’s carbon offsets include planting rubber monocultures, which are disastrous for local ecosystems and are ineffective at carbon offsetting. A large portion of Chevron’s carbon offsetting schemes involved construction of large hydroelectric dams. These projects would in all likelihood have been constructed anyway, so their status as ‘offsets’ is risible; they have also been accused of undermining local communities, with use of violent methods to suppress resistance (Corporate Accountability, Citation2023). Critics have pointed to the neocolonial and exploitative nature of such relationships (Olúfẹ́mi, Citation2019). Ill-advised if not outright damaging practices of offsetting are taking place in the context of centuries-old unequal relationships of extractivism, sometimes by the very same corporations – as in the case of Chevron in Colombia. We are left with a troubling picture: ineffective carbon offsets threatening food security in the Global South in order to maintain the lifestyles of the world’s frequent flyers (Harvey, Citation2021).

The flaws of reforestation schemes are emblematic of the broader problems with carbon offsetting. These issues are not limited to individual projects but are systemic, as evidenced by the ICAO’s carbon trading scheme, CORSIA. The scheme, which Britain was instrumental in setting up, will account for the majority of the UK aviation sector’s offsets. Beyond the general issues raised above, CORSIA has come under significant criticism from experts. None of the offsetting programmes under the scheme address issues of double counting (where an area of, say, rainforest that was already protected under a national scheme is then counted again for offsetting). Neither do the price mechanisms work, due to oversupply: when buying credits is cheaper than buying SAF, it undermines the incentive to decarbonise. Finally, the entire scheme is beset by a lack of transparency and enforceability (T&E, Citation2021a). That the Jet Zero plan places such emphasis on offsetting seriously undermines its claims to be aiming for ‘net zero’. To repeat: with every fraction of a degree of heating, climate breakdown becomes more severe, unpredictable and irreversible, and the earth’s ecosystems deteriorate further. Carbon offsetting, by giving corporations the green light to continue emitting greenhouse gases, is detrimental to the future habitability of Earth.

Policy proposals

Travelling through an airport in Britain, you might be forgiven for thinking that today’s jetliners are as light as birds. From Gatwick to Bristol, advertisements proudly declare that the airport from which you are taking a flight halfway across the globe is ‘carbon neutral’. Despite the absurdity of such statements being summarily pointed out (Walker, Citation2021), the aviation industry’s attempts to paint a green image of itself are unending. From Ryanair’s banned advertisement that declared it was ‘Europe’s lowest emissions airline’ (ASA, Citation2020) to KLM’s green claims for SAF being ruled ‘misleading’ (Sterling & Plucinska, Citation2024), there are countless examples of aviation-industry ‘greenwashing’. Indeed, a recent study found that 44% of aviation industry publicity regarding carbon offsets was misleading (Guix et al., Citation2022). This is not a new development. ExxonMobil’s 2011 advert promoting biofuel from algae, to give one of many examples, was banned for making similarly dishonest claims (Euractiv, Citation2011). This example is particularly instructive given that the much-vaunted algae ‘solution’ culminated in a dead-end, as we discussed above. The aviation industry has a history of deliberately misleading the public in order to justify its unhindered expansion. To do this it relies on exaggerated, unrealistic and disingenuous claims put forward for a slew of technofix. However, it does not act alone. Obliging governments and compliant media organisations should be held accountable too.

Considering the body of research surveyed in this article, it is evident that the Jet Zero plan prioritises the wellbeing of the aviation industry over the environment. Were the habitability of the planet its driving concern, Jet Zero would recommend demand management measures, such as a ban on aviation advertising and frequent flyer programmes, and the removal of tax exemptions on aviation fuel. It would emphasise 2030 targets, not 2050. It would prioritise consultations with young people, environmentalists, and scientists, rather than aviation lobbyists. It would take seriously the Absolute Zero report from Cambridge University’s FIRES research group (Allwood et al., Citation2019). If Britain’s ‘net zero’ target is to be achieved by mid-century, the FIRES engineers have shown, the aviation industry ‘faces ‘rapid contraction’. This entails the phasing out of ‘all aviation activity’ within 30 years’, with the mothballing of all British airports except Glasgow by 2030, and Heathrow too by 2050 – and only then, if the necessary technologies and sufficient renewable electricity come onstream, could some reopening plausibly begin.

The case for aviation contraction is unlikely to be universally popular, and won’t be a vote winner, unless two conditions obtain. One is a meaningful shift in attitudes to climate breakdown. The other is that transport reforms are linked to proposals that address popular concerns. If campaigners are to bring the aviation industry back down to earth, the vision must be of a habitable planet together with feasible and appealing travel alternatives.

As discussed above, aviation is an elite activity both in the West and worldwide. An opinion survey from 2024 reports that, Rachel Reeves’ pronouncements notwithstanding, the British public does not see aviation growth as essential to economic growth, supports taxation of aviation fuel and raising ticket prices, and ‘strongly supports’ equalising the cost of train travel versus air travel – even if this requires higher taxes on aviation (Chapman, Citation2025b). While jet owners represent 0.0008% of the global population, in Britain private jets represent one in ten flights taking off (Collins et al., Citation2023; Vaughan, Citation2023). A passenger on a private jet travelling from New York to Washington DC – the same distance as London to Paris – is responsible for around 45 times the emissions of a passenger flying the same route on a commercial flight, and 1,100 times one travelling by train (Collins et al., Citation2023). The case for banning private jets, in short, is overwhelming. Business travel should be shrunk, too. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated that much of it can be replaced by online meetings. If even just those business trips deemed ‘unnecessary’ were curtailed, Heathrow’s traffic would, at a stroke, shrink by nearly a fifth (Statista, Citation2023). Meanwhile, a frequent-flyer levy could equitably reduce demand – without punishing once-a-year holiday goers – during the period in which alternatives to flying are rolled out. Such levies are popular among the British public (Chapman, Citation2025b), and should be imposed with particular priority on the luxury-ticket classes (first, premium, business), for these, while by far the most environmentally damaging, face relatively low taxation under Air Passenger Duty. Alongside the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies, these tax revenues could also provide ‘innovative sources of finance’ to provide ‘Loss & Damage’ assistance to populations most adversely affected by climate breakdown, on the basis of the polluter pays principle (Amnesty International & CIEL, Citation2022).

Beyond these reforms, short-haul and domestic flights should be rapidly phased out. A first step has been taken by France, with its prohibition on flights covering routes that could be travelled within 2.5 hours by train.Footnote12 Again, evidence suggests these policies are popular, with one EU-wide survey finding that two in three Europeans would support a ban on short-haul flights to destinations that could be reached in twelve hours by train (Garton Ash et al., Citation2020). To replace short-haul flights, investment in rail and battery-electric coach infrastructure could enable reliable and accessible public transport for all, at affordable prices or even free. Within Europe, night trains present a viable and convenient substitute and should be revived and upscaled. Surveys consistently demonstrate that people prefer train journeys to flying (Carn & William, Citation2021). Where rail offers a viable alternative, such as between London and Paris, we see passenger demand for aviation collapsing (Rowland, Citation2019). Cruising at a modest 125 mph, a train from London could, with stops, reach Barcelona in eight hours, Ankara in twenty.

The challenge of addressing emissions from long-haul flights remains particularly complex. Alternatives are less readily available than for short-haul travel, yet their significance is greater. A study of flights departing from 31 European countries revealed that those exceeding 4,000 km constituted only 6% of total departures yet were responsible for 47% of total fuel consumption. Similarly, a global analysis found that just 5% of flights – those longer than 3,000 km – accounted for nearly 40% of total aviation fuel consumed (Dobruszkes et al., Citation2024).

To date, there appear to be no viable proposals for long-haul aviation that simultaneously meet ecological sustainability criteria, uphold social equity, and remain politically feasible. What is certain, however, is that a single return long-haul flight from Britain can exceed an individual's entire annual per capita carbon budget, assuming adherence to the 1.5°C climate target. In this context, substantial reductions in long-haul air travel appear to be the only ecologically defensible course of action. While such measures may face resistance, the imperative to remain within the boundaries of a stable planetary system must surely take precedence. The alternative is to risk pushing the Earth system into a state incompatible with the complex societal structures developed over the past five millennia. As Al Gore aptly stated, ‘the maximum that is politically feasible, even the maximum that is politically imaginable right now, still falls short of the minimum that is scientifically and ecologically necessary’ (McKibben, Citation1995).

The absence of clear alternatives to long-haul aviation should not be used to justify the continuation of current practices. That said, we can take inspiration from the slow travel movement (Kieran, Citation2013). If legislation encouraged flexibility from employers, slow-moving zero-emission ships could offer an alternative for some long-distance journeys (Neale, Citation2021). And airships – we venture tentatively, aware that we may be afflicted by the techno-utopianism that this article cautions against – may offer an additional low emissions alternative to aeroplanes (Hall, Citation2024; Jolly, Citation2025).

All these initiatives, whether night trains, ships or airships, would create new jobs, for which workers departing the aviation industry should, in a ‘just transition’, be given priority. A report commissioned by Possible found that if British aviation shrank by two-thirds, around 200,000 jobs would be lost, but by replacing these journeys with alternatives (e.g. trains and ferries), together with the resulting growth in domestic tourism, a net gain of over 300,000 jobs would result (Meadway, Citation2022).

The ‘just transition’, as has been widely observed, is a contested concept. We follow Stefania Barca in her attempt to reclaim the just transition strategy from a simple jobs campaign yoked to a ‘green growth’ agenda, to a programme that, while centred on trade-union mobilisation for ‘green jobs’, simultaneously draws upon ‘Indigenous knowledges’ and advocates for disinvestment from the fossil fuel and nuclear sectors, coupled with energy democracy and food sovereignty at the community level (Barca, paraphrased in Rainnie & Snell, Citation2024, p. 38). International solidarity would be close to its heart; the risks of reinforcing neo-colonial and extractivist relationships with the Global South in the pursuit of ‘green’ policies are well documented (Abram et al., Citation2022; Ambrose, Citation2024; Bell, Citation2024; Hamouchene & Sandwell, Citation2023; Okpanachi et al., Citation2022).

As an embryonic example of a ‘just transition’ in aviation, consider the case of ‘A Green New Deal for Gatwick’. It was convened by eco-socialists and union officials from the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), a union that has been at the forefront of campaigning and policy work on ‘climate jobs’ and the just transition (Lethbridge, Citation2024), during the Covid-19 pandemic when aviation workers were facing mass layoffs. We asked Robert Magowan, one of the proposal’s instigators, what lay behind the Gatwick plan. ‘We know that aviation must degrow’, he replied, ‘and it was degrowing during the pandemic, but this must not come at the cost of workers. The pandemic response showed what governments can do when pressure is on – especially when the Broughton manufacturing site of Airbus was retooled to produce ventilators’.

Magowan and his colleagues surveyed the manifold ways in which Gatwick workers’ skills sets could be adapted to jobs elsewhere, in decarbonising industries. With PCS backing, they found support among the workforce, including from a pilot whose words eloquently sum up what is at stake:

It has been my lifelong dream to fly. To face up to losing this massive part of our lives is incredibly scary; to lose our job is like losing a part of ourselves. But as pilots, we use our skills to identify this existential threat to the natural world and our lives. If this was an emergency in flight, we would have diverted to a safe destination long ago. We can’t just fly blindly to the planned destination as the flight deck fills with smoke. Our industry’s impact on global emissions is irrefutable. The so-called solutions to ‘green’ the industry at its current scale are decades away and are not globally or ecologically just. With environmental consciousness rising, the aviation sector will either shrink by design, through a ‘Just Transition’ for workers, or by disaster. We must find a way to put workers at the forefront of the green revolution, to ensure we have the option to be retrained into the green jobs of the future (Latif et al., Citation2020, p. 24).

A just transition of this kind could have numerous positive impacts on local communities. €4 million is lost every hour by European governments because aviation is untaxed (T&E, Citationn.d.). This aid received by airports and the aviation industry could be redirected to fund local leisure and sustainable transport infrastructure. Even redundant airports could be transformed into community hubs, museums, or green spaces (as was done at the former Berlin airport at Tempelhof) (Magowan, Citation2022).

Conclusion

The Jet Zero plan, with its reliance on unproven technofix and industry-friendly policies, exemplifies a complacency that has underpinned climate inaction for decades. It not only fails to address the scale of the aviation sector’s contribution to the climate crisis, but risks exacerbating it. Its techno-solutionism would have us believe in the alchemical power of new technology: it can turn carbon into gold. But the evidence is clear: carbon capture and storage, sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen-fuelled and battery-electric planes are not the silver bullets they are made out to be, and offsetting is a farce. These proposals serve chiefly as window dressing for the aviation industry, an alibi to provide cover for unchecked expansion while delaying the difficult decisions needed to mitigate global heating.

As the mercury continues to rise, governments, rather than working urgently to reduce aviation emissions, are placing their bets on yet-to-materialise technologies (Schleussner et al., Citation2024). The airlines, hand in glove with policymakers, are using these ‘solutions’ to carve out space to expand their operations. If such solutions, however, are false promises, as this paper argues, the aviation industry ought to be scaled down, and permitted to re-grow only if the lifecycle of aircraft can be designed to avoid GHG emissions entirely. The methods necessary to curb aviation emissions exist; what is lacking is the political ambition to implement them. They includes policies to equitably reduce demand for air travel, and investment in sustainable alternatives, with measure to ensure a just transition for workers and communities dependent on the aviation industry. The flaws of governmental responses to the Covid-19 pandemic notwithstanding, they hinted at the rapid, transformative change that can occur where the political will exists.

For the rising global temperature to be stabilised at 1.5°C, high-emissions industries must be rapidly reined in. This requires not only a radical reassessment of how we travel, but also structural transformations, with respect to the logics of economic growth and the goals of social justice and the habitability of the planet.

2 The CCC acknowledges the problem: ‘Aviation’s non-CO2 effects refer to the additional climate impacts from aviation not due to GHG emissions, such as line shaped contrails, high cloud increases, and the impacts from air pollution. Since 1990, the warming effect of non-CO2 effects has tripled’. (CCC, Citation2025, p. 223).

6 Average measures of fuel efficiency conceal substantial variation across periods. During the late 1960s, the replacement of first-generation with second-generation jets yielded significant efficiency improvements (5.6% annually in block fuel and 3.7% in MV). By contrast, from the 1990s through the early 2010s, the absence of major technological advances resulted in near-zero gains. The introduction of more efficient aircraft types in the 2010s, notably the Boeing 787, produced improvements of up to 3.5%. However, efficiency growth stagnated again in the early 2020s (Hameed & Rutherford, Citation2024). That average fuel efficiency has struggled to climb substantially above 1% pa is confirmed by the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) which in 2019 admitted that while they aspire to efficiency gains of 2% pa, “today’s aircraft are approximately 80 per cent more efficient in use of fuel per passenger kilometre than that in the 1960s” – in other words around 1.1%pa (ICAO, Citation2019).

7 Recent research suggests that the energy demands of data centres may already exceed, globally, the electricity produced by renewables (Castro et al., Citation2024). This should be of concern to the Starmer government, given its commitment to a breakneck expansion of data centres (Gross et al., Citation2025).

8 It is important to point out that even if we were to put aside the environmental and social costs of airport expansion, its contributions to growth are debatable. A recent report carried out by the New Economics Foundation found that as expansion primarily increases outbound passengers, it is “highly unlikely” that it offers “any growth benefits to the UK” (Chapman, Citation2025a). And in an extensive analysis of the economic case for the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport, a report found that it would in fact lead to a net loss for the region’s economy (Chapman & Postle, Citation2020).

9 The EU’s SAF mandate suffers from similar problems. Based on the projections of Boeing and Airbus, emissions savings from the EU’s 42% SAF mandate will be cancelled out by growth, with CO2 emissions in 2049 predicted to be just slightly lower than their 2019 level (T&E, Citation2025). However, given the low forecast for the availability of efuels, like Power to Liquid (PtL), we infer that a hefty portion of that SAF demand will be met by HEFA-based biofuel or similarly unsustainable sources. If this is accounted for then European aviation emissions would likely rise to a peak in 2049 (T&E, Citation2025).

10 Despite knowing of the concerns regarding authenticity of the oil, the British government has excluded SAF from its investigation into Chinese biodiesel imports (Hussain, Citation2024). Instead, it relies on industry-led certification schemes like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certificate to verify authenticity. These schemes depend heavily on self-reporting rather than independent verification, casting doubt on their reliability (Greenpeace, Citation2021).

11 In the UK, biodiesel is primarily used for road transport (DEFRA Citation2025), as well as agricultural machinery, and power generators.

12 Despite France’s ability to whisk passengers across vast distances in under 2.5 h thanks to its extensive high-speed rail network, Britain still sees multiple daily flights on routes that are easily covered by train.

“If we want to bring more people to our side, we need to start talking about how SAF can build new markets for farmers,” Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said Thursday at the annual SAF North America conference in Houston.

“We need to start talking about how SAF fits into this administration's goal of energy dominance, and we need to start talking about how this is a high-growth opportunity that America cannot afford to miss out on.”

While SAF production has increased in recent years, primarily in the form of fuel made from vegetable oil and waste fats and oils, it still represents a small fraction of aviation fuel. SAF can also be produced from ethanol. The first such operation, a LanzaJet facility in Georgia, has yet to start commercial operation.

Another company developing alcohol-to-jet SAF, Gevo, plans to produce the fuel at a 30-million-gallon-a-year facility in North Dakota. A larger project planned for South Dakota has stalled because of the struggles of Summit Carbon Solutions to build its carbon sequestration pipeline in that state.

The SAF industry suffered a setback when an extension of the 45Z clean fuel production credit that was included in the One Big Beautiful Bill removed an bonus incentive for SAF. The credit, which was authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, also was revised to exclude feedstocks not produced in the United States, Mexico or Canada. The credit, which was originally supposed to sunset after 2027, was extended through 2029.

The Trump administration has largely been supportive of biofuels, including SAF, at the same time it is trying to uproot federal climate policies.

Skor noted that the Trump administration also scrapped the Biden administration’s SAF Grand Challenge, a goal supported by airlines to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030.

“The current administration is emphasizing American energy dominance while moving the focus away from climate and carbon performance,” Skor said.

Even though the 45Z SAF incentive was scaled back, Skor suggested that getting the credit extended by two years at the same time other IRA policies were being rescinded demonstrated the political clout of various sectors working together.

Speaking of the 45Z extension, she said, “That's huge. Why? Because of the coalition we helped build spanning aviation, energy, transportation, agriculture and rural interests. Each may be primarily driven by a range of different goals, from energy security to fuel affordability to economic development, yet all of our coalition understands the central importance of rural America and job creation. All of our coalition is invested in the American farmer's ability to compete well into the future.”

She also said that airlines globally were still committed to cutting their carbon footprint and face mandates outside the United States to do so.

“When we look out to see where the global economy is going, it's obvious that sustainability and low carbon are only growing more important. We can see airlines and logistics companies eager to find the supply they need to hit their SAF targets. We can see SAF mandates rolling out in the EU, the UK, and globally. We can see construction beginning on SAF plants in Asia.

“These are clear market signals, and we want to move where they're pointing us. We want to make sure American energy dominance includes dominance in the aviation market.”

A study led by former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz for Growth Energy detailed the potential carbon impacts of ethanol-based SAF, based on sequestering carbon dioxide emissions, reducing energy usage in production, and implementation of cover crops and other lower carbon farming practices.

There are currently three domestic producers of SAF and production remains limited. The Energy Department has estimated that production capacity would be about 30,000 barrels a day this year.

SAF remains significantly more expensive for airlines than conventional jet fuel, with a cost premium of about $3.50 per gallon, according to Andea Moyes, global head of sustainability for Air bp.

The clean energy provisions in the inflation Reduction Act initially made the United States attractive to investors but that’s been reversed by passage of the OBBB and the United Kingdom’s creation of its own SAF mandate, said Prathama Nabi, who is with Barclays Investment Bank's energy transition group.

Soybean farmers could benefit from prohibiting Chinese used cooking oil. Soybean oil is the leading vegetable oil for biofuel production in the U.S., according to the USDA.

The U.S. could easily produce its own cooking oil and doesn’t need to buy it from China, Trump said in a Truth Social post Oct. 14.

“I believe that purposefully not buying our soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an economically hostile act,” he said. “We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution.”

The president’s post continued to put soybeans at the forefront of trade disputes with China. Soybean farmers count on China to take a large percentage of their crop. So far, China has not bought any of the new soybean crop, according to the USDA.

The Trump administration is reportedly preparing a $10 billion to $15 billion compensation package for farmers. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the government shutdown needs to end before the administration can move ahead.

Asked about Trump’s remarks, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Oct. 15 that tariffs and trade wars have no winners. “The two sides need to address relevant issues through consultation on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” he said.

China’s exports of used cooking oil to the U.S. boomed for two years, but slowed considerably in the past year.

China exported a record 1.27 million metric tons of used cooking oil, worth $1.1 billion, to the U.S. in 2024. The volume was 775% more than in 2022.

China’s used cooking oil helped increase U.S. biofuels production. It also decreased soybean oil’s share in providing feedstock, according to the USDA Economic Research Service.

Last November, China took the initiative to reduce exports. It eliminated a tax rebate for U.S. importers. Used cooking oil exports declined by 60% in December, compared to the month before, according to the USDA.

China dropped the tax rebate to redirect how it uses the massive amount of used cooking oil it collects, according to a USDA analysis. Instead of exporting low-value used cooking oil, China will use the oil to produce high-value sustainable aviation fuel, the analysis stated.

By May, Chinese exports of used cooking oil to the U.S. were nearly zero. Besides the tax change, China’s exports were driven down by a 45.5% tariff and incentives in the One Big Beautiful Bill that favored domestic biodiesel feedstocks, such as soybean oil, over foreign feedstocks.

The Redcliffe Bay facility is expected to become operational in 2026.
The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill progresses through Parliament.
Exolum will store and blend the fuel on-site with conventional aviation fuel before distributing it through the national pipeline system.
Bristol Airport has committed to working with airline customers to meet the UK’s SAF mandate as part of its aim to achieve net zero operations by 2050.","Exolum has announced a £4.5 million investment to create the UK’s first independent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending facility at Redcliffe Bay in south-west England. The facility will supply airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The energy logistics company plans to develop a UK-wide network of SAF blending hubs across its 2,000km pipeline network. The infrastructure will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to jet fuel for 40% of flights departing UK airports.

The Redcliffe Bay facility is expected to become operational in 2026. Exolum estimates the initial investment will support the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York annually.

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill progresses through Parliament. SAF is a biofuel blended with conventional aviation fuel and used in aircraft without modification to reduce carbon emissions.

Unblended SAF will arrive by ship at Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock before transport to the Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. Exolum will store and blend the fuel on-site with conventional aviation fuel before distributing it through the national pipeline system.

The project includes infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol. The company will convert existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, install blending infrastructure within the tanks, and modify systems with new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves.

“Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the UK’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s position in global sustainable aviation,” said Stephen Land, Exolum North West Europe lead. “The UK’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry.”

The facility will provide a route to market for SAF production plants expected to become operational later this decade. The infrastructure supports long-term investment in SAF production across the UK, particularly in south-west England and southern Wales.

“I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF Bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading,” said Keir Mather, member of parliament and UK Department for Transport aviation minister.

The government is investing £63 million to support domestic SAF production. The investment accompanies a mandate to increase SAF supply in aviation fuel for UK flights.

“Exolum’s £4.5 million investment in their Redcliffe Bay facility marks a boost for North Somerset, helping support new technical jobs across the sustainable aviation supply chain in southwest England,” said Sadik Al Hassan, member of parliament for North Somerset and sustainable aviation champion.

Dave Lees, chief executive officer of Bristol Airport, said blending facilities form part of the future SAF supply chain needed to decarbonize aviation.

“Raw materials undergo treatments to remove impurities, then hydro processing, gasification, or fermentation are used to transform them into high-quality aviation fuel that mimics traditional jet fuel properties.
The aim for the government is to blend SAF fuel with traditional fossil jet fuel and with time increase the SAF fuel ratio and thus lower the use of fossil jet fuel,” he continued.
“Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers significant environmental advantages, primarily through a substantial reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.
“The availability of fossil jet fuel will reduce as other sectors, notably road transport, move away from fossil diesel and petrol.","In May 2025, the UK Government introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill (SAF), which has reached Report Stage in Parliament. The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT UK) is helping the Government with advice and guidance on SAF and how it can help the logistics and transport sector.

But understanding SAF ‘s workings and benefits is crucial for the aviation sector, and why it must be embraced sooner rather than later. Geoff Maynard, member of the Aviation Policy Group at CILT (UK), recently gave evidence in Parliament to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill Committee as MPs further consider the Bill.

Geoff Maynard has worked in the aviation sector for over 25 years, undertaking a wide range of aviation related commissions, many with extensive environmental content. Educated at Queens’ College, Cambridge, with a degree in Natural Sciences, Geoff has held senior positions in both the private and public sectors. He has worked on many major projects including Heathrow’s T5, the Olympic Terminal in Beijing, and a new airport for Eswatini.

Geoff gives his expert insight into SAF, its benefits, challenges, future and why the sector must embrace it.

“SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel that can power aircraft without engine or infrastructure changes. Produced from sustainable resources like agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and municipal solid waste, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that can be used in existing aircraft engines and fuel systems without modifications,” Geoff said. “It performs identically to traditional jet fuel in terms of energy density, freezing point, and combustion characteristics, requiring no special training or new equipment. SAF can also be produced using green electricity, water and carbon dioxide extracted from the air. This SAF, also known as e-fuel, could be produced in very large quantities – constrained only by the investment in new plant.

“Raw materials undergo treatments to remove impurities, then hydro processing, gasification, or fermentation are used to transform them into high-quality aviation fuel that mimics traditional jet fuel properties. The aim for the government is to blend SAF fuel with traditional fossil jet fuel and with time increase the SAF fuel ratio and thus lower the use of fossil jet fuel,” he continued.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers significant environmental advantages, primarily through a substantial reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions. Unlike traditional jet fuel, which releases ancient carbon into the atmosphere, SAF is derived from materials that recently absorbed atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a closed carbon loop. This process can lead to lifecycle carbon emission reductions of up to 80% compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

“Additionally, SAF contributes to waste reduction by repurposing materials such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and municipal waste into energy, fostering a circular economy in waste management and energy production,” he added.

“The government is encouraging this trend by first, mandating the percentage of SAF that must be included in aviation jet fuel sold in the UK. Second the SAF bill currently going through parliament establishes a company that can contract with industry to produce SAF at an agreed cost. If the SAF is ultimately sold at a price more than the agreed cost the excess is returned to the Government. Conversely if the SAF is sold at less than the agreed cost, the Government reimburses the producer for the loss. In this way, the Government eliminates the uncertainty that private industry faces in producing SAF, ensuring they cover their costs but also ensuring sufficient SAF is available to meet the mandated percentage.

“These measures will help SAF overcome its adoption barriers, primarily its high cost, which is two to five times greater than traditional jet fuel, impacting airline profitability and passenger pricing. The Government expects that as the mandated SAF percentage rises, volumes produced will rise and it will naturally bring the price down as demand goes up,” Geoff continued.

“The development of SAF is creating new industries and economic opportunities, with companies investing in production facilities, research, and supply chains. This investment is generating jobs. For airlines, SAF is vital for achieving sustainability goals and meeting passenger demands for eco-friendly travel. The ability to hit sustainability targets by simply adding a fuel the mix is the biggest pull factor, but for this to happen Government must encourage and support the development and introduction of SAF. This year all jet fuel sold in the UK must by law contain 2% SAF, with the percentage rising linearly to 10% by 2030, and on to 22% by 2040,” he said.

“The future of SAF looks promising due to advancements in technology and increased production. Researchers are creating new methods that lower costs and reduce environmental effects. Major airlines aim for net-zero, which means SAF will play a vital role. Aircraft are being designed for 100% SAF, and production capacity is set to grow.

“The availability of fossil jet fuel will reduce as other sectors, notably road transport, move away from fossil diesel and petrol. SAF will fill this gap and with the support of CILT UK we are helping bridge the conversation between our industries, airlines and Government,” he added.",https://nitravelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sustainable-air-fuel-geoff-16-10-25.png?v=1171081330,N,,2025-10-16 17:01:49.613334

The loan, which had first been announced as a conditional commitment in the last days of the Biden administration, is the first LPO has closed since President Trump took office in January.

LPO will act as a guarantor for the reconductoring and rebuilding of around 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

The loan, which had first been announced as a conditional commitment in the last days of the Biden administration, is the first LPO has closed since President Trump took office in January. It comes after months of upheaval for the office, which has seen its work hampered by leadership turnover, mass layoffs, and paused and cancelled funding.

As Latitude Media reported in July, when the second Trump administration took the helm, LPO had 15 conditional commitments ready, totaling at least $30 billion. Since January, though, several projects have withdrawn from the negotiation process because of federal funding uncertainty.

During the first Trump administration, LPO closed just a single loan; it wasn’t until the Biden administration that the office got a big enough influx of funding and staff to become the juggernaut it was under director Jigar Shah. So when Trump took the helm for the second time, there was some question about whether his DOE would make use of the office at all.

But activity seems to be picking up. In addition to the AEP loan, earlier in October, DOE announced that LPO had restructured a previously approved loan with Lithium Americas Corp. to finance the construction of facilities for manufacturing lithium carbonate at Thacker Pass. And last week, it granted an extension to Gevo for its $1.46 billion conditional commitment for a sustainable aviation fuel project, until April 2026; the company said it is potentially revising the project’s scope to better match the Trump administration’s priorities.

The AEP loan is also the first closed loan under the Energy Dominance Financing Program, a new program established by the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that replaces the previous Section 1706 program within the LPO, eliminating the latter’s focus on emissions reduction and clean energy.

Trump and transmission

Expanding transmission infrastructure is notoriously difficult, with some projects taking over a decade and having to go through multiple legal and regulatory hurdles before even starting construction.

But building new lines is essential to ensure that the grid is able to support the enormous increase in energy demand that the country is experiencing. And upgrading old lines — including through reconductoring, which can up to double capacity on existing power lines — can be a less politically challenging way of making the most of the existing grid.

The PJM region, where the AEP project would bring much-needed capacity upgrades, is at the heart of the U.S. load growth conversation. PJM’s latest load growth forecast projects a peak load growth of 32 gigawatts from 2024 to 2030, with 30 of those coming from the booming data center sector; the grid operator’s its annual auction in July closed at the $329 per megawatt-day price cap, a 22% increase over last year’s auction, which was itself a record.

The Trump administration’s record on transmission has been mixed so far. Better grid infrastructure is essential to achieving its goal of “energy abundance,” as highlighted in its AI Action Plan. And even as DOE saw a massive exodus of staff including from the Grid Deployment Office, Latitude Media reported in April that Trump’s GDO director said that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency “really liked” the office’s Transmission Facilitation Program — a $2.5 billion effort to build new transmission projects.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-10-16T140444.295.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 15:00:34.770098

Abstract

Slashing warming pollution to the near-zero levels needed to stop global climate change will require massive investments in nearly every industry. However, nearly all of today’s clean industrial investment is focused on a few sectors where technologies and business strategies are relatively mature and thus risks are relatively low: renewable energy, electric grids with battery storage, and electric vehicles (1). In other industries that lag behind, investment in new technologies and business practices involves much larger risks that are harder for investors to fathom. The aviation sector is emblematic of the challenge. A new approach is needed that is more realistic about what is achievable and better aligned with how real-world investors balance risk and reward. We outline an approach that could help guide a pioneer group of research and development (R&D) programs alongside investors and airlines who are motivated to deploy new technology.

The transmission system operator TenneT invited me and other experts to assist them with their Target scenario for 2050 to enable them to plan for transmission upgrades and space requirements in a country where land is so precious that they make their own, building entire provinces from sea beds, dykes, and massive pumps.

The TenneT core team were deep and broad in their own ways. Emiel van Druten, who led the charge on scenario planning, with a decade of modeling background in energy across Dutch economy, has a sharp-eyed view on where the football will be. Emmanuel van Ruitenbeek brought aerospace engineering, a masters in sustainability, and a decade of European energy trading to the table. Tim Gaßmann brought power engineering and a decade of energy planning to the room, along with a deep understanding of how the core scenario tool, the Energy Transition Model, and related external dashboard hang together.

A brief shoutout to the Energy Transition Model (ETM). This free, browser-based toolkit from Amsterdam’s Quintel puts you in the driver’s seat, letting you build future energy systems with a dizzying array of sliders, around 300 by the last count. Want to see what happens if your region doubles down on heat pumps or scraps coal by 2050? Just tweak the supply and demand bars and watch as charts, emissions figures, and costs update in real time. It’s transparent, open-source, and refreshingly honest, with no hidden assumptions, no techno-liturgical claptrap. Every EU country is baselined in it, but seemingly no non-European countries at this time. That should change. The TenneT team and the larger national scenario modeling team have been using ETM for years, and I was deeply impressed with it and that they were so familiar with the levers to pull as we explored options.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent said on Wednesday the possibility of extending a pause of import duties on Chinese goods for longer than three months exists if China halts its plan for strict new export controls on rare-earth elements. The U.S. and China have agreed to a series of 90-day truces, with the next deadline looming in November.

Analysts estimate net soybean sales ranged from 500,000 MT to 1.4 MMT during the week ended Oct.9, according to a Reuters poll. USDA’s weekly Export Sales Report remain delayed amid the government shutdown.

China has yet to secure much of its soybean supply for December and January as high premiums for Brazilian cargoes discourage buyers, a development that could prompt Beijing to tap state reserves to meet near-term needs, according to traders.

Indonesia, the world’s largest palm oil producers, is considering a plan to require international flights from Jakarta and Bali to use 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend starting in 2026, according to an energy ministry official.

The company provides traceability to product origin and supplier partners and works directly with farmers on regenerative practices. Founder and CEO Heather Terry is expanding national retail distribution, including a growing footprint at Whole Foods.

● CleanJoule: CleanJoule produces a high-performance sustainable aviation fuel made from abundant biomass residues, designed to fully replace conventional jet fuel without any engine or infrastructure modifications. Its proprietary process yields a domestically produced fuel that meets or exceeds the performance standards required for commercial aviation, defense, and space applications. Founder and CEO Mukund Karanjikar is advancing toward commercial-scale production, backed by 90 million gallons in airline offtake agreements.

Collectively, this year's Americas cohort has raised over $800 million to date and employs more than 900 people.

Through regional gatherings and ongoing community-building initiatives, the Unreasonable Impact programme is designed to help participating entrepreneurs form strategic relationships and quickly solve key challenges facing their businesses to help them scale.

Post-programme, companies will continue to receive access to specialist advice from over 1,100 mentors, many of whom are Barclays colleagues, through the Unreasonable community. Since its launch in 2016, the programme has supported over 370 ventures, who have collectively raised over $16 billion in financing, and employ more than 33,000 people.

Daniel Epstein, CEO of Unreasonable Group, commented:

“Year after year, the partnership we built with Barclays reminds me why we started this in the first place: to back remarkable founders and stay with them as they do the hard work. This cohort is practical, values-driven, and ready to scale. We will be shoulder to shoulder with them with tailored support and the right resources, inside a community that holds us to real outcomes.”

Deborah Goldfarb, Global Head of Citizenship at Barclays, commented:

“It’s so exciting to welcome this group of entrepreneurs to Unreasonable Impact, where they will join the more-than-three-hundred ventures that already make up this extraordinary global community. Each individual in this new cohort is an inspiring innovator, but the magic of Unreasonable Impact is in the partnerships that are forged to overcome barriers, unlock potential, and turbocharge growth.”

MK Karanjikar, Founder and CEO of CleanJoule, commented:

“We are honored that CleanJoule has been selected for the Unreasonable Impact Americas programme. This recognition not only validates our team’s decade-long effort to bring scalable superior fuels to market, but also gives us access to an extraordinary network of mentors, investors, and peers. We look forward to leveraging this opportunity to accelerate our impact to ensure ongoing scalability of the aerospace and defense industries.”

It aims to accelerate the commercial rollout of power-to-liquid technologies by bridging the gap between research and large-scale industrial production.
“The TPP is the basis for future industrial production and the extensive use of sustainable fuels, particularly in aviation,” said Bjorn Griesemann, CEO at Griesemann Group.
The platform will use Topsoe and Sasol’s integrated G2L e-fuels technology.
Analyses from the International Council on Clean Transportation highlight bottlenecks in capital intensity, feedstock availability, and first-of-a-kind technology deployment risks.","Denmark-based energy technology company Topsoe and global chemicals specialist Sasol have signed a cooperation agreement with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Griesemann Gruppe to build and operate a new e-fuels demonstration plant at the Leuna Chemical Complex in Germany.

Supported by €130m in funding from the German Federal Ministry for Transport, the facility – known as the Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels (TPP) – is slated to be the largest of its kind when it begins production in late 2027.

The plant, which has been under construction since 1 October 2024, is expected to produce around 2,500 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year using biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen. It aims to accelerate the commercial rollout of power-to-liquid technologies by bridging the gap between research and large-scale industrial production.

“The TPP is the basis for future industrial production and the extensive use of sustainable fuels, particularly in aviation,” said Bjorn Griesemann, CEO at Griesemann Group.

The platform will use Topsoe and Sasol’s integrated G2L e-fuels technology. This combines Topsoe’s eREACT technology and hydroprocessing technologies with Sasol’s low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch system to convert captured CO2 and green hydrogen to e-fuels.

“[This project] will be an important step in enabling SAF production at scale, as well as supporting downstream application and flight testing to move us to a fully decarbonised industry,” said Sarushen Pillay, Executive Vice President for Business Building, Strategy and Technology at Sasol.

Independent studies and international agencies routinely estimate that SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions over their full life cycle by 50% to 80% relative to conventional jet fuel, depending on feedstock and process pathway.

For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) estimates that drop-in SAFs can reduce life-cycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. Under its global framework, ICAO aims for a 5% reduction in the carbon intensity of international aviation by 2030 compared with a no-SAF scenario, achieved through wider adoption of sustainable fuels and cleaner energy sources.

The European Union has set even more ambitious targets, requiring a 2% SAF blend in jet fuel from 2025, rising to 70% by 2050 – targets that could deliver deep CO2 and non-CO2 reductions through the use of renewable feedstocks and advanced conversion technologies.

Yet despite the promise, scaling remains the industry’s most persistent obstacle. Analyses from the International Council on Clean Transportation highlight bottlenecks in capital intensity, feedstock availability, and first-of-a-kind technology deployment risks.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/02/shutterstock_2307717919.jpg",N,,2025-10-16 12:57:06.381831

Findings show Middle East aviation-related jobs to grow 134% between 2023-2043, the highest rate globally, while passenger movements will double

Growing populations, investments in infrastructure & airline development, and geographic position contribute to importance of regional aviation sector

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; October 16, 2025 – The aviation sector in the Middle East is positioned for unprecedented growth over the next two decades, with total aviation-related jobs projected to increase by 134%, the highest growth rate of any region globally, according to a comprehensive white paper released by Aviation Business ME and GE Aerospace.

The report titled, ""Lifting Economies: The Impact of the Aviation Sector on Middle Eastern Economies,"" reveals that aviation's contribution to regional GDP will surge by more than 150% by 2043, reaching $730 billion and cementing the industry's position as a key driver of economic development across the region. More than 530 million passengers, twice the current number, are projected to travel through the region, with a 3.9% annual traffic growth rate.

Several key factors are fueling this growth trajectory. Middle Eastern governments have made strategic, long-term commitments to aviation through massive infrastructure investments, airline development, and supportive regulatory frameworks. This government-led approach, combined with the region's unique geographic position connecting major global markets, has created the right conditions for positive aviation sector impact.

The Middle East's location between Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific also positions its airlines and airports to capture significant transfer traffic. Growing populations, coupled with rising regional prosperity and ambitious tourism targets in much of the surrounding region, create substantial demand. Today, two of the top 10 busiest airports for international passenger traffic are in the Middle East, with Dubai ranking first globally.

“As we look toward 2040, the countries that continue to invest strategically in their aviation ecosystems will reap outsized rewards in economic diversification, skilled job creation, and global connectivity,” said Ryan Harmon, Editor, Aviation Business Middle East. “What's particularly encouraging is seeing how governments across the region are embracing next-generation technologies and sustainable practices that will ensure this growth benefits both their economies and the planet.”

""The Middle East aviation story isn't just the scale of growth, but how the region is pioneering new models of industry development,"" said Aziz Koleilat, President and CEO – Middle East, Türkiye, & CIS at GE Aerospace. ""By simultaneously investing in airlines, airports, infrastructure, and MRO capabilities, countries are creating integrated aviation ecosystems that will deliver economic benefits far beyond traditional air transport metrics.""

A growth story in Saudi Arabia and beyond

This paper has a particular focus on Saudi Arabia, which stands out as one of the region's most dynamic growth stories. The Kingdom has seen the Middle East's largest percentage jump in aviation-related jobs between 2016 and 2023, rising 136% to 1.4 million positions. The country’s aviation sector GDP contribution increased more than 150% to US$91 billion during the same period. The Saudi Aviation Strategy, backed by $100 billion in investments, aims to triple annual passenger traffic to 330 million, extend connectivity to more than 250 destinations from 29 airports, and increase air cargo volumes more than five-fold to 4.5 million tons by 2030.

Elsewhere in the region, the UAE continues to demonstrate aviation's economic impact, with the sector contributing 18.2% to national GDP – more than five times the global average of 3.9%. The UAE employs one-third of all direct aviation jobs in the region.

Finally, the aviation sector in Qatar has been identified as a key enabler of the Third Qatar National Development Strategy 2024-2030, specifically by expanding its air transport activities and positioning its logistics cluster as a specialized e-commerce distribution hub.

A soaring future

Looking ahead, the white paper identifies several key trends that will shape the industry's future.

Regional investments in artificial intelligence will accelerate implementation across aviation operations, from predictive maintenance to fuel optimization by pilots.

Middle East governments and airlines are positioning themselves as adopters of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives, with the UAE targeting 700 million liters of SAF production annually by 2030 and Saudi Arabia building infrastructure to support SAF development as part of megaprojects such as NEOM.

As regional space programs develop in countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, they will create new opportunities for the aerospace sector through overlapping specialized manufacturing, IT, and engineering skills.

The paper also outlines several actions that can be implemented to further strengthen the sector's economic impact. These include:

Greater harmonization of the Middle East's regulatory environment to improve efficiencies for airlines and MRO operators facing multiple certification standards.

Improved coordination of airspace and traffic management through data sharing and expanded access for civilian aircraft to accommodate rising traffic volumes.

Expanded in-region training and educational programs to ensure a sufficiently skilled workforce across all aviation disciplines.

The future of flight is strong across the Middle East. As the aviation industry continues to grow, it will help to power the economic advancement of countries in the region.

""Today's groundbreaking reflects our commitment to advancing energy innovation,"" said David Dausch, Ph.D., Vice President, Engineering and Advanced Technology at RTI. ""Taking emerging energy technologies from concept to commercial readiness is a major challenge. By expanding RPX, we're creating a more robust environment to help clients bridge the gap between laboratory prototype and real-world impact.""

The expanded RPX will feature configurable bays for process skids and dedicated control rooms for real-time monitoring. It will also be fully connected to the utilities, bulk gas supply, and other infrastructure needed to support advanced testing and scale-up. A planned adjacent solar field will enable behind-the-meter integration for renewable energy demonstrations.

""The RPX expansion builds on the success of the original facility established in 2013, which has supported partnerships with government agencies and commercial clients,"" said Sameer Parvathikar, Ph.D., Program Director of RPX and the Senior Director of Sustainable Energy Solutions at RTI. ""This next chapter opens the door to even more collaborations with clients tackling the toughest energy and industrial challenges.""

In June 2025, Aether Fuels, a sustainable fuels technology company, announced a project to demonstrate its breakthrough Aether Aurora™ sustainable aviation fuel at RPX. Other recent clients include Syzygy Plasmonics, which successfully demonstrated an all-electric CO2-to-fuel production pathway, and Lydian Labs, which conducted a successful pilot demonstration of its e-Reforming technology for producing sustainable aviation fuel.

The airline is testing locally produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to reduce both operational costs and the environmental impact of its flights. With an ambitious goal to integrate sustainable fuel solutions into its operations, Kenya Airways is not only contributing to global carbon reduction efforts but also aiming to create a cost-effective, locally sourced alternative to traditional jet fuel. This move aligns with the airline’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and supports the wider aviation industry’s shift toward more sustainable practices. By tapping into Africa’s vast agricultural resources, Kenya Airways is setting the stage for a new era in African aviation—one that combines economic viability with environmental responsibility.

Kenya Airways Plc is making a bold move to showcase that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can be produced and used in Africa, proving that the continent can contribute to the growing global demand for green aviation fuels.

The Nairobi-based airline has taken a significant step by operating four return flights between October 14 and 21, each using a blend of SAF, in an effort to explore the feasibility of producing the green fuel locally. This is a part of the airline’s strategy to reduce its carbon footprint and to find a cost-effective alternative to traditional jet fuel.

The first flight in this trial took off from Nairobi to Paris on Tuesday. This flight was part of a broader shift in Europe, where new regulations require at least 2% SAF to be included in all departing flights. For this journey, Kenya Airways combined conventional jet fuel with biofuel derived from drought-resistant crops like croton, which are grown in Kenya. The biofuel is a key element of the airline’s attempt to test locally sourced fuel and determine its performance on long-haul flights.

Kenya Airways had already made history in 2023 when it became the first African airline to operate a long-haul SAF-powered flight. That flight used biofuel from an international supplier, Italy’s Eni SpA, which signified a major milestone in the airline’s sustainability journey. However, the airline is now keen to reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers and focus on producing SAF locally, which could be more sustainable and cost-effective for the region.

The challenge with SAF, however, lies in its cost. While SAF is an important tool in reducing aviation’s carbon emissions, it comes at a price. SAF costs up to twice as much as conventional jet fuel, and for African carriers, it can cost up to five times more due to the complexities of logistics and the lack of a local supply chain. This financial burden is a significant hurdle for African airlines, as the cost of SAF can impact ticket prices and make the fuel less appealing to both airlines and passengers.

Kenya Airways is addressing this challenge head-on by looking into ways to reduce SAF production costs, aiming to find solutions that can make the fuel more affordable in the long run. The airline also hopes to attract subsidies from governments and international organizations to support the production and use of SAF. The airline’s CEO has emphasized that African passengers are not yet willing to pay extra for flights that use SAF, which adds a layer of complexity to the airline’s strategy.

To expand its SAF-powered operations, Kenya Airways plans to introduce SAF-powered flights from Nairobi to other major global destinations, including Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. While European airports will provide SAF refueling services for these flights, the return flight to Cape Town will be powered by conventional fuel. The airline intends to initially incorporate 2% SAF into its fleet and gradually increase this percentage to 10% by 2030. This ambitious goal aligns with Kenya Airways’ long-term sustainability plans, which aim to reduce the airline’s environmental impact and encourage the adoption of green fuels in Africa.

Local SAF production could also offer additional benefits beyond cost reduction. It could provide an opportunity for Kenyan airlines to meet future regulatory requirements as governments and international bodies push for greener fuel options in aviation. In addition, the development of a local SAF supply chain could open up financing opportunities from both African lenders and international climate funds. This financing could be critical in helping Kenya Airways and other African carriers scale up their SAF use and remain competitive as sustainability becomes increasingly important in global aviation.

Kenya Airways has partnered with Bleriot Group, a company that produces the biofuel used in the airline’s demonstration flights. Bleriot Group holds a 15-year lease on 6,000 acres of land that was previously mined by a major mining company. The land, which is not suitable for food crops, is now being used to cultivate plants for biofuel production. This sustainable land use provides a viable alternative to traditional agricultural activities and is an example of how Kenya can leverage its natural resources for green energy production.

Bleriot Group’s efforts to use this land for biofuel production highlight the potential for sustainable agriculture to play a significant role in the growth of Africa’s green economy. By using drought-resistant crops to produce biofuels, the initiative not only contributes to reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint but also supports local agriculture and rural economies.

This partnership between Kenya Airways and Bleriot Group represents a promising step in the future of sustainable aviation in Africa. As the airline continues to test the viability of locally sourced SAF and increase its green fuel usage, Kenya Airways hopes to serve as a model for other airlines across the continent. With the potential for cost reductions, increased financing opportunities, and a stronger local economy, the airline’s commitment to SAF could ultimately make it a pioneer in Africa’s sustainable aviation industry.

Kenya Airways is leading Africa’s sustainable aviation movement by pioneering the use of locally produced sustainable aviation fuel. This initiative aims to reduce both operational costs and the environmental impact of air travel, setting a new standard for green aviation in the region.

The results of these demonstration flights will provide valuable data that could help shape the future of SAF production and usage in Africa. If successful, this initiative could open the door to a broader adoption of SAF across the African aviation sector, helping the industry meet its carbon reduction targets and contribute to the global fight against climate change. The journey of Kenya Airways towards a more sustainable future is just beginning, but the steps taken so far show promise for both the airline and the region’s aviation industry.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kenya-Airways-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 10:01:35.280797

Domestic (intra-EU) aviation emissions have been part of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), a cap-and-trade framework designed to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, since 2012.
In theory, CORSIA should cover 85% of the aviation industry’s international emissions.
If the commission finds CORSIA inadequate for addressing international aviation emissions, the ETS may be extended to include flights departing from the EEA to third countries.
The growing cross-sectoral appetite — and increasing global demand — for these same feedstocks is expected to exacerbate the feedstock supply conundrum.","Decarbonization challenges: The aviation sector has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, but it is hindered by the limited availability and high costs of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).

Policy and regulatory landscape: International cooperation and cohesive policy frameworks will be critical for advancing SAF adoption and establishing a viable offsets market.

Financial and operational implications: Airlines are navigating a high-risk environment while facing increased costs associated with decarbonization efforts, and the challenge of balancing investment in new technologies with managing ticket prices and consumer demand elasticity.

According to S&P Global Commodity Insights data, aviation accounted for around 3% of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2024, with this share on the rise as air passenger traffic continues to expand. The International Air Transport Association (IATA, an airline trade body) predicts that global air passenger traffic could more than double to reach 10 billion journeys per year by 2050. Many major airports around the world are planning to expand to accommodate the predicted growth in demand.

The decarbonization roadmap for a growing industry reliant on fossil-fuel-powered aircraft is undeniably challenging. Nevertheless, many airlines have pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Unlike the road sector, where electrification is more feasible, the aviation industry faces unique hurdles in transitioning to low- and zero-emission energy sources, particularly for long-distance flights. As a result, current decarbonization efforts primarily focus on scaling up the supply of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), enhancing aircraft efficiency — including investing in new-generation aircraft and optimizing route planning — and utilizing carbon offsets. New technologies such as electric and hydrogen propulsion systems face roadblocks in becoming long-haul solutions, due to factors such as battery weight, the hefty cost of new infrastructure required for hydrogen storage, and new regulations.

While ambitions surrounding SAF usage are high, SAF availability is currently extremely limited, leading to minimal average use by airlines. The most affordable SAF is currently about three times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, and feedstock availability poses additional challenges. Consequently, there are widespread concerns regarding the scalability of production to meet decarbonization targets.

Airlines operate within a highly unpredictable, cyclical trading environment, characterized by frequent disruptions, such as employee strikes, air traffic control issues, weather-related delays and geopolitical events. The sector is marked by high capital intensity and relatively thin profit margins due to intense competition, while revenue visibility is low, as customer booking windows are typically short, and costs such as fuel can fluctuate significantly. As such, and according to our S&P Global Ratings methodology, our Global Industry Risk Assessment for Transportation Cyclical industries (which includes airlines) is “High risk” (or “5”).

Given these conditions, credit ratings for much of the sector are relatively low, with over 70% of our global airline ratings falling into the non-investment-grade category (see figure below). The highest global airline rating is BBB+. Our airline ratings also factor in environmental risks and reflect uncertainties stemming from the pace of development of climate-related technologies, related market developments, and environmental regulatory and policy initiatives. Airlines with lower credit ratings will typically have higher costs of capital, making decarbonization investments more costly and maybe a lower priority versus shorter-term funding needs.

SAF adoption is central to IATA’s Net-Zero 2050 roadmap, which focuses on achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. SAF solutions are expected to provide the largest share of aviation’s carbon abatement through to 2050, while offsets will also continue to play an important role. Decarbonizing aviation requires international cooperation and alignment. Yet policy, still in its initial stages, remains fragmented, with significant differences in approach and ambition across regions. Although policymakers initially focused on placing a carbon price on emissions from flights, they have more recently shifted efforts to include more direct incentives for SAF uptake.

Europe is leading the way in terms of ambition and progress on policy adoption. Domestic (intra-EU) aviation emissions have been part of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), a cap-and-trade framework designed to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, since 2012. Under this system, airlines are required to monitor, report and verify their emissions.

Initially, the EU ETS was designed to apply to all flights to, from and within the European Economic Area (EEA), but its scope has been temporarily limited to intra-EEA flights to support the development of the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This limitation in scope is in place until the end of 2026, but could be extended further, pending assessment from the European Commission. Recent revisions aim to enhance the system's effectiveness by phasing out free allowances by 2026, reducing the industry’s emissions cap and increasing the auctioning of emissions permits. Additionally, the EU is allocating funds from the ETS to support the adoption of SAF. The UK has a similar scheme in place, the UK ETS, which has been covering the aviation sector since 2021. Flights within the UK, as well as those departing to EEA countries, Switzerland and Gibraltar, are included in the scheme.

Suppliers can meet the main obligation and PtL obligation by supplying the required fuel or purchasing certificates to meet a shortfall through a certificate trading scheme. Certificates are awarded in proportion to energy content and GHG footprints, allowing suppliers to reduce their obligation by supplying SAF with lower GHG intensities. Alternatively, suppliers may buy out of their obligations by paying the buy-out price, although its level is prohibitive at £5,875 per metric ton for the main SAF obligation and £6,250 per metric ton for the PtL obligation. All eyes will now be on how the UK SAF market evolves and what lessons can be brought to the European Union’s first review.

In North America, the landscape for SAF policy has been characterized by fragility and uncertainty, particularly regarding supply versus demand dynamics that are increasingly influenced at state and provincial levels. In the US, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act introduced the Clean Fuel Production Credit, or 45Z, which initially offered credits ranging from $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon for SAF. However, delays regarding implementation led many fuel producers to abandon their SAF projects in favor of renewable diesel (benefiting from existing federal and state mandates) or even fossil diesel. This uncertainty deterred investors, as the renewable fuels market faced low margins and volatile feedstock costs.

At both US federal and state levels, various legislative efforts are underway to promote SAF. Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota and Washington have introduced or are implementing tax credits to incentivize SAF production. California’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program currently provides greater incentives to produce renewable diesel than to produce SAF, although treatment of SAF is developing in other state LCFS programs. Meanwhile, in Canada, British Columbia has set mandatory blending requirements for renewable fuel in jet fuel, aiming for a gradual increase through 2030. Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations program also incentivizes SAF. Both the US and Canada are signatories to the CORSIA agreement, although the US's commitment is uncertain following shifts in political leadership and policy direction.

Other markets are also witnessing the development of regulations and policies that support the adoption of SAF. Countries in Latin America and Asia are beginning to set SAF targets, although these remain modest compared to levels in Europe. In Latin America, Brazil instated a 1% emissions reduction mandate for aviation by 2027, while Chile and Colombia launched SAF roadmaps to achieve a 50% SAF blend rate in 2050. Several Asian countries are targeting 1% SAF within the next two years, notably Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia by 2026, and India and South Korea by 2027. Some have set more ambitious SAF blend targets for international flights by 2030, with Singapore aiming for 3%-5%, Taiwan targeting 5% and Japan striving for 10%. Several other Asia-Pacific markets, such as Malaysia and Australia, are approaching demand-side measures with more caution but are expected to communicate their plans soon. Lastly, China has set a SAF consumption target of only 50,000 metric tons by 2025.

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was adopted in 2016 by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to offset the increase in international aviation emissions over a specified baseline, given that international bunker emissions (including from the maritime sector) are not attributed to any country under the Paris Agreement and thus are not covered under individual countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The scheme is to be implemented in phases to address industry and state concerns of feasibility and equitable burden-sharing. After an initial Pilot Phase between 2021 and 2023, the scheme entered Phase I as of January 2024, with 128 participating countries as of 2025. Participation in this phase remains voluntary for ICAO member states until mandatory compliance takes effect at the beginning of Phase II in 2027. In theory, CORSIA should cover 85% of the aviation industry’s international emissions.

To comply with CORSIA obligations, airplane operators are required to surrender carbon credits sourced from the voluntary carbon market (VCM) that comply with requirements set out by the ICAO’s Technical Advisory Board or use eligible SAF.

Credits must carry a corresponding adjustment (CA), an accounting adjustment created under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that is applied to national emissions inventories reflecting the international sale or acquisition of emissions mitigations that occurred in a different jurisdiction. This condition significantly tightens the supply of credits that are eligible to be used for CORSIA compliance, given that, halfway through the current phase of the scheme, only one project has issued eligible credits.

Despite the scheme being in place for over four years, restrictions related to credit eligibility limit its feasibility. S&P Global Commodity Insights forecasts credit demand for the current phase to reach 155 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (mtCO2e), against a current supply of only 16 million mtCO2e from the eligible Guyana REDD+ project, a mitigation effort that reduces emissions from deforestation. Moreover, our in-house forecast for Phase I eligible supply indicates that a volume of credits sufficient to cover demand for 2024–26 would only materialize after the end of the compliance deadline. Availability of suitable credits is one of the main issues that airlines face when trying to comply with the scheme, notably because the price divergence between CORSIA-eligible credits and alternative fuels would make the former a more attractive decarbonization option.

The average Platts CORSIA-Eligible Credits (CEC) price assessment was $20.97/mtCO2e in the first half of 2025, peaking at $22.25/mtCO2e in June. This is much higher than other credits in the VCM, which averaged $14.98/mtCO2e for afforestation and reforestation projects. However, CORSIA-eligible credits are still lower than achieving reductions using SAF, given current prices.

CORSIA is enforced at the state level, meaning that participating countries are responsible for establishing compliance rules and penalties for airline operators that fail to comply. In most cases, these penalties have not yet been set, with Brazil and the UK being notable exceptions. The discretionary nature of penalties introduced by member states poses significant risks of noncompliance. If countries like China and India (which are not participating in Phase I) do not create regulations to enforce compliance in Phase II, the effectiveness of CORSIA could be significantly undermined.

Importantly, the European Union’s position on CORSIA could threaten the future viability of the scheme. The EU ETS currently covers intra-European flights, with CORSIA to cover any flights from an EEA country to a third country (and vice versa). While this distinction was initially introduced to address fierce international opposition to coverage of all flights under the EU ETS, by July 2026, the European Commission will have to report to the EU Parliament and the European Council on CORSIA's environmental integrity. If the commission finds CORSIA inadequate for addressing international aviation emissions, the ETS may be extended to include flights departing from the EEA to third countries. This could potentially prompt other countries to withdraw from the scheme.

According to Platts (part of S&P Global Commodity Insights), SAF prices in Europe lost 39% of their value in 2024, falling from near $3,000/metric ton at the beginning of the year to under $1,716/metric ton in May as production increased but new demand failed to materialize. Such a price move may be helpful for airlines and their customers, but it directly impacts production margins and investments, with construction of several facilities canceled or paused, citing “challenging market conditions.” So far in 2025, SAF prices have fallen to record lows, with the global SAF market oversupplied, which is a notable shift for a market where lack of availability is a long-term theme. Over the second half of 2025, prices have rebounded as we head toward the first European compliance deadline, with outright prices reaching $2,260 per metric ton in September, more than three times the value of jet fuel.

The SAF market is currently very small, estimated at only 1.1 million metric tons (MMt) in 2024, which is less than 0.5% of global jet fuel consumption. Demand for SAF is primarily driven by policy incentives and voluntary commitments by airlines, with a significant concentration in Europe and North America, which together accounted for almost 90% of global consumption in 2024. Nearly 60% of that was consumed in Europe, where countries like Sweden, Norway and France had SAF mandates in place, and the largest local airlines have committed to replacing 10% of their jet fuel with SAF by 2030.

SAF production capacity is also increasing, and S&P Global expects it to reach 4.3 MMt by the end of the year, with about 25 dedicated SAF plants (plants designed to produce mostly SAF) in operation globally. There is additional SAF produced as a by-product of renewable diesel (RD) or from plants with a more balanced RD/SAF yield. Regional capacity/demand imbalances are already emerging and could be an indicator of future trade patterns. More than half of the existing dedicated SAF capacity (2.3 MMt) is in Asia, despite low levels of demand in the region, while only about 1 MMt is in North America (600,000 metric tons) and Europe (400,000 metric tons), the largest markets.

S&P Global expects strong growth in the SAF market over the coming decades, with demand projected to increase tenfold by 2030, to above 11 MMt, and then rise exponentially to almost 80 MMt by 2050. SAF is expected to account for 18.6% of the world’s aviation fuel in 2050. Europe will be the main driver, especially in the short to medium term. The high SAF mandates in the European Union and the UK will support SAF adoption in Europe, where demand is forecast to reach close to 5 MMt in 2030 and almost 28 MMt by 2050.

In Asia, SAF consumption will be slow to take off and initially will be driven by airlines and modest SAF blend mandates in a couple of markets. Consumption is thus expected to reach just 3.6 MMt in 2030 and be concentrated in OECD markets and aviation hubs. After 2030, demand growth will accelerate as mainland China and India significantly ramp up their SAF blends, bringing regional volumes to 30 MMt by 2050. Similar to Asia, SAF uptake in the US will be slower until the 2030s, due to weak policy support. In the longer term, demand will rise as state-level incentives expand alongside clean fuel programs, but North America will fall behind Asia and Europe, with demand expected to reach only 12.7 MMt by 2050. Adoption in other regions will remain limited.

One of the key challenges the industry faces is expanding capacity to meet this level of demand. S&P Global tracks RD and SAF plants and projects and has identified over 190 new dedicated SAF projects announced worldwide. If all of these projects come to fruition, SAF capacity could grow almost tenfold to more than 40 MMt by 2030. Most projects are in North America (15.8 MMt), Asia (13.4 MMt) and Europe (7.2 MMt). However, only a fraction of them, equivalent to 7.3 MMt of SAF capacity, have reached a final investment decision (FID), with 28.5 MMt of capacity still awaiting approval. With the world needing 80 MMt of SAF by 2050 according to S&P Global estimates, the scale of the task is significant.

Ramping up SAF capacity has its challenges. Nearly two-thirds of the planned capacity by 2030 (25.3 MMt) is HEFA. While this is a commercially mature and cost-effective SAF production technology, it is constrained by lipid feedstock availability. Biofuels mandates and decarbonization requirements are being extended beyond road transport to other transport modes (rail, shipping and aviation) and off-road sectors (heating, etc.). They are also being progressively rolled out and bolstered in developing countries. The growing cross-sectoral appetite — and increasing global demand — for these same feedstocks is expected to exacerbate the feedstock supply conundrum.

Other options beyond HEFA exist, but they will need to be developed for supply to meet projected demand. One fifth (8.4 MMt) of announced capacity by 2030 will rely on the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway, and the rest on Fischer-Tropsch (FT), Methanol-to-Jet (MTJ) and other newer pathways. However, these pathways are more nascent and costlier, and only a few have reached FID. Of the approximately 110 non-HEFA bio-SAF projects announced globally, the vast majority (105) are “speculative,” that is, currently in the feasibility or pre-FEED stage and have yet to reach FID. They face structural headwinds, namely technical challenges with integrating multiple early-stage conversion processes, high capex and production costs, reliable feedstock supply chains, and demand and price uncertainty.

Finally, Power-to-Liquids (PTL) is touted as the answer to these issues and the long-term solution to decarbonizing aviation. However, the e-SAF sector is also facing headwinds, with most planned projects yet to reach FID. The main hurdles are related to policy uncertainty, technology risks, reliance on other key value chains and project financing. Most e-fuel pathways are currently at a low level of technological maturity, with facilities only operating at pilot or demonstration scale. There remain technical risks associated with integrating multiple conversion technologies in a single process at full industrial scale. Moreover, limited visibility on long-term prices and penalties (particularly under RFEUA) results in challenges in attracting buyers willing to commit to long-term offtake contracts, which are crucial for developers to secure project financing. Lastly, e-fuel production requires a source of green hydrogen and captured CO2. While electrolysis and CO2 capture technologies are mature, projects and supply chains have yet to develop to the level required for large-scale e-fuel production.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/corp_1014_sustainableaviationfuel?$responsive$,N,,2025-10-16 11:03:04.155751

As Europe’s ReFuelEU regulation comes into force, mandating minimum blends of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), airlines are under pressure to comply while also differentiating themselves in decarbonization efforts.

IBA’s Sustainability Watch: October 2025 provides a snapshot of how major European airline groups performed in 2024 in terms of SAF use on intra-EU flights.

How European airlines used SAF in 2024

According to IBA’s NetZero platform data, SAF adoption among European airlines is divided. Early movers that have integrated SAF into their fuel supply at measurable levels, but other carriers are still behind.

IAG (International Airlines Group) airlines lead the way in the adoption of SAF. In 2024, IAG achieved an average SAF blend of approximately 3.9% for its intra-EU operations, which makes it the most aggressive adopter so far.

Air France–KLM is not far behind, with an average blend of nearly 2.5%.

SAS recorded a blend of roughly 1.1 %, while Finnair’s uptake was modest at around 0.4 %.

Lufthansa Group airlines have been slow in SAF deployment, with a group-wide average of nearly 0.2% in 2024.

IBA describes the low-cost segment (Ryanair and Wizz Air) as having “very limited” use of SAF. Still, both carriers have set ambitious goals for 2030: 12.5% for Ryanair and 10% for Wizz. They have also inked supply agreements to help meet those targets as SAF availability improves.

Slow progress, but airline SAF strategy is developing

The numbers for 2024 show limited progress. With the EU’s SAF blending mandates, airlines across Europe will face mounting pressure to accelerate their efforts.

IBA describes early SAF adoption as “more tactical than reactive.” While carriers using SAF face higher costs than their peers who rely on conventional fuel, the advantage of early adoption is in securing a limited supply, building credibility for their sustainability claims, and taking advantage of the EU Emissions Trading System incentive.

“Groups such as IAG and Air France–KLM are already demonstrating how long-term contracts can deliver both compliance benefits and a foundation for scaling towards 2030,” IBA states. “For slower adopters, the risk is that supply constraints and carbon price pressures will narrow future options, forcing later procurement at higher cost.

“With the first ReFuelEU mandate beginning this year, 2025 credits will be a clearer test of execution. The advantage will rest with those treating SAF not as a short-term burden but as a strategic asset.”

Ensuring an adequate supply of SAF

Currently, even airlines eager to increase the use of SAF may encounter physical limitations in feedstock, production capacity, and logistics. A study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Worley Consulting demonstrated there is enough sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

However, the study found that the diversity of SAF production sources is hindered due to a slow rollout of technology. Currently, the only commercial-scale SAF production facilities utilise HEFA technology, such as converting used cooking oil into SAF.

There is also competition to acquire SAF feedstocks for other potential users. IATA says government policies should allocate biomass feedstock to aviation to ensure an adequate supply.

According to IATA, the main challenges are:

Increasing supply chain infrastructure, identifying new sustainable sources, and providing the feedstocks identified for SAF production to the air transport industry.

Accelerating the adoption of new SAF technologies, including Power-to-Liquids (PtL), which require reliable access to low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure.

Creating a fully functioning SAF market through coordinated government policies and investment.

Fostering regional leadership among North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN to drive SAF output.

Inspiring energy industry investment in SAF capacity, supporting technology commercialisation, and aligning business strategies with global decarbonization goals.

For now, IAG and Air France–KLM lead the way in SAF adoption in Europe, but whether they can maintain or widen this lead will depend heavily on how the SAF market evolves, how policies develop, and how quickly lagging carriers can catch up.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Air-France-Sustainable-aviation-Fuel.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 10:01:44.122394

F&B Bio Recyclage, a Ghanaian company, plans to turn untreated municipal waste into an energy source through a large-scale waste-to-fuel project. The firm announced in early October that it had completed the first phase of a program designed to process 2,000 tons of solid waste a day to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel.

“This project addresses two global challenges — waste management and transport decarbonization,” said Frederick Opoku Agyekum, Development Director at F&B Bio Recyclage. “Our Phase 1 completion shows we can turn trash into clean jet fuel at scale in Ghana, with clear environmental and economic benefits.”

According to the African Clean Cities Platform, over 90% of Africa’s waste ends up in uncontrolled dumpsites and is often burned in the open. Nineteen of the world’s 50 largest dumpsites are located in sub-Saharan Africa, releasing methane and black carbon that harm air quality and public health.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates aviation generates 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, while the International Air Transport Association (IATA) says sustainable aviation fuels could provide up to 65% of the cuts needed for carbon neutrality by 2050.

The Ghanaian initiative is part of a growing regional trend. In Sierra Leone, Climate Fund Managers and Infinitum Energy Group are developing a 30 MW waste-to-energy plant in Freetown, expected to convert 365,000 tons of waste a year into 236.5 GWh of renewable power.

Thanks to federal tax credits, biofuel producers will be able to pay farmers at least two times more an acre for crops than most food companies, finds a study by management consultancy Bain & Company — with the potential to disrupt agricultural markets.

The 45Z clean fuel production credit was introduced in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act to incentivise the domestic production of low-carbon transport fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel and biomass-based diesel.

While the Donald Trump administration revoked many of the IRA’s key tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it extended the 45Z credit, which was set to expire in 2027, to 2029.

There will be “much greater competition” between food and fuel producers, particularly for major crops such as corn and soya, Bain partner Andrew Keech said in a statement.

This is not the first time US federal policy has reshaped agricultural markets, the report notes. Between 2005 and 2012, inflation-adjusted corn prices leapt up by 193 per cent, driven in part by a government mandate to blend gasoline with ethanol.

“Today’s potential biofuels boom may not unfold in the same way, but the strategic risks are familiar,” the report says.

Global demand for biofuels is set to rise exponentially in the coming years as hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping work to decarbonise.

More pressure on food companies

This comes as food companies are already facing pricing pressures, reduced supply chain resilience, and greater difficulty obtaining key ingredients, the report notes.

As biofuel producers are able to bid more aggressively for farmland acres, food companies could face “higher input prices, reduced access to sustainable ingredients, and challenges in meeting both sustainability commitments and supply chain ambitions”, it says.

Bain estimates that biofuel producers will be able to pay up to $180 an acre thanks to the tax credits. It contrasts that with the $15–$35 an acre food companies typically offer.

In 2025, just 9 per cent of US-grown corn is expected to enter the human food supply, compared with 38 per cent for animal feed, 35 per cent for ethanol production, and 18 per cent for exports, says the report. Eight per cent of US-grown soya will be used for human consumption this year.

Remedies available

Bain recommends that food companies start by mapping their most critical ingredients and where they are sourced from, quantifying how overlaps with biofuel demand could affect their ability to secure a sustainable supply. It also suggests that companies explore sourcing alternatives and develop contingency plans before problems emerge.

“As extreme weather events increase and temperatures rise, supply chain resilience will be mission critical,” says the report. “The food industry’s resilience will depend on how quickly companies adapt to this new reality.”",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/c01d6497-e6da-405a-a779-d0a5fad456f0.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 10:02:02.699984

Produced from waste and renewable sources, SAF can power aircraft without modifications, helping airlines meet sustainability targets while creating green jobs and new industrial opportunities

Government mandates and financial guarantees are driving investment, lowering costs and accelerating adoption, positioning SAF as the key to a cleaner, more resilient future for aviation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents aviation’s most promising and practical path to reducing carbon emissions and achieving 2050 sustainability goals. In May 2025, the UK Government introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill (SAF), which has reached Report Stage in Parliament. The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT UK) is helping the Government with advice and guidance on SAF and how it can help the logistics and transport sector.

But understanding SAF ‘s workings and benefits is crucial for the aviation sector – and why it must be embraced sooner rather than later. Geoff Maynard, member of the Aviation Policy Group at CILT (UK), recently gave evidence in Parliament to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill Committee as MPs further consider the Bill.

Geoff Maynard has worked in the aviation sector for over 25 years, undertaking a wide range of aviation related commissions, many with extensive environmental content. Educated at Queens’ College, Cambridge, with a degree in Natural Sciences, Geoff has held senior positions in both the private and public sectors. He has worked on many major projects including Heathrow’s T5, the Olympic Terminal in Beijing, and a new airport for Eswatini.

Geoff gives his expert insight into SAF, its benefits, challenges, future and why the sector must embrace it.

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel that can power aircraft without engine or infrastructure changes. Produced from sustainable resources like agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and municipal solid waste, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that can be used in existing aircraft engines and fuel systems without modifications. It performs identically to traditional jet fuel in terms of energy density, freezing point, and combustion characteristics, requiring no special training or new equipment. SAF can also be produced using green electricity, water and carbon dioxide extracted from the air. This SAF, also known as e-fuel, could be produced in very large quantities – constrained only by the investment in new plant.

Raw materials undergo treatments to remove impurities, then hydro processing, gasification, or fermentation are used to transform them into high-quality aviation fuel that mimics traditional jet fuel properties. The aim for the government is to blend SAF fuel with traditional fossil jet fuel and with time increase the SAF fuel ratio and thus lower the use of fossil jet fuel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers significant environmental advantages, primarily through a substantial reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions. Unlike traditional jet fuel, which releases ancient carbon into the atmosphere, SAF is derived from materials that recently absorbed atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a closed carbon loop.

This process can lead to lifecycle carbon emission reductions of up to 80% compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

Additionally, SAF contributes to waste reduction by repurposing materials such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and municipal waste into energy, fostering a circular economy in waste management and energy production.

The government is encouraging this trend by first, mandating the percentage of SAF that must be included in aviation jet fuel sold in the UK. Second the SAF bill currently going through parliament establishes a company that can contract with industry to produce SAF at an agreed cost. If the SAF is ultimately sold at a price more than the agreed cost the excess is returned to the Government. Conversely if the SAF is sold at less than the agreed cost, the Government reimburses the producer for the loss. In this way, the Government eliminates the uncertainty that private industry faces in producing SAF, ensuring they cover their costs but also ensuring sufficient SAF is available to meet the mandated percentage.

These measures will help SAF overcome its adoption barriers, primarily its high cost, which is two to five times greater than traditional jet fuel, impacting airline profitability and passenger pricing. The Government expects that as the mandated SAF percentage rises, volumes produced will rise and it will naturally bring the price down as demand goes up.

The development of SAF is creating new industries and economic opportunities, with companies investing in production facilities, research, and supply chains. This investment is generating jobs. For airlines, SAF is vital for achieving sustainability goals and meeting passenger demands for eco-friendly travel. The ability to hit sustainability targets by simply adding a fuel the mix is the biggest pull factor, but for this to happen Government must encourage and support the development and introduction of SAF. This year all jet fuel sold in the UK must by law contain 2% SAF, with the percentage rising linearly to 10% by 2030, and on to 22% by 2040.

The future of SAF looks promising due to advancements in technology and increased production. Researchers are creating new methods that lower costs and reduce environmental effects. Major airlines aim for net-zero, which means SAF will play a vital role. Aircraft are being designed for 100% SAF, and production capacity is set to grow.

The availability of fossil jet fuel will reduce as other sectors, notably road transport, move away from fossil diesel and petrol. SAF will fill this gap and with the support of CILT UK we are helping bridge the conversation between our industries, airlines and Government.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Page-4-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 10:02:08.145668

China this year placed no orders for soybeans from the U.S. amid the Trump administration’s ongoing trade war with the nation, which previously imported roughly two-thirds of the state’s crop.

The state produced just over $1.02 billion in soybeans last year, just under the $1.04 billion in hay and haylage. Corn led the state with $2.27 billion in production.

Sara Stelter, the former president of the Wisconsin Soybean Association, during a Farmers for Free Trade listening session in Westby said the ag industry is doing everything it can to find new opportunities for the market, and the soybean market decline is also impacting the prices of other crops.

“What people don’t understand … is when the markets crash for corn and soybeans, it crashes all our markets for everything,” Stelter said. “Because our contracts for vegetables are based off the grain markets. It doesn’t make sense, but they’re in competition with acres for grain, so that’s why they always follow the grain markets.”

Some new markets soybean farmers are looking at include sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel for trains, wood glue and other industrial products, firefighting foam and replacing petroleum-based oil with soybean oil in more models of Goodyear tires.

“So we’re doing everything we can to look at our markets on a domestic level,” she said.

The United Soybean Board, which Stelter is a director on, is doing research to combat anti-seed oil rhetoric coming from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again effort, she said.

Sen. Brad Pfaff, D-Onalaska, said he’s backing a bill that would incentivize farmers to help build out the soybean-based aviation fuel industry.

“If you’ll remember in Wisconsin in the early 2000s, we really went gung-ho when it came to corn-based ethanol,” he said. “You, as farmers, helped build out that industry. The same idea [is] here as it comes to building out sustainable airplane fuel.”

But the Senate Agriculture and Revenue Committee member also noted the aviation fuel market alone is not going to replace the lost revenue from international exports.

Farmers for Free Trade Executive Director Brian Kuehl also noted the rising costs of steel, aluminum, fertilizer, chemicals, tractor parts and other farm inputs only adds to the difficult time Wisconsin farmers are having right now.

“You can’t keep doing that,” he said. “That’s a recipe for losing farms, and that’s what we’re starting to see.”

One way to help turn the situation around is to hold onto current major export partners, such as Mexico and Canada, and work on gaining new partners.

“That’s got to be the game plan,” Kuehl said. “Take the markets we have, open new markets. That’s how we get stronger. And this trade war, we need to bring it to a rapid end, because right now farmers are getting squeezed, and we’re hearing that all across the United States.”

— Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara is pushing back against concerns of government overreach during a public hearing on a bill that would require insurers to cover additional breast cancer screenings.

SB 264 would require insurers and the Medical Assistance program to cover additional screenings such as 3D mammograms, ultrasounds and MRI scans for women with dense breast tissue because normal mammograms often don’t catch breast cancer.

Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, was the sole “no” vote as the legislation cleared the Senate 32-1 earlier this week .

Kapenga told WisPolitics he understands the “financial pain” patients face when forced to pay out of pocket for treatments, such as additional breast cancer screenings.

But he said he voted against the measure because government mandates are “a major driver behind the skyrocketing health care costs that are hurting nearly all families across Wisconsin.”

“The insurance company should ultimately make the decision on which screenings to cover,” he added. “If there is a market demand, they will do it. But using the power of government to override free market forces—or interfere in the doctor/patient health discussion—not only contributes to a higher cost of living for everyone, it also violates the principles of limited government and Constitutional restraint.”

Bill author Cabral-Guevara, R-Appleton, during today’s Assembly Health, Aging and Long-Term Care Committee hearing pushed back on that concern. She said she also generally doesn’t support government mandates on businesses.

“The reason I say this is important, and the reason why I push for this, is because if we are going to say we are offering a service, it can’t be for 60%, only, of the women,” she said, referring to the fact that roughly 40% of women in Wisconsin have dense breast tissue.

She also argued covering late stage cancer treatment is likely more expensive for insurance companies than the cost of covering additional breast cancer screenings.

The American Cancer Society also visited the Capitol this week to bring light to the issue and work to convince lawmakers to pass Gail’s Law, named after Gail Zeamer, who died of breast cancer after several mammograms gave her a clean bill of health.

Tammy Brown, of Janesville, was part of the group of volunteers with ACS. She told WisPolitics she was fortunate enough to be able to pay $1,000 out of pocket in 2023 for an additional screening after a mammogram identified an area of concern, which turned out to be breast cancer.

“Putting off the health care that would enable early cancer intervention, when it can cost less for treatment and be less disruptive to a woman’s life is not a choice that any woman should have to make…ever,” she wrote. “This bill will save lives and ensure cost is not a barrier to early detection. My lawmakers were supportive today, but we need all lawmakers to turn this bill into law.”

— Gov. Tony Evers is urging the Trump administration to reconsider eliminating more than $1.5 billion in U.S. Department of Energy funding for clean energy in Wisconsin.

“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised,” the guv wrote in a letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Evers highlighted the potential impact in Wisconsin, including the elimination of funding through the Grid Resilience Innovation Partnerships program. Evers said the program supports grid flexibility and improving the resilience of power systems against extreme weather. He said cutting off the funding “will harm Wisconsinites and leave communities more susceptible to power outages and more costly repairs from future extreme weather events.”

The cuts put the Universities of Wisconsin at risk of losing more than $12 million, according to the guv’s office.

“Our state university system has long been a hub for advanced energy research, and federal funds support cutting-edge work in fields like battery storage, carbon capture, grid modernization, and biofuels,” Evers wrote. “These are areas that are critical for the future of U.S. energy independence, and losing this support will slow technological progress and hamper critical research into new and emerging technologies.”

A spokesperson for the state GOP did not return a request for comment.

— The Greater Green Bay Chamber of Commerce has named Lara Fritts its next president and CEO.

Fritts, who currently serves as director of the Frederick County Division of Economic Opportunity in Frederick, Maryland, starts in December and will be the second woman serving in the role. She takes the place of Laurie Radke, who stepped down at the end of August after 14 years in the role.

Fritts started her career in Wisconsin leading community development programs, such as being the first leader of On Broadway in Green Bay. She said she’s “honored to be selected to help lead the region’s next chapter of business and economic growth.”

“I’m excited to return home to partner with our public and private partners as well as the exceptional team at the Greater Green Bay Chamber to champion bold initiatives, strengthen our business community, and drive growth that delivers lasting value across the region,” she added.

— Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson appointed Benjamin Timm as the next Milwaukee Municipal Port director.

Timm has worked for the city government for 24 years and Johnson praised his record as notable, managing successful projects during his time at the Department of City Development. His budget management, lease negotiation and economic development skills make him a good fit, Johnson said.

“Benji Timm is a highly respected colleague who has taken on challenging projects such as Milwaukee Estuary Area of Concern cleanup, Northridge redevelopment and Century City reimagining,” Johnson said. “His professional strengths are a great complement to the talented Port staff he will lead.”

The job opening came after the port director of eight years, Jackie Q. Carter, took a promotion to lead the city’s Department of Employee Relations.

Kenya Airways was the first African carrier to operate a long-haul SAF-powered flight in 2023, using biofuel supplied by Italy’s Eni SpA.

But importing SAF is expensive. The green fuel can cost twice as much as regular jet fuel, and up to five times more for African airlines due to logistics and lack of local supply, according to CEO Allan Kilavuka.

Passengers in Africa are not yet willing to pay extra for lower-carbon flights, Kilavuka said. “so we need to find a way to reduce SAF production costs and hopefully get subsidies from organizations or governments.”

Attracting green capital

Kenya Airways will also operate SAF-powered flights from Nairobi to Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. At European airports, it will refuel with SAF, but the Cape Town return flight will use conventional fuel. The carrier aims to begin with 2% SAF across its fleet and gradually increase to 10% by 2030.

At the 41st Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in October 2022, states adopted a collective long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To put this ambitious vision into practice and quickly curb aviation emissions — expected to rise fast as the sector recovers from COVID-19 disruptions — the ICAO, national governments, airlines and industry will need to work even closer to reduce the climate impact of flying and associated ground operations.

A large share of aviation’s CO2 emissions arise from the combustion of kerosene, known as Jet A-1, in aircraft engines. To avoid this tailpipe CO2 completely, a range of solutions from hydrogen to batteries are possible, but these will require a full redesign of aircrafts and new refuelling infrastructure, and may therefore become widespread only after 2050.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is available today, and can be used without the need to develop new planes or engines.

These greener jet fuels deliver substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than Jet A-1. These emissions are saved throughout the production process as feedstocks used to make SAF have lower lifecycle carbon emissions than fossil jet.

However, the current predominant SAF type (i.e. biofuels) faces real availability and scalability challenges, as well as supply chain bottlenecks and questions over the sustainability of feedstocks. With these barriers in mind, our view is that Power-to-Liquid (PtL) synthetic fuel, obtained from low-carbon hydrogen and CO2, represents the most scalable product for long-term use and an untapped solution for the aviation market.

As PtL fuel is significantly more expensive than other SAFs, realising its potential cannot be achieved without major investment in electrolysis and carbon capture technology development and deployment.

Voluntary demand for SAF among airlines is rising rapidly, driven by significant CO2 savings, corporate carbon reduction targets, mounting policy attention and passenger interest.

Many airlines are already seeking to secure supplies over multi-year periods. This demand will firm up during the 2020s as national SAF mandates come into effect, especially from 2025 onwards.

Mandates are likely to start low but tighten rapidly during the 2030s and beyond. EU regulators are leading the charge: jet fuel supplied to EU airports will need to consist of 2% SAF by 2025, increasing at 5-year intervals to reach 63% in 2050 — of which 28% will consist of e-fuel.

Where demand mandates do not yet exist, the industry is taking some voluntary initiative, with a number of partnerships announced between major airlines and fuel suppliers to trial or regularly use SAF. Governments are also aware that domestic SAF production offers fuel security as an additional benefit.

To meet increasing demand, SAF production facilities are being constructed, announced or developed around the world. At present, the dominant SAF feedstock is vegetable oil. GHG savings are achieved when the feedstock is grown, as it captures CO2 during the process.

The technology to convert vegetable oil into biofuel (synthesised paraffinic kerosene) through hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is already commercial, and HEFA is the simplest and cheapest form of SAF, but its availability is limited by overall feedstock supply.

Feedstock prices, hard hit by the Ukraine war, currently represent the majority of the final SAF price. Their volatility can therefore create feedstock supply problems for producers.

Many HEFA feedstocks are monocrops, reliant on fertilisers that suffer from biodiversity reduction and are vulnerable to climatic and geopolitical price shocks.

In the lead-up to 2030, we expect to see a surge in the supply of fuel made from alternative biogenic and non-biogenic waste feedstocks, including agricultural residues, used tyres and municipal solid waste (MSW). These will be transformed into SAF through more advanced processes such as alcohol-to-jet, pyrolysis and Fischer-Tropsch gasification.

Greenhouse gas savings are more complex to assess in cases where non-biogenic waste is used, though other benefits can be realised such as avoided waste to landfill. However, feedstock constraints are once again a risk: wastes including MSW are sought by other sectors, such as incineration and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, making supply finite and competitive.

The constraints faced by these waste-to-fuel production pathways mean that the total SAF yield globally will increase but will still be relatively limited, especially in the coming decade.

To achieve significant SAF scale-up an exponential expansion of e-fuels or power-to-liquid fuels will be needed.

E-fuels are produced using low-carbon hydrogen (produced from biogas or renewable/nuclear electricity electrolysis) and captured CO2 and can achieve over 90% of lifecycle carbon savings compared with fossil Jet A-1.

In theory, e-fuels also have a far higher supply potential than other SAF types as electricity and CO2 are not restricted by feedstock availability in the same way. The catch is that e-fuels are highly energy-intensive to produce, very expensive and dependent on the rapid expansion of clean electricity production (renewable and/or nuclear) and carbon capture technology globally.

More positively, this interaction with electricity and CO2 sources potentially broadens the landscape for investors, with options to look along the value chain, from energy generation and hydrogen production to e-fuel synthesis.

Among the SAF types, PtL offers a great opportunity for decarbonisation at scale. It produces a high energy-density fuel that is more scalable and cleaner than other SAF types, when the energy used for the conversion processes is derived from low-carbon sources and the carbon from climate-neutral sources.

Importantly, PtL plants also offer an opportunity to hedge against the eventual likely demand for different fuel types.",https://kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/sg/images/2022/12/Aviation engine.PNG,N,,2025-10-16 10:02:55.280968

“(3) Within twelve months of the passing of this Act, the Secretary of State must make a direction under subsection (1) which requires the designated counter party to prioritise entering at least one revenue certainty contract with a producer of Power to Liquid sustainable aviation fuel if doing so will allow for at least one plant to reach Final Investment Decision by 31 December 2026.”

Government amendment 7.

Olly Glover - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Global demand for aviation continues to grow; it is projected to be two or three times bigger by 2050. In 2024, there was a record rate of increase in carbon emissions, according to the World Meteorological Organisation, and there was a new daily record for global aviation emissions in July 2025. Nearly half of all the carbon emissions to date from aviation have occurred since 2000.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been talked up for years as the solution, yet there has been a poor track record of unambitious targets not being matched by delivery. For example, in 2010, Boeing announced the target that 1% of aviation fuel globally should come from SAF by 2015, and in 2019, the International Air Transport Association set out hopes of reaching 2% by 2025, but today, globally, the figure is just 0.3%. The UK’s published figure this year of 1.29% is better, but it nevertheless shows how far we have to go.

The Conservative Government promised back in 2022 to have five commercial UK SAF plants operational by 2025, but there is still only one. It is therefore right of the Government to have introduced legislation to attempt to make sure that the latest set of SAF targets move from fantasy to realistic, credible and deliverable plans, although these will ultimately need to transition us towards the development of truly zero-carbon flight technology. I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Wimbledon (Mr Kohler), and for Sutton and Cheam (Luke Taylor), for their contribution to the Bill Committee, and I hope that Members from across the House will consider the Liberal Democrat amendments.

New clauses 1, 2 and 3 all increase the chances of the intention behind the Bill being realised. New clause 1 requires the Secretary of State to assess and report on the potential for disused oil refineries and similar industrial sites to be used for the production of sustainable aviation fuel. New clause 2 requires the Secretary of State to assess the measures being taken to encourage the supply of materials for production of sustainable aviation fuel, and has a focus on bioethanol plants. That is especially important in the context of the expected closure of the Vivergo bioethanol plant near Hull, following the Government’s decision not to provide it with financial support.

New clause 3 requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on the development of a strategy for analysing and maximising the potential of sustainable aviation fuels to contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

I also speak in support of two new clauses tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Edward Morello), both of which would improve the Bill by providing greater rigour and scrutiny of progress towards sustainable aviation fuel targets. New clause 4 would give the Secretary of State the power to increase SAF production obligations where necessary, and to ensure that reports on progress are laid before Parliament and relevant Select Committees. New clause 5 would introduce requirements for air travel providers to report on their use of sustainable aviation fuel, and to provide annual reports to the public via their websites. Collectively, new clauses 1 to 5 would strengthen the Bill and increase its credibility when it comes to SAF production and reporting on progress.

The Government’s SAF mandate requires just 22% of aviation fuel to be sustainable by 2040. That compares poorly with the European Union’s target of 32% by 2040. It is hard to square an objective of net zero aviation by 2050 with just 22% of fuel being sustainable a decade earlier, unless we put in place measures alongside SAF to cut emissions and make climate-friendly flight a reality. We urge the Government to clarify their plans for achieving their targets, particularly as hope for SAF progress is being used to state that Heathrow and Gatwick expansion are compatible with our greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.

Brian Leishman (Alloa and Grangemouth) (Ind) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

This year, Petroineos—that is, Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos and PetroChina from the Chinese state—closed the Grangemouth oil refinery. Closure was not about some passionate quest for net zero. Closure happened because private capital and a foreign Government owned vital energy infrastructure, and because corporate profits are more important than community good to the billionaire Jim Ratcliffes of this world. There were 435 jobs lost at the refinery, and hundreds more lost in the shared services that are housed on site; 2,822 jobs were lost in the wider supply chain. That is mass de-industrialisation.

But closure is not just about job losses. The exodus of talented, skilled workers is awful, but closure also means that the site is no longer a positive destination for many local young people leaving school. We have seen an end to a generational employer in my community. The economic consequences are also absolutely enormous for local Grangemouth businesses, which relied on the custom of refinery workers and their families. Once again, I want to give credit to all the small local businesses that have kept town centres going in recent years. The pressure of running a small business when austerity and the cost of living crisis have hammered people’s disposable incomes can be all-consuming and incredibly stressful. I should know; I tried it for some years.

The economic turmoil of stopping refining is also a national issue, because the refinery was worth more than £400 million per annum to the Scottish economy. Politicians often talk about black holes. Well, that is a sizeable, industrial-shaped black hole to fill. I do not doubt that the Government understand the magnitude of how important it is to re-industrialise communities like mine in Grangemouth. The other day, I read my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane), who has done so much work to bring this Bill to the House, describing in Hansard the situation that he grew up in on the east side of Manchester, which lost its chemical and mining industries. He said:

“We are still getting over that in my great city.”––[Official Report, Sustainable Aviation Fuel Public Bill Committee, 17 July 2025; c. 108.]

He undoubtedly understands the social consequences of industry finishing up. No community can afford this continued spiral of industrial decline.

To go back to my original point, we have for decades been an economy controlled by private capital, multinational corporations and foreign Governments whose policy has been to make things elsewhere, and to sell here. Have the last four decades not shown that the country’s complete reliance on private capital means profits over people? We must adopt a new industrial strategy that meets the needs of working people and their communities by securing at least some form of public ownership of the new industries that we will need—that is a mainstream political view.

The Government must learn lessons to stop history repeating itself, and to prevent workers and communities having every last ounce of work extracted from them before they are discarded on a corporate whim. For the Government to create and benefit economically from the necessary green industrial revolution, which we need for our economy and for the planet, some form of Government ownership of future industries is necessary. Surely, that view should be at the heart of any Labour Government.

If the Government want to put their faith in private capital to mould Britain’s new industrial future, I urge them to think again. They need to be more active in the process of creating Grangemouth’s industrial future. They need to seize the initiative and invest in workers, communities industry and Scottish manufacturing. Producing sustainable aviation fuel is an enormous objective—one that we have committed to—and sites like Grangemouth are ideally placed for it. The infrastructure needs some degree of conversion and upgrade, of course, but it is there. The workforce and expertise are there. My local community needs to be re-industrialised. The Labour Government have ambitious SAF targets to meet, but, more importantly, they also have obligations to communities in our forgotten industrial heartlands.

Tom Collins (Worcester) (Lab) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

I will speak to new clause 1. Context is important, as this Bill is a first step on a long pathway to decarbonising aviation. At the moment, SAF components are blended with existing fossil fuels to create usable aircraft fuel, as I will go on to discuss, but I think it is helpful for us to be aware of the context: the various generations of sustainable aviation fuel that will form a road map as we move into the future.

First-generation aviation fuels use oils, often of biological origin, as feedstocks, and they produce a kerosene-type fuel that can be blended with our existing jet fuel. Second-generation SAF is derived from solid waste that goes through a digestion process, producing alcohols that can then be formulated into aviation fuel-type products. Third-generation fuels—I remind hon. Members that there are four generations—use wet mass as feedstock. Again, that wet mass might be biological, but it is incapable of competing with food crops for production, and the process produces an output that is much like a bio-crude oil.

As we move through the generations of sustainable aviation fuel production, it is important to remember that the outputs are different and are able to slip into different parts of the existing fuel production supply chain. The fourth generation is derived from gases, maybe even atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxide drawn from the atmosphere. It is often referred to as a power-to-liquids process, and is an entirely non-biological process that requires a lot of new technology. It is a future solution, but an advantageous and attractive one as it can provide us with a purely synthetic fuel.

The point that I am illustrating is that the Bill is the first step in a long-term vision for aviation, in which sustainable aviation fuel is able to play a progressively larger role. In future, we may even move to different fuels all together. As chair of the all-party parliamentary group on hydrogen, I would like to give a shout-out to its role in the potential long-term future of power for aviation.

These generations of fuels also interact with the technology in our aircraft. Although current blends of sustainable aviation fuel can go into aircraft now, the aircraft will need to be upgraded as we move to higher fractions of sustainable components in that fuel, because some of the aromatic components in fossil fuels are not available in synthetic fuels. They are currently required by some of the seals in the engines, and the aircraft will need to move into future generations to accept high proportions of aviation fuel.

All of this is about having a strategic road map. The Bill is one step—one vastly enabling piece of legislation—and it follows a model that is well proven to help establish new technologies as part of a green and sustainable future. We have seen the similar progress in offshore wind, for example, where it has been utterly transformational beyond anybody’s expectations. This vehicle should be able to do similar things for the beginning of our journey on decarbonising aviation, but it needs a long-term plan. That is why there is a really important piece of work to be done in the secondary legislation enabled by the Bill. It is very important that that legislation takes account of all the factors being discussed through the various amendments that have been tabled.

I oppose new clause 1, because we must not oversimplify the journey before us. In fact, we must allow the Government the freedom to create a sophisticated, technically-led strategy to deploy these different types of sustainable aviation fuel, taking into account all factors, including our existing infrastructure, the production of biomass and the advancement of aviation technology. If we get this right, and if this game is played well, we have the opportunity to start successfully—and even lead—a journey that will be absolutely transformative, and to envisage a thriving, positive and sustainable future for aviation.

John Cooper (Dumfries and Galloway) (Con) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

For many years, I commuted by aircraft from Scotland to Dublin—so many years, in fact, that I can still recall there are eight emergency exits on a Boeing 737-800. There are two at the front, two at the rear and four over-wing exits. What a great pity that this Bill does not have an amendment that is an escape slide.

While sustainable aviation fuel sounds wonderful, it is burdened with many inconvenient facts. The first is that there is no SAF production industry at the scale required. While new clause 1 is a bold attempt to jump-start production by repurposing old facilities, it is a jumbo jet of a task. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2030, global demand for SAF is expected to reach 70 million tonnes per annum—around 4% to 5% of total jet fuel consumption.

Meeting likely demand in just five years requires an additional 5.8 million tonnes of capacity. What is the investment required to reach even that relatively modest goal? The WEF pitches it at somewhere between $19 billion and $45 billion globally. If that does not give our legislative autopilot the warning, “Terrain! Terrain! Pull up!”, then it should do. New clause 1 is unaffordable, whether backed by public or private finance, and I am afraid it is doomed to fail.

It is certain that the vast input costs will result in massively higher costs for passengers and air freight. I support the vital new clause 6, which would force an assessment of the economic impact of this Bill, which I fear will be nothing short of devastating. Some might piously accept fewer flights to the Costas or a little less airfreighted Kenyan mangetout on the dinner table, but making air travel ruinously expensive will have implications for thousands of jobs—millions globally—in not only aviation, but tourism. Many flights are not indulgences, but lifelines. We are an island nation, and many communities within the UK are entirely reliant on air links.

Will Britain—so long the pioneers of aviation, with a history stretching back to the first scheduled international passenger flight and the first jet airliner—be foremost in SAF? Probably not, for mandating SAF is easier than producing it, especially in a country with power prices as exorbitant as ours. Energy bills in Dumfries in my constituency are four times what they are in Dumfries in Virginia in the United States, and they are cheaper still in China.

We need a lot of power to make SAF. Many question its green credentials when so much carbon is generated in its production. Amendment 10 is a bid to explore the serious issues around SAF derived from either organic or synthetic sources. Much is made of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases using SAF sourced from waste fat and oil feedstocks, but, as we have heard, those basic building blocks are in limited supply. That issue is also addressed in, though not solved by, new clause 2. Using crops as feedstock may not reduce greenhouse gases at all, and there are huge implications of turning prime agricultural land and billions of gallons of water over to producing crops for fuel, rather than food. Again, Britain is at a disadvantage. America’s vast corn belt might get involved, but the British bioethanol industry is a warning to us, for it was not able to survive on current targets for the content in road fuel.

Other amendments, including amendment 11, concern themselves with how a revenue certainty mechanism will operate. My concern is that we risk creating a self-licking ice cream—a self-perpetuating system with no purpose other than to sustain itself. This Bill could guarantee moneys that simply offset the costs of manufacturing SAF, which is itself made expensive by green levies. Would it not be better to put what money we have available into aviation excellence, driving up the efficiency of jet engines and airframes? Aviation is already playing its part in reducing its carbon footprint—according to some experts, engine efficiency is already up by as much as 83% from the early days of the de Havilland Comet jet liner. That progress can continue, although super-efficient jets need superalloys to handle the extremes of temperature in their engines, and those require the sorts of rare earths that China is hoovering up. Canada, by the way, has many of the same critical minerals; might we be better off investing in those than subsidising SAF?

If we want really big carbon savings, we ought to look to the sea. Much of what we trade—in and out—goes by sea, and cargo ships are heavily reliant on bunker oil, a tar-like substance with heavy emissions. If we want novel fuels, this island nation should look once more to Tennyson’s “boundless deep”, where the salt-caked smoke stacks belch still. Meanwhile, the wild blue yonder of the skies must not be made inaccessible simply by expensive green dogma.

Sadik Al-Hassan - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My hon. Friend is, of course, right to highlight such advocacy in the sector. I welcome his contribution.

The Exolum project is not just a boost for our regional economy; it is a clear signal that the UK can combine its climate ambition with a sound industrial strategy. The production subsidies for SAF introduced by this Bill are therefore already very welcome and are the right step forward, but production plants are only as good as their ability to get their product to market. Without that capability, they cannot attract investment or access the very subsidies that this Bill rightly establishes.

Fortunately, the UK is blessed with an extensive aviation fuel pipeline and storage network—one of the most advanced in the world. Companies such as Exolum are already using that network to deliver cleaner fuels across the country. From my visits to Redcliffe Bay, I know that Exolum has additional storage capacity that it would like to bring back into use to help deliver even more SAF. Companies at the forefront of this shift, such as Exolum, must be supported to deliver further investment at Redcliffe Bay in my constituency—and at other sites—and across the national pipeline network to create a new SAF super-highway for the UK. Such a network would allow producers to get their fuel to market efficiently, and it would secure our long-term position as a global leader in green aviation.

Crucially, my constituency is also home to Bristol airport, which has demonstrated real leadership in this sector. In March, almost a year ahead of the Government’s mandate, Jet2 began operating flights from Bristol airport using SAF, cutting emissions by an impressive 70%. However, our ambitions for cleaner flights cannot stop at SAF. Bristol airport’s same leadership can and should be applied to hydrogen in aviation, ensuring that the south-west continues to lead the UK’s journey to greener skies.

Hydrogen is a key element of the future aviation landscape and the broader energy transition. As we stand at the crossroads and decide which industries and technologies to support, we must not overlook the infrastructure that will support hydrogen tomorrow, as well as its supply chain, its production and its distribution. Investment in hydrogen benefits both the industries of today and the industries of 2050. However, that investment requires certainty, which only Government direction and leadership can provide via a road map already laid out in this Bill.

I believe deeply in the potential of hydrogen, and I am proud that the south-west is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. We have world-class research facilities such as those I have visited at the University of Bath, innovative small and medium-sized enterprises such as Hyflux in North Somerset, and a cluster of industries already looking to the hydrogen future. For my constituents in North Somerset, this Bill in its current form delivers both cleaner skies and a sustainable future for a vital industry. Looking ahead to hydrogen in aviation, the opportunities are particularly exciting for our region. The research, development, production and infrastructure required for hydrogen fuel are rightly taking root in the south-west, near Bristol, which is the home of AI in the UK, where the fantastic Mayor, Helen Godwin, is creating jobs, driving innovation and positioning us at the forefront of this emerging technology.

This Bill is not merely climate policy; it is economic strategy, industrial ambition and national leadership combined. Sustainable aviation fuels are essential to the survival of our aviation industry, but let us not allow our ambition to cease there. Hydrogen represents another key to unlocking our sustainable future in the UK, and this Bill provides us with the learnings we will need to make hydrogen in aviation a reality.

Edward Morello (West Dorset) (LD) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Sustainable aviation fuel offers us a route to decarbonise one of the most carbon-intensive industries and to secure the future of our aviation sector in a way that is compatible with our net zero goals. Climate change remains the greatest challenge of our time. It is an existential threat to us, our children and our grandchildren, and every decision made in this House must be measured against the scale and the urgency of the crisis.

Aviation, while connecting people and driving our economy, is a contributor to the problem. In 2022, it was responsible for almost 30 million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to about 7% of the UK’s total emissions. Even as emissions from other sectors decline, aviation’s share is projected to rise to 16% by 2035. That is not compatible with our net zero targets, nor with our moral obligation to keep global temperature rises below 1.5°.

Sustainable aviation fuel is not a silver bullet, but it is a step towards addressing the challenge. As someone who spent almost a decade working in renewable energy, I have seen how technology, innovation and the public trust must work hand in hand if we are to make lasting progress in addressing climate change. However, with innovation must come accountability, which is why I have tabled new clauses 4 and 5. These new clauses would strengthen this Bill and aim to make the transition to clean flight more accountable, more transparent and, yes, more ambitious. New clause 4 would support the Secretary of State to raise sustainable fuel targets in any given year and introduce a duty to consider annually whether the target should be increased. The Secretary of State would also be required to set out what steps the Government will take to make any increase possible. In short, to ensure that the Government cannot forget the targets, it would require them to revisit, review and, wherever possible, raise their ambitions for cleaner flight.

New clause 4 would strengthen the parliamentary scrutiny. It would require the Government to lay a copy of each annual report before Parliament and share it with the relevant Select Committees in both Houses, meaning proper oversight and public accountability. Progress must not just be made; it must be seen to be made if we are going to take the public with us.

New clause 5 would build on that principle of transparency and public engagement, requiring air travel providers to report annually on their sustainable aviation fuel in a way that passengers and the public can actually understand. Too often, data about emissions and fuel use is buried in complex technical reports that mean little to consumers. Under this proposal, airlines would publish both the total amount of SAF used and the proportion it represents of their overall fuel consumption.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Father of the House; I could not have put it better myself. It is essential that whatever measures, on any matter, are brought forward by any Government—be it the current Government or any future Government—real people’s lives and the cost base be reviewed regularly, so that we are not making people poorer, or stopping people from being able to do what they want, be it go on holiday, travel for business or move goods around.

With that, I come to amendment 8 and the cost impact on passengers. The amendment would require the designated counterparty to report on the impact of the revenue certainty mechanism on passenger air fares. One of the most contentious areas surrounding the Bill, and indeed the Government’s whole approach to net zero, is: what does it actually cost real people? The amendment seeks to clarify that, and it gives the Government the opportunity—in theory, they should cheerfully embrace this—to lock in a claim that they profess to believe, namely that the Bill will have an impact of plus or minus £1.50 on air fares. The previous Minister repeated that statistic time and again on Second Reading and in Committee. The new Minister has the challenge today of either sticking with his predecessor’s assertion, backing the amendment and locking in protections for consumers, or admitting that this may well be more costly to air travellers.

It is worth noting that during the evidence stage of Bill Committee, none of the witnesses was willing to affirm the Government’s figure. In fact, some noted that the estimated price appeared low. For example, Jonathon Counsell from International Airlines Group stated:

“We think there are potentially some elements that have not been included in that calculation, but £1.50 per passenger feels quite low when you think the costs of the SAF itself will be nearer to £10.”––[Official Report, Sustainable Aviation Fuel Public Bill Committee, 15 July 2025; c. 17, Q12.]

Consumers need peace of mind that the Bill will not cost them dear, and will not act as a financial barrier to the family holiday or any other trip, so failure to back the amendment can only mean uncertainty.

I turn to amendment 11, which is focused on transparency. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to set a standardised levy rate, payable by all suppliers of aviation fuel, that must be publicised by suppliers of aviation fuel on invoices to their customers. Valero, for example—one of the world’s largest renewable fuels producers—has contacted the Opposition arguing for the amendment, saying that it would offer a workable solution; it would support the development of new SAF production without significantly impacting the industry as a whole. The amendment would apply the levy equally to all jet fuel suppliers, providing a fair and transparent mechanism for supporting the broader SAF industry.

Just this week, I have been contacted by Virgin Atlantic, which is arguing that transparency safeguards must be in place to keep costs low for consumers. As organisations including the International Air Transport Association have highlighted, since the mandate came into effect in January 2025, fuel suppliers have been adding compliance risk premiums to the cost of mandated SAF, contributing to the price of SAF and doubling it for some carriers. That is to cover the eventuality that they do not meet the 2% mandate target and must pay the buy-out price for any missed volume. Virgin Atlantic has argued that to prevent SAF prices increasing further, the revenue certainty mechanism must have sufficient safeguards in place to ensure transparency over cost pass-through. There must also be a transparent process for refunds in the event of over-collections, and all revenues generated under the RCM should be ringfenced, rather than going into the general taxation pot.

Amendment 9 looks at British technology and intellectual property. It would require the designated counterparty to prioritise UK-based technology when entering contracts. As I said from the Dispatch Box on Second Reading, there is a historical reality that we need to confront, and the amendment would stop history repeating itself. The historical error that I refer to is this: a great many projects supported by grants from the advanced fuels fund use foreign-owned technology. It cannot be right that the British state, while arguing for domestic fuel security, funds overseas technology when we have incredible innovators and manufacturers right here.

Domestic fuel security must mean domestic fuel IP, manufacture and supply. It is important both to develop a UK market for SAF, eSAF and local production, as is provided for by the Bill and the mandate, and to support and encourage the use of home-grown technology for the manufacture of those products. That not only retains revenue in the United Kingdom but leverages a huge amount of revenue for future exports through technology licensing. The amendment tackles that head-on, and a failure to back it would be a failure to back United Kingdom innovators.

Lastly, amendment 10 is on technological choices. It states:

“The terms under subsection (4)(c) must include a requirement for the producer to consider the longevity of supply and relative environmental impact when prioritising between organic and synthetic derived sustainable aviation fuel solutions.”

I feel incredibly strongly about this amendment. It is on a matter that I have championed in this House for many years—in the last Parliament, during my time on the Transport Committee and, since July, from this Dispatch Box. The amendment is in the name of the shadow Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Holden), and it is relevant to new clause 7 and amendment 12 in the name of the hon. Member for Dewsbury and Batley, both of which I have a great deal of sympathy for.

Governments of all political persuasions have professed to be technologically neutral. They seldom are. There is a natural tendency to pick winners and losers. We need to look through that lens, and ask ourselves what the Bill is promoting and using the levers of primary legislation to enable. The disappointing answer to that is the potential to bring alive SAF plants using technologies that have already been superseded—plants that would therefore be temporary at best. Stepping up something with no longevity, and with an estimated build cost of between £600 million and £2 billion, would be no small mistake.

Power-to-liquid solutions, otherwise known as eSAF or synthetic fuel—liquid hydrocarbons literally made out of air and water—are surely the better and sustainable future for aviation fuel. We had debates on Second Reading and in Committee about other solutions. I cannot imagine that anyone is ready to defend growing food to burn it, but equally, waste-derived fuels simply are not sustainable in the long term. Solid waste is not readily available; the primary source is local authorities, the majority of which are on contracts with energy-from-waste facilities and incinerators that have decades to run. Likewise, I am not sure there is enough chip oil in the country to meet our aviation fuel needs.

That leaves power-to-liquid solutions and eSAF. Many say that it is not ready; some say it is too expensive; but those of us on the Public Bill Committee heard loud and clear from Zero Petroleum that it is ready to scale right now. It just needs the green light from the regulators, and with scale will come affordability. Amendment 10 is in many ways a light-touch amendment to bring this debate to the fore. It does not close down other technological routes, but forces the Government to acknowledge the risk, both to the environment and in terms of cost, when choosing contracts under the RCM.

As other speakers have said, the Bill can still be improved. I urge the Minister to accept the amendments, which would improve the Bill, and to ensure a strong and affordable future for sustainable aviation fuel in our great United Kingdom.

Keir Mather - Hansard - - - Excerpts

No piece of legislation can deal with all the emissions that we are facing through challenges in the aviation sector. That is why we have this comprehensive package of measures to make decarbonising aviation while allowing passengers to fly at an affordable rate a reality.

The hon. Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman) spoke with his usual fervent passion in support of his constituents. The National Wealth Fund stands ready to encourage investors to join us in finding a long-term industrial future for Grangemouth, standing ready to invest £200 million once an investable proposition has been identified.

The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Sarah Olney) raised the unfortunate closure of Vivergo. The Government have been working with the plant to understand the financial challenges that it has faced over the last decade, but I would like to reassure her that we do not anticipate supply issues in bioethanol provision. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester for his decided and confident support for the measures in the Bill.

The hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (John Cooper) said that the market was too nascent, but I encourage him to look at the detail of the Bill. He will see that that is exactly the problem we are seeking to solve through this legislation, by allowing SAF producers to scale at pace and pursue those innovative technologies. He also spoke about Britain as an aviation leader. The RCM is a first-of-its-kind global initiative to allow SAF producers to produce the fuels we so desperately need. He also encouraged me to sort out decarbonisation challenges in maritime. I draw his attention to the fact that the UK Government announced £448 million of funding to decarbonise the maritime sector only a fortnight ago.

My hon. Friend the Member for Derby South (Baggy Shanker) has Jaguar Land Rover within his constituency and is a passionate advocate for both the automotive and aviation sectors there. He spoke about the urgent need to encourage people to fly—to enable them to access the rest of the world, to see their families and to pursue business opportunities. That is something that we are passionate about championing through the Bill.

The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Luke Taylor) was pleased to see that the Bill was supported across the House. I can only hope that he is correct in his prediction. We shall see. I note that there are no representatives from the Green party here today to focus on these important measures to decarbonise aviation. Hon. Members from across the House can take from that what they will. The hon. Gentleman was right to outline the broader work that is required to decarbonise aviation, including airspace modernisation, but also to talk up our fantastic UK aviation sector and the hard work that it is undertaking to pursue decarbonisation.

My hon. Friend the Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) pointed to the very important fact that we are endowed with key infrastructure, such as pipelines, pioneered by firms like Exolum, the research facilities in his constituency to which he pointed and the pioneering work of Bristol airport. We need to develop a market to facilitate that infrastructure further. The 70% cut in emissions through SAF is an exciting proposition indeed.

There are a number of Government amendments that I would like hon. Members to consider. Government amendment 6 allows for levy regulations to require the Secretary of State to assist the designated counterparty by collecting information and sharing it with the designated counterparty. It will also allow for the regulations to be used to impose requirements on a person to provide information to the Secretary of State. It is a technical amendment that will ensure that the information required to calculate individual levy contributions is provided at sufficient frequency, while not creating additional administrative burdens for industry.

Government amendment 1 allows the Secretary of State to direct a Government-owned company to provide assistance for the purpose of identifying to whom revenue certainty contracts should be allocated. The allocation process for RCM contracts will be fair and transparent to give confidence to any applicants. In other renewable schemes, contract allocation is often carried out through an auction process. The allocation process for contracts for difference for renewable electricity is carried out through the National Energy System Operator, or NESO, which is an operationally independent, publicly owned body.

That type of approach to allocation may also be suitable for RCM contracts, so the amendment will allow the Secretary of State to direct a body like NESO to support in the allocation process. The final decision on allocation, however, remains with the Secretary of State. Without the amendment, the same allocation process could be pursued, but that would need to be done on a contractual basis through a procurement process, which would add unnecessary cost and complexity to the process. The amendment avoids those unnecessary impacts. I therefore commend it and all other Government amendments to the House.

I would ask that new clauses 1 to 3, which were tabled by the Liberal Democrats, be withdrawn. They were introduced in identical form in Committee, and my remarks will closely reflect the points my predecessor made then. The amendments seek a review of the impact of the revenue certainty mechanism within the next 12 months. I am afraid that that is not reasonable, as the revenue certainty mechanism triggers only once SAF is being produced, and even at pace, that is some years off. It will take time to build SAF plants, initially starting with a contract allocation round with SAF producers. Therefore, we will not see sufficient developments in the next 12 months to warrant a review of the impact of the revenue certainty mechanism. I agree, however, that it is important to have parliamentary scrutiny to measure the impact of the Act and to propose actions if necessary. The SAF mandate already includes a review clause to assess the impact of the statutory instrument, with the first review scheduled within five years. That is in line with comparable schemes.

With regard to new clause 1, I can reassure the House that work is being carried out at pace across Government on the future of our refineries. Commissioning a separate report, as the new clause proposes, risks a delay to future decisions and any subsequent benefits that may be realised. Overall, we expect low-carbon fuel production to support up to 15,000 jobs across the country and to make a contribution to the economy of up to £5 billion by 2050.

Keir Mather - Hansard - - - Excerpts

The hon. Member raises a very important point. We need to ensure that the benefits of the Act are felt across the length and breadth of our United Kingdom, and that includes engaging with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Assembly.

I turn to new clause 2. We do not anticipate a substantial impact on SAF production in the event of a decline in UK bioethanol production. The bioethanol market is a global one, and we do not currently foresee any supply issues. Furthermore, the recommendations in new clause 2 are already under way and duplicate measures can already be found in the SAF mandate. In July, a total of £63 million was awarded to 17 projects via the advanced fuels fund. That includes projects that use bioethanol, municipal solid waste and green hydrogen as feedstocks, among other sources. The Chancellor also announced in the spending review 2025 that we will continue to support SAF production throughout the spending review period. The SAF mandate also includes a formal review mechanism embedded in its legislation, with the first review scheduled to take place within five years.

New clause 3 would also duplicate measures that already exist in the SAF mandate. The mandate awards more certificates per litre to SAF with higher greenhouse gas savings, which will encourage SAF developers to continuously improve on their greenhouse gas savings. This will be monitored through the formal review mechanism, with the possibility to update legislation as required.

I hope that this reassures the hon. Member for Didcot and Wantage that, in many respects, the concerns he outlines are allayed by existing measures in the Bill. I therefore urge him not to push his new clauses.

New clause 6, tabled by the right hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Holden), would require the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament a report on the economic impact of the legislation within a year of it being passed. Such a report would not show the full economic impact of these measures. Contracts will need to be negotiated, signed, plants built and SAF produced and sold before economic impacts are released. Transparency on reporting in relation to the Act’s economic impact can be achieved through regular updates to the House. Therefore, I do not see the new clause as being effectual, if he wishes to evaluate the economic impact of the RCM. I therefore ask him not to move his new clause.

New clause 5, tabled by the hon. Member for West Dorset (Edward Morello), would require the Secretary of State to introduce a regulation requiring airlines to make an annual report on their use of SAF, both in absolute volumes and as a percentage of overall fuel used. I welcome transparency on carbon emissions to help consumers make informed choices. However, we will be providing data on the supply of SAF under the mandate, including what proportion of the total aviation fuel supply is SAF. Furthermore, many airlines already provide public information on their decarbonisation efforts, and I therefore do not believe this new clause is necessary and ask the hon. Member not to move it.

New clauses 4 and 7, tabled by the hon. Member for West Dorset and the hon. Member for Dewsbury and Batley (Iqbal Mohamed) respectively, relate to power-to-liquid obligations. On new clause 4, the Government have already committed to keep mandate targets under review. The existing legislation enables the Secretary of State to amend obligations under the SAF mandate, subject to consultation with those affected and scrutiny by Parliament. Allowing amendments to the obligations without consulting appropriate parties could be detrimental to our shared ambition of increasing the use of SAF. On new clause 7, the legislation that gave effect to the SAF mandate already makes provision for a review no later than 2030. Given that the mandate has been in place for less than 12 months and the PtL obligation does not come into effect until 2028, it would not be helpful to review earlier than planned. I therefore ask the hon. Members not to move their new clauses.

Amendment 8, tabled by the right hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay, would put a requirement on the counterparty to report on the effect of the introduction of the RCM on air travel prices. This was spoken to by the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith). The Government are committed to delivering value for money in the RCM scheme by controlling the scale and number of contracts entered into, and through the prices negotiated in each contract. The impact on air fares are likely to rise or fall by less than the cost of a cup of coffee. The costs of the scheme and the impact on ticket prices will be kept under continual review. Passengers should also benefit from the lower prices generated from the lower project risk and reduced cost of capital for SAF producers. Therefore, the Bill and the measures in it will not limit people’s ability to fly. Given that, I ask the right hon. Member not to move the amendment.

I turn to amendments 9 and 10, tabled by the right hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay, and to amendment 12, tabled by the hon. Member for Dewsbury and Batley. The decisions on the specifics of contract allocation will be made during the contract allocation process. There will be a fair and transparent allocation process that evaluates the key costs, benefits and risks of each project. That will be developed over the coming months and will be subject to consultation with stakeholders. These amendments would reduce the Government leverage in negotiations by setting criteria in advance and would likely reduce value for money in the contracts signed, which I am sure all of us would seek to avoid. I therefore ask that these amendments are not moved.

Finally, I turn to amendment 11, tabled by the right hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay. In May 2025, the Government published the response to the consultation on funding the SAF revenue certainty mechanism. It confirmed that a variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers would be introduced, and this was included in the contents of the Bill. The Government plan to consult imminently on the detailed design of the levy, but this amendment would pre-empt stakeholder responses, which will be considered in any design decisions. I therefore ask the right hon. Member not to press the amendment.

I hope that my responses have provided the explanations and reassurances that colleagues were seeking. The Bill is a crucial step towards establishing a SAF industry in the UK and driving investment, growth and jobs across our great country. Once again, I urge the House to give the Bill its full support.",https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/static/UK_Parliament/img/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-16 03:01:05.755331

Singapore will introduce a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy for outbound air travel in 2026. The details of this levy will only be introduced later. But we can expect an additional fee to be collected when we fly next year.

This levy is not for fun. International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme For International Aviation), will become mandatory worldwide in 2027. Airlines will be required to offset any carbon emission growth with either carbon credits or SAF.

I said in my speech that I fully support our move towards sustainability. As a small, low-lying island on the equator, we are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We must do our part.

However, sustainability should not come at the expense of competitiveness. They must always go hand in hand. Because what good is sustainability for tomorrow, if we lose our lunch today ?

Departing from Changi Airport already costs more than other airports. Others such as KLIA, Incheon, Suvarnabhumi or Narita are all cheaper. Changi's charges are also expected to rise further in the years ahead, even before the new SAF Levy kicks in.

Our air hub is of strategic importance. It connects us to the world, enables trade, and directly supports tens of thousands of jobs. But the competition is cutthroat. Other airports are learning from us and working hard to improve on both service and efficiency. They will steal our lunch if we are not careful.

LEGO Group has set a series of climate goals, including targets to reach net zero emissions across the value chain by 2050 and to reduce carbon emissions by 37% by 2032, on a 2019 basis. According to the company, phasing out natural gas forms part of its “Zero Impact in Operations” ambition to decouple its impact from its growth.

The company has historically used natural gas to heat its factories, with emissions from natural gas use representing 16,000 tonnes CO₂e in 2023. To solve the challenge of natural gas-based GHG emissions, LEGO highlighted key projects to find alternative sources of heat.

Among the highlighted projects, LEGO Group said that it has drilled two wells at its factory in Nyíregyháza, Hungary, finding a heat source to enable the use of geothermal energy. The company said that over the next two years it will install infrastructure and technology to circulate the hot water from the well through the factory, which it expects to completely eliminate the factory’s reliance on natural gas for heating completely once it is operational in 2028.

The company said that it has also reduced natural gas use by switching to district heating, which is mostly renewables-based, in Billund, Denmark, with 11 buildings transitioned in 2024.

Strategic Leveraging for India’s SAF Ascension India’s ambition to become the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) hub for the Global South requires more than incremental moves.
“Producing enough Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to power planes is no small feat.","India is charting a bold course to become the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) hub of the Global South, leveraging its vast biomass, ethanol infrastructure, and policy-driven mandates. With domestic blending targets, state-backed incentives, and pioneering projects like IOC’s Panipat facility, the country is converting waste streams—used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and municipal solid waste—into low-carbon jet fuel. By 2040, India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF annually, slashing lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent, generating green jobs, and creating export opportunities across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Startups, EPC firms, and R&D hubs are strengthening industrial capability, while harmonized global standards ensure both domestic adoption and international credibility. In short, India is transforming a climate challenge into a strategic, economic, and environmental advantage, positioning itself as the engine of aviation decarbonization for emerging markets.

Aviation is global yet carbon-bound. Planes still rely on liquid hydrocarbons; electrification is limited, hydrogen is years away, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the only immediate lever to cut emissions in a sector responsible for 2–3 per cent of global CO₂.

“The trajectory of SAF is nothing short of extraordinary—expanding from a nascent 5 million gallons in 2021 to 24.5 million gallons in 2023, a CAGR exceeding 100 per cent. Yet this still accounts for less than 0.1 per cent of global jet fuel demand, underscoring both the scale of the challenge and the immensity of the opportunity ‘’, mentioned Dr. Nripanka Das, Author, Sustainability & Carbon Markets. “The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, announced in 2021, has set audacious targets of 3 billion gallons by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050, requiring unprecedented scaling of production capacity and technological deployment. Pathways such as Fischer–Tropsch, approved by ASTM in 2009, already demonstrate how woody biomass, municipal solid waste, and agricultural residues can be transformed into jet fuel virtually indistinguishable from conventional Jet A. In this lies the promise of scaling an industry that not only meets aviation’s exacting standards but also redefines waste as the feedstock of the skies ,” he opined.

In 2024, SAF supplied under 1 per cent of demand, leaving the Global South exposed. Fast-growing airlines in India, ASEAN, and Africa face minimal local supply, giving India a strategic opening.

“In 2025, real progress in SAF isn’t measured by headlines but by bankable projects—those reaching final investment decision, securing long-term offtakes with price floors or contracts for difference, and moving into genuine EPC mobilization. Success is also measured in carbon intensity as much as in gallons produced, with lowering lifecycle emissions now as critical as expanding capacity,” stated Dr Jennifer Holmgren, CEO, LanzaTech.

“In Washington, the vaunted ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ has compressed SAF’s erstwhile premium of $1.75 per gallon to a modest $1.00 under 45Z, ostensibly levelling the fiscal playing field with ethanol, but in reality propelling capital to cheaper road-fuel pathways such as renewable diesel. India, by contrast, has wisely eschewed the per-gallon palliatives of subsidies in favour of mandated momentum: a 1 per cent SAF blend in international flights by 2027, 2 per cent in 2028 under CORSIA, and an aspirational trajectory toward 5 per cent thereafter. Augmented by state-level incentives—capital subsidies, land concessions, and tax reimbursements—New Delhi is not merely nudging an industry, it is summoning it inexorably forward, guaranteeing a market, and inscribing India’s aviation future in cleaner, greener, and more resilient hues,’’ she added.

” The American model bets on the market rewarding low-carbon fuels without playing favorites; the Indian model assumes SAF won’t take off without a legal runway.

The strategic takeaway is clear: in the U.S., the winners will treat thinner credits as a design constraint, focusing on relentless carbon intensity reduction, locking in ironclad offtakes, and securing feedstock certainty. In India, success will hinge on executing the mandate-to-manufacturing flywheel—leveraging guaranteed demand, building robust domestic supply chains, and maintaining strict capex discipline. In both markets, SAF will only scale at pace where policy certainty aligns with the discipline of bankable project finance “

——– Dr Jennifer Holmgren, CEO, LanzaTech

India’s aviation sector, ferrying 240 million passengers in 2024 and poised to double by 2030, stands at a pivotal inflection point. Fuel demand is projected to soar from 16 million tonnes in 2030 to 31 million by 2040. Enter Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): capable of slashing lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent, India could produce 8–10 million tonnes annually by 2040—surpassing domestic demand, catalyzing 1.4 million green jobs, and opening export avenues. Already, 88 airports operate on green energy, with Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad setting carbon-neutral benchmarks of global significance.

IOC is spearheading commercial SAF production at Panipat, with ISCC CORSIA certification. An initial 35,000-tonne annual output, sourced from used cooking oil from hotels, restaurants, and food manufacturers like Haldiram’s, will satisfy India’s 1 per cent international blending mandate. Alcohol-to-jet pathways and export prospects, initially targeting European carriers, are also under exploration.

With blending mandates proliferating across Indonesia, Mexico, Canada, Europe, and Africa, and with low-carbon ethanol prospects beckoning in the United States, Praj finds itself at the cusp of a transformative expansion—broadening its portfolio in CBG, SAF, and ETCA while simultaneously amplifying the international dimension of its enterprise. Aircraft readiness is assured: Airbus confirms all planes can operate on a 50 per cent SAF blend, and Indian carriers have successfully executed demonstration flights. India is positioning itself not merely as a consumer, but as the SAF fulcrum of the Global South—where policy, pilots, and production converge to chart a sustainable, high-flying future.

India’s Feedstock Opportunity: A Diverse Ecosystem

India’s edge in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) race lies in its abundant and diverse biomass, not subsidies. Unlike nations constrained by monocultures or geography, India can channel agricultural residues, industrial by-products, urban waste, and renewable energy into multiple SAF pathways—positioning itself as both a domestic and export hub. In words of Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Chairman Praj Group, “India is uniquely positioned to become the hub for SAF in the Global South. Its strategic location in the Asia–Pacific, with strong air connectivity to Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, makes it a natural node for SAF supply and distribution. The Ethanol Blending Programme, scaled from modest beginnings to 20 per cent, demonstrates India’s ability to mobilise feedstock, implement policy, and drive impact at scale—delivering foreign exchange savings and strengthening rural economies. The foundation is further strengthened by India’s unmatched feedstock diversity. Agricultural residues and sugarcane by-products offer abundant raw material streams for SAF production.”

” Praj has established several Centers of Excellence in collaboration with leading research institutes, working across the entire biofuels value chain—right from feedstock and technology development to end-product and application development. At the heart of this ecosystem is Praj Matrix, our state-of-the-art R&D center, which serves as the innovation hub for developing and commercialising cutting-edge technologies for biofuels and SAF. This strong integration of research, policy, and industry not only accelerates breakthroughs but also reinforces India’s credentials as a frontrunner in the global SAF journey “

— Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Chairman, Praj Group

Agricultural residues are the cornerstone. India generates 230–250 million tonnes annually, including rice straw, maize stalks, and sugarcane bagasse, much of which is wasted or burned. Rice straw alone contributes 80–85 million tonnes of emissions in northern states. Redirecting even 15–20 per cent into SAF via gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, or cellulosic ethanol-to-jet could anchor a domestic industry while tackling severe winter air pollution. “SAF can be blended at different levels with limits between 10 per cent and 50 per cent, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), over 360,000 commercial flights have used SAF at 46 different airports largely concentrated in the United States and Europe. An estimated 1 billion dry tons of biomass can be collected sustainably each year in the United States, enough to produce 50–60 billion gallons of low-carbon biofuels, ” stated Dr. Marcus Griswold, Founder at Little Green Myths. “

Ethanol is another pillar. India’s fuel-blending programme has built over 5 billion litres of annual capacity, spanning 1G molasses and emerging 2G cellulosic plants. Existing infrastructure can pivot to alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) production, with Praj Industries piloting scalable ATJ technology alongside global partners.

” Feedstock costs represent the largest component of biofuel production costs, typically accounting for 40-60 per cent of total production expenses depending on conversion pathway and feedstock type. Wood residues and sawmill by-products currently cost $40-80 per dry ton delivered to conversion facilities, while dedicated energy crops may cost $60-120 per dry ton depending on production systems and transportation distances. These feedstock costs translate to $0.80-2.40 per gallon of biofuel production cost, indicating the critical importance of feedstock procurement strategies and supply chain optimization for overall project economics”

— Dr. Nripanka Das, Author, Sustainability & Carbon Markets

“Ethanol is no longer confined to being a road-fuel blend; it’s a low-cost, versatile building block for an extraordinary range of products, from sustainable aviation fuel via alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology to textiles, cleaning agents, and everyday household goods. With advances in carbon capture and utilization (CCU), we can now make ethanol from industrial emissions, municipal waste, and even biogenic CO₂, turning liabilities into valuable feedstock. The result is a molecule that sits at the crossroads of decarbonization and circular economy. This is ethanol’s reinvention story: from a single-purpose fuel additive to a platform chemical powering the next wave of sustainable manufacturing ,’’ mentioned Dr. Holmgren.

Niche feedstocks and urban waste further broaden the portfolio. Used cooking oil (1.4–1.5 million tonnes/year) feeds HEFA pathways, while municipal solid waste (62 million tonnes/year, 30 per cent treated) can support gasification-FT SAF routes, aligning aviation decarbonisation with Swachh Bharat and Smart Cities initiatives. “Airlines are betting billions and billions on jet fuel made from yesterday’s French fries—but can cooking oil really power the future of aviation? SAF made from used cooking oil can cut emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to regular jet fuel, but right now they account for only about 1 per cent of the world’s jet fuel supply. It’s also important to remember that not all SAF is created equal—some are made from food crops that can raise other environmental concerns, while waste oils like used cooking oil are among the most effective and sustainable sources ,’’ advocated Justin Goldsberry; CEO and Founder of Goldsberry Management Group, LLC.

” We are on the cusp of new scaling for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in both the United States and India. But unlike solar and wind energy, renewable fuels carry a significant premium vs conventional fuels. Covering SAF’s cost above conventional jet fuel is a key factor to grow the sector. There must be a way to cover both the infrastructure capital investments and the ongoing operational costs of producing SAF.

In the recent past, the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Office oversaw a loan program that offered funding for SAF refineries at favorable rates. Today there are no government programs to provide low-cost debt. The U.S. still offers incentives to cover operations in the form of credits for agricultural products (the renewable fuel standard – RFS) and for producers combining the product with fossil-based fuel (the blenders tax credit, and 45Z clean fuel production credit). Individual states are also providing incentives for regional consumption such as California and Illinois. There is no U.S. SAF mandate”

—- Adam Klauber, Vice President Sustainability and Digital Supply Chain, World Energy

Looking ahead, cheap green hydrogen and captured CO₂ enable a Power-to-Liquids future. India’s record-low solar tariffs ($0.025/kWh) and $2.4 billion Green Hydrogen Mission create early positioning for synthetic SAF, potentially a decade from commercial scale.

In the words of Suzanne McKenzie, Sales Director, Lifecycle Oils, UK, “ The sustainability credentials of SAF depend heavily on what it is made from. Second-generation biofuels (derived from waste like UCO) offer substantial environmental advantages over first-generation biofuels made from virgin crops such as palm oil or rapeseed oil. First-generation biofuels are controversial from a sustainability perspective because they can compete with products that would end up in the food chain. This can drive up prices and expand agricultural land use. “

Suzanne further opined that considering the growing biofuel feedstock crops to be carbon-intensive, and is associated with deforestation, land conversion, biodiversity loss, and high water consumption. – repurposing a waste stream like UCO, could completely sidestep the significant carbon emissions associated with agricultural production and land-use change. UCO-derived biofuels can slash lifecycle carbon footprints by an estimated 80 per cent when benchmarked against conventional fuels, and 40 per cent when compared to first- generation biofuels. She further highlights the pressure to decarbonise aviation is translating directly into binding SAF mandates and targets worldwide, which is driving a substantial increase in demand for the fuel. “The UK mandate legally requires a 2 per cent blend of SAF in all jet fuel from 2025, rising to 10 per cent by 2030. Similarly, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation starts at a 2 per cent minimum blend in 2025 and increases to 6 per cent by 2030”, she opined.

“Across the Asia-Pacific region, we’re also seeing strong policy signals and emerging targets on SAF. Japan is exploring a 10 per cent SAF share by 2030 for departing flights, and Singapore is introducing a 1 per cent SAF target for 2026, which could rise to 3-5 per cent by 2030. South Korea and India are both considering a 1 per cent target for 2027. The trend is clear – countries worldwide see SAF as the best way to cut aviation emissions in the mid-term.

Meeting this demand will require significant scaling of SAF production – and demand is already outstripping supply. Current forecasts predict that by 2030, global demand for SAF will be around 15 million Mt, and by 2035, this looks set to reach 40 million Mt. In 2024, global SAF production was around 1 million Mt, with current predictions suggesting global capacity will only grow to around 18 million Mt by 2035. “

— Suzanne McKenzie, Sales Director, Lifecycle Oils, UK

“Venturing into Sustainable Aviation Fuel is not just about aligning India with the global targets under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation; it is about leading from the front,’’ mentioned Vijay Nirani, Managing Director, TruAlt Bioenergy. “Unlike countries such as Singapore or the UAE, where access to agricultural land is limited, India’s natural strengths in terms of vast agricultural base, give us the chance to turn this challenge into a defining advantage for our industry as well as environment,’’ he added.

Compared with peers—Brazil’s sugarcane focus, Southeast Asia’s palm reliance, Africa’s residue abundance but limited infrastructure—India uniquely combines biomass density, refining and engineering capability, and growing aviation demand. The task now is acceleration: Converting latent feedstock abundance into a globally competitive SAF industry, bridging the supply gap for the Global South.

” At TruAlt Bioenergy, we plan to establish a facility producing 10 crore litres of SAF annually, positioning us among the world’s largest ethanol-to-SAF producers. With CORSIA’s mandatory offsetting for international flights from 2027 and India’s 1 per cent SAF blending target, we are committed to scaling production capacity. Our ambition is to help India meet regulatory milestones while advancing sustainable aviation fuel adoption on a global scale.”

— Vijay Nirani, Managing Director, TruAlt Bioenergy

Policy Architecture and Industrial Capability: Laying the SAF Foundations

India’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) strategy exemplifies a rare convergence of policy precision and pragmatic precedent. Beginning with a 1 per cent blend in 2027 for international flights, rising to 2 per cent in 2028, these targets echo ethanol’s early E5 trajectory, signaling credibility to investors. With state-owned oil marketing companies—IOC, BPCL, and HPCL—underwriting demand, the sector gains sovereign-grade certainty in a capital-intensive space, translating policy intent into actionable investment confidence.

” The good news is: the demand is definitely there; however, the biggest challenge for SAF adoption is scaling—waste oils are limited, production costs remain high, and infrastructure isn’t yet built to handle wider adoption. Furthermore, governments and policy support worldwide is helping, with U.S. incentives, European reporting rules, and efforts in some countries in Asia to expand SAF production and adoption. Still, the gap between ambition and availability is a major challenge because there’s only so much used cooking oil that can go around, and much of it is already accounted for in other industries. “

— Justin Goldsberry, CEO and Founder of Goldsberry Management Group, LLC

Global compatibility forms the second pillar. By harmonizing BIS standards with ASTM International, HEFA, ATJ, and Fischer–Tropsch pathways gain immediate export legitimacy, while carbon accounting aligned with ICAO’s CORSIA ensures acceptance in Europe and the U.S. Without Western-style subsidies, India relies on engineering-led efficiency and procurement certainty—a model attractive to airlines wary of politically tethered supply chains. Catalytic finance, through NABARD credit, green bonds, or viability gap funding, remains essential to bridge upfront capital gaps.

Industrial capability provides the third lever. TruAlt Bioenergy’s planned 10-crore-litre SAF facility positions India among the world’s largest ethanol-to-jet producers. Praj’s Centers of Excellence and R&D hub, Praj Matrix, integrate innovation across the biofuels value chain. India’s EPC sector delivers biofuel plants at 20–30 per cent lower capex than Western peers, while startups like GPS Renewables provide blockchain-based feedstock traceability.

Together, these levers—demand certainty, global compatibility, and industrial depth—position India as the SAF systems integrator for the Global South, bridging domestic aviation growth with regional decarbonisation leadership.

Strategic Leveraging for India’s SAF Ascension

India’s ambition to become the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) hub for the Global South requires more than incremental moves. It demands flagship investments, diversified technologies, climate integration, and regional market creation. While blending mandates and pilot projects signal intent, the real inflection point lies in scaling multiple production pathways and leveraging India’s geopolitical position.

“There must be a way to cover both the upfront infrastructure costs and the ongoing operational expenses of producing sustainable aviation fuel. Globally, countries like the U.S. rely on a mix of loan programs, tax credits, and state-level incentives, even without a federal SAF mandate ”, mentioned Adam Klauber, VP Sustainability and Digital Supply Chain, World Energy. “India is taking a similar approach, combining national SAF blending targets with regional incentives—land subsidies and fuel tax relief—to encourage investment. But mandates alone aren’t enough; without enforceable penalties for underperformance, the sector risks stagnation. To move SAF from promise to scale, India must marry financial scaffolding with policy teeth, ensuring both capital and operational viability for producers across the ecosystem,” he added.

“Producing enough Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to power planes is no small feat. The biomass requirements are immense, and land-use concerns—like corn cultivation in the U.S.—cannot be ignored. Beyond CO₂, we must also account for the full spectrum of emissions when the fuel is burned. Derived from renewable or recycled sources such as oilseeds, algae, fats, and agricultural residues, SAF can cut carbon emissions by up to 70 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel. Blends range from 10 per cent to 50 per cent, and over 360,000 commercial flights have already operated on SAF across 46 airports, mostly in the U.S. and Europe.”

— Dr. Marcus Griswold, Founder, Little Green Myths

India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) annually by 2040, positioning the country to meet domestic demand and become a key exporter. The ICAO ACT-SAF feasibility study evaluates India’s capacity to produce drop-in SAF, examining feedstock availability, production pathways, infrastructure readiness, and policy frameworks, providing a roadmap suited to India’s socio-economic and environmental context. With over 750 million tonnes of biomass, including 230 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residues, India aims for phased blending of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030. The initiative is expected to cut 20–25 million tonnes of emissions annually and create new agricultural value chains.

Northern India alone burns over 50 million tonnes of crop residues annually, releasing 150 million tonnes of CO₂; redirecting even part of this into SAF creates a dual win for climate and energy security. A domestic SAF credit market aligned with ICAO’s CORSIA, coupled with EPC exports and technology licensing to Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, enhances South–South impact.

Startups like GPS Renewables strengthen sustainability traceability. With the National Green Hydrogen Mission targeting 5 million tonnes annually by 2030 and ultra-low solar tariffs (~$0.03/kWh), India could become competitive in e-SAF. Anchored by double-digit aviation growth and policy credibility, India is poised to emerge as the SAF hub of the Global South.",https://agrospectrumindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/India_SAF_Hub_Wallpaper.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:01:04.517218

A Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc), Petrobras, reached a historic milestone in October 2025. She became the first certified refinery in Brazil to produce and market sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) along the route HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). This information was officially released by Petrobras, which reinforces the the country's leading role in the global energy transition.

Furthermore, international recognition was only possible thanks to ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification – Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). This seal was granted after authorization from the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), issued on May of 2025. Thus, the Reduce consolidated itself as national pioneer in the route of air decarbonization, raising the Brazil to a new level of innovation and sustainability.

Petrobras is present in the global energy transition

With ISCC CORSIA certification, Reduce proved that your process follows strict sustainability and traceability standards. The refinery is now authorized to produce SAF with up to 1,2% renewable raw material. In addition, you can market up to 50 thousand cubic meters per month, equivalent to 10 thousand barrels per day.

The advancement is aligned with the Future Fuel Program, from Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), which provides for reduce 1% of aviation emissions by 2027, in accordance with the LANE, ICAO. According to director William França, the achievement reinforces the Petrobras' commitment to a fair and sustainable energy transition. He highlighted that the progress demonstrates the essential role of innovation and modernization in Brazilian refining, ensuring environmental efficiency and competitiveness.

Brazil anticipates demands and takes the lead in green aviation

Although the mandatory use of SAF on international flights start only in 2027, Petrobras got ahead of itself and put the Brazil at the forefront of sustainable fuels. This strategy demonstrates leadership, planning and environmental commitment.

O director Claudio Schlosser stated that the coprocessing from Reduc is a efficient and sustainable solution, strengthening the fair energy transition. He stressed that the approach shows how national industry can anticipate global demands, ensuring cleaner and more competitive aviation.

A Henrique Lage Refinery (Revap)On Sao Jose dos Campos (SP), also tested the co-processing of vegetable oil, expanding the SAF production and consolidating the Petrobras as a global reference in the sector.

Certification reinforces commitment to sustainability

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which creates new subsidies for SAF production, progresses to its next stage in Parliament. SAF is a ‘drop-in’ biofuel that is blended with conventional aviation fuel and used in aeroplanes without modification, to reduce the carbon emissions of flying.

By blending customers’ SAF into Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, the investment will boost green aviation fuel supplies to airports across southern England and Wales, including those at Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The company is also announcing that the facility will be the first of a new UK-wide network of SAF blending hubs it plans as part of its 2,000km pipeline network, creating a SAF Superhighway that will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to the jet fuel for 40% of flights leaving the UK’s airports.

Expected to be operational from 2026, the initial investment at Redcliffe Bay will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York a year, supporting the UK’s position as a global leader in green aviation.

The plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the UK and, in the case of Redcliffe Bay, south-west of England and southern Wales, by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when they become operational, which is expected later this decade.

Unblended SAF will initially be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock, before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. It will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel, to create the ready-to-use ‘drop-in’ fuel that is then distributed by Exolum’s national pipeline system.

The project includes several infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay, on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol. The plans include:

Conversion of existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.

Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.

Modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

Exolum North West Europe Lead, Stephen Land, said: ""Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the UK’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s world-leading position at the forefront of global sustainable aviation.

“The UK’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry.”

UK Department for Transport Aviation Minister, Keir Mather MP, said: “I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another major vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF Bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading.”

“We're also investing £63 million to support the production of homegrown SAF which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to UK flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the UK.""

Sadik Al Hassan MP, sustainable aviation champion and MP for North Somerset, said: “Exolum’s £4.5 million investment in their Redcliffe Bay facility marks a significant boost for North Somerset, helping support new technical jobs across the sustainable aviation supply chain in southwest England, whilst advancing the UK’s leadership in green aviation.

“Their vision for a sustainable aviation fuel ‘superhighway’ links delivery hubs to where the green fuel is needed most across the country, making the region more attractive for green investment in sustainable fuel production. It’s a clear signal that the green transition isn’t just possible but here.”

Dave Lees, CEO of Bristol Airport, said: “It’s fantastic to see this investment in our region, with blending facilities being a vital part of the future SAF supply chain that we need to decarbonise aviation. We’ve committed to working with our airline customers to meet the UK’s SAF mandate as part of our aim to be a net zero airport by 2050.”",,N,,2025-10-15 17:00:46.541145

Keir Mather promised that ticket prices will be “kept under continual review”, once the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill clears both Houses of Parliament.

MPs approved the draft new law at third reading in the Commons, and it faces further scrutiny in the Lords at a later date before it can become law.

The Bill paves the way for a new Government scheme to promote a “clear, predictable market price” for sustainable aviation fuels (Safs), by paying producers if Safs are sold for under a guaranteed “strike price”.

Where Safs are sold for above that price, the producers will pay back into the scheme.

It would be initially funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The Conservatives called for a legal duty on the scheme’s managers to report on its impact on passenger air fares.

Shadow transport minister Greg Smith told the Commons: “This has been one of the most contentious areas surrounding this Bill and indeed the Government’s whole approach to net zero – what does it actually cost real people?”

He added his proposed amendment to the Bill, which did not pass by 319 votes to 151, majority 168, would “give the Government the opportunity – that in theory they should cheerfully embrace – to lock in that which they profess to believe, namely that the provisions of this Bill will have a plus or indeed minus £1.50 impact on air fares”.

At the despatch box, Mr Mather said the Government “is committed to delivering value for money” in the scheme by “controlling both the scale and the number of contracts entered into, and through the prices negotiated in each contract”.

Sikander Rashid, Global Head of AI Infrastructure at Brookfield, said: “Behind-the-meter power solutions are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories.","Brookfield Asset Management and energy solutions provider Bloom Energy announced the launch of a new strategic partnership, including plans for Brookfield to invest up to $5 billion to deploy Bloom’s fuel cell technology across its global AI datacenters.

Founded in 2001, California-based Bloom Energy provides solutions for businesses and communities to meet energy demands through distributed generation of electricity and hydrogen. The company’s solutions include solid oxide fuel cells that provide lower-carbon power, producing electricity through an electrochemical process that combines hydrogen and oxygen.

According to the companies, the new agreement comes as power demand from AI data centers is anticipated to grow rapidly over the next few years, with fuel cells emerging as a key technology to address the increasing energy needs, with reliable, scalable and clean onsite power that can be rapidly deployed without legacy grids.

To date, Bloom Energy has deployed hundreds of megawatts of its fuel cell technology to data centers through partnerships with American Electric Power, Equinix, and Oracle.

KR Sridhar, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Bloom Energy, said:

“AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale. Unlike traditional factories, AI factories demand massive power, rapid deployment and real-time load responsiveness that legacy grids cannot support. The lean AI factory is achieved with power, infrastructure, and compute designed in sync from day one. That principle guides our collaboration with Brookfield to reimagine the data center of the future. Together, we are creating a new blueprint for powering AI at scale.”

Under the new partnership, Brookfield and Bloom Energy said that they are actively collaborating on the design and delivery of AI factories globally. The companies said that the partnership’s first site in Europe will be announced this year.

The new partnership marks Brookfield’s first investment under its dedicated AI Infrastructure strategy. The launch of the strategy was released recently by Brookfield in a letter to shareholders , with the firm calling AI infrastructure “ one of the defining investment themes of the decade,” combining three key megatrends, or the “three Ds,” Digitalization, Decarbonization, and Deglobalization.

Sikander Rashid, Global Head of AI Infrastructure at Brookfield, said:

“Behind-the-meter power solutions are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories. Bloom’s advanced fuel cell technology gives us the unique capability to design and construct modern AI factories with a holistic and innovative approach to power needs. As the world’s largest AI infrastructure investor, this partnership adds a powerful new tool to our global growth strategy, especially in a grid-constrained market environment.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bloom-Energy-fuel-cells.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 13:56:15.656455

Exolum is investing £4.5 million to establish the UK's first independent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending facility at Redcliffe Bay, south-west England. This facility is part of a broader plan to create a UK-wide network of SAF blending hubs.

Operational Timeline

The Redcliffe Bay facility is expected to be operational by 2026. It aims to support the greening of up to 64,741 flights annually, enhancing the UK's position in sustainable aviation.

SAF Supply Chain

Unblended SAF will be delivered by ships to Bristol's Royal Portbury Dock and then transported via pipeline to Redcliffe Bay. There, it will be blended with conventional aviation fuel to create a ready-to-use 'drop-in' fuel, which will be distributed through Exolum's national pipeline system.

SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

According to a recent report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), however, while SAF production is anticipated to double in 2025, it will still account for just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption.

South Korea’s new rules form the latest in a series of SAF mandates by jurisdictions globally, including the EU and UK, which each implemented a 2% SAF mandate beginning in 2025,

Under the new mandate, introduced by South Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), international departing flights from Korea in 2027 will be required to use fuel with a 1% SAF blend, with blend mandates increasing to 3–5% in 2030 and 7–10% in 2035. The specific ranges for 2030 and 2035 will be based on recent global market trends and domestic industry considerations.

While MOLIT and MOTIE said that will include penalties for non-compliance will be included in the new mandate, they will be initially deferred. Additionally, the mandate includes flexibility mechanisms allowing up to 20% of the total SAF-blended fuel supply requirement for a given year to be deferred and fulfilled within the following three years. New airlines will be exempt from the mandate in their first three years of commercial operation.

Fuels that will be recognized as SAF in the mandate will be those that have achieved the carbon reduction level required by international standards based on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and with bio-aviation fuel quality standards anticipated to be established in the first half of 2026.

According to South Korea’s Vice Minister for Transport KANG Hee-up, the new SAF mandate “represents Korea’s first step toward achieving carbon neutrality in international aviation, and will be remembered as a historic milestone that further elevates Korea’s status as the world’s eighth-largest air transport nation.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Airplane.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:01:17.298205

The airline plans to raise the SAF blend to 10% by 2030, aligning with its carbon neutrality goals.

Africa currently counts only five SAF projects, with a projected production capacity of 0.6 million tonnes by 2030.

Kenya Airways is expanding its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program as part of a strategy to reduce its carbon footprint and establish Kenya as a leading hub for green aviation in Africa.

According to Bloomberg, the airline launched on October 14 a series of four round-trip flights using a blend containing 2% SAF produced in Kenya. The first flight connected Nairobi and Paris, followed by routes to Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. The airline expects to complete the series by October 21.

Kenya Airways plans to progressively increase SAF usage to 10% by 2030, reinforcing its position as one of the frontrunners in Africa’s aviation energy transition. The carrier previously operated its first long-haul flight using SAF in 2023, sourcing the blend from Italy’s Eni SpA.

The company said the new initiative supports the global aviation industry’s target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and aims to promote energy self-sufficiency among African airlines.

Kenya Airways’ initiative also highlights the structural challenges facing the SAF industry in Africa. Only five projects are currently under development across the continent, with a combined projected production capacity of 0.6 million tonnes by 2030.

While Africa has abundant biomass and feedstock potential, a World Bank study stresses that efficient supply chain management remains crucial to ensuring consistent production and competitive pricing.

The report “Fueling Africa’s Flight: A Techno-Economic Assessment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa” notes that coordinated government support, international partnerships, and targeted investment in infrastructure and technology could enable Africa to emerge as a key player in the global SAF market.

Book and claim is a chain-of-custody model, in which the administrative record flow does not necessarily connect to the physical flow of material or product throughout the supply chain (ISO 22095:2020).

By leveraging the book and claim model, the Avelia platform aims to reduce the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) aviation emissions and enable greater participation in the sector’s decarbonisation efforts. The platform provides wider access to the GHG benefits of SAF across the aviation value chain.

This agreement supports Moeve’s Positive Motion strategy by promoting greater SAF adoption as the market evolves, helping to make it a more commercially viable solution for advancing the energy transition. ‘In a dynamic book and claim landscape, Avelia stands out as an initiative that has demonstrated real scale and credibility in accelerating SAF adoption. We are proud to join Avelia as its first strategic third-party SAF supplier and see this agreement as a key step in our ambition to lead aviation decarbonisation in Europe,’ says Carlos Barrasa, Moeve’s executive vice president for Commercial & Clean Energies.

Moeve is a leading SAF supplier in Spain, manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel at its La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva from used cooking oils, advancing the circular economy and supporting aviation decarbonisation. It is building a 2G biofuels facility in Huelva as part of a joint venture with the capacity to flexibly produce up to 500,000 tonnes of SAF and renewable diesel annually, and is targeting an overall annual SAF production capacity of 800,000 tonnes by 2030.

Avelia was launched in 2022 by Shell Aviation in collaboration with Amex Global Business Travel and Accenture, with support from the Energy Web Foundation (EWF). It offers a transparent, secure, credible and externally verified platform that helps businesses access the GHG benefits of SAF even when SAF is not physically available at their nearest location.

As of June 30 2025, Avelia helped inject over 41 million gallons of SAF into the existing fuel network at 17 airport injection point locations around the world, helping to abate over 370,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent. 57 corporations and airlines have made transactions through Avelia.

In July 2025, Avelia announced its evolution into a multi-supplier platform, helping users access the GHG benefits of SAF from multiple SAF suppliers including Shell. The integration of Moeve into the platform means that airlines, corporations, freight forwarders and shippers will now have broader SAF supplier choice, including Moeve and Shell.

The plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the U.K. and, in the case of Redcliffe Bay, South West England and southern Wales, by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when they become operational, which is expected later this decade.

Unblended SAF will initially be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline.

It will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel to create the ready-to-use drop-in fuel that is then distributed by Exolum’s national pipeline system.

The project includes several infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation-fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol.

The plans include:

Conversion of existing aviation-fuel storage tanks to handle SAF before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.

Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF-blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.

Modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

“Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the U.K.’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s world-leading position at the forefront of global sustainable aviation,” said Stephen Land, Exolum’s lead for Northwestern Europe. “The U.K.’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the U.K.’s sustainable fuels industry.”

Keir Mather, the U.K. Department for Transport’s aviation minister, added, “I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another major vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading. We’re also investing £63 million (USD$84 million) to support the production of homegrown SAF, which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to U.K. flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the U.K.”

1. Rise of renewables

Renewable energy has produced more electricity than coal for the first time, according to a report from energy think tank Ember.

Global electricity demand grew by 2.6% in the first half of 2025 – a rise that was more than met by increases in solar (+31%) and wind generation (+7.7%), the report says. With growth of 306 TWh – about the same amount of electricity that a country like Italy uses in a year – solar alone covered 83% of the increase in demand.

Coal generation, meanwhile, fell by 0.6%, leading to renewables’ share of global electricity rising 1.6 percentage points to 34.3%. Coal’s share fell by just over a percentage point to 33.1%.

Coal use and emissions fell in China and India as wind and solar met the growth in demand, the report adds. But its use grew in other major regions, with the European Union leaning on gas and coal to offset falls in hydro, bioenergy and wind generation and the US using more coal because clean sources did not rise enough to meet demand growth.

Concluding that the surge of solar and wind provides a “pivotal moment” to accelerate the energy transition, the report calls for governments to set ambitious targets and policies to speed up deployment of clean energy sources.

Emerging economies in particular, it says, still face barriers to renewables generation and need support from mature economies to overcome them.

The World Economic Forum's Coal to Clean platform works with energy, finance and civil society organizations to accelerate funding for the early retirement and repurposing of coal-fired power plants in emerging economies

2. Invest in grids and batteries - IEA

Amid the surge in solar, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) has highlighted the need to address supply chain and grid challenges.

In an announcement accompanying the agency’s Renewables 2025 report, Fatih Birol said that, driven by low costs and faster timeframes for permits, solar PV is on course to account for about 80% of the increase in the world’s renewable capacity until the end of this decade.

As renewables’ role in power systems increases in many countries, policy-makers “need to pay close attention to supply chain security and grid integration challenges,” he said.

The rapid rise of renewables is putting increasing pressure on electricity systems, the report notes, and with curtailment and negative price events appearing in more markets, it calls for urgent investment in grids, energy storage and flexible generation.

The report lowers its overall renewable energy growth forecast for 2025-2030 by 5% compared to last year to reflect policy, regulatory and market changes.

The report underscores the need to ensure power systems are flexible, resilient and sustainable – these will be the ""backbone of future economies"", according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Power Systems initiative.

The initiative works with a diverse range of stakeholders to drive the partnerships, strategies and innovations that will support future demand.

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which creates new subsidies for SAF production, progresses to its next stage in Parliament. SAF is a ‘drop-in’ biofuel that is blended with conventional aviation fuel and used in aeroplanes without modification, to reduce the carbon emissions of flying.

By blending customers’ SAF into Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, the investment will boost green aviation fuel supplies to airports across southern England and Wales, including those at Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The company is also announcing that the facility will be the first of a new UK-wide network of SAF blending hubs it plans as part of its 2,000km pipeline network, creating a SAF Superhighway that will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to the jet fuel for 40% of flights leaving the UK’s airports.

Expected to be operational from 2026, the initial investment at Redcliffe Bay will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York a year, supporting the UK’s position as a global leader in green aviation.

The plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the UK and, in the case of Redcliffe Bay, south-west of England and southern Wales, by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when they become operational, which is expected later this decade.

Unblended SAF will initially be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock, before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. It will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel, to create the ready-to-use ‘drop-in’ fuel that is then distributed by Exolum’s national pipeline system.

The project includes several infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay, on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol. The plans include:

Conversion of existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.

Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.

Modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

Exolum North West Europe Lead, Stephen Land, says: “Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the UK’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s world-leading position at the forefront of global sustainable aviation.

“The UK’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry.”

UK Department for Transport Aviation Minister, Keir Mather MP, says: “I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another major vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF Bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading.”

“We’re also investing £63 million to support the production of homegrown SAF which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to UK flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the UK.”

Sadik Al Hassan MP, sustainable aviation champion and MP for North Somerset, says: “Exolum’s £4.5 million investment in their Redcliffe Bay facility marks a significant boost for North Somerset, helping support new technical jobs across the sustainable aviation supply chain in southwest England, whilst advancing the UK’s leadership in green aviation.

“Their vision for a sustainable aviation fuel ‘superhighway’ links delivery hubs to where the green fuel is needed most across the country, making the region more attractive for green investment in sustainable fuel production.

The interisland flights are Hawaiʻi’s biggest transportation carbon producer.
It’s going to take years, Green said, before technology exists to use electric aircraft to replace traditional planes for interisland flights.
It can reduce carbon emissions by 50%-80% when blended with standard aviation fuel, she said.
“I think across the airline industry, we are aligned that scaling the supply of cost-competitive, sustainable aviation fuel is going to be the key to addressing aviation carbon emissions,” James said.","Rylee Brooke Kamahele helped forge a landmark legal settlement requiring Hawai‘i to eliminate carbon emissions from the state’s transportation system in the next 20 years, including cars on all islands, ships and airplanes used for interisland flights.

Now, Kamahele and other plaintiffs in the historic Navahine settlement are pushing back against a major element of the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation’s plan for reaching the goal. The issue: the department’s proposal to use what’s known as sustainable aviation fuel or SAF— essentially the airplane equivalent of biodiesel — for interisland flights.

The department’s proposed plan to use the fuel aligns with the view of the aviation industry and fuel producers — as well as a local grower of oily plants that can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel — that SAF is the most practical choice to reduce emissions.

But the plaintiffs have a different view.

“The bottom line is to be completely carbon or 100% emission free by 2045: that’s just the bottom line,” said Kamahele, a 17-year-old activist, entrepreneur and actor from Mililani.

SAF, she said, is “not 100% carbon free, which is what we’re looking for.”

An alternative solution: “I’m very interested in fully electric planes,” she said.

The Department of Transportation says that’s not an option.

For zero-emission airplanes to replace jet fuel in 20 years, the department says, “there would need to be a very fast scale-up of electric battery aircraft technology for larger jets” carrying at least 100 passengers.

Given the nascent nature of electric aircraft, the department expects that by 2045, electric planes could make up only 10% of interisland flights.

The impasse underscores the challenge Hawaiʻi faces as it tries to keep the promises it made to the young plaintiffs.

Major Source Of Emissions

It’s one thing to electrify cars, trucks and boats and charge them using wind and solar power. Airplanes are different. Electric airplanes exist, but experts say they’re not big enough to transport the thousands of people who fly between Hawaiʻi’s islands each day.

The interisland flights are Hawaiʻi’s biggest transportation carbon producer. They make up more than half of all emissions related to civilian transportation in Hawaiʻi — and about 30% more than all forms of ground transportation combined.

Jeff Mikulina, a renewable energy consultant who helped craft Hawaiʻi’s energy policy, said the aviation component is “the biggest crux of this zero emissions goal.”

He said SAF is an attractive interim solution but the state needs to work toward electric planes while it pivots to SAF.

“Electrification of airplanes is going to be a winner,” he said.

Gov. Josh Green is less sanguine about electric planes.

In an interview, Green praised the young plaintiffs but said not all proposed solutions can meet what he called a “purity test.”

“This is a long game, when we’re talking about climate change, the Navahine settlement,” he said.

It’s going to take years, Green said, before technology exists to use electric aircraft to replace traditional planes for interisland flights.

“It’s going to have to be a lot of partners, and the young people are going to now be going to engineering school,” Green said, “and they’re going to come back, and they’re going to realize that these are not simple solutions.”

Final Plan To Be Released Wednesday

The state’s aviation challenge dates back to 2022, when a dozen teenagers, including Kamahele, sued the state Department of Transportation and then-Gov. David Ige, citing their state constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.

They were represented by lawyers from Earthjustice’s Hawaiʻi office and Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based nonprofit organization that brings climate change suits on behalf of young people.

The complaint included allegations that climate change was damaging the lives of each of the plaintiffs. It also noted how a previously mandated zero emissions transportation target required the Department of Transportation to “take any actions necessary” to achieve zero emissions across all transportation modes, including interisland flights.

The plaintiffs argued the state was headed in the opposite direction.

Green settled in June 2024, essentially requiring the state to follow the law. The settlement lays out interim targets for 2030, 2035 and 2040 to ensure the state eliminates all emissions from transportation by 2045.

In June, the department issued a draft plan for how it would meet the milestones and sought public comments.

The final plan is expected to be released Wednesday. The department declined interview requests for this story.

The plan will likely include responses from the department to comments from Earthjustice and Our Children’s Trust. A fundamental flaw, the plaintiffs say, is the plan’s repeated reference to “net-zero emissions.” That would allow cars, boats and planes to continue generating carbon and for the state to offset the emissions by doing things like planting trees.

Kamahele noted the statute requires “real zero” emissions, not net zero.

“Net zero means that we just keep burning fossil fuels and we hide it with offsets,” she said. “That doesn’t protect future generations.

Settlement Envisions SAF As Interim Solution

The use of SAF is another issue.

The settlement actually envisions using SAF to meet the interim targets. It says the Department of Transportation must, “Support adoption by private stakeholders of zero emissions vehicles, sustainable aviation fuel, and other technologies.”

But the plaintiffs don’t see it as a long-term solution.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel (‘SAF’) is often made from corn ethanol, which increases carbon dioxide, air pollution, consumes a significant amount of land area, and must be shipped to Hawaiʻi, and is thus a non-solution for zero emissions transportation,” Earthjustice and Our Children’s Trust wrote in response to the department’s plan.

In addition, they wrote, the plan calls for the continued use of SAF well past 2045. The idea that zero-emission planes will make up only 10% of interisland flights by 2045 is “contrary to the Navahine Settlement, which commits to 100% zero emissions for interisland flights by 2045.”

Airline industry experts say there’s no other practical option.

Alana James is the sustainability innovation director for Alaska and Hawaiian airlines. The airline industry’s goal, she says, is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050; Alaska Air Group, which includes Hawaiian, is aiming for 2040.

The plan includes operating more efficiently, using next-generation airplanes and using carbon offsets.

But SAF is the most promising technology, James said. It can reduce carbon emissions by 50%-80% when blended with standard aviation fuel, she said. Plus, it’s ready to use now: airlines are already using SAF blends with existing engines and infrastructure.

One problem is capacity. There’s not that much SAF being produced. Alaska has agreements to buy SAF from West Coast refineries but still only consumed about 1% of its total aviation fuel from SAF last year, James said.

Another issue is price. SAF costs two to five times what conventional jet fuel costs. James couldn’t say what that would mean for someone traveling from, say, Oʻahu to Maui. But she estimated using SAF blends would mean a 25% increase in fuel prices, which would significantly impact ticket prices.

“I think across the airline industry, we are aligned that scaling the supply of cost-competitive, sustainable aviation fuel is going to be the key to addressing aviation carbon emissions,” James said.

Plan Calls For SAF Production Incentive

A key to driving down costs is support from state and federal taxpayers, similar to other green energies like solar, James said.

“SAF is going to require incentives to help reduce that cost gap to conventional fuels,” she said.

States like Washington, Minnesota and Illinois offer tax credits to support SAF. While the Hawaiʻi Legislature has yet to get on board, part of the Department of Transportation’s proposed plan is to create a SAF tax credit.

The bottom line: SAF will cost Hawaiʻi residents, in the form of tax incentives or higher interisland plane fares.

Hawaiʻi’s only refinery, Par Hawaii, already is betting big on SAF. In July, Par Hawaii announced a deal with Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation contributed $100 million for a 35.6% stake in a new joint venture, Hawaii Renewables, focused on producing renewable fuels at Par Pacific’s Kapolei refinery. By the end of this year, Hawaii Renewables expects to be able to produce 61 million gallons of SAF and other renewable fuels.

“We are slowly getting off the ground,” said Par Hawaii’s president, Eric Wright. “We do still have a long way to go.”

Par Hawaii is also working with Pono Pacific, a land conservation company that wants to ramp up production of a plant called camelina, whose oily seeds can be processed into SAF. The idea is to grow at least some SAF feedstock in Hawaiʻi rather than importing it.

“For the state to meet its goals, we’re really going to have to all work together on this,” Wright said.

Electric airplanes aren’t an option, James of Hawaiian Airlines, said.

Hawaiian now flies about 150 interisland flights with 128-seat airplanes. Current electric airplanes aren’t nearly that big.

Hawaiian has made an equity investment in REGENT Craft Inc., developer of what it calls an all-electric Seaglider, designed to fly on a cushion of air just above the ocean’s surface. The company says it has raised more than $90 million from other big-name investors, including Japan Airlines, Mesa Air Group, Thiel Capital, Mark Cuban and Lockheed Martin, and has orders for more than 600 Seagliders valued at more than $9 billion.

The company is targeting its 12-passenger plane, which is regulated as a maritime vessel, to enter service in 2026 or 2027 and a larger 50- to 100-passenger plane by the end of the decade.

Such technology is promising, James said, but added, “It’s going to take time before they’re going to really be able to make a dent” in reducing carbon emissions for interisland flights.

For the plaintiffs, meanwhile, SAF also won’t fly.

“It pollutes when you grow it,” Kamahele said. “It pollutes when you refine it. It pollutes again when you ship it to get to Hawai‘i, and then when you burn it here in Hawai‘i, it pollutes even more. Hawai‘i deserves real clean energy, not greenwashing.”

Exolum invests in UK’s first independent SAF blending facility

10:11 am

Uncategorized

Exolum, a European energy logistics company, will invest £4.5 million in a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending facility. The site will be located at Redcliffe Bay in south-west England. It marks the start of a national network of SAF blending hubs across the UK.

Supporting the UK’s Green Aviation Goals

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill moves ahead in Parliament. The Bill introduces new incentives for SAF production. It also supports the aviation sector’s shift towards lower emissions. SAF blends with standard jet fuel and works in aircraft without modification. Therefore, airlines can cut emissions without costly changes.

Expanding Clean Fuel Access

By blending customers’ SAF into its aviation fuel network, Exolum will supply greener fuel to key airports. These include Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff. As a result, the company will help the UK lead in clean aviation.

Building a SAF Superhighway

The Redcliffe Bay facility is the first in a series of planned blending hubs. Together, these sites will form a “SAF Superhighway” within Exolum’s 2,000km pipeline system. The network will give producers and importers direct market access. It will also provide sustainable jet fuel for about 40% of UK flights.

Driving Sustainable Growth

The facility is due to open in 2026. When operational, it could fuel up to 64,700 London–New York flights a year. The project will attract new investment in regional SAF production across south-west England and southern Wales.

Modern Infrastructure and Upgrades

Initially, unblended SAF will arrive by ship at Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock. It will then move by pipeline to Redcliffe Bay. There, it will be stored, blended and distributed nationwide. Exolum will also upgrade existing tanks, install advanced blending systems and add new pumps and filters.

Powering a Cleaner Future

With this investment, Exolum strengthens its commitment to sustainable aviation. Step by step, the company is building the infrastructure that will drive the UK’s transition to cleaner, greener energy.

In line with the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate ramping up to 10% by 2030, the new facility at Redcliffe Bay is part of wider plans for a UK-wide network of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending hubs.
Exolum’s UK fuel pipeline network currently delivers fuel to four out of 10 flights departing the UK each year.
The SAF will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel to create a drop-in fuel distributed by Exolum’s pipeline system.
“The vision for a sustainable aviation fuel ‘superhighway’ links delivery hubs to where the green fuel is needed most across the country, making the region more attractive for green investment in sustainable fuel production.","The blending facility at Redcliffe Bay in south-west England is expected to be operational from 2026.

Energy logistics company Exolum’s GBP4.5 million investment will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York. In line with the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate ramping up to 10% by 2030, the new facility at Redcliffe Bay is part of wider plans for a UK-wide network of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending hubs.

The Redcliffe Bay facility will be the first of multiple SAF blending hubs Exolum is planning as part of its 2,000km pipeline network, creating a SAF Superhighway to provide producers and importers with access to the jet fuel for 40% of flights leaving the UK’s airports.

Exolum’s UK fuel pipeline network currently delivers fuel to four out of 10 flights departing the UK each year. It delivers fuel for all flights from Stansted and Manchester Airports, around half of the flights from Gatwick and around a third of the flights from Heathrow. It also provides fuel supplies via road tankers for various regional airports, including Bristol, Exeter, Newquay and Cardiff.

The GBP4.5 million investment will, according to Exolum North West Europe Lead, Stephen Land, help turn the UK’s ambitions for greener flights into reality.

“The UK’s twin commitment to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry,” Land said.

The energy logistic firm’s plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the UK by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when the plants become operational.

For the Redcliffe Bay facility on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol, unblended SAF will be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock, before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. The SAF will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel to create a drop-in fuel distributed by Exolum’s pipeline system.

Plans to upgrade Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay include converting the existing storage tanks to handle SAF, installing a state-of-the-art blending infrastructure, and modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

Dave Lees, CEO of Bristol Airport said: “It’s fantastic to see this investment in our region, with blending facilities being a vital part of the future SAF supply chain that we need to decarbonise aviation. We’ve committed to working with our airline customers to meet the UK’s SAF mandate as part of our aim to be a net zero airport by 2050.”

He was joined by Sadik Al Hassan MP sustainable aviation champion and MP for North Somerset, who noted that the GBP4.5 million investment “marks a significant boost for North Somerset.” He underlined it will support employment across the region’s sustainable aviation supply chain.

“The vision for a sustainable aviation fuel ‘superhighway’ links delivery hubs to where the green fuel is needed most across the country, making the region more attractive for green investment in sustainable fuel production.

A: Airport operators and concessionaires can use the report’s insights to embrace technology, streamline operations, and foster collaboration.","ICF's Aviation team recently released two reports for the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP): a Framework and Tools for Incorporating Technologies into Airport In-Terminal Concessions Programs and the supplemental Incorporating Technologies into Airport In-Terminal Concessions Programs - A Primer.

In the light of the increase in the use of technology in airport concessions programs, the main report is a practical guide for airport operators looking to deliver an advanced retail experience for their passengers. It highlights new and innovative technologies that airports and concessionaires are using enhance their relationships with the airport passenger. The report also offers insights into evaluating, selecting, and implementing technology to enhance customer experience, operational efficiency, and revenue generation. The Primer is a self-assessment tool, which provides a technical report for airport operators on the research effort.

We caught up with Tod Yankee, senior manager, global aviation commercial advisory, to find out more about key insights from the reports.

Q: If you had to summarize the reports’ biggest takeaway, what would it be?

A: Airports must treat technology as a core driver of passenger experience and revenue in concessions. This requires a holistic, data-driven, and collaborative approach that aligns digital innovation with evolving traveler expectations.

For airports where innovation is not a key element of their organizational culture, consider taking a “blue sky” approach. That means challenging the idea of what is possible without being encumbered with seemingly insurmountable constraints, as these can often be overcome with creativity and vision.

Q: Why is now the right time for airport operators to rethink the role of technology in their concessions strategy?

A: The convergence of new traveler behaviors, rapid innovations in technology, and rising competition means airports must act now to make technology a core part of their concessions strategy. Remember that your customer may be traveling through several other airports on their journey and experiencing what those airports offer.

Also, keep in mind that your airport is what passengers experience first when they arrive in your city or region and what they remember last when they leave. How can you leverage innovation to make sure that your customers’ impressions are favorable and positively memorable? Happy airport passengers spend more, so don’t risk being left behind.

Q: How does the new framework help airports move from concept to implementation?

A: The framework turns high-level ideas into actionable roadmaps, ensuring technology adoption is realistic, scalable, and aligned with each airport’s unique needs and goals.

Q: Can you share an example of how one of the featured airports successfully applied the framework?

A: Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) used processes similar to the framework’s principles. First aligning its innovation strategy with airport-wide business goals, then establishing a dedicated Innovation Division, they used cross-functional teams to pilot and scale new technologies like self-serve kiosks, mobile ordering, and “Just Walk Out” stores.

By collecting and analyzing sales and operational data (as recommended in the framework’s self-assessment tool), DFW was able to benchmark performance, optimize concession operations, and continuously improve both passenger experience and revenue—illustrating how the framework can turn high-level concepts into measurable, real-world results.

Q: How can airport operators and concessionaires navigate the changing landscape and position themselves for success?

A: Airport operators and concessionaires can use the report’s insights to embrace technology, streamline operations, and foster collaboration. This will help them stay competitive in a rapidly evolving industry by boosting efficiency, net revenues, passenger experience, and employee satisfaction.",https://www.icf.com/-/media/images/icf/insights/aviation/2025/9/advanced-retail-experiences-airports/acrp-aviation-reports-2025-icf-social-1200px.jpg?rev=e09b3008f8e84e0698c8b6d8a3d9eef6,N,,2025-10-15 08:01:08.617384

Paes Leme noted that these fuels can be used to replace planet-harming fossil fuels in sectors such as aviation, maritime transport, or the cement and steel industries.
Sustainable fuels are already used in these industries ""but they are not produced in sufficient quantities,"" he said.
The commitment to sustainable fuels ""is something we love to hear,"" said Francesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
For the first time, the world pledged to ""transition away"" from fossil fuels at COP28 in Dubai in 2023.","Brazil, India, Italy and Japan vowed Tuesday to quadruple their production and consumption of renewable fuels, hoping other countries will join the pledge during UN climate talks in November.

""We hope to have a good number of signatories"" by COP30, Brazilian foreign ministry official Joao Marcos Paes Leme told reporters in the capital Brasilia.

""Other European countries are also interested,"" he added.

Paes Leme was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of representatives from 67 countries in the run up to COP30 climate talks in the Amazon city of Belem next month.

The pledge involves quadrupling the production of sustainable fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen and some synthetic fuels by 2035, compared to 2024 levels.

Paes Leme noted that these fuels can be used to replace planet-harming fossil fuels in sectors such as aviation, maritime transport, or the cement and steel industries.

""These are sectors where decarbonization is difficult,"" because electrical energy has not yet succeeded in replacing fossil fuels.

Sustainable fuels are already used in these industries ""but they are not produced in sufficient quantities,"" he said.

The massive use of coal, oil, and fossil gas for energy since the industrial revolution is the primary driver of human-induced global warming.

The commitment to sustainable fuels ""is something we love to hear,"" said Francesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

However, he warned that some biofuels can be harmful due to the vast expanses of land required to produce raw materials such as sugarcane, soy, or corn.

""We have to be serious about what we say, sustainable fuel also means sustainable from the perspective of land use.""

For the first time, the world pledged to ""transition away"" from fossil fuels at COP28 in Dubai in 2023.

However many of the largest fossil-fuel producing nations—including Brazil—are planning to increase production in the coming years.

All investments involve risk, and not all risks are suitable for every investor. The value of securities may fluctuate and as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. The past performance of a security, or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk, it does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a down market. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities or other financial products. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.

Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. Margin trading increases risk of loss and includes the possibility of a forced sale if account equity drops below required levels. Margin is not available in all account types. Margin trading privileges are subject to Webull Financial, LLC review and approval. Leverage carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Greater leverage creates greater losses in the event of adverse market movements.

According to Airlines for Europe (A4E), which represents chief executives operating in the European aviation sector, airlines currently face high surcharges and limited price transparency, making large-scale SAF adoption impractical.

‘Derisk investment’

‘The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) must derisk investment in SAF production and bring down the cost of SAF,’ the group said in a statement.

‘Europe needs a market intermediary for SAF, more multi-year SAF allowances, a simple book-and-claim system, EU ETS revenues reinvested, and a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)-like mechanism, to reduce carbon leakage, fairly distributing SAF costs between EU and non-EU airlines – real tools to fast-track aviation’s decarbonisation.’

A4E added that the Fit for 55 package and SAF mandates in their current form ‘disproportionately increase’ the cost of flying through EU hubs and to EU destinations, as well as driving traffic, jobs, and, notably, emissions, to other global markets.

The group added that while European airlines are ‘committed’ to decarbonisation, this should not come at the cost of competitiveness, or accessible air travel.

‘Sober up’

Elsewhere, airline CEOs said that both the EU and national governments need to ‘sober up’ to the current geopolitical reality, given the importance of the sector to Europe’s economy – contributing over 4% of GDP and supporting more than 12 million jobs.

As they noted, industrial action in one member state – such as the recent air traffic controller strikes in France – can impact flights right across the bloc.

To prevent future disruptions, A4E called on EU leaders to ‘rewrite the script – require mandatory arbitration before a strike is even called, set a 21-day advance notice for any industrial action, protect overflights while ensuring local departures and arrivals are not impacted, and guarantee a right of redress for airlines.’

The CEOs also criticised what they called ‘unrealistic’ rules on delay compensation and cabin baggage, that ‘fail to serve passenger priorities or operational realities’.

Summit has been working for several years to develop a CO2 pipeline project that would span areas in South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and North Dakota, capturing CO2 produced at dozens of partnering ethanol plants and transporting it to North Dakota for secure geologic sequestration.
That facility, known as Gevo North Dakota, has operational CCS capabilities onsite.
Documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate Gevo and the DOE LPO are now considering altering the conditional commitment to support the proposed North Dakota SAF project.
“The conditional commitment will remain effective during the extension period in order to allow for modifications which satisfy the DOE LPO.","Gevo Inc. on Oct. 14 announced the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office has granted the company an extension of the conditional commitment for the $1.46 billion loan guarantee for its proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project.

Gevo in October 2024 received a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee with disbursements totaling $1.46 billion (excluding capitalized interest during construction) from the DOE for its proposed Net-Zero 1 project (NZ1) in South Dakota.

The proposed NZ1 project is an alcohol-to-jet biorefinery located near Preston, South Dakota, that was expected to produce 60 MMgy of SAF. During a second quarter earnings call held in August, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber said the NZ1 project is “plugging along, albeit slowly.” The development timeline for the project has been impacted by delays associated with Summit Carbon Solution’s proposed carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project.

Summit has been working for several years to develop a CO2 pipeline project that would span areas in South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and North Dakota, capturing CO2 produced at dozens of partnering ethanol plants and transporting it to North Dakota for secure geologic sequestration. Gevo’s NZ1 facility is among the facilities slated to be connected to the CCS system.

Development of the CCS project has been delayed by legal and permitting difficulties, including state-level legislation preventing the project from utilizing eminent domain to secure the pipeline route.

In South Dakota, Gov. Larry Rhoden in March signed a bill that aims to prevent the use of eminent domain for the development of CO2 pipelines, specifically targeting Summit’s proposed project. The following month, state’s Public Utilities Commission denied Summit’s pipeline application. Summit has signaled its intent to refile.

During Gevo’s second quarter earnings call, Gruber noted the company was continuing to work with the DOE and customers regarding the development of NZ1 and is waiting to see what happens with the Summit pipeline. In the meantime, Gruber said Gevo was shifting its resources and prioritizing the development of a 30 MMgy ethanol-to-jet project at its recently acquired corn ethanol plant in North Dakota. That facility, known as Gevo North Dakota, has operational CCS capabilities onsite. Documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate Gevo and the DOE LPO are now considering altering the conditional commitment to support the proposed North Dakota SAF project.

In an Oct. 14 filing made with the SEC, Gevo said it received a letter from the DOE LPO on Oct. 8 granting an extension of the conditional commitment until April 16, 2026. “The extension allows the company and DOE LPO to evaluate potential modifications to the project scope under the conditional commitment in order to address energy policies and priorities,” the company said in the SEC filing. “The conditional commitment will remain effective during the extension period in order to allow for modifications which satisfy the DOE LPO. The potential scope modifications include the construction of a lower cost 30 million gallon per year jet fuel production facility (ATJ-30) to develop jet fuel production at the company's existing ethanol and carbon capture utilization and storage facility in North Dakota and the optimal use of captured carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/epm/posts/web/2019/11/GevoLogoBigger_15729967454727.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 03:56:27.765178

The company has expedited work at the site now that employees, who had been detained last month, have returned to their duties, effectively ending the brief suspension of on-site operations. According to the report, LG Energy Solution staff and partner employees returned to work on Tuesday after a month-long paid leave, which coincided with the Chuseok holidays.

“The launch of our Toowoomba Terminal is the start of our plans to deliver [decarbonisation] benefits and meet the aviation sector’s growing demand through flexible, efficient and scalable SAF blending,” said Matt Doyle, CEO of Wagner Sustainable Fuels, in a statement on Wednesday.

“With the support from Boeing, we’re focused on bringing large scale SAF and renewable diesel production to Australia and integrating it into the global supply chain through the Brisbane Recycling and SAF Facility, which is currently under planning and development.”

SAF is made from oil derived from renewable sources, such as municipal solid waste, agricultural byproducts and vegetable oils. It has been identified as a way for the aviation industry to operate with lower greenhouse gas emissions.

Wagner said the facility makes use of FlyORO’s AlphaLite technology and support from aerospace company Boeing.

FlyORO’s website states that its machinery is housed in a 40-foot container, able to provide up to 2,160,000 litres of blended fuel per day, and can enable blends “of any single D7566 fuel with Jet A1” at up to a 50 per cent blend of SAF to jet fuel.

“Current global regulations permit commercial aircraft to use up to a 50/50 blend of SAF and fossil jet fuel. This will continue to rise as additional production pathways are certified,” added Boeing’s head of Asia Pacific Sustainability, Dr Kimberly Camrass.

“Wagner’s commercial blending terminal is a powerful step forward in aviation decarbonisation, boosting regional employment and opening new export markets. It will also provide important learnings to support the development of robust and scalable SAF supply chains within Australia.”

The announcement added Wagner has also become the nation’s first first RSB (Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials) certified SAF company.

Boeing announced in August last year that it had become an early investor in the sustainable aviation fuels division of the Wagner group, which also owns Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport.

The 2023 Boeing/CSIRO SAF Roadmap identified opportunities to develop a domestic SAF industry as well as the investment required in R&D to support emerging technologies. It predicted that jet fuel demand will grow by 75 per cent by 2050.

As reported by this title and others last year, Wagner, Boeing and others are partnered on a feasibility study on SAF production facility in Brisbane, with $760,000 support from the state government.

The Brisbane plant would use LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process, converting ethanol from waste-based feedstocks, and with a planned capacity of 102 million litres of SAF and 12 million litres of renewable diesel per year.

The terminal, powered by FlyORO’s proprietary patented technology, is not only a first for Australia, but also the world’s first SAF blending terminal located at an airport.
Additionally, Wagner Sustainable Fuels has achieved another milestone by becoming Australia’s first Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) certified SAF company.
“This is a pivotal moment for sustainable aviation in Australia and demonstrates Wagner Sustainable Fuels’ commitment to addressing future challenges with solutions available today,” said Matt Doyle, CEO of Wagner Sustainable Fuels.
We are excited to partner with Wagner Sustainable Fuels and Boeing to lead the way in building a more sustainable aviation ecosystem in Australia.”","Wagner Sustainable Fuels has officially launched operations at Australia’s first dedicated Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending terminal, marking a significant step forward in the aviation and renewable energy sectors. In collaboration with Boeing [NYSE:BA] and technology partner FlyORO, the facility is set to play a key role in advancing sustainable aviation in the region.

The terminal, powered by FlyORO’s proprietary patented technology, is not only a first for Australia, but also the world’s first SAF blending terminal located at an airport. Its modular design allows it to scale with rising demand, making it replicable as the SAF industry continues to grow in Australia and across the Asia Pacific.

Additionally, Wagner Sustainable Fuels has achieved another milestone by becoming Australia’s first Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) certified SAF company. This certification ensures that customers benefit from a robust accounting process that guarantees SAF authenticity and chain-of-custody transparency.

“This is a pivotal moment for sustainable aviation in Australia and demonstrates Wagner Sustainable Fuels’ commitment to addressing future challenges with solutions available today,” said Matt Doyle, CEO of Wagner Sustainable Fuels. “The opening of the Toowoomba Terminal marks the beginning of our plans to deliver decarbonization benefits and meet the aviation sector’s increasing demand with flexible, efficient, and scalable SAF blending.”

Doyle added, “With support from Boeing, we’re focused on large-scale SAF and renewable diesel production in Australia, which will be integrated into the global supply chain through the Brisbane Recycling and SAF Facility, currently in the planning phase.”

Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or non-fossil fuel sources such as municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, animal fats, and vegetable oils. It significantly lowers carbon emissions throughout the fuel’s lifecycle, making it a more sustainable option for powering aircraft.

SAF blending involves mixing “neat” SAF with conventional fossil jet fuel, which, after testing and certification, becomes a drop-in aviation fuel that is compatible with current airport and aircraft infrastructure.

“Current global regulations allow commercial aircraft to use up to a 50/50 blend of SAF and fossil jet fuel, with this percentage set to increase as additional production pathways are approved,” said Dr. Kimberly Camrass, Boeing’s Head of Asia Pacific Sustainability.

Dr. Camrass further noted, “Wagner’s commercial blending terminal is a major step forward in the decarbonization of aviation, creating regional job opportunities and opening new export markets. It will also provide valuable insights to help build a resilient and scalable SAF supply chain in Australia.”

The Boeing-CSIRO SAF Roadmap forecasts a 75% increase in jet fuel demand in Australia by 2050. To meet this demand, Wagner Sustainable Fuels has partnered with FlyORO to deploy advanced SAF blending technologies for commercial, general aviation, and defense sectors in Australia.

“FlyORO’s modular SAF blending system, AlphaLite, doesn’t just reduce emissions – it creates a scalable platform for collaboration, co-investment, and transparency across the fuel value chain,” said Jonathan Yeo, CEO of FlyORO. “This integrated model supports our broader deployment strategy, which includes standalone facilities like the one operating in Singapore.”

Yeo added, “This is how we unlock speed and scale in the SAF sector. We are excited to partner with Wagner Sustainable Fuels and Boeing to lead the way in building a more sustainable aviation ecosystem in Australia.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Aircraft-refueling-at-Wellcamp-Airport-Toowoomba-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 03:57:02.839780

According to Dr Kimberly Camrass, Boeing’s head of Asia Pacific Sustainability, the new plant is a step towards fulfilling the 2023 Boeing/CSIRO SAF Roadmap, which identified Australia as being in a “prime position” to develop a domestic SAF industry and predicted a 75 per cent increase in jet fuel demand in Australia by 2050.

“Current global regulations permit commercial aircraft to use up to a 50/50 blend of SAF and fossil jet fuel. This will continue to rise as additional production pathways are certified,” she said.

“Wagner’s commercial blending terminal is a powerful step forward in aviation decarbonisation, boosting regional employment and opening new export markets.

“It will also provide important learnings to support the development of robust and scalable SAF supply chains within Australia.”

The news comes as Wagner is also partnering with Boeing to build what it says is Australia’s first fully integrated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in Brisbane.

The project last year secured $760,000 in Queensland government funding, and aims to start construction in 2026. It will use LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology to create ethanol-based fuel, with the expectation of 102 million litres of SAF per year.

Wagner says the SAF produced at its Brisbane facility will “integrate seamlessly with existing airline infrastructure and meet rigorous fuel standards”.

It was an outstanding event in a new venue covering many topics and providing meaningful networking opportunities. In case you missed it, among the important takeaways, here are four of interest:

1. E15 legislation is a top priority in Congress. We have put great effort into the bipartisan bill to allow retailers to sell E15 year-round in all parts of the country, and Congress seems to have finally gotten the memo, which means the grassroots advocacy we have mobilized is paying off. During his keynote, Congressman Dusty Johnson (R-SD) thanked ACE for our advocacy and said there is “more than a 70% likelihood” this legislation will pass. We like those odds but implore you to keep Congress’s feet to the fire by using our online Action Center to send messages and make calls! There is also increasing pressure on Congress and the Trump administration to provide emergency financial aid to help farmers facing uncertain export markets, low prices, large crop surpluses and high input costs. What cannot be lost in this discussion is E15 year-round provides a market-based, long-term solution to increase domestic demand for corn, so we must finally get E15 legislation over the finish line in 2025.

2. 45Z buzz is real, yet clarity is needed. A big thank you is owed to the outstanding panel of experts from RSM, Christianson, and Mickelson & Company who provided valuable insight on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit during our conference. These companies explained the changes Congress made to 45Z and helped our ethanol companies make plans to maximize returns on investment. Hallway discussions during our event were almost entirely about 45Z. While there is significant enthusiasm, we still do not have final guidance for the credit, Treasury has said they do not expect to put out a proposed rulemaking until next year, and there’s no clarity on whether low-carbon farming practices can be used to help monetize 45Z. Therefore, we must remain vigilant in urging Treasury to speed up the proposed rulemaking and final guidance, and keep working to ensure low-carbon farming practices can be monetized through 45Z. This remains a top priority for ACE.

3. RFS blending volumes send strong signal for 2026 and 2027, but small refinery exemption (SRE) reallocation questions remain. The original RFS was signed into law 20 years ago and, despite some mismanagement from various administrations, it remains a bedrock for ensuring ethanol production and use in the U.S. The Trump administration deserves credit for proposing strong blending volumes for the 2026 and 2027 calendar years, including a minimum of 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuel and big increases for advanced biofuel and biomass-based diesel—which will help ensure excess supplies of these renewable fuels do not displace opportunities for E15, E30 and E85.

Despite strong RFS blending targets, questions linger about SREs. EPA is trying to follow caselaw from prior SRE litigation to work through a significant backlog of SRE petitions and decide whether exempt gallons will be reallocated to future years. The first Trump EPA allowed dozens of SREs without reallocating those blending volumes to other refiners, which caused RIN values to fall and reduced the incentive to blend E15 and E85. This time around, they are proposing to reallocate most or all of the SREs to future RFS blending targets, which is a very positive sign, but final decisions about the new approach to SREs and reallocation have not been made.

4. Sioux Falls’ homefield advantage. This was the first conference we have hosted in Sioux Falls in more than 20 years, and based on the overwhelming positive feedback we received from attendees, rest assured, Sioux Falls will become part of our regular rotation for conference sites.

Summit has been working for several years to develop a CO2 pipeline project that would span areas in South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and North Dakota, capturing CO2 produced at dozen’s of partnering ethanol plants and transporting it to North Dakota for secure geologic sequestration.
That facility, known as Gevo North Dakota, has an operational CCS capabilities onsite.
Documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate Gevo and the DOE LPO are now considering altering the conditional commitment to support the proposed North Dakota SAF project.
“The conditional commitment will remain effective during the extension period in order to allow for modifications which satisfy the DOE LPO.","Gevo Inc. on Oct. 14 announced the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office has granted the company an extension of the conditional commitment for the $1.46 loan guarantee for its proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project.

Gevo in October 2024 received a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee with disbursements totaling $1.46 billion (excluding capitalized interest during construction) from the DOE for its proposed Net-Zero 1 project (NZ1) in South Dakota.

The proposed NZ1 project is an alcohol-to-jet biorefinery located near Preston, South Dakota, that was expected to produce 60 MMgy of SAF. During a second quarter earnings call held in August, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber said the NZ1 project is “plugging along, albeit slowly.” The development timeline for the project has been impacted by delays associated with Summit Carbon Solution’s proposed carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project.

Summit has been working for several years to develop a CO2 pipeline project that would span areas in South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and North Dakota, capturing CO2 produced at dozen’s of partnering ethanol plants and transporting it to North Dakota for secure geologic sequestration. Gevo’s NZ1 facility is among the facilities slated to be connected to the CCS system.

Development of the CCS project has been delayed by legal and permitting difficulties, including state-level legislation preventing the project from utilizing eminent domain to secure the pipeline route.

In South Dakota, Gov. Larry Rhoden in March signed a bill that aims to prevent the use of eminent domain for the development of CO2 pipelines, specifically targeting Summit’s proposed project. The following month, state’s Public Utilities Commission denied Summit’s pipeline application. Summit has signaled its intent to refile.

During Gevo’s second quarter earnings call, Gruber noted the company was continuing to work with the DOE and customers regarding the development of NZ1 and is waiting to see what happens with the Summit pipeline. In the meantime, Gruber said Gevo was shifting its resources and prioritizing the development of a 30 MMgy ethanol-to-jet project at its recently acquired corn ethanol plant in North Dakota. That facility, known as Gevo North Dakota, has an operational CCS capabilities onsite. Documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate Gevo and the DOE LPO are now considering altering the conditional commitment to support the proposed North Dakota SAF project.

In an Oct. 14 filing made with the SEC Gevo said it received a letter from the DOE LPO on Oct. 8 granting an extension of the conditional commitment until April 16, 2026. “The extension allows the company and DOE LPO to evaluate potential modifications to the project scope under the conditional commitment in order to address energy policies and priorities,” the company said in the SEC filing. “The conditional commitment will remain effective during the extension period in order to allow for modifications which satisfy the DOE LPO. The potential scope modifications include the construction of a lower cost 30 million gallon per year jet fuel production facility (ATJ-30) to develop jet fuel production at the company's existing ethanol and carbon capture utilization and storage facility in North Dakota and the optimal use of captured carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2017/11/GevoLogo_15101793359557.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 20:56:51.363746

We’re going to redefine the category – we call it private class. It’ll be all the benefits of flying private: amazing cabins, concierge service, everything from black cars to great meals on board. It’ll be a privilege to fly again as opposed to a nuisance.”

“Magnifica Air is pioneering a new space between private aviation and first-class commercial travel,” added Wade Black, CEO. “We combine the privacy and intimacy of a private jet with the cultural relevance and operational scope of a world-class airline.

The Massachusetts Port Authority proposal, which has faced years of opposition, would expand the Lawrence G. Hanscom Field located between Bedford, Lexington and Concord by adding 17 new hangars. The publicly-owned airfield holds the most private jets in New England, and an October 2023 report found private jets from the field accounted for an estimated 106,676 tons of carbon emissions over an 18-month period.

Activists on Tuesday aired concerns about increased carbon emissions from private jets that serve the wealthy. They drew attention to a Massachusetts Sustainable Aviation Fuel Workgroup report, which recommended that the state advance the implementation of SAF, a type of jet fuel made from renewable sources.

The working group report suggests that SAF has “the potential to dramatically reduce life cycle aviation emissions … and avoid indirect impacts on forests and croplands.” It also recommends creating a Massachusetts and New England Regional SAF Hub “to secure buy-in from key stakeholders, facilitate information sharing, and identify priority short- and long-term initiatives that build SAF momentum.”

But a new report from the D.C.-based think tank Institute for Policy Studies claims that utilizing SAF in this project or others will not help Massachusetts reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is not a “feasible” way to reduce emissions at scale.

“SAF won’t help the Commonwealth reduce emissions. Period. It will not scale at the pace of climate change. It is a diversion of money and attention in this moment,” Chuck Collins, co-author of the think tank’s report, said Tuesday.

“Hypothetical future use of SAF should not serve as a green light for expanding aviation. We find that SAF solutions provide minimal or negative greenhouse gas reductions,” the report says. It calls studying SAF “logical” but suggests “proposals to drive production or consumption of SAF through economic policy or subsidies do not make financial sense, as SAF currently and for the foreseeable future increases GHG emissions.”

Massport maintains that the renewable fuel “represents one of the most immediate and effective tools available today to reduce aviation’s climate impact and enable emission reductions without compromising reliability or safety.”

The agency is “committed to reducing aviation-related emissions and promoting more sustainable practices across all our facilities, including Hanscom Field,” Massport said in a statement to the News Service. “We understand there are a range of opinions, and we’re committed to continuing the conversation with our neighbors to find the right balance between environmental goals, airport operations, and economic growth.”

Lincoln resident Alex Chatfield criticized the focus on SAF in the midst of opposition to the Hanscom project.

“If Massport thinks that we will be distracted by the supposedly bright, shiny object of SAFs and accept the North Airfield project, because someday, a few decades from now, some highly expensive and still environmentally damaging but differently produced fuel is being sold there, they have badly underestimated our determination to stop this project,” Chatfield said.

Secretary of Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper in 2024 rejected a draft environmental impact report filed by Runway Realty Ventures and North Airfield Ventures to expand the Hanscom airfield. The developers are expected to submit a supplemental draft environmental impact report to address environmental and community impacts and concerns by the end of the year, Chatfield said.

“There is no way you can put in a whole bunch of essentially garages for private jets and still claim ever again, at least in the living memory of those of us in the room, to be concerned about climate. This is it. This is the inflection point for Massport,” Sen. Michael Barrett said during a State House briefing.

“The same in some ways is true for the Legislature and executive branch, also. It is going to be very, very difficult for your elected officials to make the case that we prioritize fighting climate [change] if this particular deal goes down,” Barrett continued.

Activists on Tuesday delivered another letter to Healey calling on her to put a stop to the project, after conservation and historic preservation groups delivered a different letter and petition to her in April.

Barrett recalled the decision of former Gov. Frank Sargent in the 1970s to reject the Inner Belt project, which Barrett said would have decimated neighborhoods in Somerville, Cambridge and Boston.

“Sargent took a look at that seeming inevitability and said, ‘Not on my watch – that is a bad decision. I’m thinking about the future, and I can see that this would get it wrong,'” Barrett said. “So we’re asking our current governor, who’s done so much good work on other issues, to appreciate that there is a precedent for her saying just, ‘No, not on my watch.'”

A petition created by the Stop Private Jet Expansion at Hanscom or Anywhere group, which calls on Healey to stop the expansion plans, has more than 14,500 signatures.

“It’s a matter of political will,” Rep. Carmine Gentile said. “Massachusetts has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. How can we take that goal seriously if we greenlight projects like this? We can’t,” Gentile said. “How can we tell working families to switch to electric cars, to insulate their homes, take the T while letting the ultra rich burn jet fuel to [take] quick flights to the Caribbean? That would be a moral failure.”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Barrett-Michael-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 18:56:42.909689

The Avioxx team joined more than 450,000 attendees in Lisbon this month for the World Aviation Festival 2026, one of the leading global events for aviation and innovation. The three-day gathering brought together sustainability directors, policymakers, and pioneering technology start-ups focused on AI-driven waste and fuel solutions.

A Focus on Sustainability and Innovation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and decarbonisation dominated the agenda throughout the festival. From keynote sessions to fireside discussions, industry leaders explored how aviation can meet rising demand for air travel while achieving Net Zero targets.

Glenn Morgan, Chief Technology Officer at IAG, reinforced the airline group’s commitment to decarbonising aviation and scaling sustainable fuel adoption, urging the sector to move from ambition to action.

Faith Taylor, Global Sustainability and Social Impact Officer at Kyndryl, delivered a resonant message:

“If we build with vision, integrity and sustainability in mind, we will reach Net Zero goals.”

She emphasised the critical role of renewable fuels such as SAF in making the sustainability transition both achievable and enduring.

Financing and Scaling Real Sustainability

Avioxx attended the panel discussion “How are we financing and scaling real, measurable sustainability in aviation right now?” where Nichola Bates, founder of XeleratedFifty, spoke about innovative funding models needed to connect legacy systems with the emerging green economy. She stressed that progress will depend on collaboration across industries rather than any single solution.

At Avioxx, innovation is at the core of this mission. The company’s patented waste-to-fuel technology provides a tangible solution to the challenge of SAF availability, helping aviation meet Net Zero mandates.

Lukas Kaestner, Chief Development Officer at ZAL, reminded attendees of the sector’s resilience and ingenuity:

“We have always been an industry that succeeds in making the impossible possible.”

That sentiment aligns with Avioxx’s vision. By producing aircraft fuel from non-recyclable waste, the company addresses global waste management challenges while cutting carbon emissions.

Scaling SAF for Net Zero

During the session “Scaling SAF and Practical Decarbonisation Strategies for Net Zero”, Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Officer at IAG, noted that while SAF supply could meet demand, production costs which are currently around three times higher than fossil jet fuel, remain a major barrier to widespread use.

Avioxx is tackling this head-on. Its ultra-clean SAF burns efficiently without creating contrails and performs on par with, or better than, traditional jet fuel. When produced at scale, it becomes cost-comparable with fossil alternatives. Fully renewable and sustainably sourced, Avioxx SAF has the potential to replace fossil fuels entirely.

As Dick Benschop, Chair of the Mission Possible Partnership, observed:

“Who knows that every flight they are sitting on already includes 2% SAF? It’s happening, but people seem unaware.”

Avioxx shares this conviction. Greater public awareness and transparency are essential to accelerating the transition to sustainable aviation. The change is already underway, and Avioxx’s technology is helping to make it possible.

Avioxx’s Role in a Cleaner, Circular Future

Avioxx’s waste-to-molecule technology not only produces cleaner, more efficient jet fuel but also diverts significant volumes of waste from landfill and incineration. By turning waste into value, the company supports the UK and global aviation industries in progressing towards Net Zero.

With SAF mandates coming into force and penalties for non-compliance on the horizon, now is the time to invest and scale.

The Avioxx 32,000 TPA SAF Plant

To meet growing demand, Avioxx has unveiled plans for its 32,000 tonne-per-year SAF plant, the company’s largest to date. Once operational, it will divert more than 300,000 tonnes of waste annually from landfill and incineration, converting it into sustainable jet fuel to power the next generation of low-carbon flights.

With strong airline partnerships, cutting-edge technology, and a clear strategy for growth, Avioxx is demonstrating that the transition to sustainable aviation is not only achievable but already happening.

October 9, 2025

Check against delivery

Good morning everyone.

Let me begin by thanking the NATO Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence for hosting us here in Montreal and inviting me to speak.

Thanks also to CDAI for co-hosting this wonderful event.

I’m so sorry to not be able to join you in person, but it’s a great privilege to be able address you virtually this morning.

The work that you do —your research, and your leadership in addressing the defence and security impact on climate change – has never been more important.

I am just shy of six months as Canada’s Minister of National Defence, just under a year serving as a cabinet Minister and just over 21 years serving as a Member of Parliament.

But before all of that – I spent years working on sustainability and climate change around the world, and previously served as President of Canada’s National Round Table on the Economy and the Environment.

So in a sense, today is an intersection of the last 40 years of my life – where national security meets natural security.

As Minister of National Defence, I know it is critical that we deter the effects of climate change to support operational readiness of the Canadian Armed Forces, community needs, and, by extension, our national security.

This can save lives, and deter an adversary who wishes to harm us.

When it comes to nature and the systems that sustain us — our wetlands, our waterways, pollination — there is no substitute.

Our security and our prosperity are fully dependent on a healthy and functioning environment — think of it as a three-legged stool that must be kept in balance.

And that balance is, lately, getting harder to achieve.

Our international system based on shared rules and norms is under strain.

War rages in Ukraine, instability persists throughout the Middle East, and tensions are simmering in the Indo-Pacific.

And our adversaries are active across a multitude of domains — cyber, space, quantum, artificial intelligence and the information space, too.

Every day there are new reports of Russian incursions into NATO airspace and of our approaches being tested.

At the same time, China is displaying increasingly aggressive behaviour toward its neighbours, as well as toward other countries with a presence in the Indo-Pacific, including Canada.

Amplifying all of these challenges right now is climate change — a threat multiplier that’s driving insecurity across the globe.

Against this backdrop, Canada and its Allies need to ensure our militaries are resilient and ready.

This means future-proofing our military by adapting to climate change and mitigating its impacts on our operations.

It also means working to ensure our actions don’t make it worse.

The changing climate has profound implications for National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces.

It poses a threat to all Canadians, especially Indigenous and Northern communities, and for our Allies.

It directly affects how our countries train, equip, deploy and operate. And nowhere is that clearer than in energy.

Fuels and energy are the lifeblood of any military.

Without secure supply chains at risk from climate disruption, fleets cannot move, bases cannot function, and operations cannot be sustained.

That’s why climate resilience isn’t just environmental policy — it’s operational policy.

It’s force readiness.

And it’s national security strategy, too.

At National Defence, we have already begun to integrate climate risk into our planning and operations.

In 2024, we completed a Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment across our real property footprint.

The results were sobering: 64% of our assets are at a high climate risk, especially in our coastal and northern regions.

That’s why we’re strengthening energy resilience in our bases and infrastructure, ensuring that new construction accounts for sea-level rise, flooding and permafrost thaw.

National Defence is the largest federal emitter of greenhouse gases, and we recognize that achieving our targets will be crucial in order for our government to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

Already, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 38% since 2005.

DND is implementing measures to reduce emissions in its real property portfolio.

To do so, we are using energy performance contracts, purchasing clean energy, modernizing heating systems, decommissioning old buildings, and improving our energy management approach.

For nearly two decades, we’ve been working on research into alternative fuels.

Today, we are pursuing low-carbon fuels that meet military requirements — fuels that will help secure our military fuel supply chain, strengthen interoperability with our Allies, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our primary military fleets.

For example, the Royal Canadian Air Force has a net-zero plan for its air platforms — and sustainable aviation fuel is at the heart of that plan.

Until then, we are preparing our fleets for the day when sustainable fuels will become the norm. And we will get there.

And, as the framework nation for the NATO Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence, Canada is proudly hosting this key venue right here in Montreal.

Here, Allies and partners can share expertise, develop best practices, and strengthen our ability to confront the security impacts of climate change.

All this work shows that we are indeed capable of adapting and mitigating.

That we can future-proof ourselves as strategically as possible.

But adaptation and mitigation alone are not enough.

If we stop here, we are only treating the symptoms.

To truly safeguard Canada’s future, all our futures, it’s time to stop the fiction that

our planet’s carrying capacity is unlimited.

That we are not seeing stressors, that species aren’t being depleted and rendered extinct, that we’re not compromising the plant’s ability to restore itself.

Because when it comes to nature, there is no substitute.

Natural capital provides essential services — clean air, fresh water, fertile soils, flood control, climate regulation, pollination — without which, our life on this planet is impossible.

This natural capital also provides valuable products — medicines like penicillin and codeine, and technologies inspired by the natural world, like Velcro from burrs, and aircraft from bird flight.

By not protecting this critical wealth of natural capacity and the potential it promises, we run the risk of degrading or depleting altogether solutions to the defence and medical challenges of the future.

We cannot manage and sustain this critical resource, nature, if we don’t know how to measure it. Or even know how much of it we have.

We have a geological survey in Canada – but no biological survey.

There are encouraging developments: for example, Canada’s Water Agency is creating a new national water security strategy.

Yet here in Canada, we still don’t have a national survey or measure for our natural capital.

What is pollination worth to food sovereignty?

What is watershed integrity worth to clean water?

If we don’t answer these questions, we leave blind spots in our security planning.

And that is why the work we do here — to integrate climate, economy and security — must also integrate the environment.

In defence, innovation has always been about staying one step ahead of our adversaries.

Today, that increasingly means drawing lessons from the oldest and wisest systems of all: nature’s own designs.

Harnessing nature’s solutions is not just science — it’s strategy.

It’s how we keep our forces interoperable, resilient and effective in the future fight.

Bioprospecting and biomimicry aren’t just fancy buzzwords.

These are the next level of strategic advantage.

And nations that preserve their biodiversity and draw from their design will have decisive options.

We don’t have to look very far to see that artificial intelligence is accelerating this process.

It’s allowing us to design new materials and systems at speeds we never imagined:

think of wildfire suppression technology using satellites, AI, and a fleet of specialized drones.

We are already deploying some nature-based innovations in the form of scalable, dual-use infrastructure with natural or engineered features.

Everything from wetlands to reefs and barrier beaches that mimic ecological processes designed to reduce the risk of coastal flooding and erosion, while supporting biodiversity and local communities.

In fact, much of our economic activity is already financed by the “DNA Bank of Nature” — 500 million years of evolution, on deposit.

But you can’t manage what you don’t measure.

Nowhere is this issue more evident than in our Arctic.

Canada’s sovereignty and security in the region are non-negotiable.

And yet they are under increasing threat.

An Arctic warming at four times the global average means more access — and more interest—from competitors and adversaries alike.

That has significant security and sovereignty implications for Canada.

But defending the Arctic mustn’t come at the expense of the very environment we’re trying to protect.

Our Arctic ecosystems are fragile.

Sea ice is melting, making the North more navigable and vulnerable to intrusion.

Permafrost is thawing, threatening communities and critical infrastructure.

Ocean coastline is exposed for longer and eroding faster, placing at risk communities, cultural heritage and wildlife habitats.

If we treat the Arctic as a disposable resource, we risk undermining the very foundations of Canadian sovereignty.

This sovereignty relies on strengthening partnerships and effective management with territorial and municipal governments, Indigenous and northern communities and organizations, as well as other partners and stakeholders.

That’s why we need to think of this country’s natural capital like we do a retirement pension: we want to live off the interest and sustain the capital, not deplete it.

We need to balance development, national security and ecological integrity.

Have strength through sustainability.

Protect nature as a form of deterrence.

In military strategy, deterrence is about preventing harm before it happens.

We build credible defences not because we want to use them, but to avoid the devastating costs of conflict.

The same principle must apply to climate security.

Protecting and reinvesting in nature is a form of deterrence.

Where natural ecosystems are under strain, displacement and conflict are inevitable.

Water scarcity is already wreaking havoc along the Yellow River in China, Asia’s second-longest river; and it’s driving tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia along the Blue Nile.

Climate disasters alone displaced some 800,000 people in 2023, and some experts now predict up to 1.2 billion so-called climate refugees by 2050, those displaced by climate change and natural disasters.

In 2023, Canada saw 192,000 people internally displaced due to climate disasters like wildfires. This is the highest number ever recorded.

This puts a strain on the operational capability of the Canadian Armed Forces, which are increasingly called upon to respond to natural disasters as a force of last resort.

We are fortunate to have the necessary resources to respond, keep people safe, and protect critical infrastructure.

But this isn’t always the case in other parts of the world.

Disaster and ecological collapse fuel instability, as surely as an aggressor crossing a border.

That’s why I believe measuring our natural capital and protecting natural systems is also about preventing loss of life on a massive scale.

This is neither theoretical nor abstract for me.

In the 1980s, I was stationed for two years with the United Nations in Côte d’Ivoire.

In the nearby Sahel Region, I got to see the effects of desertification and soil collapse firsthand.

In hindsight, one can see how thousands of young men with no hope for a better future might be drawn into the ranks of extremist groups that provide money, camaraderie and purpose.

Today, we have groups like Boko Haram terrorizing communities in northern Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad.

In this conflict zone alone, 60,000 people have already paid with their lives.

This lesson is clear: if we don’t slow or reverse the effects of climate change, the bill will be paid in ever-increasing human suffering and insecurity.

My friends, in the defence and security domain, we invest in preparedness because it saves lives.

We build credible deterrence because prevention is always less costly than conflict.

I believe the same logic must apply to climate and nature.

Investing and restoring in our ecosystems and natural capital is strategic preparedness.

It is national defence.

And it’s natural security.

In the end, something is only worth defending if we can ensure there will always be something left to defend.

So, I’ll say it again.

We can replace equipment, we can rebuild infrastructure, we can resupply our forces dealing with the next climate disaster.

But we can’t replace nature — there is no substitute.

Our national and natural security are inextricably linked.

Priester Aviation as a partner in its program that enables private jet flyers to offset aircraft emissions associated with climate change.

George J. Priester Aviation’s clients may opt in on their own to participate in the program.

Director of Marketing Madison Priester says, “We believe that leadership in aviation means not only providing exceptional service, but also being responsible stewards of our environment.”

She adds, “Partnering with 4AIR allows us to give our clients meaningful options to offset and reduce their emissions today, while we work toward a more sustainable future for private aviation through the advancement of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.”

Clients can opt in to reduce their carbon footprint from flight activity by using verified carbon offsets, with the option to support Sustainable Aviation Fuel coming in the near future.

Each carbon offset corresponds to a verified reduction or avoidance of one metric ton of carbon dioxide, supported by projects that meet strict criteria and standards.

As the most viable near-term solution to reducing aviation emissions, SAF reduces the lifecycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel, thereby significantly reducing the sector’s direct emissions.

4AIR’s sustainability programs, specifically tailored for business aviation, allow users to support science-based, independently verified emissions-reduction projects worldwide.

The partnership with 4AIR extends across George J. Priester Aviation’s full range of services, including aircraft management, charter, and jet card programs.

This means that every client, whether they own, operate, or charter aircraft through the Priester family of companies, can take part in meaningful sustainability initiatives.

Participants can choose to offset the carbon impact of their flights or contribute to advancing SAF production, ensuring that responsible environmental stewardship is available to all types of private aviation users.

Short supply of new planes means that airlines are keeping older models flying – leading to estimated costs of $11 billion in 2025. The primary factors are excess fuel costs from using older, less efficient craft ($4.2 billion); additional maintenance cost of using older craft ($2.6 billion); increased engine leasing cost from engines spending more time on the ground during maintenance ($2.6 billion); and surplus inventory holding costs from stocking more parts due to supply chain uncertainty ($1.4 billion).

Additionally, supply chain issues are preventing airlines from deploying a sufficient amount of vehicles to meet passenger demand. In 2024, passenger demand rose 10.4% while capacity expansion was only 8.7% – and the rising passenger demand trend is expected to continue in 2025.

Oliver Wyman says the aerospace industry can take several actions to tackle its supply chain problems. These actions include supporting maintenance, repair, and operations (MROs) firms to be less dependent on OEM-driven commercial licensing models; enhancing supply chain visibility to spot risks early and reduce bottlenecks; using data to drive predictive maintenance and create maintenance platforms for optimizing inventory; expanding repair and parts capacity to speed up repair approvals; and adopting advanced manufacturing to ease bottlenecks.

LONDON (Reuters) -Chief executives of Europe's airlines called for more European Union support to increase the supply of green jet fuel and improve subsidies for its creation.

The EU began requiring airlines to use more sustainable aviation fuel this year, with a 2% minimum blending mandate set to rise to 6% by 2030.

""We have mandates but we don't have sustainable aviation fuel,"" said Luis Gallego, CEO of IAG, at a press conference for trade group Airlines for Europe on Tuesday.

The group includes the CEOs of Ryanair, easyJet, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways-owner IAG.

The CEOs said they wanted more help from the European Commission in creating a functioning SAF market as well as higher subsidies to encourage the production of the fuel.

As it stands, SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel.

""If SAF was the same price as jet fuel, we wouldn't need mandates,"" said easyJet CEO Kenton Jarvis.

Textron Aviation has four Cessna Citation jets at the static display, including the Ascend, Longitude, Latitude and CJ4 Gen2.

A mock-up of the Citation CJ3 Gen 3 – development of which was announced at last year’s NBAA show, along with “Gen 3” variants of the M2 and CJ4 platforms – is also at the static display.

In the hall, Textron Aviation is presenting a half-shell interior mock-up of the CJ3 Gen3, which is positioned to enter service in 2027.

Most notable is the debut of Ascend, with an example of the mid-sized jet landing at Henderson Executive airport in the morning on 13 October.

Ascend’s certification is imminent, Textron Aviation chief executive Ron Draper says on 13 October, describing the end of the process as “this close”, holding up a small gap between his thumb and forefinger.

Draper adds that the US federal government shutdown is not holding up certification of the Ascend, which has logged some 1,000 test-flight hours. Textron Aviation is a “document or two” away from the finish line.

Cessna recently rolled the first production example of the Ascend off its line in Wichita. The jet is a refresh of the company’s “XL” line, with upgrades going well beyond surface level.

“The Citation Ascend will be all-new interior, all-new cockpit, and even the engines have had technology inserted into them,” Draper says. “We’re thrilled that this will be certified soon.”

Textron Aviation is hopeful that Ascend’s certification will come shortly after revealing on 13 October that it has secured FAA certification of the Citation CJ3 Gen 2 and M2 Gen 2.

Certification of the M2 Gen2 comes after Textron Aviation completed nearly 300 test-flight hours with the FAA. The light jet variant comes with Garmin’s Autothrottle system as a standard feature, providing protection from engine exceedance incidents and reducing pilot workloads.

The airframer says that the Autothrottle system “supports the most-delivered light-entry jet’s capabilities by optimising engine power, simpliflying flight-management and increasing overall operating efficiency”.

Textron Aviation put the CJ3 Gen2 – the larger of the two light jets – through about 445 test-flight hours prior to clearing the final certification hurdle. The variant also integrates Garmin’s Autothrottle and, incorporating customer feedback, provides a bit more legroom for pilots as part of ”enhancements throughout the aircraft”.

REGULATORY AND CERTIFICATION CHALLENGES

Civil aviation regulators in Europe and North America have made “positive movements” in recent months, but Draper would like to see aircraft certification become less time-consuming. He recalls the “deep freeze” on moving products through certification during the Covid-19 pandemic and notes that, relative to those lows, aircraft certification processes “are back moving again”.

For example, Textron Aviation recently received FAA certification for advanced features of the Garmin G5000 avionics suite, including a synthetic vision guidance system, improved connectivity and a taxiway routing feature.

But the manufacturer’s only in-certification clean-sheet aircraft, Beechcraft’s single-engined Denali, has faced repeated delays, with certification of GE Aerospace’s Catalyst turboprop engine holding up the process. GE Aerospace finally cleared that hurdle in February, providing Denali with both an engine and a certification pathway.

That aircraft will compete for market share mainly against the Pilatus PC-12, with Denali seating four passengers in an executive configuration and up to nine passengers in a commuter configuration.

Textron Aviation now expects to secure type certification of Denali in 2026.

“There are some cases where they still need to move faster, and they’re working on that,” Draper says. “Sometimes, that is a resource issue with EASA or the FAA, [where] they’re one or two experts deep in a particular area.”

However, regulators recognise areas where they are thin and are “heading in the right direction”, Draper says.

“The FAA, I know they’ve been bashed a lot the past five years,” he says. “We can throw rocks at them over specifics – why is this taking so long, or that taking so long? I do see them listening and trying to react, so that’s not keeping me up at night.”

Draper says Textron Aviation is weighing in on the rapid changes underway at EASA and the FAA, pointing specifically to the USA’s air traffic control overhaul.

“We’re lending our voice to that, as well as continuing to push for speed and common sense in certain aircraft certifications and bilateral agreements,” Draper adds. “How do we get the FAA and EASA and all the other regulatory bodies around the world, how do we get them honouring bilaterals?”

Currently, Textron Aviation faces headwinds from getting products certificated country by country, a years-long process that holds up the rollout of new aircraft platforms, such as the Cessna SkyCourier utility aircraft. Draper would like regulators to smooth out those processes.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/1/1/113211_ascend_985706.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:57:10.636355

While fuel suppliers are responsible for providing fuel with the progressively stronger blends of SAF at airports, airlines are obliged to purchase the available fuel for their operations.

Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said that oil suppliers selling SAF were able to ""extract additional profit from airlines by charging these compliance surcharges,"" adding that this should prompt European regulators to eliminate the mandates.

""They have, in effect, facilitated price gouging by fuel suppliers in the name of the environment, and that's completely unacceptable,"" Walsh said.

Walsh did not specify which airlines had been impacted or which fuel suppliers were involved in price hikes.

SAF costs on average three to five times more than regular jet fuel.

Industry association FuelsEurope said there had been a ""significant and consistent decline of average SAF prices,"" citing third-party pricing data from Argus Media.

Energy companies have said they are not seeing enough demand for SAF to justify ramping up production, which some executives say is weighing on prices rather than driving them up. Several have scaled back SAF refinery projects in recent years.

Walsh was speaking in an interview on a separate report by IATA setting out $11 B in extra costs in 2025 caused by congestion in other parts of the airline supply chain.

Responding, Ms Sun said the sustainable aviation fuel levy will be paid by different parties, including aircraft operators.

Conversely, simply mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel across the board would impose unpredictable and unsustainable costs on airlines and passengers, she added.","SINGAPORE – Singapore can now impose a fixed levy on all departing flights after Parliament passed a Bill on Oct 14 to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel by airlines.

Sustainable aviation fuel, mostly made from waste materials such as used cooking oil, has been deemed the

most practical way to decarbonise

the aviation industry as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without any costly modifications.

The Bill was passed unanimously.

Presenting the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill for debate, Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling said the proposed changes will allow the green jet fuel levy to be paid to the CAAS, which will set up a fund to procure and manage such fuel.

Noting that green jet fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel, she said Singapore has chosen a “pragmatic and balanced approach” in setting a target for sustainable aviation fuel to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi Airport and Seletar Airport in 2026.

Singapore will collect the funds needed to procure green jet fuel in an upfront manner through the levy.

Preliminary estimates from the CAAS

had suggested that economy-class passengers may incur an additional $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights, such as those to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.

MPs such as Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang West) and Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Changi GRC) asked about the impact of the levy, and reasons for passing the costs on to passengers through higher air ticket prices.

More specifically, Ms Poh asked why the cost burden is to be borne solely by consumers, instead of airlines.

Responding, Ms Sun said the sustainable aviation fuel levy will be paid by different parties, including aircraft operators. It is calculated based on the ultimate user of the air transport service, she added, so aircraft operators will be allowed to pass the levy on to end users such as passengers or shippers.

The amount of the green jet fuel levy that each end user has to pay will be displayed transparently, she said.

Certain flights will be exempted from the levy, such as those used for flight training and for charitable or humanitarian purposes, she added.

Addressing a question by Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), Ms Sun said passengers transiting or transferring through Singapore will not need to pay the sustainable aviation fuel levy.

She acknowledged that transit and transfer passengers are a critical part of air traffic through Changi Airport.

Although they do not start or end their journeys in Singapore, they enhance the nation’s connectivity by supporting a broader network of destinations and higher flight frequencies, she said.

Ms Sun added that the Government plans to ensure that Changi Airport remains competitive enough for these passengers to continue choosing to transit or transfer through Singapore, and hence will not impose the levy on them.

Several MPs, including Ms Gho Sze Kee (Mountbatten) and Mr Yip, asked about how the levy could potentially affect Changi Airport’s competitiveness as a global air hub.

Responding, Ms Sun said airlines and passengers fly through Changi Airport for various reasons, including safety, network and connectivity.

The Government will keep a close watch on Changi Airport’s charges and costs, she said, adding that it has calibrated its approach to adopting green jet fuel with “safeguards” to maintain the air hub’s competitiveness.

Ms Sun said the Government has consulted the industry and assessed that starting with a 1 per cent green jet fuel adoption target is “manageable”, and will not increase air ticket prices significantly.

Under this model, the total amount spent on sustainable aviation fuel each year will be pre-determined based on the usage target set and the projected cost of the fuel, she noted.

“We can decide how much cost we want to bear, and provide cost certainty for airlines and passengers,” said Ms Sun, who assured the MPs that Changi’s competitiveness would not be adversely impacted.

Conversely, simply mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel across the board would impose unpredictable and unsustainable costs on airlines and passengers, she added.

Responding to Mr Dennis Tan (Hougang) on possible greenwashing due to the use of certain feedstock in sustainable aviation fuel that may create external pollutants, Ms Sun said the green jet fuel procured will comply with the requirements set out by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

She added that the Economic Development Board has been in discussions with existing energy firms on retrofitting current refinery units, while research institutes are investing in technology that can advance biofuel production.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/588e03f28957c5ef712849602237c7fb65f937ca53b1072eb97bc9cb04a803fd,N,,2025-10-14 11:57:06.326922

The company filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida, 11th Circuit, last Thursday (October 9). Verijet, which had a fleet of single-engine Cirrus SF50 Vision Jets, ranked as the 13th-largest U.S. operator of charter and fractional flight hours at its peak in 2023, having only launched as a company three years prior.

The court documents, however, show that the company listed estimated assets between $1 million and $10 million, while facing debts of up to $50 million at the time of its bankruptcy filing.

He highlighted that expanding the number of countries exporting ethanol could help elevate it to a globally significant commodity, a goal that Brazil strongly supports.

“If there is surplus to export ethanol, it’s a good idea. I think that more countries exporting ethanol can make ethanol an important commodity throughout the world. And we want to promote ethanol as a world commodity. So for Brazil, it’s great news if this will happen,” he said in response to a question from ANI about India’s potential ethanol exports.

He emphasized the importance of promoting ethanol as a global commodity, encouraging more nations to participate in its trade. A commodity is typically a raw material that is traded globally, falling into categories such as hard commodities like crude oil and gold, and soft commodities like agricultural products such as wheat and coffee.

India and Brazil have been strengthening their collaboration in the bioenergy sector, particularly focusing on advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and meeting higher ethanol blending targets. Ambassador Haczynski da Nobrega noted that the partnership between the two countries has grown over the past few years as both align their clean energy goals.

“Our bilateral relations in terms of bioenergy have been booming now for some years,” he remarked during the 13th Bio-Energy Summit, which focused on “Fuelling India’s Green Revolution: Forging Global Partnerships.” He also pointed out that Brazil has been sharing its expertise on incorporating ethanol into gasoline mixtures and developing engines capable of running on 100% ethanol or various blends.

For the past five to six years, Brazil has actively contributed to India’s ethanol development, the Ambassador noted. He referenced the commitment made during Prime Minister Modi’s state visit to Brazil in July to further enhance this collaboration.

The Ambassador also discussed the role of the Global Biofuel Alliance (GBA), co-led by India and Brazil, in advocating for ethanol as a crucial solution for decarbonizing nations in the Global South. “The Global Biofuel Alliance is now the place where Brazil and India are not only strengthening and deepening their collaboration but also promoting ethanol as a solution to decarbonisation to the world,” he said.

India, which has already reached a 20% ethanol blend in its gasoline, is now working toward a 30% target. The Ambassador underlined that while specific deadlines are not set, both countries are making steady progress in bioenergy integration.

“We cannot talk about deadlines. We can talk about steady progress. As you have now reached 20 per cent mix of ethanol and gasoline, we are about to reach 30 per cent mix,” he added, noting India’s emerging focus on sustainable aviation fuel as well.

The two countries are also increasing their cooperation in other sectors such as energy, agriculture, defense, and pharmaceuticals. Brazil is particularly keen to learn from India’s successful implementation of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). “India has a very valuable experience in promoting DPIs in your country. So we want to learn from you,” said the Ambassador.

Brazil has also made strides in flex-fuel technology, which allows vehicles to run on any ethanol-gasoline blend. “The flex-fuel motor is the successful experience of Brazil in moving towards larger blends of ethanol and gasoline,” the Ambassador explained, adding that cars with flex-fuel engines face no technical limitations in using various ethanol blends.

The growing partnership between India and Brazil, especially through the Global Biofuel Alliance, is becoming an important driver of global decarbonization efforts. However, Tarun Sawhney, Chairman of the CII National Committee on Bioenergy, cautioned that the development of sustainable aviation fuel would require significant investment and time.

The summit also focused on the role of crops like sugar, rice, and maize in India’s ethanol program, which supports energy security and benefits farmers. Sawhney highlighted India’s achievement of a 20% ethanol blend, with plans to increase it to 27%, and the potential for flex-fuel vehicles running on E100 (100% ethanol).

Additionally, the Indian government recently approved the export of Second Generation (2G) ethanol. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) issued a notification on September 24 allowing the export of 2G ethanol, which is produced from non-food sources like bagasse, agricultural residues, and other renewable materials. This ethanol must meet specific sustainability criteria, including low CO2 emissions, and must be certified by relevant authorities before export.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ethanol-pump.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 10:57:09.518526

Badawi met with a delegation from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which included Natalia Lacorzana, Head of Natural Resources, and Gianpiero Nacci, Managing Director of Climate Strategy and Delivery. The discussions focused on expanding the partnership between Egypt’s petroleum sector and EBRD to include cooperation in mining. They also reviewed the ongoing reforms aimed at creating an attractive investment climate through upgraded legislative and regulatory frameworks. The meeting also touched upon the aerial and geophysical survey project for mineral exploration, which the Ministry is preparing to launch.

Furthermore, the two sides discussed strengthening technical cooperation in energy efficiency, decarbonization, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects, as well as in electric vehicles and methane emission reduction.

Badawi also met with Tonno Vahk, CEO of the Canadian Aton Resources, and Sherif Barakat, the company’s General Manager in Egypt, to review the company’s plan for its Abu Marawat concession in the Eastern Desert. This plan aims to achieve the first commercial gold production in the second half of 2026.

In another meeting with Maximo Pacheco, Chairman of Chile’s National Copper Company (CODELCO), Badawi discussed potential areas of cooperation. He highlighted the reforms in Egypt’s mining sector and its openness to international partnerships, inviting the Chilean company to explore investment opportunities in copper mining in Egypt’s Eastern Desert. They agreed to send a technical team from CODELCO to Egypt to discuss possible areas of cooperation with the Mineral Resources and Mining Industries Authority.

It is worth mentioning that Egypt aims to increase the mining sector’s contribution to 6% of GDP, making it a key pillar of economic growth. However, one of the main challenges in the sector is the complex regulations and lengthy licensing procedures that deter foreign investment. To address this issue, the Parliament approved an amendments to Law No. 198 of 2014, transforming the mining authority into an independent economic entity. The decision is expected to enhance the entity’s ability to lead the mining sector with greater efficiency. It also grants it broader powers to develop sector strategies, regulate mineral exploration and exploitation operations, localize mining, and promote transparency and attract investments.

Apart from the meetings, Badawi participated as a keynote speaker at one of the forum’s panel discussions, during which he highlighted the incentives implemented by the ministry within a comprehensive reform program in the oil and gas sector.

The Minister pointed out that major international oil companies (IOCs), including Eni, Shell, Apache, and Arcius Energy, have announced ambitious plans for Egypt with substantial investments to accelerate exploration and production activities. He also noted that ExxonMobil is intensifying its efforts in the Western Mediterranean.

Badawi added that Egypt is working to enhance its position as a regional hub for energy trade and exchange across all sources, highlighting the partnership with Cyprus to establish two gas pipelines connecting Cyprus’s fields to Egypt’s liquefaction facilities.

Singapore chose to avoid sustainable aviation fuel mandates and incentives – adopted by the European Union and United States, respectively – because of their downsides, added Sun.
She cited federal and state-level incentives in the US that lower the cost of sustainable aviation fuel and encourage domestic production.","[SINGAPORE] The Republic’s new legislation for the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel ensures cost certainty for the industry, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling on Tuesday (Oct 14).

Unlike a mandate, Singapore’s approach is not affected by fluctuations in the price of such fuel; and unlike incentives, it does not require “large and recurring fiscal commitments, which are not fiscally sustainable for Singapore”, she said.

“It helps to encourage (sustainable aviation fuel) production through clear demand signals, while ensuring that costs remain contained, predictable and fairly shared,” she said in Parliament at the second reading of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) (Amendment) Bill.

Singapore has set a target for this fuel to form 1 per cent of fuel use by 2026. The Bill, passed on Tuesday, allows this previously announced policy to be implemented.

It provides for CAAS to enact a levy, and create a fund and central procurement mechanism for sustainable aviation fuel.

The 1 per cent figure was chosen as it will not increase air ticket prices significantly, yet sends a firm demand signal to the market to spur production and industry development, said Sun.

Avoiding volatility

The amount that the government will spend on sustainable aviation fuel each year is pre-determined, based on the 1 per cent target and the projected price premium of the fuel compared to conventional fuels. This required amount is then collected via the sustainable aviation fuel levy: a tax paid to CAAS for outbound passenger and cargo flights from 2026.

CAAS itself – or an entity established by the agency – will procure, manage and allocate sustainable aviation fuel and credits for it.

“This allows us to secure better commercial terms with fuel suppliers and ensures that the levy proceeds are used in an accountable and effective manner,” said Sun.

The levy quantum for each year will not change even if the actual sustainable aviation fuel premium differs from projections. Instead, the amount of such fuel to be procured will be adjusted accordingly.

Singapore chose to avoid sustainable aviation fuel mandates and incentives – adopted by the European Union and United States, respectively – because of their downsides, added Sun.

Due to price volatility, mandates create significant cost uncertainty for airlines and passengers. An example is the EU’s requirement for sustainable aviation fuel to form 2 per cent of jet fuel use by 2025, rising to 70 per cent by 2050.

This fuel is “a nascent product that is subject to high price volatility” and airlines cannot hedge its price, she said.

“Simply mandating (its use) would impose unpredictable and unsustainable costs on airlines and passengers as sustainable aviation fuel prices may vary significantly.”

Meanwhile, subsidies “require large and recurring fiscal commitments, which are not fiscally sustainable for Singapore”.

She cited federal and state-level incentives in the US that lower the cost of sustainable aviation fuel and encourage domestic production.

In response to clarification questions from Members of Parliament, Sun said that the levy quantum in 2026 is expected to be within previously announced levels: For economy class, S$3 for short-haul flights such as to Bangkok, S$6 for medium-haul flights such as to Tokyo, and S$16 for long-haul flights such as to London.

She added that there are no plans to include transit and transfer passengers under the levy, in order to ensure Changi’s competitiveness as an international air hub.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/e29a24b8cf27561dc5210f5a3bb41b2f8ed004ec986f8b283b628591a3f82252?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-10-14 08:56:11.916064

Without an effective dewaxing catalyst like TK-930 D-wax, fuels can crystallize and clog filters, leading to operational issues.
The TK-930 D-wax catalyst uses a specially designed zeolite that has been fine-tuned with many small improvements.
“From our previous experience with SAF production, we knew a dewaxing catalyst would be critical, because the production of SAF requires dewaxing renewable feedstocks,” Ignacio explains.
Since then, five other customers around the globe have chosen the TK-930 D-wax catalyst as an easier step into SAF production, demonstrating this catalysts potential to advance SAF production worldwide.","What if a single catalyst could open the door to the fast-growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market? Meet TK-930 D-wax™! This dewaxing catalyst is making it easy for refineries to take their first step into renewable fuels production – while also delivering significant advantages in conventional fuel production.

To help us unpack the chemistry and market impact, we teamed up with Ignacio Costa, Technology Licensing Manager and a chemical engineer with a well-rounded understanding of both the science and business of fuel production.

A dewaxing catalyst designed to keep our fuel fluid

A dewaxing catalyst is vital in the production of winter-grade diesel and in processing renewable feedstocks because it directly improves cold flow properties. By enhancing these properties, the fuel remains fluid and reliable even in cold conditions. Without an effective dewaxing catalyst like TK-930 D-wax, fuels can crystallize and clog filters, leading to operational issues.

TK-930 D-wax is a selective dewaxing catalyst, that was designed to improve cold flow properties and minimize yield loss during the production of both conventional fuels (such as ultra-low sulfur diesel) and renewable fuels. The result is safer and more reliable fuels for everyone – from truck drivers to airline passengers.

“Every time you dewax a fuel, you will lose some valuable yields. But in short, what is outstanding of TK-930 D-wax is that even under difficult operating conditions, it delivers great cold flow improvements with minimal yield loss!” says Ignacio.

Ignacio Costa, Technology Licensing Manager at Topsoe

Isomerization capabilities are key to minimal yield loss

When crude oil or renewable feedstocks are converted into fuels like jet fuel, their properties must be improved to ensure they flow well at low temperatures. This is done using a dewaxing catalyst. Dewaxing catalysts need to carefully balance two chemical reactions: cracking and isomerization. Cracking involves breaking large molecules into smaller ones (undesired) and isomerization involves rearranging molecules to improve flow (desired). Both reactions happen on special materials called zeolites, which have tiny acidic spots that help trigger these two important chemical reactions. The TK-930 D-wax catalyst uses a specially designed zeolite that has been fine-tuned with many small improvements. This help encourage more isomerization and reduces cracking, which makes the process more efficient.

Ignacio explains: “The TK-930’s strong isomerization capabilities are the key to its exceptional cold flow properties and minimal yield loss. As an isomerization catalyst, our R&D team has been able to produce a catalyst with the right balance of acidity and metal content, which enables it to deliver the necessary activity without compromising performance. This outstanding work from our team helps maximize fuel yield and minimize unwanted byproducts.”

Adding to its value in the production of both conventional and renewable fuels, the TK-930 D-wax also effectively supports the removal of unwanted substances like sulfur, nitrogen and aromatics using hydrogen (through hydrogenation.

Stepping into the world of co-processing

Considering its great potential, it was no surprise that after its introduction in 2018, the TK-930 D-wax catalyst quickly set a new benchmark and became a key ingredient in hydrotreating units for both conventional and renewable fuels production (including sustainable aviation fuel) with Topsoe HydroFlex™ technology.

With ongoing shifts in the market, co-processing for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production started emerging as an even more promising opportunity:

In 2018 the ASTM approved Annex 1.2.2.1 to D1655 allowing the co-processing of up to 5vol% triglycerides, free fatty acids and fatty acids ester in petroleum refineries to be blended into jet fuel.

The same year, the Renewable Energy Directive, the EU Commission announced mandates on SAF where blend of traditional fuels with bio-based fuels was allowed. Mandates on SAF started in 2025.

In 2023, the European Commission adopted a delegated act (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/996) which specified how to monitor, certify, and account for the share of biogenic carbon in fuels produced by co-processing.

But the right solution for co-processing renewable feedstocks to SAF still had to be found.

A tried, tested and proven solution for SAF production

The TK-930 D-wax quickly became a leading candidate when we started exploring different solutions for co-processing.

“From our previous experience with SAF production, we knew a dewaxing catalyst would be critical, because the production of SAF requires dewaxing renewable feedstocks,” Ignacio explains.

“When we tested the TK-930 D-wax catalyst as a potential solution, we were amazed by the results. The catalyst supported SAF production through co-processing extremely well. We perform co-processing for SAF pilot tests at kerosene hydrotreater conditions, a unit not originally designed for dewaxing. This means the catalyst operates under harsh conditions, but despite this it still performs exceptionally well.”

At the ERTC conference in November 2024, we presented our successful co-processing test results with the TK-930 D-wax catalyst in collaboration with TotalEnergies. Since then, five other customers around the globe have chosen the TK-930 D-wax catalyst as an easier step into SAF production, demonstrating this catalysts potential to advance SAF production worldwide.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/IML-00010210%20%282%29%201.png,N,,2025-10-14 11:57:29.329089

With reduced weight, enhanced performance, and decreased maintenance requirements, the GEnx engine has become a leader in long-distance flights.","Just as time improves knowledge, craft, and expertise, it also helps to forge closer relationships.

This is the case in Japan, where the GEnx engine family recently surpassed five million flight hours, marking a new partnership and performance milestone in the local aviation market.

“Reaching five million engine flight hours in Japan underscores the GEnx engine’s proven reliability and safety record, as well as the deep trust placed in GE Aerospace by our airline partners — including Japan Airlines (JAL), All Nippon Airlines (ANA), and Nippon Cargo Airlines (NCA),” said Katsuya Okano, general manager of North Asia and the Pacific for GE Aerospace’s Commercial Engines and Services business. “From the very first GEnx-powered flight by Japan Airlines to today’s growing fleets across multiple carriers, we’re honored to be part of Japan’s aviation story — and we’re just getting started.”

A Harbinger of Change and New Opportunities

The arrival of the GEnx engine in April 2004 represented a major step forward in propulsion technology.

Starting as a blank sheet design — incorporating advanced technologies and materials developed after the GE90 engine entered service — the GEnx engine used lightweight, durable materials and advanced design processes to reduce weight, enhance performance, and lower maintenance costs. Designed for the Boeing 787 and 747-8 airplanes, the GEnx engine delivers up to 15% fewer CO2 emissions and is 15% more fuel efficient than its predecessor, the CF6 engine.

These innovations attracted attention and helped the company secure orders from global airlines, including Japanese aviation players.

Welcome to Japan

JAL was among the first airlines to select the GEnx engine, announcing its decision in November 2005 to power its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners. This continued a long-standing relationship with GE Aerospace, as JAL had previously operated engines including the CT7, CF34, CF6, and GE90.

Seven years later, on March 26, 2012, JAL took delivery of its first GEnx-1B-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner at a ceremony at the Future of Flight Aviation Center. It was the first GEnx-1B-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner to be delivered.

The plane’s maiden flight, a month later, on April 22, was notable for several firsts: the first revenue-generating flight of the GEnx-1B engine and the first nonstop Asia-to-Boston flight, from Tokyo’s Narita International Airport to Boston’s Logan International Airport.

“GE Aerospace has consistently been a trusted partner in our growth journey. As a launch airline for the GEnx engine, we have seen firsthand its high performance, reliability, and efficiency in action. With its demonstrated track record throughout the years, the GEnx engine will continue to support JAL in achieving our long-term goals,” said Kyohei Takizawa, vice president of procurement at Japan Airlines.

NCA was another GEnx early adopter. In 2005, it was one of the first cargo airlines to order GEnx-powered Boeing 747-8 freighters, placing a firm order for eight, with an option for six more.

“From the very beginning of our 747-8 freighter operations, the GEnx engine has delivered the performance and reliability essential for our long-haul cargo missions,” said Toshiaki Kobori, senior executive managing director of Nippon Cargo Airlines. “GE Aerospace’s continued support has played a key role in maintaining the high operational standards expected in our business.”

A New Decade, with a New Alliance

The GEnx engine’s footprint in Japan grew further at the start of the 2020s.

On February 25, 2025, ANA selected GEnx-1B engines to power its order for additional Boeing 787 Dreamliners, building on its initial selection of the engine in 2020.

ANA has an extensive fleet of GE Aerospace– and CFM International–powered aircraft. In addition to the GEnx, ANA operates the GE90 and CF6 engines and CFM’s CFM56 and LEAP-1A engines.* The airline has also ordered GE9X engines to power its Boeing 777X planes, as well as LEAP-1B engines to power its Boeing 737 MAX fleet.

Improved efficiency and sustainability were cited as key drivers of ANA’s decision to select the GEnx engine. On this front, the GEnx-1B engine provides four times better time on wing than the competing engine on the Boeing 787. Like all GE Aerospace engines, the GEnx can operate on approved sustainable aviation fuel blends. With reduced weight, enhanced performance, and decreased maintenance requirements, the GEnx engine has become a leader in long-distance flights.

“We are pleased to build on our long-standing relationship with GE Aerospace as we continue to grow our fleet,” said Ryosei Nomura, vice president of procurement at ANA Holdings Inc. “The advanced design and great innovation behind the GEnx give us the confidence that these engines will continue their outstanding performance and contribute to our growth.”

A Growing Legacy

As the GEnx engine family surpasses 68 million flight hours globally, the contribution from Japan — now exceeding five million hours — stands as a testament to more than just time in the sky. It reflects the strength of long-standing partnerships and the shared confidence in performance, reliability, and service.

It’s also a strong sign of what’s ahead.

With recent GEnx selections by JAL and ANA for their new Boeing 787 Dreamliner orders, the GEnx footprint in Japan is set to expand even further. Together, we look upward and forward — toward the next five million flight hours and beyond.

Círculo companies purchase an amount equivalent to a set percentage of the carbon footprint generated by certain corporate and cargo flights operated by Iberia.
As a member of this initiative, BBVA will be able to reduce emissions from its corporate flights on Iberia by 30 percent, within Scope 3, Category 6, which refers to emissions associated with employees’ business travel¹.
He also stressed the importance of alliances of this kind “to propel the energy transition.” Participating companies receive certification for the SAF used on Iberia flights.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel accounted for 0.3 percent of global airplane fuel production in 2024. By 2050, the IATA estimates that nearly 500 billion liters will need to be produced to reach the net-zero emission target. Through collaborative efforts, Iberia’s Círculo SAF aims to support the energy transition by promoting the development of SAF. Círculo companies purchase an amount equivalent to a set percentage of the carbon footprint generated by certain corporate and cargo flights operated by Iberia. This contributes to global emission reductions for the aviation industry, while allowing member companies to reduce part of their Scope 3 emissions.

As a member of this initiative, BBVA will be able to reduce emissions from its corporate flights on Iberia by 30 percent, within Scope 3, Category 6, which refers to emissions associated with employees’ business travel¹.

“Becoming a member of Iberia’s Círculo SAF means taking another step further in managing our carbon footprint, while supporting the aviation sector’s decarbonization efforts. A sector we included in our decarbonization targets in 2023, and one that requires both the development of cleantech and the participation of companies and governments to promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel,” said Leonardo Pereyra, Head of Direct Impact in the Sustainability Area at BBVA. He also stressed the importance of alliances of this kind “to propel the energy transition.”

Participating companies receive certification for the SAF used on Iberia flights. The SAF is certified according to the sustainability criteria established by the European Renewable Energy Directive (RED II).

Specifically, the sustainable aviation fuel Iberia uses to reduce the carbon footprint of Círculo SAF members comes from organic waste, such as used cooking oil. Emission reductions are calculated based on actual fuel consumption data for 2023, differentiated by route, type of aircraft and cabin type for flights operated in 2023. From there, the carbon dioxide equivalent conversion factor defined by the U.K. Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is applied, along with the percentage reduction in emissions achieved by using SAF compared with conventional fuel.

Benefits of using SAF

Sustainable aviation fuel – currently the only viable alternative and solution to reduce part of the aviation sector’s emissions, together with fleet renewal – can be produced from agricultural or forestry waste in its biological form (bioSAF), or from renewable hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the air (synthetic SAF or e-SAF), or from industrial processes (recycled carbon fuels).

According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), SAF is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 80 percent on a life-cycle basis (including everything from extraction or cultivation of raw materials to combustion in flight) compared with conventional kerosene.

BioSAF, which is produced from plant-based waste, also strengthens the energy transition and the circular economy. The waste used as raw materials for its production currently largely ends up in landfills, or is discarded on farms. Therefore, developing the SAF industry would improve waste management and turn it into a resource. Socially, it can boost job creation in agricultural areas where organic waste is collected to produce this fuel, helping to combat rural depopulation and contributing to prosperity in these regions. Another benefit of SAF is that it can be used without having to alter aircraft engines or airport infrastructure.

¹BBVA acquires SAF certificates equivalent to 30 percent of the emissions generated by flights booked on Iberia. Baseline year for calculation: 2023. This represents three percent of total Scope 3, Category 6 emissions, business travel, projected for 2025 (six percent using 2023 as the baseline).",https://www.bbva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Iberia-BBVA-combustible-vuelos-corporativos-1920x1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 07:57:21.716591

Establishing legal monitoring and offsetting frameworks provides the foundation for a transparent carbon trading system and integrates Russian aviation into global climate policy.","Starting September 1, 2026, Russian airlines must record fuel consumption and report CO2 emissions on all international flights. Amendments to Russia’s Air Code and federal greenhouse gas emission restrictions law, prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development in coordination with the Ministry of Transport, mandate compliance and establish the implementation timeline.

The amendments implement Russia’s integration into ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the new rules, carriers must log fuel burn for each international sector, prepare CO2 emissions reports and submit them to the Ministry of Economic Development. The legislation establishes a system for accrediting independent verification bodies to confirm report accuracy. Specific monitoring methodologies and the accreditation procedure will be defined in secondary regulations.

CORSIA requires mandatory reporting and offsetting of emissions growth above an established baseline. If emissions exceed that baseline, an operator must either acquire carbon credits or use recognized low‑carbon fuels, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) or CORSIA‑eligible fuel (CEF).

Operationally, carriers will need to deploy software and automated data‑collection systems, and train staff for monitoring and reporting tasks. Verification of reports will become a recurrent operational expense, and any increase in emissions will generate additional costs for purchasing offsets. According to industry estimates, Russian airlines’ cumulative compliance costs between 2027 and 2035 will range from RUB 61–258 billion.

Authorities are developing measures to reduce these expenses. The Ministry of Economic Development is exploring the accreditation of Russian domestic carbon credits for use under CORSIA. Projects to scale up production of sustainable aviation fuel are underway. Should Russian climate initiatives and carbon credits gain international recognition, operators could use domestic offsets and reduce foreign‑currency outlays.

CORSIA has been in operation since 2019 and applies to carriers whose international emissions exceed 10,000 metric tonnes of CO2 annually. From 2026 the scheme moves into a phase of mandatory participation for most ICAO member states. Russia has been an ICAO member since the organization’s founding, but its participation in CORSIA has been voluntary until now. This regulatory framework enables Russian airlines to meet international standards and avoid operational restrictions in overseas markets.

Joining CORSIA also aligns with Russia’s declared strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Establishing legal monitoring and offsetting frameworks provides the foundation for a transparent carbon trading system and integrates Russian aviation into global climate policy.",https://ruavia.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/decarbonisation-green-fuel-green-engine-icao.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 11:57:38.473712

It raises vital questions about Britain’s – and the world’s – readiness to face the security threats posed by the climate crisis, none of which can be met if leaders keep treating climate and defence as separate issues.

This summer, wildfires linked to climate change brought Europe to its knees, wreaking economic havoc, overwhelming health systems and draining military resources. All over the world, climate breakdown is fuelling instability, conflict and displacement. The EU’s failure to break free from Moscow’s pipelines is jeopardising its energy sovereignty. Too many governments treat climate and security as separate priorities, but true security will depend on how quickly we integrate climate resilience into national defence.

As world leaders increase their defence budgets, they must redefine what security means. Nato’s pledge to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP, agreed this summer, should be used to invest in innovation, something the British military has a proud history of.

The navy’s shift from burning coal to oil before the first world war was controversial, but ended up strengthening the British fleet. Today, dual-use technologies – which have both civilian and military applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles and sustainable aviation fuel – can similarly reduce emissions while boosting military performance.

As the world accelerates toward a more sustainable energy future, how do you envision the global energy mix evolving in the coming decade?

SAMSUNG E&A expects the global energy mix to transition steadily from being fossil-fuel led to a more balanced mix where renewables, hydrogen, low-carbon fuels, and advanced energy efficiency technologies play a central role. The largest gains will be made in renewables, electrification, and clean molecules such as hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Equally important will be the deployment of enabling technologies, such as carbon capture, digital twin, and AI-based optimization.

From your perspective, which trends and technologies are driving the most significant transformation in the global energy industry?

Decarbonisation is accelerating through investments in carbon capture, SAF, renewable hydrogen, and waste-to-energy solutions, while digitalisation is transforming engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) processes. AI, automation, and digital twins are improving project accuracy, productivity, and safety. Finally, integration is increasingly vital. Today, waste-to-SAF alliances, integrated hydrogen projects, and end-to-end digital ecosystems exemplify the impact of collaborative partnerships.

Can you highlight some of Samsung’s recent projects and milestones that reflect this transition?

In 2023, we announced our vision to become an “engineering company that builds a better future with advanced technology.” Since then, we’ve secured the Malaysia SAF project and won the FEED contract for the Indonesia LNG Project, which aligns with both energy security and decarbonisation in Asia and globally. Further, we are participating in the Middle East’s first eco-friendly plastic business.

We expanded in the hydrogen value chain through acquiring shares in Nel, and by developing our own zero carbon emissions water electrolysis technology (CompassH2).

Through our E&Able brand, E&Able Low (low carbon), E&Able Zero (zero carbon), and E&Able Circle (environment), we’ve launched solutions such as Efficien-C for carbon capture, WtoX for waste-to-energy integration, and Eco O&M for sustainable operations.

What makes ADIPEC 2025 an important platform for Samsung, and what are your key priorities and expectations this year?

ADIPEC is one of our major global marketing platforms. Over the past decade, it has allowed us to build long-term relationships with clients such as ADNOC, showcase our technologies, and engage with C-level decision-makers across the global energy ecosystem.

In 2025, our priority as a Platinum sponsor is to demonstrate how the convergence of AI, automation, decarbonisation, and safety innovation creates tangible value for clients and society by presenting solutions across three dedicated zones (E&Able, Integration, and S.A.Y + Go Quality).

We aim to strengthen our reputation as a leading energy tech company driving the transition and second, to connect with partners and clients to co-create opportunities that will define the next era of energy. ADIPEC 2025 is therefore both a showcase and a strategic checkpoint.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/tqynqze0/samsung-e-a-president-ceo-hong-namkoong.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134048993865770000,N,,2025-10-14 08:56:28.118653

Deepak Ballani, Director General of ISMA, emphasized, “India’s sugar sector has met its ethanol blending targets ahead of time.
Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, President of IFGE, stated, “India’s ethanol success demonstrates the strength of the collaboration between industry and government.

The organizations are also calling for GST rationalization on Flex-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs) and Smart Hybrid Vehicles, along with consumer incentives similar to those provided under the FAME scheme for Electric Vehicles (EVs), to help sustain the momentum of India’s ethanol revolution, as stated in a press release.

This appeal follows India’s achievement of E-20 ethanol blending five years ahead of schedule—a milestone that has drawn global attention and reinforced India’s commitment to sustainable mobility and energy security. The success highlights strong government leadership and the collaborative efforts of the sugar, bioenergy, and automotive sectors, positioning India as a leading example of global fuel transition.

Central to this progress is the sugar industry, which has invested approximately ₹40,000 crore to develop an ethanol production capacity of over 900 crore liters per year, putting it in a strong position to support blending beyond E-20. These investments have resulted in steady demand for sugarcane, faster clearance of cane arrears, improved cash flows for mills, the creation of millions of rural jobs, and significant research into high-yield feedstocks for sustainable ethanol production.

Deepak Ballani, Director General of ISMA, emphasized, “India’s sugar sector has met its ethanol blending targets ahead of time. To continue this revolution, policy continuity is crucial. With the ethanol industry providing 1,776 crore liters—well beyond the Oil Marketing Companies’ requirement of 1,050 crore liters—the sector is ready to support a 27% ethanol blend. However, without a clear roadmap beyond E-20, production capacities could remain underutilized, leading to idle investments, reduced mill revenues, and stagnated biofuel innovation. A phased, time-bound roadmap is essential to provide clarity on future blending milestones, vehicle adaptation standards, and advancements in biofuels like 2G/3G ethanol, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and green chemicals.”

The appeal also highlights financial strain caused by the lack of an increase in ethanol procurement prices from B-heavy molasses and juice over the past three years. This has put pressure on growth and could undermine the progress made so far. A clear roadmap beyond E-20 is therefore necessary to ensure fair utilization of existing capacity and continued improvement in farmer incomes.

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, President of IFGE, stated, “India’s ethanol success demonstrates the strength of the collaboration between industry and government. To sustain this momentum, it is crucial to announce a National Ethanol Mobility Roadmap for 2030 with clear targets beyond E-20. This will integrate vehicle adaptation standards, encourage advanced biofuels, and open pathways for green chemicals. Doing so will secure long-term investments, spur R&D in next-generation technologies, and solidify India’s position as a global leader in sustainable bioenergy.”

The joint appeal also underscores the importance of Flex-Fuel Vehicles and Smart Hybrids in India’s transition from traditional internal combustion engines to cleaner alternatives. These vehicles, capable of running efficiently on various ethanol blends up to E-100, could significantly reduce emissions and dependence on petroleum. However, the current GST rate of 43% on FFVs and Smart Hybrids remains a major obstacle, especially when compared to the much lower GST rate of 5% for EVs. With the right policy support, FFVs could help reduce India’s annual oil import bill by ₹50,000–₹75,000 crore, enhance energy independence under the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, and keep the country on track to meet its Net Zero 2070 commitment.

Reaffirming its commitment, ISMA emphasized that the sugar and bio-energy industries remain central to supporting Indian farmers and the nation’s transition to a cleaner, self-reliant energy future. Both ISMA and IFGE stressed that ongoing policy support will turn the current enthusiasm for ethanol into long-term benefits, ensuring stable farmer incomes, promoting industry growth, and laying the foundation for a cleaner transportation future in India.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ethanol-fuel-1.png,N,,2025-10-14 07:57:32.110335

Airlines, fuel producers, governments, and technology innovators are increasingly aligning with aggressive net-zero targets, positioning SAF as a cornerstone of global aviation sustainability strategies.

Drivers of Market Expansion

Decarbonization Imperative

The aviation industry contributes approximately 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions. With tightening international climate regulations, SAF emerges as the most practical short-term solution to curb emissions without the need to replace aircraft or overhaul existing infrastructure.

Airline Sustainability Commitments

Leading carriers are securing long-term SAF supply agreements to meet corporate ESG objectives. Business aviation and corporate travel programs are also integrating SAF to align with sustainability goals.

Technological Advancements

For discerning Bell and Schweizer owners in the UK, the discussion around Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is becoming increasingly relevant, not just as an environmental commitment, but as an operational necessity and a way to future-proof their assets.

In the UK, the commitment to SAF is substantial, driven by government mandates and industry innovation. This “Green Rotor Revolution” is already impacting how helicopters are powered and represents the most immediate and effective path to reducing the carbon footprint of private and commercial helicopter operations.

Understanding the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Mandate

The UK government has set out clear, ambitious targets to stimulate the production and use of SAF. The UK SAF Mandate, which begins in 2025, requires fuel suppliers to ensure a minimum proportion of jet fuel is SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to at least 10% by 2030.

Drop-in Capability: Crucially, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel. This means it can be blended with traditional jet fuel (kerosene) and used in existing turbine engines—like those powering the Bell 505 and Bell 407GXi—without requiring any modifications to the aircraft or its infrastructure. This is the game-changing factor for helicopters, allowing immediate emissions reduction.

Emissions Reduction: SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. It’s produced from sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil (HEFA), agricultural waste, or even synthetic fuels created from captured carbon (Power-to-Liquid or PtL).

Future-Proofing Your Investment: As a helicopter owner, adopting SAF is a practical step toward future-proofing your investment. Manufacturers like Bell are fully committed to SAF compatibility, and as the mandate progresses, aircraft certified for high-blend SAF operations will be more desirable, likely retaining better value in an increasingly carbon-conscious market.

Bell’s Leadership in Sustainable Flight

Bell is a leader in ensuring its latest generation helicopters are ready for this transition. The powerful and efficient Safran Arrius 2R engine in the Bell 505 and the Rolls-Royce engine in the Bell 407GXi are already certified to operate on a blend of conventional and SAF. The industry is working toward certifying these engines for a 100% SAF blend in the coming years.

For private operators, this means:

Direct Emissions Reduction: Every flight using a blended SAF immediately contributes to a reduced carbon footprint, aligning private flying with broader sustainability goals.

Operational Continuity: Unlike other technologies (like hydrogen or electric power) that require completely new aircraft designs, SAF ensures that high-performance aircraft like the Bell fleet can continue to operate efficiently and safely for decades to come.

Future Availability: As the UK government’s commitment to SAF production strengthens, availability at UK airfields will steadily increase, simplifying logistics for private owners.

The Helicopter Advantage and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

While larger airliners consume enormous volumes of fuel, the helicopter sector’s operational model—frequent, shorter flights often into smaller, less-equipped airfields—presents a unique opportunity for targeted SAF deployment. By focusing on regional distribution and smaller-volume deliveries, the rotorcraft community can lead the way in ensuring the fuel is available where it’s needed most.

The commitment to SAF is about more than just mandates; it’s about maintaining the operational freedom and utility that helicopters offer in a sustainable way. For current or prospective Bell owners, embracing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the logical next step in responsible aircraft ownership, ensuring the thrill and utility of flying remain viable for the next generation of pilots.

Hydrogen offers a bold zero-emission promise, while electric propulsion brings silent, efficient flight — but both face steep challenges in range, weight, and infrastructure. SAF, on the other hand, is already in the tanks of commercial jets today.

Airlines can use SAF as a direct replacement for jet fuel, cutting emissions by up to 80% without changing aircraft or engines. Hydrogen and electric aircraft may define the distant future, yet high costs, safety hurdles, and battery limits mean widespread use is decades away. For now, SAF is the only scalable path bridging sustainability with real-world practicality.

By the 2030s, the industry could see a mix of all three — SAF leading the skies, hybrid-electric systems shaping short-haul routes, and hydrogen waiting on the horizon.

34th annual Global Business Aviation Outlook projects 8,500 new business jet deliveries valued at $283 billion over the next decade

Purchase plan growth fueled by fractional operators and new tax law

Aircraft utilization continues to grow as vast majority of operators plan on flying more or the same as they did this year

LAS VEGAS, Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today published its 34th annual Global Business Aviation Outlook, which forecasts a record-setting number of new business jet deliveries over the next decade. The report provides unique insights into current industry trends and longer-cycle developments based on forecasting models and surveys of hundreds of business aviation operators across the globe.

Within the report, Honeywell predicts 8,500 new business jets with a projected value of $283 billion – the highest in the report's 34-year history – will be delivered over the next 10 years with an average annual growth rate of 3%. The strong demand for new jets continues to persist against a backdrop of increasingly complex macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. However, those factors have not slowed down the demand for new aircraft.

""The combination of recent economic growth, increasing demand for fractional ownership and a steady cadence of new aircraft development and technology upgrades have produced record levels of demand in business aviation,"" said Heath Patrick, president, Americas Aftermarket, Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. ""Operators are increasing their usage rates and in turn manufacturers are continuing to ramp up production to keep pace with growing demand. Over the next decade, we expect these record-setting levels of deliveries and usage to continue.""

Key findings in the 2025 Honeywell Global Business Aviation Outlook include:

New business jet deliveries in 2026 are expected to be 5% higher than in 2025.

New business jet deliveries are expected to grow by 3% annually on average over the next 10 years.

91% of those surveyed expect to fly more or about the same in 2026 compared to 2025.

20% of operators globally have at least one aircraft on firm order – up from 17% a year ago. The figure was higher in 2025 for the subset of Part 135 and equivalent operators (private jet charters, for example), where 28% of respondents mentioned they have an aircraft on firm order.

89% of respondents consider ""Performance"" among their top three most important criteria when purchasing an aircraft, which compares with 82% from last year's survey. ""Cost"" remains a distant second at 56%, which is down slightly from 60% last year.

Demand for fractional ownership continues to lead industry growth with Midsize and Super Midsize being the jets of choice for these customers. Among those surveyed, 12% of operators of wholly owned business aircraft say they also own fractional shares.

Fractional fleets have grown more than 65% since 2019 to roughly 1,300 aircraft now in service.

Growth from fractional operators, new economic policy contributing to higher demand

Operators surveyed indicated that the return of 100% bonus depreciation following the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) earlier this year is expected to spur additional business aircraft purchase activity. This federal tax incentive allows businesses to deduct a large portion of the cost of certain assets – including business jets – in the year they are put into use.

According to the survey findings, strong demand for fractional ownership is fueling large orders and contributing significantly to industry growth. The fractional ownership market has continued to outpace the industry in terms of growth, both in fleet sizes and flight activity. In fact, fractional fleets have grown more than 65% since 2019. Light, midsize and super midsize jets comprise 80% of these fractional fleets.

While 12% of current operators of wholly owned aircraft said they also own fractional shares, 15% more said they are considering purchasing them in the future. When asked for reasons why they are considering purchasing these shares, nearly 50% of respondents said they would increase the overall flying capacity of their operation and 30% said they would use their fractional program to optimize their current flight operations.

Flight Activity: Strong year-over-year growth in 2025

Operators are flying their aircraft noticeably more in 2025 when compared to 2024, with business jet flight hours up about 3% year over year after flight hours were virtually flat from 2023 to 2024. This growth is derived primarily from private operators and fractional ownership companies, where demand for charter flights has stabilized well above 2019 levels after fluctuating throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of regularly scheduled airline routes.

Corporate flight departments continue to lag in flight activity as they seek to optimize various cost elements of their flight operations. This is often achieved through selective use of wholly owned aircraft, charter flights, and fractional ownership.

When asked, operators expressed optimism about their outlook for future flight activity, with 28% saying they plan to fly more next year compared to this year and 64% saying they plan to fly about the same over the same time.

Regional Breakdown: Recent delivery trends continue

North America: North America is expected to receive roughly 70% of new jet deliveries over the next three years as 17% of operators have aircraft on firm order and the region comprises a massive 62% of the global fleet. There is optimistic sentiment from operators in North America driven by regulation changes in the U.S. headlined by bonus depreciation. Operators in the region follow the global trend of flight activity optimism, with just over 90% saying they plan to fly either the same or more hours over the next year.

Europe: Europe is expected to receive about 14% of new jet deliveries over the next three years, and the portion of operators with aircraft on order is higher than the global average. Europe maintains 11% of the global business aviation fleet, but 29% of these operators state that they have at least one aircraft on firm order. The flight activity sentiment mirrors the global trends with nearly 30% of operators expecting to fly more in the coming year and about 60% expecting to fly the same.

Latin America: Latin America will accept 7% of global new jet deliveries over the next three years. 15% of the global fleet is based in the region and 19% of current operators there said they have aircraft on firm order. These operators tend to be more optimistic about their flight activity growth in the coming year, with 33% of them anticipating an increase.

Remainder of the world: Asia-Pacific and the Middle East & Africa regions are forecasted to receive 5% and 3% of global deliveries, respectively. Both regions have hovered around these levels for the past few years, and the trend is expected to continue. Operators in these regions are less bullish on flight activity growth than the other regions, but still nearly 20% of the region's current operators expect to fly more, with most of the remainder still expecting to fly about the same amount in the coming year. The Middle East is poised for growth as positive regulatory changes and improvements to airport infrastructure will make it easier for business aviation entities to establish operations in and fly throughout the region.

Aircraft Purchase Priorities: Performance and cost remain king

Aircraft performance and cost continue to be the two primary purchase drivers for buyers of business aircraft, with aircraft range being the single most important specification. Other aircraft performance-related specifications such as payload, field performance and speed rank near the top of the list of purchase drivers.

Buyers surveyed who are purchasing new aircraft prioritize customer support and technology more than buyers of pre-owned aircraft. Specifically, buyers of new aircraft place higher value on good response time and technical support when compared with buyers of pre-owned aircraft.

When asked about aircraft technology, buyers of new aircraft said they consider advancements in fly-by-wire controls, connectivity and advanced safety features in their purchase decisions more than buyers of pre-owned aircraft.

Sustainability in Business Aviation: More fuel-efficient aircraft key to environmental improvements

For the fifth consecutive year, Honeywell also conducted an analysis of sustainability in business aviation and examined how operators are trying to lower their carbon footprint. Key findings in the report include:

81% of operators believe that developing new, more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines is at least moderately effective in helping to achieve sustainability goals.

61% think sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is at least moderately effective in reaching those same goals.

Among those who are taking proactive steps to improve the sustainability of their operations, 60% are acquiring more fuel-efficient aircraft, 56% are using SAF and 31% are flying at more efficient cruise speeds.

Regarding the adoption of SAF, cost and availability of the fuel continue to be the largest challenges.

Verijet’s bankruptcy highlights the continuing challenges of building large-scale charter operations around very small jets.","Florida-based charter operator Verijet has entered Chapter 7 bankruptcy, bringing a quiet end to one of the most ambitious attempts to reinvent short-haul private air travel around a single-engine jet and a promise of cleaner, more sustainable flying.

Court documents show the company listed between $1 million and $10 million in assets and up to $50 million in debts at the time of its bankruptcy filing on October 9, 2025. The filing follows months of lawsuits from customers and vendors and comes a month after the death of Verijet founder and CEO Richard Kane, who suffered a heart attack while cycling on September 13, 2025, at age 60.

Founded in 2020, Verijet bet heavily on the Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet, the single-engine personal jet typically favored by private owners rather than charter fleets. Kane’s vision was to create a “green air taxi” network linking small cities and regional airports, using the SF50’s lower fuel burn and noise footprint to deliver a cleaner, quieter alternative to conventional light-jet operations.

The company claimed that the Vision Jet’s fuel consumption — around 60 gallons per hour versus 100-plus gallons per hour for most twinjets — cut carbon emissions by about 40%, and said it would use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) wherever possible while offsetting remaining emissions to reach net-carbon-zero operations.

Verijet operated on a jet card model, selling prepaid flight hours in blocks starting at $25,000. Rates averaged about $3,000 per flight hour, with one-hour minimum per leg. The company marketed its pricing as competitive with turboprop charter options while offering faster point-to-point travel. However, unlike traditional fractional ownership or guaranteed-availability programs, Verijet’s terms stated that flights were “subject to aircraft and crew availability.” That clause became central to later disputes when customers found themselves unable to book flights or reclaim unused balances.

From its base in South Florida, Verijet expanded to Texas, California, South Carolina, the Northeast, and the Caribbean, at one point ranking as the 13th-largest charter operator in the United States by flight hours. By 2023, it appeared to be a breakout success story in the emerging light-jet charter niche.

That same year, Verijet signed a letter of intent to merge with a SPAC led by former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, which would have taken the company public and given Muilenburg a board seat. But the plan unraveled when Muilenburg’s New Vista Capital liquidated the SPAC before closing the deal.

Soon after, lawsuits mounted from customers who had purchased jet cards — prepaid flight packages that promised convenience but not guaranteed availability. Many cardholders claimed they were left with large unused balances after Verijet canceled flights and stopped operations. Vendors, lessors, and fuel suppliers also joined the creditor list as the company’s cash flow dried up.

By mid-2025, Verijet’s once-active fleet of around 20 Cirrus Vision Jets had shrunk to just a few aircraft. Flight-tracking data shows little activity in recent months, and the company appears not to have flown any flights since Kane’s passing. While Verijet’s website remains online, it has not been updated to reflect the bankruptcy filing or the current status of operations.

Verijet’s downfall underscores the difficulty of scaling air-taxi operations around very small jets. The Vision Jet’s low acquisition and operating costs made it appealing on paper, but limited payload and range meant the economics depended on consistently high utilization — something no operator has yet achieved.

Verijet’s bankruptcy highlights the continuing challenges of building large-scale charter operations around very small jets. The company’s fleet of Cirrus SF50s was less expensive to operate than traditional light jets, but limited range and payload restricted its earning potential.

Other companies have tried similar short-haul charter concepts in the past with mixed results. The Eclipse 500 “very light jet” programs of the mid-2000s, for example, also struggled to sustain utilization and profitability.

At the same time, the industry continues to pursue more efficient aircraft and lower emissions. Major manufacturers are certifying new models for 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use, and smaller operators are exploring hybrid-electric propulsion.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/10/02-Verijet-3-cropped.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 04:56:43.605976

Energy density requirements, weight limitations, and operational demands create an inescapable reality: these backbone industries need liquid fuel solutions to decarbonise.
Policymakers across the Asia Pacific are coming to terms with this reality and acting on it in an increasingly decisive manner.
Companies building regional low carbon liquid fuel capabilities now position themselves advantageously for the consolidation phase that inevitably follows market maturation.
The groundwork laid through APEC coordination will determine whether Asia Pacific leads global low carbon liquid fuel development or cedes first-mover advantages to regions already acting decisively on both climate and security imperatives.","As APEC leaders convene, the Asia Pacific region faces twin imperatives that demand coordinated action. Climate commitments will require deep decarbonisation across transport and industrial sectors while energy security concerns necessitate reduced dependence on volatile fossil fuel trade flows. Low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) offer a rare solution that addresses both challenges simultaneously, creating an US$800 billion market opportunity across the region.1

The scale of this challenge becomes clear when examining the hard-to-electrify backbone of regional trade. Aviation, maritime transport, heavy freight, and industrial processes form the circulatory system of the Asia Pacific's interconnected economies. These sectors move the goods and people underpinning regional prosperity yet face fundamental physical constraints that make electrification commercially unviable. Energy density requirements, weight limitations, and operational demands create an inescapable reality: these backbone industries need liquid fuel solutions to decarbonise.

These applications account for nearly half of liquid fuel consumption across major regional economies. With aviation demand growing 2.6% annually and freight at 1.9%2, the challenge compounds without coordinated intervention - this is precisely why LCLFs emerge as the critical market catalyst.

Policymakers across the Asia Pacific are coming to terms with this reality and acting on it in an increasingly decisive manner. Deloitte’s SAF Lighthouse tool provides airport-level demand forecasting, revealing where Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is likely to take off, driven by emerging mandates. This, paired with the current pipeline of SAF projects under development, and volumes of competitive feedstock available, make clear that there is a significant opportunity for the region.

However, realising this potential requires overcoming significant investment barriers. Our analysis in the Refined Ambitions report for Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation identifies five interconnected risks constraining private capital: demand uncertainty without harmonised policy, price volatility in fragmented markets, feedstock supply risks, technology risks beyond proven pathways, and policy uncertainty from inconsistent standards. These barriers persist across both developed and emerging regional economies, creating a coordination problem that no single jurisdiction can solve alone.

Understanding market development phases reveals why coordinated action creates competitive advantages. Four distinct stages characterise this evolution: export-led growth, domestic demand emergence, supply diversification, and consolidation. Companies securing partnerships during earlier phases capture disproportionate value as markets mature. Critically, competition between production pathways and feedstock supply is expected to reduce abatement cost significantly, making regional coordination not just strategically smart but economically essential.

The Refined Ambitions report points toward seven specific accelerators that can unlock investment barriers through coordinated regional action:

Increase market access - harmonise sustainability standards and trade frameworks

Increase risk mitigants - develop revenue certainty mechanisms and concessional finance

Reduce transaction frictions - standardise contract terms and regulatory processes

Send credible demand signals - coordinate policy and government procurement

Reduce information asymmetry - publish market benchmarks and supply/demand forecasts

Leverage innovation - coordinate R&D investments and technology deployment

Align value chain interests - facilitate partnerships and joint ventures

As outlined in Deloitte’s recent report, Accelerating Net-Zero: Critical Opportunities in Asia Pacific’s Climate Policy, the strategic imperative for regional leaders is clear – the only way to catalyse real change, at pace, regionally, is for policy to lay the groundwork for action, matched with private sector investment and innovation. APEC provides the coordination platform, but individual C-suite decisions across aviation, shipping, heavy industry, and fuel production will ultimately determine outcomes. The window for establishing regional partnerships narrows as other markets move decisively toward integrated approaches. In Deloitte’s recent 2025 CxO Sustainability Report, almost 50% of Asia Pacific C-suite surveyed noted that they are focused on developing new sustainability related products and services and actively implementing new technology solutions. SAF provides a key opportunity for these organisations.

Companies building regional low carbon liquid fuel capabilities now position themselves advantageously for the consolidation phase that inevitably follows market maturation. Those choosing fragmented national strategies risk higher costs, supply constraints, and competitive disadvantages as integrated regional ecosystems develop economies of scale and regulatory alignment.

The groundwork laid through APEC coordination will determine whether Asia Pacific leads global low carbon liquid fuel development or cedes first-mover advantages to regions already acting decisively on both climate and security imperatives.

The choice facing regional leaders is fundamental: build these capabilities together through coordinated partnerships or explain later why fragmentation was chosen when the stakes demanded integration and the pathway to success was clear.
