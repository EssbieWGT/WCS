Synhelion has now delivered its first solar aviation fuel to SWISS World’s first solar jet fuel plant inaugurated by Synhelion","Collaborating with Synhelion engineers, a solar research team at the Solar-Institute Jülich (SIJ) of FH Aachen presented two papers at SolarPACES 2025 assessing the accuracy and reliability of dynamic process models for a solar fuel production system. They used operating data from Synhelion’s DAWN pilot plant.

In Synhelion’s solar fuel plant, DAWN, concentrated solar power drives endothermic chemical reactions to convert biogenic methane, carbon dioxide, and steam into synthesis gas (syngas), which can then be processed into liquid hydrocarbon fuels, such as kerosene for aviation or gasoline.

Because the methane and carbon is derived from bio-waste rather than fossil fuels, and heat is generated from concentrated solar heat instead of burning fossil fuels, Synhelion is pioneering a sustainable drop-in replacement for today’s liquid fuels.

Synhelion’s DAWN pilot plant in Jülich (which can be toured at the next SolarPACES conference in the Fall of 2026) uses RED-certified sustainable biogenic waste as the methane and carbon source and has demonstrated the complete production chain under real solar operation conditions.

Synhelion’s solar-absorbing gas receiver is a unique design that is capable of extremely efficient conversion of solar irradiance from the heliostats to temperatures as high as 1500°C.

How can Synhelion’s solar receiver achieve such high temperatures?

Speed matters for real-time simulation

Now that Synhelion is beginning its first commercial production of solar fuels, plant operators will need to adapt to changing information in real time. Traditional physics-based models can be fast, but that usually comes at the cost of lower accuracy. So the team took a new approach.

“We needed a system where we can offer simulation results in real time to aid the operators who run the plant and make the decisions,” explained lead author Falko Schneider in a call from SIJ in Germany.

“For example, when to switch operation modes, what kind of mass flows or compositions of the reactants to set. To achieve this, we need models that can deliver both high accuracy and high computational speed. You can also use the process model offline to test potential operating and control strategies, of course, where speed doesn’t matter as much. The physics-based model takes a bit longer, but still, it’s very fast. It’s not like it needs days to simulate a week of operation.

The studies are to validate physics-based and machine-learning-based models for simulating DAWN’s solar fuel plant operation. The idea is to replace the more computationally expensive physics-based simulations with machine-learning models and validating an efficient alternative. The team first created a machine-learning model of the thermal energy storage with synthetic data from the physics-based model and successfully validated it.

In the overall system study, Validation of a Dynamic Process Model of a Thermochemical System for Solar Fuel Production, all three key components are validated against real-time operation. The key components are the solar receiver, the reforming reactor where the thermochemistry happens, and the thermal energy storage, which is crucial in solar fuels production, as the thermochemistry must operate continuously.

Synhelion’s high-temperature solid thermal energy storage system uses ceramic refractory bricks with internal channels to carry the heat transfer fluid.

The thermal energy storage had the most comprehensive study

The second study, A Validated Machine Learning Approach to Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Simulation Using Synthetic Data, focused on this component, the thermal energy storage. Of the three aspects studied, the thermal storage was most fully modeled.

The thermal energy storage model successfully reproduced charge-discharge transients over 8 cycles across 10 days, achieving errors of less than 3% of the temperature swing in the upper storage layers, although deviations increased toward the bottom due to potential material property variations and mass flow measurement uncertainties.

The team’s surrogate model yielded results in milliseconds on the synthetic validation data, compared with on average over five seconds for a physics-based model—making it roughly 100 to 1000 times faster. On operational validiation data from DAWN, it is even up to 50.000 times faster. Its run times were also much more consistent, allowing the system to run many simulations very quickly, making it practical for optimization tasks or real-time control.

Since solar flux onto the receiver wasn’t directly measured during operation, the researchers developed a simplified data-driven surrogate solar field model using a 4th-degree polynomial with ridge regression.

“We used experimental data as input and compared the output to the experimental data,” Falko explained. “ The coupled surrogate-receiver simulation achieved outlet gas temperatures of approximately 1000°C, showing good agreement with experimental data, although it slightly overestimated temperatures due to a minor systematic bias in the surrogate model. And since then, the receiver has been operated at output temperatures of over 1200°C.

The model validation for the reforming reactor revealed major discrepancies, though. Especially under partial-load conditions, the model overestimated the reaction rate and heat consumption, with residual methane present, contrary to equilibrium predictions, and lower CO₂ conversion than expected.

“We still have some work to do there,” Schneider noted.

“Usually you have these physical models, and then you fit them with operational data. There are components that work very well, right out of the box, without a fitting. The thermal storage model worked quite well already without any fitting. But regarding the chemistry, we need to do some more work. We assumed that a thermochemical equilibrium had been reached within the reactor. That was the statement we got from an industrial manufacturer. However, in the end, it did not align with reality, probably due to the relatively small reactor size.”

So the team needed to implement some kinetics:

“For example, we could implement some factors that allow us to say, ‘Okay, depending on how fast the reactants flow through the catalyst, it will get that close to a thermal chemical equilibrium.’ If it reaches or not, or how close it gets, and what the composition would look like are factors that can be fitted with operational data from DAWN. So this is about the reactor kinetics,” he said.

Work continues on the solar receiver and the reforming reactor

“For the solar receiver, the problem is that we do not have the operational measurements of the concentrated flux hitting it,” he said. “So we are missing an input variable, and we don’t have a detailed model of the heliostat field because a lot of factors go into this. You usually use ray tracing tools to create these kind of models which are not applicable in the process model. So I created this approximation of the heliostat field model, and used that to validate the receiver model. That’s not a strict validation, but at least it’s a successful plausibility check.”

And the reforming reactor model still needs major improvements. It may be necessary to replace the current equilibrium method with a kinetic model or utilize effectiveness factors to more accurately capture how the system behaves under partial loads. However, both provide a solid base for building a digital twin of the solar fuel process.

“Since we are already creating some component models based on machine-learning, we are checking as well if this would be suitable to accurately reproduce the chemistry,” Scheider pointed out.

“This was a publicly funded project between Synhelion, SIJ and Germany’s Institute of Future Fuels at DLR as partners, within which DAWN was built. DLR also created a small lab setup to evaluate different kinds of catalysts. They developed more detailed chemical models with that data. So we are working with them to see whether we can implement it in our model.”

The team’s machine-learning models have been developed within the TwinSF project in the EU, which combines tested physical models with data-driven approaches to help guide operations in alternative fuel production plants using concentrated solar energy to produce sustainable fuels.

The long-term goal is to develop a functioning digital twin that enables real-time plant monitoring, predictive control, and virtual testing of control strategies before they get implemented on an actual solar fuels plant’s system.

The humid weather and air conditioning are blowing hot and cold, depending on which corner of the venue you are in, which one delegate quipped was “a bit like the carbon markets” at the moment. Nature and carbon are firmly on Friday’s agenda across side events at the summit, and negotiators on Article 6 were also said to have enjoyed calmer talks on Thursday, though after a new text on crediting Paris projects landed overnight, it now seems reopening adopted work on the new crediting mechanism may be back on the table at the conference.

Timestamps are in local time (GMT-3).

0800 – New texts, new drama: But just when parties were saying they did not intend to create fresh drama at COP30 on Article 6, a new text concerning the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM) dropped. Heavily bracketed, containing provisions around an extended transition of Kyoto-era projects to the new Article 6.4 system, and a proposed extension of current Supervisory Body members’ term limits, one observers said it was “looking really bad”, with some of provisions in the text calling for adopted standards on the PACM, such as on baselines and additionality to possibly to be tweaked. Carbon Pulse will look to analyse in full and publish an update later on Friday.

0900 – You shall not pass: A peaceful protest by Indigenous groups blocked the main entrance to COP30 this morning, with demonstrators calling for a meeting with President Lula and highlighting that major projects – including those related to soy, waterways, and carbon markets – are moving ahead without their free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC). Delegates were redirected to a side entrance, with officials stressing there was no security risk. Commenting from the scene, Cool Earth’s Natalie Klepacova said the action reflected longstanding exclusion and broken promises, adding that Indigenous peoples are rights-holders and frontline defenders whose voices must be central to climate decision-making.

1000 – To Tulio, with love: Building on the Brazilian presidency’s description of negotiations as therapy sessions, where parties should feel encouraged to share their true feelings in a safe space, Brazil’s top COP strategist Tulio Andrade asked delegates on Thursday to send him private “love letters” expressing how they felt the conversations were proceeding – and encouraging those that hadn’t to write soon, according to one negotiator in the room. The presidency extended talks on the four main issues – around the ambition gap, trade, finance, and reporting on progress – until another plenary on Saturday. The plenary is likely to be in the morning, to give the SB chairs time to take stock of talks, but not set yet.

1000 – Whitehouse in the house: US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) is arriving in Belem as the sole representative of the US federal government. The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee plans to participate in discussions on Friday on the future of offshore wind, clean shipping, and non-CO2 GHG emissions and hold meetings with international leaders and the private sector.

1030 – Total investment: French oil and gas major TotalEnergies is putting $100 mln into a fund that backs technologies to cut emissions from the oil and gas value chain. Climate Investment’s venture strategy fund has had a portfolio impact of 133 MtCO2e since 2019, particularly in the detection and abatement of methane, carbon capture, and energy efficiency, TotalEnergies said. Climate Investment was launched in 2015 by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, of which Total is a member.

1130 – Document development: The Mexican state of Jalisco has submitted its registration document to J-REDD+ standard ART TREES. The document will now undergo a completeness check, and if accepted, will be posted for a public comment period.

1200 – Virtual hugs from US Democrats: US Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) joined the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition as the former Speaker of the House to critique the absence of the Trump administration from the international climate negotiations. Pelosi and other members had planned to attend in Belem but were delayed by the federal shutdown, which ended on Thursday. The House Democrats reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement.

1330 – Utility upgrades: Utilities around the world plan to up their annual investment in the energy transition to $148 bln per year, from $117 bln, IRENA announced on Friday. The plan, by the members of the Utilities for Net Zero Alliance, will see the companies mobilise over $1 trillion towards the energy investment up to 2030, since the group was established in 2023. Investments will go towards power grids and networks, including $1.24 spent on grids and storage for every $1 spent on renewable generation. It also includes delivering tends of thousands of kilometres of new and upgraded grid infrastructure.

1430 – France and Italy’s red carpet for fossil fuels: While European Commissioner Hoekstra kept his promise and did not bring fossil fuel lobbyists to COP30 as part of his entourage, France and Italy didn’t get the memo, according to NGO Friends of the Earth. Research by Fossil Free Politics shows that France, Sweden and Italy had the largest EU fossil fuel delegations out of the other 27 member states. France brought along five TotalEnergies lobbyists, including CEO Patrick Pouyanne, and sizeable delegations from EDF and ENGIE, for a total of 22 lobbyists. Italy brought along 12 lobbyists, and Sweden 18. In total nine EU governments brought 84 fossil fuel lobbyists into COP30 on their official government delegations, out of the 1600 fossil fuel lobbyists present at Belem’s conference.

1430 – Badgering the State Department: US Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) told reporters in Belem that federal representatives of the US are missing from the international conference as much due to the federal shutdown, as due to complicated logistics. Without the cooperation of the US State Department, the senator said it has been challenging to access the Blue Zone at COP30. In previous years, Whitehouse and other member of Congress have asked the State Department for “party overflow” badges to the US delegation. The State Department denied the request, according to a Whitehouse staffer, as the country had not applied to attend, leaving Whitehouse and others to scramble for spare “observer” badges through NGOs. Whitehouse is attending as an observer with international association Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment (GLOBE).

1530 – Concrete jungle: C40 Cities urged on Friday national governments at COP30 to advance a credible global plan to end dependence on fossil fuels, echoing Brazil’s call and responding to climate impacts already hitting cities. Building on COP28 commitments to transition away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, and double energy efficiency by 2030, mayors stressed the need to turn ambition into concrete action through a just and equitable phaseout supported by stronger local-national collaboration. C40 cities have pledged to halve fossil fuel use by 2030, with the highest-emitting countries moving fastest. They are already cutting emissions five times faster than national targets, demonstrating that a fossil-free future is achievable.

1630 – Plans for action: New action plans for the African Union, Caribbean, Chile, Colombia and Mozambique, under the Global Clean Power Alliance (GCPA), have been published on Friday on the UK government website. They aim to identify priority needs and outline targeted support for clean energy transitions, in the countries, including transmission infrastructure and project readiness. These demand-led plans guide collaboration with local partners, the UK government, which co-launched the GCPA, said. Complementing them is a private-finance-endorsed High-Quality Energy Investment Planning Roadmap, designed to help countries mobilise private capital at scale and accelerate global clean energy deployment. At COP30, the UK and Brazil also unveiled new deliverables for the GCPA finance mission, backed by a broad coalition of NGOs, private investors, international organisations, MDBs and other partners committed to advancing energy transitions in developing economies. The alliance was first launched at the G20 Summit in Nov. 2024 by the UK and Brazil, with an initial mission to scale clean energy finance.

1700 – Cheaper SAF agreement – Latin American Airline Abra Group and Japanese company Sumitomo Corporation announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to scale up sustainable aviation fuel. Abra, which owns companies like Brazilian Gol Linhas Aereas, and Sumitomo will establish a Brazil-Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement to ensure supply of SAF between Abra and Sumitomo. Brazil wants to become a leading global SAF producer via the production of ethanol and biodiesel.

1730 – I want to live by Common Principles: The 10 multilateral development banks in the MDB Nature Working Group have launched an update to the Common Principles for Tracking Nature Finance, which were first released in 2023. They were created in response to the 2021 MDB Joint Statement on Nature, People and Planet, which highlighted the deep connections between poverty reduction, climate action and addressing the drivers of nature loss. The new Joint Statement, published Friday, committed MDBs to embedding nature more fully across their policies, analyses, advice, investments and operations. It also pledged to scale up nature-positive finance and to create stronger methods for tracking such investments across MDB portfolios.

1800 – Big figs: A new Oxford Smith School report shows that a rapid shift to renewables could double energy-sector productivity in low- and middle-income countries within 25 years, delivering GDP gains of around 10% by mid-century. Solar-rich nations such as Burundi, DR Congo, and Mozambique could see particularly strong economic benefits, the researchers said. Renewables raise productivity by generating more electricity per dollar invested and by providing cheaper power, allowing households and industries to operate longer at lower cost. The study found these gains are greatest in the Global South and could help narrow global income disparities. It also shows renewable investment has already boosted GDP in developing countries far more than fossil fuels, adding $1.2 trillion between 2017 and 2022. In Brazil alone, renewables contributed $128 billion. However, the authors stressed that communities benefit only when intentional mechanisms – such as local ownership and community funds – are in place. They also highlighted the importance of distributed renewables to expand access and ensure an inclusive transition.

1800 – BB carbon desk: Banco do Brasil (BB) formally launched its carbon credit desk on Friday, becoming the first Brazilian bank to do so. The bank’s carbon business will rely on three prongs: project origination, commercialisation of credits, and decarbonisation advisory. Currently, BB already has more than 30 projects under development, with the capacity to generate up to 3 mln carbon credits per year, it said.

LanzaJet, the alternative fuels technology company that is marked as a significant player, has achieved a major breakthrough in Soperton, Georgia, which can be regarded as a monumental step for the aviation industry. The firm has made history by being the first-ever to produce jet fuel out of ethanol at the scale of a commercial operation. This new method is not simply a technical success but rather a major leap that will greatly affect the use of eco-friendly travel in the future.

A New Era for Aviation Fuel in Georgia

LanzaJet’s new facility in Georgia, known as LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels, marks the first-ever commercial production of jet fuel derived from ethanol. This facility, strategically located in Treutlen County, has successfully achieved ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) certification for on-spec jet fuel. The plant’s operations have now reached full capacity, positioning LanzaJet at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

This development has been years in the making. After 15 years of research, development, and collaboration, LanzaJet’s ethanol-to-jet (ATJ) technology is now fully operational, offering the aviation industry a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based jet fuels. With the aviation sector under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, this new fuel offers a viable, eco-friendly solution.

LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet Technology

LanzaJet’s innovative Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology is a game-changer for sustainable aviation. Unlike traditional fossil fuels, which rely on limited oil reserves, LanzaJet’s fuel is derived from widely available ethanol feedstocks. These feedstocks can come from a range of sources, including agricultural residues and recycled carbon from waste. The versatility of this technology means that nations worldwide can tap into their local agricultural resources to produce jet fuel, promoting energy security and reducing reliance on imported fuels.

By using ethanol as a feedstock, LanzaJet’s fuel solution offers substantial greenhouse gas emissions reductions over traditional jet fuel. When blended with conventional Jet A-1 fuel, it creates a fully certified sustainable aviation fuel that is compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. This means airlines can start using this cleaner fuel without making costly adjustments to their fleets or operations, further enhancing its appeal.

Impact on Travel and Tourism

This breakthrough will undoubtedly influence the future of air travel. As the aviation industry grapples with its carbon emissions, sustainable aviation fuels like those produced by LanzaJet offer a promising pathway towards more eco-conscious travel. With the aviation industry contributing a significant portion of global CO2 emissions, LanzaJet’s innovation could help reduce the environmental impact of air travel, making it more sustainable for future generations.

For the tourism industry, this means a future where travellers can feel better about the environmental impact of their flights. As more airlines adopt SAF, air travel will become greener, supporting tourism in a more sustainable way. This could encourage eco-minded travellers to choose more environmentally friendly options and contribute to the overall sustainability of the tourism sector.

Georgia’s Role in Leading the Way

LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility is a model for future sustainable aviation fuel production worldwide. With the plant’s successful integration of cutting-edge technologies, it sets a blueprint for other regions to follow suit. This project also highlights the growing importance of regional investments in sustainable technologies and infrastructure, boosting local economies and creating new job opportunities.

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility was developed with an investment of over 300 million USD, employing over 300 people during construction and creating additional long-term jobs. These efforts are not only advancing global aviation but also contributing to the local community in Georgia, which benefits from economic development and energy security brought about by the new facility.

A Bright Future for Sustainable Aviation

LanzaJet’s groundbreaking achievement in Georgia represents a significant milestone in the aviation industry’s shift toward sustainability. With its ethanol-based jet fuel, the company has unlocked a new chapter in aviation, where travel is not only convenient but also more sustainable. As LanzaJet continues to scale its operations, the future of air travel looks greener and more promising than ever.

By providing a scalable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional aviation fuel, LanzaJet is setting a new standard for the aviation industry, inspiring other countries and companies to follow suit.

The group has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sumitomo Corporation do Brasil, a key subsidiary of Japan’s global trading giant Sumitomo Corporation, to accelerate the creation and deployment of industry-ready decarbonization solutions for aviation.

The agreement marks a strategic alliance between two regions with increasingly aligned climate ambitions. It also signals a new phase in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Brazil, a country widely regarded as one of the world’s most capable future producers.

A Partnership Designed to Fast-Track Emissions Reductions

The MoU establishes a joint framework for Abra – represented in Brazil through Gol Linhas Aéreas – and Sumitomo to coordinate deeply with government bodies, regulators and private-sector stakeholders in both Brazil and Japan. Their primary goal is to advance the implementation of a Brazil–Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), developed under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement.

The JCM is a bilateral carbon-offset system introduced by Japan in 2011 to support low-carbon projects in developing regions. In exchange, Japan receives a portion of the generated emission-reduction credits, helping the country meet its domestic climate targets while accelerating climate-positive investments abroad.

For Abra and Sumitomo, establishing the JCM in Brazil represents the essential step toward enabling a long-term offtake agreement for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. By aligning both nations’ climate policy frameworks, the two companies aim to remove one of the most significant barriers to SAF expansion: the need for reliable long-term financing and guaranteed market demand.

Meeting Soaring Global Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry is entering a crucial era. Global demand for SAF is projected to reach nearly 400 million tons by 2050, driven by international decarbonization commitments, emerging regulatory pressure and the aviation sector’s urgent need to reduce its footprint.

Developed economies with minimal access to feedstock – including Japan, Singapore and several European nations – are already bracing for severe supply constraints. SAF production requires large quantities of biomass or renewable feed materials, making resource-rich countries like Brazil pivotal to the global energy transition.

Brazil has long been recognized as an agricultural and biofuel leader, with decades of experience in ethanol, biodiesel and renewable energy technologies. This positions the country uniquely well to become a central hub for SAF production. Yet, despite having the natural and industrial advantages, large-scale SAF development faces persistent financial challenges. High production costs, investment risks, and the need to preserve affordable domestic air travel for Brazilian consumers remain critical concerns.

The introduction of the Brazil–Japan JCM could provide the missing bridge. The framework would unlock new financial flows, lower market-entry risks for producers and create a stable foundation for long-term SAF supply agreements. Airlines in both countries would benefit, while Brazil would expand a new renewable-energy export market without compromising its domestic aviation accessibility.

Mutual Gains for Governments, Producers and Passengers

The Abra–Sumitomo collaboration generates unique benefits for both countries. Japan gains access to competitively priced SAF sourced from a reliable partner with vast renewable potential. Brazil secures investment, technology and market guarantees that support local producers and job creation, while reinforcing its leadership role in the global renewable-energy landscape.

Brazilian airlines, including Gol, stand to benefit from increased SAF availability within their domestic market—an essential advantage as global regulations tighten and consumer pressure for sustainable travel intensifies. Passengers across both nations ultimately gain from a cleaner, more responsible aviation ecosystem with long-term safeguards for affordability and operational continuity.

Strengthening Latin America’s Sustainability Voice Ahead of COP30

The signing of this MoU comes at a critical moment. With the world turning its attention to Latin America as Brazil prepares to host COP30, sustainability partnerships of this scale signal the region’s growing influence in shaping global climate solutions.

For Abra Group, the agreement reinforces its commitment to responsible aviation policies that safeguard connectivity, economic opportunity, environmental responsibility and social progress across Latin America. By championing innovation and aligning with global partners, the group aims not only to transform its own operations but also to set a benchmark for regional and international airlines.

As the aviation sector moves into a defining decade, the Abra–Sumitomo partnership stands out as a forward-looking blueprint for cross-border cooperation, climate-aligned investment and large-scale deployment of sustainable aviation technologies. Through collaboration, innovation and strategic policy alignment, the two organizations are helping shape a future where growth in air travel can coexist with meaningful climate action.

Maria Del Mar Whittaker, Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer, Abra Group, said: “At a time

when financing for SAF projects is particularly challenging due to market uncertainties, demand

constraints and evolving regulations, creative solutions that leverage the strengths of different global

regions are the best path forward. This joint initiative represents an important step towards global

climate alignment, connecting Japan’s commitment to decarbonization with Brazil’s unique capacity

for SAF production and its need for affordable aviation connectivity.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Runway-Closure-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 17:56:39.129152

As the commercial aviation sector struggles to transition away from fossil fuels, Boeing is turning to underground carbon storage as a cost-effective alternative to sustainable jet fuels.

Charm’s process begins with agricultural and forestry residues, which are converted into a dense liquid known as bio-oil through a thermal treatment. Instead of being burned, the bio-oil is injected deep underground, including into depleted oil wells, where it can remain stable for centuries.

The approach provides a tangible solution for companies facing growing pressure to offset emissions while more scalable fuel alternatives remain years away.

Charm and Boeing charting a CO2 removal course

The deal could indicate renewed demand for carbon removal within aviation. 2023 saw a deal for the removal of 400,000 tonnes of CO2 between Occidental (through its subsidiary 1PointFive) and Airbus and there have been others involving carriers but not enough to call this a functioning market.

Analysts estimate the industry will need at least $60 billion in offsets by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions targets. For startups like Charm, this creates a lucrative market for carbon removal credits.

Charm previously sold 112,000 credits to advance market commitment Frontier for roughly $53 million, but the company aims to dramatically cut costs from $470 per ton to around $50 per ton, potentially unlocking broader adoption.

For Boeing, the new agreement underscores a pragmatic strategy: combine emerging carbon removal technologies with long-term investments in sustainable aviation fuel.

Becky Petry, Applications Engineer, Greene Tweed

Andrew Clarke, CEng, Applications Engineer — Sealing Systems, Greene Tweed

What are the differences in various types of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and how do these variants affect common elastomers?

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are renewable alternatives to traditional jet fuels, intended to reduce carbon emissions. SAFs are produced from a variety of renewable feedstocks, including biomass, algae, animal fats, vegetable oils, and agricultural residues like corn stalks. The ASTM D7566 standard outlines eight approved SAF pathways, enabling the production of sustainable fuels tailored to both environmental goals and fuel performance requirements.

Within SAF, there are different formulations, including Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK) and Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK). These variants differ primarily in their aromatic content [benzene (ring) hydrocarbons], which plays a vital role in determining their compatibility with elastomers commonly used in aerospace fuel systems:

SAK contains a high level of aromatics, which are essential for maintaining the performance of certain elastomers, such as those used in seals and gaskets. Aromatics help elastomers retain their flexibility and prevent excessive swelling or weakening.

SPK has no aromatic content, making it a cleaner-burning fuel. However, its lack of aromatics can lead to challenges with elastomer compatibility, such as swelling or reduced sealing performance.

Both SAK and SPK formulations play a critical role in the adoption of SAF. While SAK’s high aromatic content supports compatibility with traditional elastomers, SPK offers a cleaner-burning alternative with fewer emissions but requires careful consideration of elastomer performance. Advanced materials like FKM seals provide a reliable solution across SAF blends, ensuring safety and performance without compromising sustainability goals. As the aviation industry continues its transition toward greener fuels, understanding the nuances of SAF formulations and their impact on materials will be key to a seamless shift toward more sustainable skies.

Which form of SAF – SAK or SPK – is more in use or likely to come into use?

Currently, SPK is more widely adopted and is set to play a key role in the future of aviation. The diversity of feedstocks approved under ASTM D7566 highlights the broad range of sources available for SPK production. Aircraft manufacturers are also making strides toward sustainability, with plans to design aircraft capable of operating on 100% SPK by 2030. Certain SPK feedstocks are already proving to be the dominant choice for SAF.

We worked with Virant to source and test SAK (which is 97% aromatic) – a material with a high aromatic content (97%) derived from algae. This product was specifically developed to blend with approximately 80% SPK, ensuring the correct aromatic balance needed for a drop-in fuel compatible with nitrile seals exposed to jet fuel. While SAK is not intended to be used as a standalone fuel, it serves as a critical blending component. A mixture of 80% SPK and 20% SAK creates a 100% sustainable fuel option, eliminating the need for petroleum-based jet fuel while maintaining performance and reliability.

Where are elastomer seals used and for what purpose?

In aerospace applications, elastomer seals are critical components used in fuel systems, hydraulic systems, and engines to prevent leaks and ensure safety. Their primary purpose is to create a reliable barrier that prevents leaks, withstands elevated temperatures, and resists chemical degradation.

What material used in commercial applications underperforms with SAF and in what ways (swelling, weakening) and under what conditions?

Fluorosilicone elastomers (FVMQ), such as Greene Tweed’s 409 compound, showed underperformance in certain conditions:

Hardness Change: FVMQ materials exhibited greater and/or inconsistent hardness reduction when exposed to SAF fluids.

Weakening: Prolonged exposure to dry-out conditions or fuel switching (e.g., from conventional jet fuel to SAF) led to reduced sealing performance and dimensional instability.

Based on the variance in results between the different types of SAFs used, we recommend further application testing of any FVMQ compound in the specific SAF fluid intended for use. In contrast, under the same test conditions Greene Tweed’s fluorine-based elastomers (FKM compounds 665, 731, and 772) demonstrated good compatibility and consistent performance.

How widespread is the use of seals that use this material?

FVMQ (the material which underperformed during testing) represents a choice for static fuel applications that require good sealing performance over a broad temperature range. Few material options were historically available that could offer excellent levels of sealing performance at very cold temperatures (i.e. below -54°C or -65°F). However, newer grades of FKM material are also capable of performing well at these cold temperatures.

Are substitute materials available (and approved by the FAA, EASA, etc.) to replace the underperforming seal materials?

As mentioned above, newer grades of FKM material (notably those compliant against AMS7379 and AMS7410 industry specifications) can perform well at very cold temperatures. As such, they can meet the operating temperature envelope that only an FVMQ material can offer. In addition, FKM materials also typically cost somewhat less than FVMQs. FKM materials can therefore represent an attractive alternative to an FVMQ material.

It should be noted that if a type of sealing product is replaced within an aircraft system, it is the responsibility of aircraft system manufacturers to qualify the replacement and demonstrate an equivalent level of performance.

Do FKM seals cost more?

The cost impact would be from having to replace nitrile seals with the FKM seals due to the higher cost of FKM material. As mentioned earlier nitrile seals require some aromatic content, so the blending of aromatics or switching to FKM seals would be a cost consideration.

Is the supply chain for the substitute material challenged?

The supply chain for advanced elastomer materials like FKM is currently stable, however, fluctuations are always possible depending on factors like increased demand. Greene Tweed’s global manufacturing and distribution network ensures a reliable supply of high-performance elastomers to meet industry needs.

What is Greene Tweed’s expertise in supplying elastomers for SAF (can cover research, testing, verification, manufacturing or distribution strengths).

As a global leader in advanced materials and high-performance solutions, with decades of experience in elastomer technology, our expertise spans multiple areas, including advanced material science capabilities in research and development.

We follow this with comprehensive testing and verification protocols to ensure our materials meet or exceed industry standards. For this particular application, we conducted a comprehensive study to evaluate the compatibility of fluorine-based elastomer seals with various SAF blends, including SPK and SAK. The seals were tested under accelerated aerospace conditions, such as temperatures up to 120°C and prolonged SAF exposure, to ensure their reliability in real-world applications.

Our manufacturing facilities also enable us to produce high-quality elastomers at scale, while our robust global distribution network ensures efficient delivery to customers worldwide.

Proving seal compatibility with SAFs through rigorous testing ensures that existing aircraft and systems can safely transition to these fuels without costly overhauls, paving the way for a more sustainable future in aviation while maintaining safety and reliability standards.",https://www.aerospacemanufacturinganddesign.com/fileuploads/image/2025/11/14/pav-greene-tweed-fusion-665-image-ko-szd.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:56:26.662438

“Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation.
The resulting liquids are upgraded into a kerosene-range blend that meets existing jet fuel specifications.
The headline is the life-cycle assessment: depending on configuration, MSW-derived jet fuel could cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 80 to 90 percent compared with conventional fossil jet.
Global potential of trash jet fuel Policy ambition for SAF is rising fast.","Aviation accounts for roughly 2.5 percent of global CO₂ emissions today, and demand for flights is on track to double by 2040. Unlike cars, planes can’t simply switch to batteries at scale, which is why sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has become the industry’s main decarbonization lever.

The hitch is supply. SAF still represents less than one percent of jet fuel use worldwide because it’s expensive to make and limited by feedstocks such as used cooking oil and energy crops. A new study points to an overlooked, highly scalable input: municipal solid waste (MSW).

By converting everyday trash into drop-in jet fuel through industrial gasification and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project found a powerful emissions lever. Their analysis shows that airlines could slash lifecycle emissions using this pathway.

The researchers found that aviation has surprisingly few practical, near-term tools to cut emissions in a meaningful way.

“Unlike road transport, which is shifting toward electrification, there’s no silver-bullet for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,” said Jingran Zhang, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-China Project.

“Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today’s engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.”

Turning trash into jet fuel

The pathway the team evaluated is well-established chemistry at industrial scale. Mixed municipal waste – including organic scraps, paper and cardboard, a portion of plastics, and other combustibles – is sorted and then gasified into a synthesis gas of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

After cleanup to remove contaminants, that “syngas” is fed into a Fischer–Tropsch reactor to build longer hydrocarbon chains.

The resulting liquids are upgraded into a kerosene-range blend that meets existing jet fuel specifications. Airlines can use it now without modifying engines or fueling infrastructure.

The headline is the life-cycle assessment: depending on configuration, MSW-derived jet fuel could cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 80 to 90 percent compared with conventional fossil jet.

Savings stem from diverting waste, preventing methane, and substituting petroleum with a far lower-carbon fuel. But a real bottleneck is scaling gasification systems that can reliably process mixed waste with consistent quality and uptime.

Boosting efficiency with hydrogen

Trash isn’t a uniform feedstock, and syngas composition doesn’t always perfectly match what Fischer–Tropsch reactors prefer.

In the scenarios the authors analyzed, only about one-third of the input carbon became fuel without additional process adjustments. This is good enough for big emissions gains, but is definitely improvable.

The analysis shows two levers to push efficiency higher: capture and recycle CO₂ within the plant, and blend in green hydrogen produced with renewable electricity.

Both tactics raise carbon utilization and fuel yield. They strengthen climate benefits and economics, especially in regions with supportive power and carbon policies.

Trash problem to jet fuel solution

MSW is a municipal headache nearly everywhere. Landfills consume land, leak methane, and are increasingly constrained. Incineration reduces volume but brings air quality challenges.

Routing appropriate fractions of that waste to fuel production offers cities a credible “zero-waste” pathway that also displaces fossil fuels.

The researchers emphasize that plastics must be handled carefully to meet sustainability criteria. However, with proper sorting and modern gas cleanup, a large fraction of urban trash becomes a reliable SAF feedstock rather than an environmental liability.

Global potential of trash jet fuel

Policy ambition for SAF is rising fast. The United States aims for up to 35 billion gallons per year by 2050, backed by tax credits.

The European Union is mandating rising SAF blends on all departing flights, from two percent in 2025 to 70 percent by mid-century.

Against that backdrop, the MSW potential is striking. In the study’s “practical” case, existing waste could produce about 50 million tons (roughly 62 billion liters) of jet fuel annually. That is enough to cut aviation’s lifecycle CO₂ by about 16 percent.

With green hydrogen integration and optimized plants, output could climb to 80 million tons per year. That would supply up to 28 percent of global jet fuel demand and avoid as much as 270 million tons of CO₂ annually.

Regionally, Europe’s potential from MSW alone would exceed near-term EU blending mandates while staying within sustainability guardrails.

Under carbon pricing and offset programs such as ICAO’s CORSIA, lower-carbon fuel also carries an economic edge: airlines reduce their compliance costs by burning fewer fossil tons, and incentives help close the price gap with conventional jet.

Scaling depends on policy

Despite strong climate performance, MSW-to-jet won’t scale on chemistry alone. Siting and financing large gasification plants, upgrading waste collection and sorting, securing long-term feedstock contracts with cities, and aligning utility-scale green hydrogen supply all require durable policy.

Production-side tax credits, contracts for difference that guarantee a stable SAF premium, and clear sustainability standards can unlock private capital.

On the demand side, blend mandates that ratchet up predictably give airlines and fuel producers the certainty to invest.

Trash and the future of jet fuel

“This study presents a blueprint for converting urban waste into sustainable aviation fuel, offering future environmental benefits,” said lead author Michael McElroy, a professor of environmental studies at Harvard.

“Broad collaboration among governments, fuel producers, airlines, and aircraft manufacturers will be essential to lower costs, and accelerate aviation’s path to net-zero emissions.”

The big picture is pragmatic. There’s no single fix for aviation. But MSW-derived SAF is one of the few options that can scale this decade using existing airplanes and pipelines. It also helps solve a waste problem that cities already pay to manage.

Pair it with efficiency gains, smarter operations, other certified SAF pathways, and hydrogen or electric aircraft where they make sense, and the sector’s path to deep decarbonization looks a lot more achievable.

The study is published in Nature Sustainability.

Logistics, Community and Operational Detail Capturing CO₂ at a bioethanol plant is itself complex.
In this case, multiple ethanol plants now feed into the pipeline, creating a shared logistics infrastructure that benefits from economies of scale.","Nebraska-based ADM (at its Columbus, Nebraska, corn-processing complex) recently made waves in the biofuels world thanks to an exciting new project. The company marked the operational start of a new carbon-capture and storage (CCS) project, now labeled the world’s largest bioethanol carbon-capture facility.

What makes this milestone even more compelling isn’t just its scale. It was how their CCS project was achieved.

The project harnesses an existing 400-mile natural-gas transmission line formerly used for fossil fuel transport. It has been retrofitted and retooled to carry captured CO₂ from multiple ethanol plants to underground sequestration deep in Wyoming.

By repurposing infrastructure rather than building completely new pipelines and systems, the companies involved drastically reduced costs, expedited timelines, and reframed what a “new” facility can look like in the sustainability era.

The Project at a Glance

The pipeline in question is the Tallgrass Energy “Trailblazer” system. Formerly a natural-gas transmission line running through Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, it has been converted to transport CO₂ from an array of ethanol plants, including ADM’s Columbus facility and plants operated by POET in Nebraska and Iowa.

The operation is designed to transport over ten million tons of CO₂ per year. The scale is equivalent to removing more than two million passenger vehicles from the road.

Reuse of Legacy Infrastructure

What sets this project apart is that the pipeline didn’t start as a CCS project. It was a natural-gas facility that found new life converted for a new purpose.

Adapting old infrastructure in this way carries several benefits. For one, the operation required fewer new rights-of-way, reduced need for entirely new construction, and faster integration. Smaller, lateral lines were constructed using voluntary easements from landowners, simplifying permitting and community engagement. Together, this meant far less disruption for ADM to accomplish their goals.

This adaptation underscores the theme: “old infrastructure, new purpose.” Rather than laying entirely new conduits across vast terrain, the project leveraged what was already in place. Doing so reduced cost, decreased logistical friction, and hastened its time-to-market.

Logistics, Community and Operational Detail

Capturing CO₂ at a bioethanol plant is itself complex. Fermentation processes release CO₂, which must be collected, compressed, and transported safely.

In this case, multiple ethanol plants now feed into the pipeline, creating a shared logistics infrastructure that benefits from economies of scale. Once transported, the CO₂ is injected deep underground in rock formations roughly 9,000 feet beneath the surface in southeast Wyoming.

Community engagement also played a significant role. Tallgrass worked with landowners and citizens’ groups, creating a community investment fund tied to the pipeline’s throughput (10 cents per metric ton of CO₂ sent).

Initial contributions toward local services such as early childhood development, senior care, and food pantries were given. This is a critical element of the project as repurposing infrastructure isn’t just a technical exercise—it has to fit socially and politically, too.

Reinforcing the Theme: Beyond the Pipeline

While the retrofitted pipeline is the highlight of this development, the project’s broader strategy reinforces the theme of transformation.

The ethanol plants themselves are evolving. By capturing their CO₂, they lower their carbon-intensity scores and position themselves for new markets such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

These plants were originally built for one purpose: fuel production. Now they’re adapting to serve a net-zero future. That second layer of reuse speaks to the broader mindset shift of legacy assets repurposed for modern climate goals.

The transition to sustainable operations is no easy feat. New technology, shifting regulations, massive capital costs, and intricate logistics all stand as formidable barriers. Many decarbonization projects stall not because the science is impossible, but because the infrastructure and business-model challenges are real and steep.

Yet in this case, the company behind this facility demonstrated how a measure of ingenuity can go a long way. Choosing to repurpose an existing natural-gas line, building lateral connections via voluntary easements, and aligning community interests all unlocked what might otherwise have been prohibitively slow or expensive.

Their story serves as a beacon. It shows that while the challenges are steep, a path forward to a more sustainable future is very much possible.

Repurposing yesterday’s infrastructure for today’s climate challenge isn’t just clever… it’s necessary. And as we scale the next generation of decarbonization efforts, the “old-infrastructure, new-purpose” mindset may be one of our most effective tools.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Overview:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a bio-based or synthetic jet fuel derived from renewable resources, designed to replace conventional fossil-based jet fuel. SAF offers a significant reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions, making it a crucial component in the aviation industry's efforts to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel, obtained from sustainable feedstocks like municipal waste, agricultural residues, algae, and cooling oil. It offers up to 80% reduction in greenhouse emissions over the fuel's lifecycle, while maintaining compatibility with fueling infrastructure and existing aircraft engines. The global sustainable aviation fuel market is projected to witness substantial growth driven by the airline sustainability commitment, technological improvements in production pathways, and growing air passenger traffic. Leading airlines like British Airways, Delta, and United have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. SAF adoption is a core component of their tactics, with long-term procurement agreements being contracted to secure supply. This commitment is fueling continuous industry demand.

Although drivers exist, the global market is challenged by factors like feedstock competition and availability, and underdeveloped production infrastructure. The low availability of sustainable feedstocks, such as agricultural residues and waste oils, creates supply barriers.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Growth Factors

Aviation's climate strategy pivots on fuels with verifiable lifecycle cuts. CORSIA (ICAO) moved into wider implementation in 2024-2026, tightening accepted sustainability criteria and methodologies for SAF.

This compliance-grade carbon value is monetized. Airlines' decreasing reported emissions exposure can trim ETS-CORSIA liabilities. At the same time, producers earn higher credits in LCFS if they drive CI lower (for instance, via renewable power, green hydrogen, or CCUS on ethanol feedstocks). The global sustainable aviation fuel market is hence rewarding projects that can document traceability and additionally, increasing investment into digital MRV and lower-CI feedstocks.

The price delta remains the central brake, but it's easing at the margin. Based on the region and feedstock, SAF premiums have commonly ranged $2 to $4/gal above Jet-A. With IRA + LCFS, specific United States lanes can compress this to sub-$1-$2/gal efficient premiums for qualifying low-CI volumes, mainly for HEFA and some ATJ routes tied to low-CI ethanol.

In a project funded by the Minnesota corn checkoff, Dauenhauer is testing a series of metal catalysts, to see which could produce the highest yield at the greatest economic efficiency.
“Using existing technology you can make methanol into jet fuel.
“In 2022, the USA produced about 14 billion bushels of corn (~360 million tonnes of corn, source: USDA),” Dauenhauer wrote in his research proposal.
“(That same year), the USA consumed about 145 million tonnes of diesel fuel (source: EIA).","With support from Minnesota Corn, Professor Paul Dauenhauer is exploring the corn-to-methanol pathway for biofuels.

Modern corn ethanol is a marvel of clean fuel production, harnessing the energy of the sun to make a single seed into 600 or more kernels, and then rendering the glucose polymers in the grain into an alcohol fuel. Modern production efficiency renders nearly three gallons of fuel from every bushel.

Making alcohol is a biological catalytic process as old as civilization, but, even with the latest refinements, the biology in the process requires the sacrifice of about a third of the glucose molecules in the lifecycle of the yeast catalyst, producing CO2 along with the alcohol.

Paul Dauenhauer, a University of Minnesota Professor of Chemical Engineering, asks, what if there were a process that could utilize 100% of the corn glucose polymers to make fuel? He believes an inorganic catalyst could turn all those molecules into another form of alcohol, called methanol.

In a project funded by the Minnesota corn checkoff, Dauenhauer is testing a series of metal catalysts, to see which could produce the highest yield at the greatest economic efficiency.

“Methanol has a universality to it,” Dauenhauer said. “Using existing technology you can make methanol into jet fuel. You can also make clean burning diesel fuel, and you can make polyethylene polymers—plastics.”

The jet fuel made this way achieves a major reduction of carbon emissions, and so qualifies as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—corn-based methanol could potentially supply that entire American SAF market, he said.

He believes this new process will yield 50% more fuel, while still leaving the corn fiber, protein and oil for coproducts like distillers grains animal feed.

“In 2022, the USA produced about 14 billion bushels of corn (~360 million tonnes of corn, source: USDA),” Dauenhauer wrote in his research proposal. “(That same year), the USA consumed about 145 million tonnes of diesel fuel (source: EIA). Using about half of the annually produced corn would provide the renewable carbon required to manufacture all of the country’s current jet fuel consumption.”

The “universality” of the methanol molecule will allow biorefineries to respond to the various markets and direct production into different amounts of jet fuel, diesel, or plastic, depending on demand, Dauenhauer said.

Methanol-based diesel also offers a huge environmental benefit.

Dauenhauer said, “You manufacture a molecule called dimethyl ether…People have been talking about it for a long time. The benefit of using dimethyl ether in a diesel engine versus conventional diesel is it burns really cleanly. All the problems you have with exhaust with a conventional diesel engine, you would not have with methanol-based diesel.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Minnesota_Corn_Nov25_6f013edadd.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:57:43.986467

“[Trump] may be skipping COP30, but his fossil fuel allies aren’t,” Collin Rees, U.S. campaign manager at Oil Change International told DeSmog.
The IETA is a business lobby group made of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers and greenhouse gas emitters.
He also defunded renewable energies and accelerated drilling for planet-heating oil and gas, while branding the climate crisis a “con job”.
Fossil fuel executives are the arsonists of the climate crisis.","Top American oil and gas producers are using trade groups to gain access to this year’s COP30 climate summit in the absence of an official U.S. delegation, DeSmog can report.

ExxonMobil and Chevron — which are among the fossil fuel industry’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters — have sent a combined total of 13 executives to the talks, while both companies have either sponsored events or pavilions at the conference.

In addition, Exxon CEO Darren Woods spoke at a number of COP30 side events, including one in Sao Paolo on November 3, where he noted in an interview with Reuters that crude oil and hydrocarbons were “going to play a critical role in everybody’s life for a long time to come”.

U.S. President Donald Trump took the unprecedented step of deciding against sending an official U.S. delegation to the COP30 climate summit, where over 50,000 delegates are gathered in the Amazon city of Bélem, Brazil.

“[Trump] may be skipping COP30, but his fossil fuel allies aren’t,” Collin Rees, U.S. campaign manager at Oil Change International told DeSmog. “This is proof that Big Oil still holds a dangerous sway over the climate process.”

The 13 executives identified by DeSmog are among the more than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists attending this year’s summit. This is the largest ever proportion recorded at a climate conference, according to a new analysis published today (Friday) by the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition, a coalition calling to remove fossil fuel companies and lobbyists from influencing climate negotiations.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributors to the climate crisis, and Exxon and Chevron are among the 57 polluters directly linked to 80 percent of the world’s global fossil CO2 emissions since the 2016 Paris Agreement. Two years ago, the COP28 summit in Dubai ended with a historic call to “transition away” from fossil fuels to meet climate targets, but emissions from polluting fuels are on track to hit a record high this year.

Exxon and Chevron also have a history of delaying action on climate change through lobbying and false advertising. Earlier this month, DeSmog and The Guardian revealed how Exxon funded think tanks to spread climate denial in Latin America and across the Global South during the 1990s and early 2000s.

Both companies say they are committed to climate action, but neither has committed to a 2050 net zero target that includes Scope 3 emissions from the burning of their fuel, which make up the vast bulk of their polluting gases.

Exxon and Chevron did not respond to DeSmog’s request for comment.

This was the first year in COP history when attendees have been able to voluntarily disclose which organisation or individual paid for their attendance.

Analysis of the delegates list reveal that the Geneva-based International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), which counts ExxonMobil as a member, paid for two Exxon executives to attend, as well as delegates from BP and TotalEnergies. Meanwhile Washington D.C.-based Thaddeus Segal from ExxonMobil, senior director of Exxon’s global energy transition in public and government affairs, accessed the talks as part of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) delegation.

The IETA is a business lobby group made of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers and greenhouse gas emitters. This year, the group’s pavilion was sponsored for a second year running by Chevron, among other polluters, including BP. As DeSmog reported last year, the group’s COP29 pavilion in Baku, Azerbaijan, was also sponsored by ExxonMobil.

DeSmog also found that ExxonMobil is sponsoring a “high-level” side-event on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) on November 15, hosted by the U.S. and Brazilian Chamber of Commerce and pesticides giant Bayer. Here, Exxon “leaders” will speak alongside members of Congress on the “economics and policy support to scale sustainable aviation fuel [SAF]”.

Experts have warned that the widespread production of SAF without sustainable practices could lead to deforestation, loss of biodiversity and competition for land with food crops.

Chevron, meanwhile, has gained access to the talks through industry groups IPIECA, a London-headquartered global oil and gas group which focuses on providing an industry channel into official UN proceedings. The group sent just three delegates: two of its own employees, and a third from Chevron.

This year, the American Petroleum Institute (API)sent just one delegate — also an executive from Chevron. The Washington D.C.-based API is the world’s biggest oil and gas industry group, with a history of undermining the global consensus on climate change.

A third Chevron executive attended as the sole delegate of the European Roundtable on Climate Change and Sustainable Transition, an independent Brussels-based think tank.

Exxon’s Woods also headlined a COP30 launch event on November 7 in Brasilia, hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Amcham Brasil to “discuss business solutions for carbon accounting and emission reductions”. Exxon has joined an industry effort to create a new carbon accounting system to create more accurate calculations of emissions-intensity, which critics have described as a “new climate delay tactic”.

Speaking on Bloomberg’s Zero podcast on the sidelines of COP, Woods praised Trump for changing the “paradigms” of the energy transition, but insisted Exxon still has a role to play in lowering emissions. Since his inauguration in January, Trump has quit the Paris Agreement, the legally-binding international treaty to limit catastrophic temperature rise. He also defunded renewable energies and accelerated drilling for planet-heating oil and gas, while branding the climate crisis a “con job”.

Meanwhile, away from COP, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said on Wednesday that revival of international oil and gas exploration could be at least partly attributed to the President’s energy policies.

“The Trump administration has played a critical role in opening doors and creating an environment where people are looking to do these kinds of deals,” he told Bloomberg TV.

Rees of Oil Change International said: “Trump is the fossil fuel industry’s best investment and the world is paying the price.”

He called for fossil fuel companies to be denied access to the talks.

“No Big Oil executive can claim their objectives align with the UN’s multilateral climate treaty,” Rees said.

“These companies continue to drill, pollute, and profit from the destruction of our planet and communities. Fossil fuel executives are the arsonists of the climate crisis. They cannot be trusted to help extinguish the fire.”",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3D4E3TE-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:57:49.642033

Delhi International Airport Limited

Videh Kumar Jaipuriar has been nominated for his exemplary leadership in managing and navigating Delhi International Airport (DEL) during the COVID-19 pandemic. He led multiple initiatives to ensure business continuity at DEL, which included passenger safety and convenience, stakeholder management, cash conservation, adoption of new technologies, and care for environment and employee safety.

He proactively engaged with the government stakeholders and supported them in safeguarding aviation through strong confidence building measures for travellers, such as developing several indigenous technology solutions like air circulation with six changes per hour and a combination of UV and plasma disinfection systems to provide safest journey experience to their passengers. Under his leadership, DEL has been forefront of implementing safety measures which was later adopted across the country.

Despite lockdown, Jaipuriar ensured that DEL was operational for rescue missions, medical evacuations, and transporting medical essentials to various parts of the country. He further led the Vande Bharat Mission flights of Government of India (a rescue mission to get Indians back to India), as well as rescue flights by other international governments. His outstanding leadership across all areas across the stakeholders in the aviation ecosystem and going beyond the call of duty in managing and navigating this crisis for a national capital airport having national importance makes him the apt choice for the Person of the Year Award.

CEO

Hajj and Umrah Airport – Jeddah – KSA

Adnan Saggaf continues to demonstrate strong leadership skills throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and brought out of the box ideas in attracting traffic and to support his team during this difficult time. With new innovative ideas in balancing cash flow, the facilities were kept maintained and the personal were kept employed.

Saggaf has protected the financial stability of his staff income, ensured valuable cost cutting management, shown excellent performance of crisis management, and exceptional negotiation skills shown with authority regarding agreement restructuring and receivable payments.

To handle the loss of Umrah traffic to the airport, Saggaf chose to attract new airlines, mainly LCCs, to use the terminal with attractive offers and more reliable services. He built a new strategy by diversifying the airport offers. He prepared the facilities by deploying new technology and working on enhancing passenger experience. Saggaf also initiated a capacity building programme for the airside team by drafting SOPS, training and coaching, as well as initiating dedicated workshops to discuss ideas and to deploy new initiatives.

Leaders show strength in difficult times, and this is exactly what Saggaf showed and why he deserves to be awarded as the Person of the year 2021.

Head of Operations, Safety and Emergency

Belo Horizonte International Airport

Robson Freitas has developed and led the BH Airport plan for the resumption of airport operations post-COVID-19, as well as being responsible for leading the group of Directors and Managers at the airport, defining the three main pillars of recovery: Health and Safety of People, Institutional and Integrated Communication and Institutional Partners. These central pillars include ensuring hygiene and health and social distances measures for passengers, users, and the airport community, in addition to participating in strategic committees involving the public sectors to comply with regulatory rules. Freitas developed the COVID guardians programme, who were responsible in monitoring and following up on the measures already implemented for COVID-19 and advising users, employees and other people on compliance with distancing, hygiene and health measures recommended by health authorities. He also developed a COVID booklet with information and guidance for the airport community regarding good hygiene and health practices and led the beginning of the publication of a monthly newsletter with passenger curve information, allowing the planning of reopening and rehiring by commercial stores. Freitas also supported the reduction of OPEX by planning the temporary closure of areas, toilets and equipment in common use and internalising some activities.

Chief Strategy Development Officer

Bangalore International Airport Limited

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Raghunath worked closely with all the aero concessionaires and cargo operators to minimise disruption and provide financial relief to them. The airline marketing team helped launch a historic first route to the U.S. West Coast and the cargo team at BIAL also achieved record numbers over this period, with the airport becoming India’s leading airport for the export of perishables. Despite the impact of COVID-19, Raghunath has led a digital transformation and expansion at BIAL airport, with new initiatives and the deployment of the fully biometric-based self-boarding solution for seamless passenger flow and travel experiences and a process automation and analytics platform. These initiatives amongst many others, meant that the airport won ACI World’s ‘Voice of the Customer’ initiative, which recognised BIAL airports efforts to prioritise their customers during COVID-19. Raghunath has remained a staunch and resilient leader during such an uncertain time and is very much appreciated by his team.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Airport General Manager

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport

Balram Bheodari leads Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as North America’s most efficient airport, due to his vast knowledge of and astute attention to efficiency in aviation, which has allowed the airport to thrive in the most difficult of markets. Bheodari combines operational expertise, integrity, and selflessness to provide a quality of leadership throughout Atlanta Airport. He oversees all facets of airport governance, including operations and a multi-billion-dollar capital improvement programme, ATLNext, designed to pave the way for Atlanta’s growth over the next 20 years. During COVID-19, Bheodari developed a comprehensive resumption of operations playbook that served to support ATL’s recovery efforts. With guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid evolving health and safety guidelines, Bheodari steadfastly encouraged collaboration among stakeholders, team-building among aviation employees, and adaptability in uncertain times. Throughout the pandemic, he participated in daily calls with Airports Council International and other large-hub airports to share best practices as well as information from Washington, D.C. federal offices and the CDC.

He aimed to restore customer confidence and ensure the airport was a healthy facility using COVID-19 safe protocols. Since, the airport achieved Airport of the Year by the Airport Minority Advisory Council (AMAC).

During the height of the pandemic, Bheodari was the most ardent supporter of our mission-critical employees. Having worked his way up through the ranks, he fully appreciates the oftentimes thankless jobs these employees perform that keep the Airport safe and running optimally at all times. Morale never flagged because Bheodari made sure those employees felt valued through hazard pay, special meals, social media posts, intranet spotlight features, and other incentives.

His actions and his directives all reflect his commitment to the three key focus areas of our organisation’s strategic plan: people, purpose and performance.

CEO

Swedavia Airports

Jonas Abrahamsson has shown the strength to steer the company towards its long-term sustainable goals, despite the challenges of COVID-19. Abrahamsson has ensured that Swedavia achieved its net zero target for all ten of the airports in 2020 and has continued to support strategic development and innovation to further the cause of sustainable air travel. During 2020, when passenger numbers where down over 90 per cent and a lot of investments were paused, he decided that investments in the company’s net zero target should proceed, allowing Swedavia to become the first net zero airport group by the end of 2020.

Instead, it’s a layered task: multiple levers need to be put to work together, each one reducing and addressing emissions in its own way. Airbus is putting this idea into practice, combining four levers in a single flight.

Between 17-21 November 2025, Dubai Airshow will open its doors to the public. With the tagline ‘The Future is Here’, this 19th edition of the show has a focus on technological advancements, innovative products and technologies. Where better for Airbus to bring together four key complementary levers in a single flight – latest generation aircraft, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Book and Claim (B&C) and carbon dioxide removals (CDR) – to showcase how each of these levers can play a part in reducing the emissions gap.

Today, around 30% of the world’s in-service aircraft fleet are of the latest generation, which deliver a 20-30% fuel saving compared to their predecessors. Replacing older aircraft with more modern ones – like the Airbus A350-1000, which first entered into service in 2018, and requires on average 25% less fuel than previous generation aircraft – is a key way for the aviation industry to make progress towards decarbonisation.

In fact, it is an Airbus A350-1000, flying from Toulouse to Dubai, which will provide an opportunity to showcase the various decarbonisation levers in a single flight. While the use of all these levers in routine operations is still rare and challenging for airlines to implement, this showcase aims to emphasise the point that no single technology in isolation can help the aviation industry reach its decarbonisation targets.

Multiple levers, working in parallel

Industry bodies like ATAG recognise the complexity of decarbonising aviation in their Waypoint 2050 report (2nd edition, 2021). In their three scenarios which depart from a continuation of current trends, SAF remains the lever with the capacity to make the greatest difference, accounting for between 53-71% of emissions reduction contributions in 2050. This depends on the level of ambition and commitment with which the industry embraces decarbonisation and the particular levers that gain the most focus and support.

Alongside SAF, market-based measures such as carbon dioxide removals will be needed to close the emissions gap by 2050. This combination of SAF and carbon removals or other emission mitigation options presents the industry with a practical solution to many of the challenges that put pressure on the wider adoption of SAF.

Inspired by these scenarios, Airbus is deploying the following levers to address each tranche of emissions created during the flight:

Deconstructing our SAF, B&C and CDR showcase flight

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

The A350 is travelling from Airbus’ operational headquarters in Toulouse, France, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to participate in the Dubai Airshow flying display. For this flight the A350 will benefit from a 35% blend of physical SAF. The remaining 65% will be conventional aviation fuel (CAF).

Toulouse is well-served to supply SAF, as it benefits from not only the infrastructure at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport but also Airbus’ own dedicated fuelling facilities, but this is not the case for all cities. So what options are there when SAF is not readily available or where an airline or operator may wish to have a greater percentage of SAF than is physically available on site?

Book and Claim (B&C)

An airport or airline may be enthusiastic about using SAF, and willing to pay the additional cost to acquire it – SAF costs between 2-7x conventional aviation fuel, depending on the feedstock – but there may be logistical challenges that make it complex to have SAF delivered where they operate, for example, being located in a part of the world without easy access to SAF producers or suppliers.

For this reason, there exists an accounting mechanism called ‘Book and Claim’ that enables airlines and airports to be able to take advantage of SAF without needing to physically take delivery of it. We can use this to virtually replace the CAF on the flight. By using Book and Claim, Airbus purchases SAF emissions reduction certificates from an independent registry, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), an NGO that defines sustainability standards for SAF.

In simple terms, the Book and Claim mechanism allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Book and Claim could be a key lever in the scaling of SAF, connecting supply and demand and improving SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those located far from supply points or production facilities. In practice, this means the physical SAF is delivered to another operator, which then consumes the amount of SAF as indicated by the certificate.

Carbon dioxide removals (CDR)

Even by effectively replacing all of the fuel with SAF (through a mixture of physical SAF and through SAF Book and Claim certificates), emissions remain. Airbus will use carbon dioxide removal (CDR) units to neutralise the residual emissions of this flight. CDR is a credible measure for addressing residual remaining emissions by physically removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it. For this specific flight, Airbus has selected CDRs from reforestation projects in Mexico which are certified by the Climate Action Reserve (vintage 2022-2023).

What does this showcase reveal about aviation’s path to decarbonisation?

The whole industry needs to come together to tackle decarbonisation, from airlines to airports, and fuel producers to OEMs like Airbus, as well as regulatory bodies. We are playing our part: increasing the use of SAF in our own operations with fuel providers like TotalEnergies, participating in the SAFFA Fund alongside AirFrance-KLM Group and Qantas, amongst others, and investing directly in SAF producers like LanzaJet.

When it comes to Book and Claim, Airbus has launched its own Demonstrator in collaboration with RSB. The demonstrator has the ambition to facilitate demand from some of its smaller-scale customers and connect it with supply, making it easier for these clients to access SAF. Airbus has also been working to raise the profile and credibility of Book and Claim as a mechanism. As yet, Book and Claim is not recognised by the regulated markets – neither by the EU Renewable Energy Directive nor by CORSIA – however Airbus believes this could be a powerful lever to make SAF more accessible and is advocating for the recognition of this lever.

The aviation industry will not reach its long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions overnight. To achieve this by 2050 will take hard work, investment, regulatory support, and the willingness of all industry participants to drive progress. The industry agrees that multiple levers are the way to go. This flight takes that idea, and puts it in the air.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102142/642843-6f5j6v2vyc-preview.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 09:58:23.596283

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill introduces a statutory Revenue Certainty Mechanism to support the commercial production of SAF in the UK. It aims to reduce investment risk and enable the construction of first-of-a-kind commercial SAF plants, while directly contributing to the UK's aviation decarbonisation targets.

The first reading in the Lords took place on 20 October 2025, with the date for the second reading yet to be announced, but Royal Assent expected by the end of 2026.2

How the SAF Bill works: key features explained

Revenue certainty contracts To support investment in UK SAF Production, the Bill introduces a Revenue Certainty Mechanism. The Secretary of State may instruct a government-owned counterparty to enter contracts with SAF producers, guaranteeing a fixed ""strike price"" for SAF over a defined period.

If the market price falls below the strike price, the counterparty pays the producer the difference.

If the market price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays the counterparty the surplus.

This mechanism mirrors the UK's Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme used in low-carbon electricity and hydrogen, in which the mechanism aims to lower financing costs, boost investor confidence, and accelerate final investment decisions for SAF plants.

The mechanism is intended to be a time-limited measure to stimulate an early market for SAF and will become obsolete once investor confidence is proven on a commercial scale.

Designated counterparty The counterparty must be a company wholly owned by the government. It is responsible for issuing and managing contracts with SAF producers, handling payments under the strike price mechanism, and administering the overall scheme.

Levy funding The mechanism is funded through a variable levy imposed on UK aviation fuel suppliers, calculated according to each supplier's market share of aviation turbine fuel. This approach reflects the ""Polluter Pays"" principle under the Environmental Act 2021. This levy covers:

Payments under strike price contracts

Administrative costs of the scheme

The levy adjusts to market fluctuations through recurring charging periods, with potential redistribution of surplus funds to levy payers when market prices exceed strike price. Suppliers may need to provide financial collateral to ensure payment security.

Placing the levy on fuel suppliers distributes costs across the supply chain, targets those with SAF Mandate obligations and minimises administrative burden.

Administration and enforcement The counterparty (a government-owned company) is responsible for administering both the levy and the contractual framework, with oversight and support from the Secretary of State. To ensure compliance with levy regulations, the Secretary of State is empowered to impose financial penalties of up to £100,000 or 10% of a supplier's turnover.

Oversight and flexibility The Secretary of State retains powers to direct the government-owned counterparty, request relevant information, and provide financial assistance to support the scheme. Key regulations underpinning the mechanism are subject to parliamentary approval, ensuring appropriate oversight. The Bill applies across the UK, with consultation requirements in place for devolved administrations to ensure coordinated implementation.

Policy rationale The mechanism is designed to address key investment barriers – including technology readiness, feedstock availability, construction risk, and revenue uncertainty. It complements the UK's SAF Mandate, which requires fuel suppliers to blend a minimum proportion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, by offering long-term price certainty. Together, these measures aim to unlock private investment and accelerate the commercial-scale production of SAF in the UK.

By Craig Langford

Rolls-Royce is leading a new UK research initiative aimed at finding more effective ways to use sustainable aviation fuel to reduce both carbon and non-carbon emissions, the company stated.

The two-year project, known as Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), is co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). It brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport to study how smarter deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, could reduce the climate impact of contrails.

While SAF is already recognised for its potential to cut carbon emissions compared with fossil jet fuel, studies have shown that it can also reduce the number of ice crystals that form in aircraft contrails. According to Rolls-Royce, fewer and thinner contrails could lessen aviation’s wider climate impact.

Alan Newby, Director of Research and Technology at Rolls-Royce, said “SAF will not only play a vital role in decarbonising aviation, but has also been shown to reduce certain non-CO2 emissions. This project will demonstrate smarter ways of using SAF which could unlock additional value through reducing non-CO2 climate effects as well.”

Because contrails are only formed under specific weather conditions, most of the climate effect is caused by a relatively small number of flights. The QRITOS project aims to determine whether SAF can be prioritised for those flights most likely to produce persistent contrails, using flight trials, atmospheric modelling, and satellite data collected at Heathrow.

Marcin Dutka, Environmental Sustainability Technologist at Rolls-Royce and project manager for QRITOS, said “Measurements have already shown that fuel composition can influence contrail properties. This project aims to demonstrate how contrail climate impact might be reduced by targeting SAF at flights predicted to form persistent contrails.”

British Airways is contributing operational data from its fleet. “At British Airways, we believe sustainable aviation fuel is central to the future of flying,” said Tom Byrne, the airline’s Head of Net Zero and Environment. “Through the QRITOS project, we’re exploring how SAF can go beyond reducing carbon emissions to also help minimise the climate impact of contrails.”

Heathrow Airport is also participating. Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy, said “As SAF continues to scale it is important to take a closer look at how we can use it to deliver the greatest climate benefit. As one of the world’s busiest airports we’re proud to participate in this project to demonstrate how targeted SAF use could help to address non-CO2 emissions.”

The research team at Imperial College London will develop new computational models and satellite imaging tools to monitor contrail formation. Associate Professor Sebastian Eastham said “We will develop and trial advanced computational contrail modelling and satellite image analysis techniques, with the goal of performing both prediction and near real-time assessment of the effectiveness of targeted SAF deployment for contrail warming reduction.”

Industry Minister Chris McDonald described the project as an example of collaboration between government and business. “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation,” he said.

According to the ATI, QRITOS will conclude in April 2027 and aims to improve forecasting methods, advance understanding of contrail formation, and develop new ways to verify environmental outcomes using satellite data.",https://ifairworthy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Blue-IFA-Logo-Graphic.png,N,,2025-11-14 09:58:42.517114

On November 13, 2025, Airbus formally handed over the first A330-900neo to Air Algérie at its Toulouse delivery center. This event immediately launched the Algerian flag carrier into a new phase of long-haul operations. The aircraft, registered 7T-VTA and named “Novembre 54” in homage to the date that sparked the Algerian Revolution in 1954, completed its ferry flight the same day and touched down at Algiers Houari Boumediene International Airport to an official welcome ceremony. Exclusively powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, this delivery marks the opening chapter of a firm commitment for 10 A330-900neo aircraft, with deliveries expected to be completed by mid-2027.

Omar Ali Adib, Senior Vice President, Customers at Rolls-Royce, underlined the strategic importance of the partnership during the handover: “It is an honour to power Air Algérie’s new-generation widebodies with our Trent 7000 engines. For over 70 years, the airline has proudly served Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. Today, it is extending its global reach towards Asia and beyond. The arrival of the A330neo opens a new chapter of efficiency, sustainability, and ambition. Rolls-Royce is proud to stand alongside Air Algérie as it positions Algiers as a bridge between continents.”

The journey to this ten-aircraft contract began in June 2023 when Air Algérie originally signed for seven widebodies: five A330-900neo and two A350-1000s. Early in 2025, the carrier made the pragmatic decision to convert both A350-1000 positions into additional A330-900neo, prioritizing complete fleet commonality on the long-haul side to minimize training, spare parts, and maintenance costs. Subsequent option exercises and production-slot agreements subsequently increased the firm order to ten aircraft. The updated delivery schedule calls for four examples (including the one just received) before the end of 2025, with the remaining six arriving at a steady pace throughout 2026 and the first half of 2027. Temporary leases of both A330neo and older A330ceo aircraft are ensuring uninterrupted capacity during the transition period.

Air Algérie’s choice of the A330-900neo is rooted in a combination of operational efficiency and environmental performance that is particularly well-suited to its network profile. The Rolls-Royce Trent 7000, the sole powerplant available on the A330neo family, delivers a 14 % reduction in fuel burn per seat compared with the Trent 700 that equips the airline’s current eight A330-200s, while cutting perceived noise by half (6 dB) and offering full compatibility with 100 % Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Those improvements translate directly into lower operating costs at a time of persistently high fuel prices and ever-stricter carbon regulations on the carrier’s core European routes. With a range of 13,300 km in typical configuration, the aircraft comfortably enables non-stop operations from Algiers to Beijing, Guangzhou, Johannesburg, or even the North American East Coast without payload restrictions.

Inside, the cabin benefits from Airbus’s latest Airspace design: larger overhead bins, advanced LED mood lighting, higher humidity levels, and the quietest environment in its class. Air Algérie has opted for a three-class layout that places particular emphasis on long-haul comfort, featuring fully-flat beds in business class, a dedicated premium-economy section, and significantly improved economy seating with the newest generation of in-flight entertainment and connectivity options. Exact seat counts have not yet been disclosed publicly. Still, the configuration is understood to be in the 300–320-seat range, balancing premium offerings for diaspora traffic with the higher density required on high-demand leisure routes.

Operationally, the ten new A330-900neo will first replace the ageing A330-200 fleet, whose average age now approaches 18 years, and then fuel an ambitious expansion program. The very first aircraft is expected to enter commercial service before the end of November 2025, initially reinforcing frequencies to Paris, Montreal, Istanbul, and Dubai before inaugurating the long-awaited Beijing route. Guangzhou is scheduled to follow in 2026, while sub-Saharan Africa will see rapid growth: Ndjamena was relaunched in October 2025, and Addis Ababa, Libreville, Luanda, and several additional points are confirmed for the coming months, with a stated objective of doubling the airline’s African network by 2028.

This long-haul renewal forms only one pillar of a much broader modernization effort validated at the presidential level. Eight Boeing 737 MAX 9 will modernize medium-haul operations from 2027 onward, while fifteen ATR 72-600 will strengthen domestic and regional connectivity through a forthcoming dedicated subsidiary. By 2030, Air Algérie targets a fleet of 75–80 aircraft, with an average age reduced by more than half, restoring sustained profitability after the heavy losses incurred during the pandemic and enabling consistent double-digit annual growth.

For Algeria’s national carrier, the arrival of “Novembre 54” is far more than the simple addition of a new aircraft type. It represents the concrete manifestation of a strategic pivot designed to recapture market share lost to Royal Air Maroc, EgyptAir, Ethiopian Airlines, and the major Gulf carriers on key Europe–Africa corridors, while capitalizing on the country’s geographic position and the purchasing power of its large diaspora in France and Canada. With quieter, cleaner, and dramatically more efficient Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines powering its wings, Air Algérie has equipped itself to compete aggressively in an aviation landscape where sustainability and cost control are non-negotiable. The new era of growth promised by this first A330-900neo is now officially underway.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/75f19d50bbd7f16ccf14d26f9dfc6127_S.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 09:58:55.376372

Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago.

Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources.
Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services.","Globally, energy-related investments are set to reach USD 3.3 trillion in 2025, according to the IEA’s latest World Energy Investment 2025 report. Around USD 2.2 trillion is expected to go collectively towards renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, efficiency and the electrification of end-use sectors, with USD 1.1 trillion going to oil, gas and coal.

This analysis, prepared jointly by the IEA and the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), dives further into the latest data. It examines energy investment trends in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) since 2015, highlighting investment opportunities for the region as countries look to support economic growth, enhance energy security and accelerate clean energy transitions while ensuring energy affordability and access.

Latin America has some of the world’s best solar, wind and hydro resources, and it is a pioneer in the development of biofuels and renewable power. Leveraging these assets, the region has seen clean energy investment grow by 25% since 2015. Spending on renewables, grids, energy efficiency and electrification are on course to increase to about USD 70 billion in 2025.

Fossil fuel resources are unevenly distributed across the region; some countries are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, while others are major exporters. Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago. This year’s fossil fuel investment is expected to be about 20% lower than in 2015.

Overall, energy investment in the region is projected to reach USD 160 billion in 2025. This would be around 7% lower than a decade earlier, though this can be explained in part by cost declines over this period, both for both for upstream oil and gas activities as well as for key clean energy technologies.

Fifteen countries1 in the region have pledged to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. Meanwhile, a slightly different group of 15 LAC countries2 have put forward new Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement with targets for 2035. Across the region, meeting announced energy and climate targets would require a significant acceleration in investment in low-emissions power generation, grids and storage, low-emissions fuels, energy efficiency and the electrification of end-uses. Based on today’s policy settings, annual clean energy investments would exceed USD 110 billion by 2035, rising by 60% from current levels. However, in the IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario (APS), annual clean energy investment in Latin America would exceed USD 200 billion, more than triple anticipated investment levels in 2025. Investments in EVs would need the largest amounts of additional capital, with investment needs for energy efficiency and electrification nearly quadrupling and accounting for about 45% of end-use investments in 2035.

Grids in particular will need a boost in spending; as with many other regions, spending on distribution and transmission have not kept up with the rapid growth in solar and wind capacity. Today, for each dollar spent on new power generation in the region, less than USD 0.50 is spent on grids and storage. By 2035, this needs to reach about USD 0.85, with total spending on grids and storage reaching nearly USD 50 billion under the APS.

As energy transitions in LAC accelerate under the APS, investments in fossil fuels decline, reaching about 50% of 2015 levels by 2035. Total spending on fossil fuels drops by over USD 30 billion by then, with much of this reduction offset by a sharp increase in investments in low-emissions fuels, which rise to nearly five times current levels.

Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources. Northern Chile and Western Argentina have high-quality solar radiation, while the “Southern Cone”3 and Northern Colombia offer highly productive wind corridors. Brazil has well-established bioenergy and sustainable fuel industries, along with most of the continent’s installed capacity in distributed solar, utility-scale solar and wind generation. Capacity across these categories is also expanding in Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay. In the Caribbean, countries are exploring solar, storage and hybrid projects to reduce fossil fuel dependence and increase energy security. These are very much in line with the ambitious targets adopted in the region: Barbados seeks to establish a 100% renewable power mix by 2035, and Antigua and Barbuda aims to source one-third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. And many other countries, including Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia and Dominica, have policies in place to support significant decarbonisation efforts in the coming decade.

For the moment, the region receives only 5% of global private investment in clean energy, compared with 8% of private sector spending on fossil fuels. There are, however, multiple examples from across LAC that show how a clear vision for energy transitions and a willingness to engage with the private sector can produce results.

Across two auctions in 2024, Brazil raised nearly USD 4 billion to build almost 7 300 kilometres (km) of new transmission lines. In October 2025, another auction was successfully held for the construction and operation of more than 1 000 km of new lines. These investments, which aim to strengthen the grid, integrate more renewable energy and improve system reliability, show how competitive auctions can attract private capital for major infrastructure projects.

In Argentina, the first large-scale auction (AlmaGBA) for a battery energy storage system (BESS) targeted the installation of 500 megawatts (MW) of capacity in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. The market responded strongly, with over 1 300 MW in bids and a final allocation of around 660 MW. The programme focused on congested areas and enabled greater renewable integration.

In Honduras, energy storage is being used to stabilise the electricity system in regions where renewable expansion is limited by transmission capacity and variability, showing that flexibility solutions are spreading across the region beyond large electricity markets. The National Electricity Company (ENEE) launched an international tender in 2025 to contract 1 500 MW of firm capacity to secure electricity supply through 2030. At least 65% of capacity must come from renewables with storage under a multi-round reverse auction and a Build-Operate-Transfer scheme with contracts of about 15 years.

This year, the Dominican Republic, through its National Energy Commission (CNE) and the Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company (EGEHID), also launched an international tender for up to 600 MW of new renewable capacity with mandatory storage, with the aim of diversifying the country’s energy mix, reducing fossil fuel dependence and achieving 30% renewable generation by 2030 under long-term power purchase agreements spanning from 15 to 20 years.

In Chile, a strong regulatory framework is in place that encourages battery integration and transmission improvements as renewable penetration grows.

Overall, these initiatives show that countries across the region are actively fostering conditions for further growth in energy investment, particularly amid their shift toward more resilient, flexible and renewable energy-focused power systems.

Regional energy integration is a key tool to harmonise planning, facilitate decision-making and enable the development of larger-scale projects. In line with this objective, OLADE created in 2024 a Regional Energy Planning Council, whose goal is to act as a regional coordination platform that identifies opportunities for integration and promotes a common energy agenda by helping energy ministers share information, reach agreements and align national planning efforts. The broader aim is to speed up the energy transition in Latin America and the Caribbean by exchanging best practices and creating better conditions through coordinated sustainable energy policies and market integration across the region.

Another critical element is the implementation of stable frameworks for renewable energy auctions and contracts. Recent experiences in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic and Honduras show that competitive auctions and long-term contracts provide certainty to developers and reduce financial costs for investors. OLADE’s Regional Regulatory Convergence initiative reinforces this principle by promoting the harmonization of criteria and contracting practices that encourage cross-border and regional investment.

National incentives and regulations have an important role to play. For example, Brazil’s Fuel of the Future Law, passed in late 2024, could unlock around USD 4 billion per year in investments for sustainable fuels, including green diesel, biogas and sustainable aviation fuel. The law sets mandatory blending targets, carbon intensity mandates and incentives to expand biofuels, supporting the country’s energy transition and attracting private capital to the sector.

The availability of instruments to mitigate currency risk and public guarantees is another key factor in attracting foreign investment, while the expansion and digitalisation of electricity grids also serves as an essential enabler to unlock investments in distributed generation and large-scale renewables. Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services. As elsewhere in the world, robust energy planning in LAC remains central to creating a strong enabling environment for investments in a secure, affordable and sustainable energy future.

The G20 Roadmap to Increase Investment in Clean Energy in Developing Countries, developed by the IEA for Brazil’s G20 Presidency in 2024, identifies opportunities and actions to help achieve a rapid scaling up of clean energy investments. The roadmap outlines specific, timebound steps for increasing private financing in order to mobilise the investments required across different regions and sectors to build modern, clean energy systems.

The European Commission's DG ENER decision to, for the moment, exclude crop-based fuels from aviation decarbonization quotas under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation is problematic, David Carpintero, director general of ePURE, an industry body for European renewable ethanol, told Platts Nov. 13.

The approach makes compliance after 2030 nearly impossible for airlines while jeopardizing climate goals, he said.

""With the current version of ReFuel, you are making the life of airlines very dependent on some limited feedstocks,"" Carpintero said, referring to the EU's restrictive stance on crop-based feedstocks for SAF production. He argued that focusing on feedstock type rather than reducing greenhouse gas emissions misses the point of effective climate policy.

The comments highlight growing industry frustration with EU biofuel policy that prioritizes advanced biofuels made from waste and residues over conventional crop-based alternatives.

More than half of liquid biofuels currently in use are based on bioethanol produced from food crops, but this can be produced from a range of feedstocks, the International Energy Agency said Nov. 12.

Fuel ethanol demand is projected to grow to over 2.2 million b/d in 2027, with growth driven mostly by the US and Brazil, from around 2.15 million b/d in 2025, analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights said. European consumption will rise 5% from 153,799 b/d in 2025 to 161,174 b/d, while production will dip 2% from 106,255 b/d in 2025 to 103,670 b/d, Commodity Insights data showed.

Trade liberalization

Regulatory uncertainty comes as the European ethanol sector faces additional pressure from trade liberalization. The pending trade agreement between EU and the South American trade bloc Mercosur could boost low-duty ethanol imports, with Carpintero warning of ""a very negative impact on European ethanol producers"" from the cumulative effect of these multiple free trade agreements, Carpintero said.

Brazilian energy company Raizen sees potential for its waste-based ethanol — currently overwhelmingly earmarked for European road users — to grow its share in other transport applications as it ramps up capacity of the second-generation fuel over the next few years, a company official told Platts in October 2024.

Platts, part of Commodity Insights, assessed ethanol barges on an FOB basis in Rotterdam that had cleared EU customs at $826.15/cu m Nov. 12, slightly below its five-year average of $843.46/mt.

European ethanol prices surged to $987.86 in October, the highest level since April 2023, driven by several factors. Chief among these were the Dutch decision to no longer allow undenatured ethanol imports to count against the 2026 RED III targets, the lower corn crop in Southeast Europe, the slow pace of imports, and the downturn in deliveries from the UK plants to Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp. None of them are transient and therefore prices will remain well-supported in the months ahead, analysts at Commodity Insights said. Prices will remain volatile until the market has found a new equilibrium, they said.

Market opportunities

The renewable ethanol industry is identifying new growth opportunities in higher ethanol blends for gasoline. Technical specifications for E20 fuel – containing 20% ethanol versus the current E10 standard – are nearing completion and could create substantial new demand.

""There is a significant fleet of cars in Europe that will benefit from E20,"" Carpintero said, describing the development as ""a big step to continue the decarbonization of road transport.""

The higher blend could also open maritime applications, with marine engine developers testing ethanol-powered systems.

Bioethanol plays an important role in decarbonizing road transport, but growth opportunities are limited because of the widespread electrification of vehicles, the IEA said Nov. 12.

Ethanol as a marine fuel can ride on the increasing popularity of methanol in the shipping industry, Mikael Wideskog, Wartsila's director for sustainable fuels and decarbonization, told Platts in March 2023.

This growth potential could align well with the International Maritime Organization's net-zero frameworks, and it could be further fueled by global regulatory convergence, Carpintero said.

Bioethanol does not currently meet the requirements for consideration as a sustainable fuel by the FuelEU Maritime regulation if produced from a food crop, and, as a result, its future use depends to a considerable extent on whether it can be produced affordably using waste material, the IEA said.

Despite technical challenges, including the appearance of elastomers in fuel, the expansion into E20 and maritime applications represents the industry's strategy to offset regulatory and trade pressures while maintaining its role in European decarbonization efforts.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-14 09:59:34.755361

This move is hailed as a groundbreaking initiative to help reduce aviation emissions and accelerate the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a key part of the nation’s long-term sustainability goals.

The Green Aviation Fuel Levy: A Closer Look

The green aviation fuel levy is designed to promote the use of SAF and help reduce carbon emissions within the aviation sector. This levy will apply to air tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore starting October 1, 2026. The initiative is seen as a major stride toward achieving Singapore’s goal of adopting a 3 to 5 percent SAF adoption rate by 2030, a target that aligns with global efforts to reduce aviation’s impact on the environment.

According to CAAS, the revenue generated from this levy will be used to support sustainable aviation fuel initiatives and further strengthen Singapore’s position as a leader in green aviation. As the aviation sector grapples with rising emissions, SAF has emerged as one of the most promising solutions. SAF is produced from renewable sources and has a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to traditional jet fuel, making it a key enabler of the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

How the Green Fuel Levy Will Impact Passengers

The green fuel levy will be imposed on all passengers flying out of Singapore, with the amount varying depending on the travel class and distance traveled. This tiered structure aims to make the levy fair and proportionate to the distance flown and the class of travel. Here’s a breakdown of the levy charges for different passenger categories:

Southeast Asia: Economy and premium economy passengers traveling to Southeast Asia will pay SGD 1 for their flights.

Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea: For economy cabin travelers, the levy will be SGD 2.80, while passengers in premium cabins will pay SGD 11.20.

Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, and New Zealand: Economy cabin passengers will be charged SGD 2.80, while those flying in premium cabins will pay SGD 25.60.

The Americas: Economy class passengers will pay SGD 10.40, and premium class passengers will be charged SGD 41.60.

Additionally, passengers who are merely transiting through Singapore will not be required to pay the levy. For those traveling on flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

Cargo Flights and the Levy

Cargo flights departing from Singapore will also be subject to the green aviation fuel levy, though the charge will be calculated on a per-kilogram basis. This move extends the levy beyond passenger flights, ensuring that all sectors of aviation contribute to Singapore’s sustainability efforts.

The Broader Vision for Sustainable Aviation

The green aviation fuel levy is part of a larger strategy by Singapore to become a global leader in green aviation. The levy is designed to complement Singapore’s other sustainability initiatives, including the establishment of the GCC (Green Corridor for Connectivity) to ensure efficient and environmentally friendly air travel between key regions.

This levy is not just about collecting funds but also about raising awareness within the aviation sector and among passengers about the importance of adopting sustainable practices. It highlights Singapore’s commitment to being at the forefront of efforts to combat climate change, particularly in sectors that have traditionally been difficult to decarbonize, such as aviation.

In line with its broader sustainability goals, Singapore has set ambitious targets to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon emissions, with SAF being the cornerstone of these efforts. By incentivizing airlines to adopt SAF through this levy, Singapore is positioning itself as a leader in the global movement toward decarbonizing the aviation industry.

The Impact on Airlines and the Industry

Airlines operating in Singapore will also be impacted by the introduction of this green aviation fuel levy. While the levy directly affects passengers, it will also indirectly influence airlines’ decisions regarding the types of fuel they use. Airlines will be encouraged to adopt more sustainable practices and use SAF to offset the financial impact of the levy.

This development is expected to drive further investments into SAF production and innovation. The aviation industry has already made significant strides in this area, with various global airlines and fuel suppliers collaborating to scale up SAF production. The green fuel levy is a step toward incentivizing further research and development in the production of SAF, making it more accessible and affordable for airlines worldwide.

By introducing the green aviation fuel levy, Singapore is positioning itself as a key player in this global shift toward greener air travel.

Singapore’s green aviation fuel levy also sets a strong example for other nations looking to adopt similar policies. As more countries consider introducing their own levies or incentives for SAF adoption, the aviation sector will be better positioned to meet its emissions reduction targets. In the long run, this will help create a global market for SAF, driving down costs and making sustainable aviation fuel more widely available.

Preparing for the Transition

The introduction of the green aviation fuel levy will require airlines, travelers, and industry stakeholders to adapt to the new system. Airlines will need to assess their fuel sourcing strategies and determine how to incorporate SAF into their operations to mitigate the impact of the levy. Passengers, on the other hand, will need to be educated about the levy’s purpose and how it contributes to Singapore’s sustainability efforts.

The government has also committed to providing resources to help travelers understand the levy and its benefits. Public awareness campaigns will be rolled out to ensure that passengers are informed about the purpose of the levy and how their contributions will help drive the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

What’s Next for Green Aviation in Singapore?

Looking ahead, Singapore’s green aviation fuel levy is just the beginning of a larger, long-term effort to decarbonize the aviation industry. In the coming years, Singapore is expected to expand its initiatives to include more fuel-related levies, incentives, and policies that further encourage the adoption of SAF.

The move to implement the green fuel levy will likely serve as a model for other nations considering similar steps to reduce emissions in the aviation sector. By working together with global partners, Singapore hopes to set the stage for a future where sustainable aviation fuel is the norm, and the aviation sector contributes significantly to global efforts to combat climate change.

As more airlines and nations adopt SAF and invest in cleaner, greener technologies, the aviation industry can look forward to a more sustainable future. The green aviation fuel levy is an important milestone in this journey, signaling Singapore’s unwavering commitment to driving positive change in the global aviation sector.

Singapore’s introduction of the green aviation fuel levy marks a significant milestone in the country’s efforts to reduce emissions from air travel and promote sustainable practices within the aviation sector. By applying the levy to both passengers and cargo flights, Singapore is taking a comprehensive approach to tackling emissions and ensuring that the aviation sector contributes to the nation’s broader sustainability goals.

Singapore’s green aviation fuel levy, set to take effect in 2026, aims to reduce emissions by promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This levy encourages eco-friendly travel while supporting the country’s goal of achieving 3 to 5 percent SAF adoption by 2030.

As airlines and travelers adjust to this new system, the green fuel levy will help raise awareness about the importance of sustainable aviation fuel and the role it will play in reducing global aviation emissions. With Singapore leading the way, it is hoped that more nations will follow suit and work together to create a greener, more sustainable future for air travel.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-11-14T105632366.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 04:56:48.476837

Ambition Meets Implementation The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan represents a definitive commitment by the European Commission to unlock investment and regulatory stability for the challenging decarbonization of aviation and waterborne transport.","On November 5, the European Commission recognized its communication on the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), setting out a strategic roadmap aimed at accelerating the energy transition for the aviation and waterborne transport sectors. Positioned as a key element of the EU’s Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal, the STIP provides a unified approach to enhancing investments in renewable and low-carbon fuels (RLCFs).

While aviation industry alliances, such as DESTINATION 2050 and the International Air and Transport Association (IATA), welcomed the STIP as a constructive and significant step forward, noting it addresses long-standing weaknesses in the EU’s decarbonization strategy, major concerns remain over the scale of funding and implementation timelines.

What the STIP Promises

The STIP is structured around three main pillars – Strategic Framework, Financing Action, and External Dimension – and focuses on unlocking investments to meet the ambitious fuel targets established in the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime Regulations. By 2035, the EU expects to need approximately 20 million tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

To stimulate the market, the STIP outlines plans to mobilize at least €2.9 billion in EU support for sustainable fuels through 2027. Key short-term funding measures include:

InvestEU is expected to mobilize at least €2 billion for sustainable alternative fuels to help bridge financial gaps.

The Commission will allocate €300 million by the end of 2025 through the European Hydrogen Bank to support the production of hydrogen for SAF and sustainable maritime fuels (SMF).

The Innovation Fund will mobilize €153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects.

Critically, the STIP signals movement on key market mechanisms, including launching preparations for an intermediary mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers.

The Commission is set to launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project by the end of 2025, aiming to mobilize at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects through the organization of the first pooled double auction pilot. This double-sided auction system is commended by DESTINATION 2050 partners as showing growing recognition of the need for market-based incentives to scale up SAF production.

Aviation Implications

For the aviation sector, the STIP provides a long-awaited signal to tackle the “teething problems” of the SAF market. IATA welcomed the steps to assess extending SAF support under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) post-2030, exploring tradable SAF, and simplifying operator reporting.

The plan also refers to assessing the feasibility and design of a Book & Claim mechanism, which is one of the most effective tools cited by industry to ensure SAF accessibility across all EU airports, regardless of local fuel availability. IATA stressed that such a system is urgently required to promote regional cohesion and act as a key enabler for investments in SAF production facilities.

However, the industry requires certainty and commitment from the Commission that the Book & Claim mechanism will be developed and implemented as soon as possible, fearing delays. Furthermore, the commitment regarding the extension of SAF allowances under the EU ETS is seen as falling short of providing the necessary commitment, as the Commission only states it will “assess” such a possibility.

Funding Shortcomings and Biofuel Debate

The primary critique of the STIP centers on its financial scope. Driving the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels alone requires an estimated investment of €100 billion by 2035. In this context, aviation partners noted that the announced funding support of at least €2.9 billion until 2027 appears “disappointingly low and not commensurate with the scale of investment required.”

There are also deep concerns regarding the technologies being prioritized for support:

Biofuels vs. E-Fuels: Transport & Environment (T&E) warned that the plan “leaves the door open for biofuels being included in double-sided auctions.” T&E argues that auctions should be strictly limited to e-fuels (synthetic fuels like e-kerosene), which are the most sustainable and scalable alternative for long-term decarbonization but are currently struggling to reach final investment decisions (FID) due to high costs. Conversely, IATA advocates for a technology-neutral approach that supports both biofuels and e-SAF, arguing that limiting support risks undermining the scalability and cost-effectiveness of overall SAF deployment.

Neglected Technologies: In a letter organized by the SASHA Coalition, the STIP has been criticized for the absence of targeted support for hydrogen and electric technologies (zero carbon emission aircraft and vessels). Industry leaders urged the Commission to designate these solutions – which offer the most sustainable paths for short- and medium-haul routes – as strategic, priority technologies for investment.

ETS Revenues: The plan only “encourages” member states to use existing carbon market (ETS) revenues to decarbonize shipping and aviation. Critics argue the 2026 ETS revision should incorporate a requirement to earmark these revenues for e-fuels investments. Furthermore, extending the ETS scope to cover extra-EEA flights could have generated over €7 billion in extra revenues last year alone, funds that are currently being lost.

Connecting to Non-CO2 Impacts

The central measures of the STIP, including the financial support mechanisms and the focus on SAF, primarily address CO2 emissions through fuel mandates and investments in lower-carbon alternatives. While the ultimate impact of shifting fuel supply towards sustainable options may influence aviation’s total climate impact, the current STIP communication and funding allocations, as presented by the Commission, do not explicitly reference specific strategies or targeted support for mitigating aviation non-CO2 effects (such as contrails or nitrogen oxides).

Ambition Meets Implementation

The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan represents a definitive commitment by the European Commission to unlock investment and regulatory stability for the challenging decarbonization of aviation and waterborne transport. It takes critical steps by acknowledging the investment barrier and prioritizing solutions like the double-sided auction and the Book & Claim mechanism necessary to de-risk e-fuel production.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I_S5!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff2a6371-6b8a-4b60-b4dc-e812be446f33_1376x892.png",N,,2025-11-14 09:59:38.324223

The levy applies to passengers travelling in either the Economy Cabin, which includes Economy and Premium Economy, or the Premium Cabin, which covers Business Class and First Class.
In line with established industry methodologies for calculating cabin-specific carbon emissions, the levy for Premium Cabin passengers is set at four times the rate applied to Economy Cabin passengers within the same geographical band.
Economy passengers on these routes will pay S$10.40, while Premium Cabin passengers will pay S$41.60.
All SAF Levy collections will be channelled into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS.","The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced the introduction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy applicable to all passengers departing Singapore, cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights from October 1, 2026. The levy will apply to tickets and services sold from April 1, 2026, marking a significant step forward in Singapore’s strategy to accelerate aviation sustainability.

CAAS said the levy has been calculated based on the volume of SAF required to meet Singapore’s 1 per cent SAF target for 2026, as well as the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel, including associated costs for certification, blending, and delivery. To reflect fuel consumption differences by distance, the levy is structured into four geographical bands covering Southeast Asia, Northeast and South Asia, Australia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, and more.

The SAF Levy for passengers will be charged on a per-passenger basis and will vary according to both distance travelled and cabin of travel, based on four geographical bands established by CAAS. The levy applies to passengers travelling in either the Economy Cabin, which includes Economy and Premium Economy, or the Premium Cabin, which covers Business Class and First Class. In line with established industry methodologies for calculating cabin-specific carbon emissions, the levy for Premium Cabin passengers is set at four times the rate applied to Economy Cabin passengers within the same geographical band. Airlines are required to collect the levy directly and display it as a distinct line item on tickets. The charge applies exclusively to passengers departing from Singapore to another country, and excludes all transit passengers.

For flights within Southeast Asia, passengers in the Economy Cabin will pay a levy of S$1.00, while those in the Premium Cabin will pay S$4.00.

Travellers heading to Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea will incur a levy of S$2.80 in Economy and S$11.20 in Premium.

For longer-haul destinations such as Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, and New Zealand, the levy increases to S$6.40 for Economy passengers and S$25.60 for Premium Cabin travellers.

The highest levy applies to flights to the Americas, reflecting the significant fuel consumption on these ultra-long-haul routes. Economy passengers on these routes will pay S$10.40, while Premium Cabin passengers will pay S$41.60.

Cargo shipments will incur a per-kilogramme levy ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15, depending on the geographical band. Airlines or cargo operators must list the levy as a distinct charge on contracts and documentation.

For general and business aviation, the levy is charged per aircraft and varies by geographical band and the aircraft’s ICAO wingspan code (A–F). Charges range from S$40 for small aircraft operating in Southeast Asia to S$6,500 for large aircraft flying to the Americas. Exemptions apply for humanitarian, charitable, and training flights.

All SAF Levy collections will be channelled into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS. This fund will finance the purchase of SAF and SAF environmental attributes (EAs) and cover administrative costs. The newly formed Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) will oversee procurement and allocation to ensure transparency, cost-efficiency, and accountability.

The introduction of the SAF Levy forms part of Singapore’s commitment to the ICAO 2050 Long-Term Aspirational Goal of net-zero international aviation emissions. Under the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint launched in 2024, CAAS aims to reduce domestic aviation emissions by 20 per cent by 2030 and achieve net zero across domestic and international aviation by 2050.

To meet these goals, CAAS will roll out 12 decarbonisation initiatives across airport operations, airlines, and air traffic management, supported by enablers such as infrastructure planning, workforce transformation, and international partnerships. SAF adoption is a key pillar, with Singapore targeting an SAF blend of 1 per cent in 2026 and aiming to increase this to 3–5 per cent by 2030, subject to global supply and cost developments.

Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS said, “The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”",https://traveltradejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Singapore-Changi-Airport.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 04:57:29.316051

Themed “Bolstering Supply Chains and Manpower Resilience for a Sustainable Future,” the Assembly provides a critical platform for airline leaders across the Asia Pacific region to review industry performance, exchange insights, and address key operational and strategic challenges shaping the sector’s trajectory.

Industry outlook

Since 2022, air travel demand in the Asia Pacific region has demonstrated continued resilience, with international passenger traffic expanding by 10 percent during the first nine months of 2025. While the outlook for 2026 remains positive, growth is expected to align more closely with long-term historical trends. Passenger load factors remain elevated due to constrained capacity growth, as the industry continues to face an estimated global shortfall of more than 5,200 aircraft deliveries in 2025.

Maintenance and repair operations also face significant bottlenecks, with extended turnaround times driven by shortages of components and skilled manpower. Meanwhile, the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains nascent, with production volumes far below the levels required to support the industry’s decarbonisation targets.

Global trade and supply chain pressures

For the second consecutive year, supply chain constraints and workforce resilience remain dominant themes at the Assembly, compounded by renewed trade tensions and tariff measures that threaten to increase operational costs and disrupt the free flow of aviation goods and services.

Commenting ahead of the event, Mr. Subhas Menon, Director General of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, said, “The introduction of new tariffs at a time when global supply chains are still in recovery represents a setback for the aviation sector. Tariffs elevate supplier costs and undermine the principles of free trade on which global aviation supply chains are built. While passenger and cargo demand remains strong, persistent supply challenges could restrict airlines’ ability to meet the expectations of travellers and businesses alike. The air freight market, in particular, stands to be directly affected by escalating trade tensions in the months ahead.”

Sustainability and Fleet Modernisation

Mr. Menon further noted that supply chain disruptions also hinder the industry’s sustainability transition, as ongoing delays in new aircraft deliveries slow fleet renewal and extend the operational life of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft – potentially increasing the industry’s overall carbon emissions footprint.

“The Assembly serves as a vital forum for the region’s aviation leaders to discuss the current state of the industry and to chart a sustainable and resilient path forward,” Mr. Menon added. “Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the robust demand for air services, combined with the region’s strong economies and favourable demographics, continues to underpin optimism for the Asia Pacific aviation sector in the year ahead.”",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/favicon.png,N,,2025-11-14 04:57:36.911198

The biennial show’s choreography will be familiar: fighter jets in elegant formation, wide-body aircraft snarling down the runway and helicopters slicing the air. But the real spectacle isn’t confined to the sky. It’s in the closed-door rooms where deals, partnerships and future routes are hammered out. The star attraction remains flying taxis – eVTOLs (electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft) will take pride of place with test demonstrations, mock-ups and operational briefings. Companies such as Joby Aviation and Archer are still pushing for a 2026 launch of eVTOL passenger services between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Such optimism invites scrutiny. Certification is complicated, battery density still falls short of commercial requirements and early users will probably only be those able to afford premium pricing. Still, few places can match the UAE’s capacity to build infrastructure at speed and holding the event at DWC only reinforces that momentum. The airshow functions as the sector’s deal-making furnace. Previous editions have seen tens of billions of dollars committed on the tarmac, wide-body orders, defence packages and long-term service agreements.

The full cast of aviation powerbrokers will be in attendance: Boeing and Airbus with their supply-chain headaches and stretched delivery schedules; Gulf carriers Emirates, Etihad and new player Riyadh Air pushing expansion and next-generation fleets; defence giants looking to secure long-horizon programmes; and aerospace companies breaking ground in the Middle East. It’s a gathering where strategy chiefs, government delegations, manufacturers and financiers mix with an unusual ease. Everyone understands that this is the room where tomorrow’s aviation map is drawn.

And for all the deals and strategy sessions behind the scenes, the airshow extends a hand to the public. The Skyview grandstand will again offer families a vantage point from which to observe the aerial acrobatics, a reminder that aviation can still enchant, even as the sector wrestles with its heaviest challenges.

Sustainability is likely to dominate corporate conversations – and the industry finally appears to be moving beyond platitudes and towards climate action instead. Dubai Airports is preparing a sustainability showcase for the event, highlighting operational innovations, energy-efficiency systems, waste-reduction measures and emerging propulsion options. Still, the broader sector is in a bind: sustainable aviation-fuel production is nowhere near scale, hydrogen is promising but distant and electrification is only beginning to consider short-haul mobility. The airshow will present glimpses of a greener future but also lay bare just how far from that horizon the commercial fleet remains.

Dubai Airshow 2025 arrives at a moment of flux in which technology is advancing faster than regulation can catch up. Ambition is everywhere. Scepticism is warranted. But the aviation industry should ready itself to witness the winds of change next week.

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 if left unchecked. What I find particularly striking is that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) currently represents less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption globally. In my work with major airlines and energy companies, I’ve witnessed firsthand the immense pressure building for meaningful change. The aviation industry stands at a critical inflection point, much like the automotive industry did with electric vehicles a decade ago. We’re seeing unprecedented alignment between regulatory pressure, consumer demand, and technological innovation that’s creating the perfect storm for transformation. The current state reminds me of early conversations I had with automotive executives about EVs – there’s recognition of the inevitable shift, but genuine uncertainty about the path forward. What’s different this time is the urgency; climate commitments and public scrutiny have accelerated the timeline dramatically.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Cost and Scale Dilemma

The most immediate barrier I consistently encounter in my consulting work is the fundamental economics of SAF production. According to McKinsey & Company analysis, sustainable aviation fuel currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel. This creates an impossible equation for airlines already operating on razor-thin margins. I recently consulted with a major European carrier that calculated switching to 50% SAF blend would increase their annual fuel costs by over $1.2 billion – essentially wiping out their entire profit margin. The scale challenge is equally daunting. As Deloitte research highlights, global SAF production would need to increase by approximately 3,000 times current levels to meet 10% of aviation fuel demand by 2030. What many executives don’t realize is that this isn’t just a production problem – it’s an entire ecosystem challenge involving feedstock availability, refining capacity, and distribution infrastructure.

Challenge 2: Technological Uncertainty and Investment Risk

The second major challenge I see paralyzing decision-makers is the technological pathway uncertainty. There are at least seven viable SAF production pathways being developed simultaneously – from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) to alcohol-to-jet and power-to-liquid technologies. Each requires massive capital investment with uncertain returns. In my strategic foresight workshops with energy companies, I often use the analogy of betting on VHS versus Betamax in the early days of video recording. The World Economic Forum notes that the aviation industry needs to invest approximately $175 billion in SAF production capacity by 2050 to meet climate targets. The risk isn’t just choosing the wrong technology – it’s the timing. Companies that move too early risk stranded assets, while those who wait too long face regulatory penalties and competitive disadvantage.

Challenge 3: Regulatory Fragmentation and Policy Gaps

The third challenge that keeps coming up in my discussions with global aviation leaders is the patchwork of regulatory frameworks and policy incentives. Unlike the automotive industry where emissions standards are relatively harmonized globally, aviation faces a complex web of national and regional regulations. The Harvard Business Review recently analyzed how this regulatory fragmentation creates compliance nightmares for international carriers. I’ve seen airlines struggling to navigate conflicting mandates from the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, the US Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, and various national carbon pricing mechanisms. What’s particularly concerning is the policy uncertainty around long-term incentives. Many of the current tax credits and subsidies have sunset clauses that create investment hesitation. As PwC’s aviation practice notes, without stable, long-term policy frameworks, the business case for large-scale SAF investments remains precarious.

Solutions and Innovations

Despite these challenges, I’m incredibly optimistic about the innovative solutions emerging. In my research and consulting, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that are gaining traction.

First, the partnership model between airlines, energy companies, and technology providers is proving remarkably effective. United Airlines’ investment in Fulcrum BioEnergy represents a template I’m seeing replicated globally – airlines taking equity positions in SAF producers to secure supply and share in the upside. This aligns incentives in ways that traditional supplier relationships cannot.

Second, advanced feedstock development is addressing the scale challenge. Companies like LanzaJet are pioneering waste-to-fuel technologies that can utilize municipal solid waste and agricultural residues. According to Accenture analysis, these second-generation feedstocks could potentially supply up to 20% of global aviation fuel demand without competing with food production.

Third, digital twin technology is revolutionizing SAF plant design and optimization. I recently visited a facility where engineers are using AI-powered simulation to optimize production processes before physical construction begins. This reduces capital risk and accelerates time-to-market significantly.

Fourth, blockchain-enabled sustainability certification is creating much-needed transparency and trust in the SAF value chain. By providing immutable records of fuel origin, production methods, and carbon intensity, these systems are addressing the greenwashing concerns that have plagued early adoption efforts.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of current trajectories and technological readiness, I project that sustainable aviation fuel will reach cost parity with conventional jet fuel between 2030 and 2035. The International Energy Agency forecasts that SAF could account for nearly 30% of aviation fuel consumption by 2040 under ambitious policy scenarios.

What many business leaders underestimate is the exponential nature of this transition. We’re likely to see a tipping point around 2027-2028 where SAF adoption accelerates dramatically. My foresight exercises with airline executives suggest that early movers will capture significant competitive advantage through fuel hedging strategies and premium brand positioning.

The market size projections are staggering. According to BloombergNEF analysis, the global SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million today to over $30 billion by 2035. This represents one of the largest energy transition opportunities I’ve seen in my career.

Technologically, I expect several breakthroughs in the coming decade. Advanced biofuels using engineered microorganisms could dramatically increase production efficiency. Synthetic fuels produced using direct air capture and renewable electricity may become commercially viable by the late 2030s. The integration of AI and machine learning will optimize entire SAF value chains, from feedstock sourcing to distribution.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, sustainable aviation fuel will transform from a niche product to a mainstream energy source. Airlines that fail to develop comprehensive SAF strategies risk regulatory penalties, consumer backlash, and competitive irrelevance. The transition will create winners and losers not just among airlines, but across the entire aviation ecosystem. Fuel suppliers, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators all face fundamental business model disruption. The companies that thrive will be those viewing SAF not as a compliance burden, but as a strategic opportunity to build resilience and capture new value streams.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The sustainable aviation fuel revolution represents one of the most exciting and necessary transformations of our time. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The future belongs not to those who wait for change, but to those who have the courage to build it.” We stand at the threshold of reinventing one of humanity’s greatest achievements – air travel – for a sustainable future.

The EU Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), launched last week, aims to tackle this challenge head-on with a proposed intermediary mechanism that bridges producers and buyers, shares risks, and helps make e-SAF projects bankable. 💶 At Member State level: A first e-SAF pilot is expected to be launched with support from participating Member States through an intermediary that runs double-sided auctions - securing long-term contracts with e-SAF producers and shorter-term agreements with airlines. The funding gap would be covered via ETS auction revenues or national contributions, helping early projects reach final investment decision (FID). The Commission aims to mobilise at least EUR 500 million in Member State contributions - with Germany already signaling interest. At EU level: A follow-up intermediary mechanism at EU-level is foreseen to pool resources, coordinate auctions across Member States, and align with instruments such as the Innovation Fund, the Competitiveness Fund, and EIB loans and grants. The Commission proposes an indicative envelope of EUR 3 billion to deliver scale, efficiency, and cross-border coherence. Together, these mechanisms could be key in meeting the 1.2% sub-target for e-SAF by 2030 , increasing to 35% by 2050 in ReFuelEU Aviation. 🚀 Read more about our Sustainable Aviation Fuel solutions: https://lnkd.in/dWHGUs93",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQE9futOUgDHjw/feedshare-shrink_800/B4DZp8aM7WHsAk-/0/1763023835503?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Z2X5oeFB2RY_A_bibaC78oknUJtuR64gjtnZLmzM0pM,N,,2025-11-13 20:57:12.200244

However, researchers believe it could be transformed into a key ingredient for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). A new report from researchers at the University of Michigan explores pathways to recycle the existing carbon source into a climate solution for the aviation industry.

CO2 from ethanol fermentation is uniquely valuable. The fermentation process yields pure streams containing 85% CO2 by volume or higher, unlike gas streams from industrial processes. This makes it easier and less energy-intensive to capture. Because the CO2 was originally separated from the air by corn plants, capturing and reusing it for fuel creates a carbon-recycling loop that does not add new CO2 to the atmosphere.

Defossilizing Aviation Fuel

Aviation produces over a gigaton of fossil CO2 emissions annually. Researchers believe it is essential to find scalable, non-carbon stocks. The U.S. ethanol industry’s 2023 output of 15.6 billion gallons released 48 megatons of CO2. This presents a huge, ready-to-scale resource.

U-M research scientist Stephen McCord said, “It is exciting to explore whether this ‘waste’ stream can actually become a significant asset, turning inefficiency into advantage and accelerating the real-world application of emerging technologies.”

U-M researchers compared an existing corn-based SAF production method called Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) with two new CO2-based routes. According to researchers, the AtJ process is effective but achieves a carbon reduction of only 4.5% to 20% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The two CO2-based pathways, however, start by converting captured CO2 into syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). One path, Gas Fermentation, creates ethanol using syngas before using the AtJ process. The second path, Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, feeds syngas directly into a reactor to synthesize long-chain liquid jet fuel hydrocarbons.

A lifecycle assessment of the two methods projected substantial environmental benefits for both CO2 routes. However, the Gas Fermentation route was deemed the path with the “smoothest transition.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-50.png,N,,2025-11-13 17:56:29.400188

Great Falls is also home to Montana Renewables, the largest producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in North America.
“Great Falls, Montana, makes operations affordable,” Schalper says.
Walleye, northern pike, sunfish, crappies, bass, catfish can all be found in the river waters running through Great Falls.
Every year, the week of March 19 (Russell’s birthday) is marked by Western Art Week in Great Falls.","There is no shortage of drive and entrepreneurial spirit in Big Sky Country.

From the moment my flight touched down at Great Falls International Airport in early October, signs of the area’s economic, geographic and cultural identity began to appear.

One of the first things I spied from the airplane window was a U.S. Air Force plane, later identified as a Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The Montana Air National Guard and Malmstrom Air Force Base are both located in Great Falls. The Air Guard’s mission includes tactical airlift, firefighting and search and rescue operations. The U.S. Air Force will be modernizing its aging nuclear missile system at Malmstrom Air Force Base (on the other side of the Missouri River from the airport). The Malmstrom AFB Sentinel Missile Upgrade program will see an estimated $1.5–2 billion in direct spending in Montana for construction, infrastructure, housing and support facilities. Malmstrom AFB manages over 150 missile silos across north-central Montana. The project is expected to spur more than 3,000 construction jobs and over 500 long-term support and maintenance positions.

Leaving the airport to catch my cab to the city, a gust of wind almost immediately snatched away the Atlanta Zoo baseball cap I was wearing to shield my eyes and airport hair. This proved to be an excellent aerometric marker for the abundant wind energy resources in the region, harvested via wind turbines that pepper the Great Falls landscape.

Welcome to the Electric City

And what a landscape it is: The Little Belt Mountains, Square Butte and the Rockies color the surrounding horizon of Great Falls, which at 60,000 residents is the third most populated city in the state after Billings and Missoula. Running through the city’s center is the Missouri River, which I walked alongside the next day with Jake Clark, vice president of business development at Great Falls Development Alliance. He told me about the moves being made to build out the local energy infrastructure.

“Great Falls has a really long history with energy,” Clark said, noting the several hydroelectric dams in the city that once powered copper production in the city. The Anaconda Copper Mining Company was the copper smelting and refining complex, in operation for about 100 years until its closure in 1980, that put Great Falls on the map. A power-intensive project that exemplified one of the first commercial uses of hydroelectric power, the refinery also smelted copper that would eventually be used in the early days of electrification across the country.

And the region continues to see big wins in energy and fuel.

“Our refinery cracked the code on sustainable aviation fuel,” says Clark about the Calumet Montana Refining facility. Great Falls is also home to Montana Renewables, the largest producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in North America. “And there’s a couple-billion-dollar upgrade ongoing right now to stay on the top of that hill,” Clark says of the $1.67 billion expansion at Montana Renewables supported by a U.S. Department of Energy loan guarantee, the largest clean energy investment in Montana. “So, they’ll be doing significantly more.”

Green hydrogen is also on the table for the Calumet refinery and at Montana Renewables. Most green fuels produced at the facilities are shipped to California, where state tax credits help incentivize that portion of the energy supply chain. “It’s farm-to-table jet fuel,” Clark says about the whole operation. “In addition to what is going on at our refinery now, Berkshire Hathaway Energy recently purchased what’s called the Montana Alberta Tie Line. If you go north of Great Falls, you see large wind farms. Those wind farms feed that line, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy purchased that in order to develop more energy business on the U.S. side of that line … We see the potential for a data center cluster between here and the Canadian border in our region to do several other data centers because we have more independent power generation than any other part of the state as well as the potential to develop some behind-the-meter additional assets. And we have enough acreage for supersites.”

A 600-MW hyperscale data center coming to the Great Falls area from Atlanta-based TAC Data Centers will span 569 acres and include 2 million sq. ft. under roof. The data center, dubbed Project Cardinal, is planned for an area near the AgriTech Park, north of Malstrom Air Force Base and near the Great Falls Rainbow Power Substation, with construction of the whole campus expected to be completed by 2030. Power capacity will be between 500 and 600 MW across several buildings, supported by two on-site substations. TAC is reported to be investing between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in the facility, which is projected to create 1,500 to 2,000 construction jobs and 150 to 200 high-paying permanent positions.

“We have the fiber,” Clark says about Great Falls’ potential for advanced digital infrastructure. “We have the water. We have the land. And we’re working on talent.”

Berkshire Hathaway Energy Montana will add a 72-MW battery system near Cut Bank (less than two hours from Great Falls), a 100-MW solar farm on about 1,000 acres in north-central Montana (expected to be complete in 2026) and a new Great Falls control center to complement the existing wind farms attached to the Montana Alberta Tie Line (MATL) connecting southern Alberta to Great Falls.

Always Improving

Since 2020, the city of Great Falls has experienced more economic activity, major investments and population growth than it’s seen in 40 years. Stability and affordability make the city a prime location for business, says Jolene Schalper, executive vice president at Great Falls Development Alliance.

“Great Falls, Montana, makes operations affordable,” Schalper says. “We have a long history of low taxes and stable governance. We seek out tools to aid our industries and are able to work in tandem with elected officials for meaningful policy change. Our job is to listen to you and identify ways to help you thrive. Your bottom line is ours. Your team are our neighbors. The focus on long-term relationships is a key component of why Great Falls, Montana, is a great place to do business.”

In addition to the business-friendly climate that the city and state have to offer, quality of life is always improving. On the city’s east side, the mixed-use development “The Falls,” expected to launch construction in late 2026, will be a 100-acre, $500 million to $700 million project featuring retail, hotel, homes, restaurants, trails and public spaces with the goal of becoming a shopping and living hub over the next two decades. Led by Mitchell Development & Investments, the project will measure 630,000 sq. ft. and host two hotels, 831 residential units and 20 acres of public space.

The area’s quality of life can also be measured by a long list of recreation, cultural and hospitality assets, including River’s Edge Trail, an urban trail system where I took an e-bike tour. The trail features nearly 60 miles of pathways (21 of them paved) and strings together several parks, sculptures and gazebos, connecting to the Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center, the Great Falls Civic Center, Riverside Railyard Skate Park, West Bank Park and Giant Springs State Park.

The Missouri River also supplies an abundance of fish for anglers. Walleye, northern pike, sunfish, crappies, bass, catfish can all be found in the river waters running through Great Falls. Blue ribbon trout fishing off the Missouri is also seen south of the city, and salmon has been known to also populate the river. This veritable haul lends itself to a strong local fishing economy which in 2024 contributed $910 million to Montana’s GDP, according to an August 2025 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research.

In downtown Great Falls, restaurant and bar Enbär, live music venue The Newberry, arcade bar Sidequest and ice cream shop Big Dipper form a thread of lively options all owned and operated by a local group of investors and entrepreneurs (Enbar Inc.) who also own the minor league baseball team, the Great Falls Voyagers.

A local family of entrepreneurs, the Tronsons, operate the successful 5th & Wine wine bar and restaurant, headed by patriarch Mark Tronson, as well as Buffalo Blanc, a local café & coffee bar run by daughter Whitney Tronson. Soon, the Tronson family will also add a sister wine & beer bar, Buffalo Noir, to their portfolio in Great Falls, which will be run by another Tronson daughter, Tara.

Other stops in the city that will delight include independent bookstore Cassiopeia Books (owned and operated by retired Brooklyn attorney Millie Whalen), Central Avenue Meats owned by head butcher Drew Hicks that sources beef and pork locally from McCafferty Ranch and Faltree Farms, respectively, and The Farmer’s Daughter Fibers, a nationally known yarn and fabric shop run by Candice English.

Visitors seeking an experience that reaches back to an earlier time will love the Sip ‘n Dip Lounge, in operation since 1962. The tiki bar, located in the historic O’Haire Inn downtown, features “mermaids” who swim up and greet patrons in an aquarium-like window view (sadly closed during my visit), kooky and vibrant tropical-themed art, a 64-ounce cocktail (the “fishbowl”) and a jazzy live musical performer.

Healthy Environment for Growth

The local hospital system in Great Falls, Benefis Health Systems, will be expanding its facilities with several new and upgraded services to better serve the health care needs of the community. Construction is currently underway on a Healthy Aging Center, a 15,000-sq.-ft. outpatient clinic expected to open in 2026 that will provide audiology, mobility and geriatric services. The Sanavita Estates Senior Living development will span nearly 43 acres with a 64-unit apartment building and 28 villas for 55+ individuals and provide quality-of-life amenities such as a wine bar, ice cream parlor and a wellness center. Benefis Health Systems also recently saw an expansion of its endoscopy lab, adding rooms and bays and cutting wait times, and a renovation of its Sletten Cancer Institute that will improve patient comfort with additional infusion chairs, private treatment rooms and larger lab and pharmacy space. A new walk-in urgent care clinic with on-site pharmacy, lab, imaging and occupational health services is also expected to open in late 2025.

In 2023, a new extension campus of Touro University, a Harlem-based private medical school system in New York City, opened in Great Falls — the Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine (TouroCOM). The 100,000-sq.-ft. medical school campus houses classrooms, an anatomy lab, a simulation center and more. Three students who will be part of the first group of medical school graduates to complete their education at TouroCOM told me the biggest draws of the school were its focus on providing care for those who need it most and its welcoming environment.

“I chose Touro because I wanted to explore a new state and environment that is different, coming from big cities,” says Shantell Angarita, who hopes to complete her residency in emergency medicine. “I was drawn toward the philosophy that Touro supports in serving patients in underserved areas.”

For Jireh Gerry, Touro was a perfect match for her goals of becoming an OB-GYN and also serving those same underserved populations.

“I chose Touro because the environment was so friendly and so refreshing from what I was used to in Los Angeles,” she says. “Additionally, the program at Touro truly helps equip student doctors to be able to serve underserved communities, which is my goal when I become a physician.”

Touro is a Jewish university system with several locations globally. Notably, the campus in Great Falls demonstrates respect for religions and walks of life from all over, providing kosher and halal cafeteria options and ways to learn and practice medicine for learners who come from different cultural backgrounds, such as providing simulation and computer-aided training for students who are not allowed to dissect cadavers due to spiritual beliefs.

The program at TouroCOM in Great Falls is expected to graduate 135 physicians each year.

Cowboys & Artists

Great Falls has a storied history of great art, dating back to the late 1800s and famed American artist of the American West Charles Marion Russell, who was one of the highest paid artists in the U.S. by the 1920s (largely helped by the business management acumen of his wife, Nancy Cooper Russell). Raised in Missouri, Russell moved to Montana at age 16 to work on ranches and lived there the rest of his life, eventually becoming a self-taught, full-time and prolific creator of Western works.

Every year, the week of March 19 (Russell’s birthday) is marked by Western Art Week in Great Falls. Millions of dollars in fine art are exhibited and sold at this event held at different locations in Great Falls, culminating in the Russell Auction — the hallmark fine art fundraising event held at the C.M. Russell Museum.",https://siteselection.com/media/Favicon-100x100.png,N,,2025-11-13 14:57:05.610509

LanzaJet has achieved a global first, confirming that its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia, is now fully operational and producing on-spec jet fuel from ethanol at a commercial scale.

This marks the first time that alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel has been manufactured in a commercial-scale facility anywhere in the world, and the first time a non-oil-based sustainable aviation fuel pathway beyond HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) has reached this level of maturity.

The plant integrates several first-of-a-kind technologies, including LanzaJet’s proprietary ethanol-to-jet process, Technip Energies’ Hummingbird ethanol to ethylene unit, and an oligomerisation system developed jointly by the US Department of Energy and LanzaTech. LanzaJet brings these systems together into a continuous, end-to-end operation that produces fully certified jet fuel ready for blending.

The project represents over $300 million of investment and employment of more than 300 workers during construction. Around 65 direct and indirect roles remain in ongoing operations.

Company Chief Executive Jimmy Samartzis called the milestone “a major win for global aviation” and a demonstration of what is possible when research, engineering, and commercial deployment align. LanzaJet says the facility now serves as the template for future ATJ projects around the world.

How ethanol-to-jet unlocks new feedstocks beyond HEFA for SAF

This development addresses one of the central challenges facing the aviation sector. Almost all current SAF production is based on HEFA, and multiple expert bodies have warned that HEFA feedstocks are approaching their limit. Used cooking oil, animal fats, and related bio-oils cannot meet long-term demand, even with aggressive expansion.

ATJ directly broadens the supply base. Ethanol is produced at an industrial scale in multiple regions, and can also be derived from waste biomass, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon. This allows countries with established ethanol industries to build domestic SAF capacity rather than rely on imports, reducing exposure to the feedstock constraints that have shaped the SAF market to date.

Freedom Pines demonstrates that a non-HEFA SAF pathway can operate reliably at a commercial scale, providing a reference design for other nations and investors. For airlines, it confirms that one of the most discussed next-generation SAF technologies can now deliver real volumes.

The timing is critical. With SAF mandates tightening in the EU, UK, and US, regulators have been clear that new pathways must reach commercial readiness before 2030 if long-term targets are to be met. Until now, few technologies had crossed that threshold.

What LanzaJet’s breakthrough means for future SAF production

LanzaJet intends to license and deploy its ATJ technology globally. The company is already working with partners in the US, UK, Japan, Australia, India, the EU, the Middle East, and South America. Freedom Pines is expected to serve as the model for future facilities, giving investors and governments a proven baseline for performance and integration.

The next phase will focus on replication at larger scales, cost reduction as plants mature, and securing long-term ethanol supply agreements, especially from waste and residue sources. The aviation sector will be watching closely to see whether ATJ plants can be brought online more quickly and reliably than other next-generation SAF projects, including Power to Liquid.

If successful, ATJ could become the first major post-HEFA pathway to deliver meaningful volumes of SAF before the end of the decade, easing supply pressure and helping airlines meet rising blend requirements. In a market defined by uncertainty, LanzaJet has now provided one of the clearest signs that the next wave of SAF production is finally beginning to materialise.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lanzajet-ethanol-to-jet-fuel-SAF-plant-at-Freedom-Pines.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:56:53.678677

This isn't really new. People have been working on this for over a decade now and unfortunately it has been a rocky road. In the US, interest as of late has all but evaporated due to uncertainty in the regulatory regime. The failure of the Fulcrum Bioenergy SAF project in Nevada didn't help boost enthusiasm for investing in these types of projects either. Fortunately, there are still opportunities abroad.

Trying to convince yourself that any kind of ""sustainable"" aviation is possible is delusional.

On 29 October 2025, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (""DESNZ"") published the Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan (the ""Plan"")1– a policy framework setting out how the UK will meet its statutory Carbon Budgets 4 to 6, covering the period 2023 to 2037.

The Plan has been published shortly before states meet at the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Belem (COP 30). One of the stated objectives of the Plan is to integrate the UK's national carbon budget with its international commitments on climate change mitigation, including the 2030 and 2035 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. It also marks a renewed phase in UK climate policy, which combines emissions-reduction targets with a growth-oriented industrial strategy. It seeks to accelerate progress toward net zero by 2050, while strengthening energy security, lowering household bills, and positioning the UK as a global destination for clean-energy investment.

What are carbon budgets?

Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the UK is legally bound to cap its total greenhouse gas emissions within successive five-year ""carbon budgets."" These budgets serve as interim milestones to ensure the UK remains on course for its long-term net-zero target. Each budget is set 12 years in advance based on recommendations from the Climate Change Committee and is legally binding, making them a central pillar of the UK's climate governance framework.

The UK is currently operating within Carbon Budget 4 (2023-2027) and is broadly on track to comply. Carbon Budget 6 (2033-2037) was set in 2021, and the level for Carbon Budget 7 (2038-2042) must be confirmed by June 2026. These legally binding limits provide the structural pathway for climate policy, shaping regulation, investment priorities and compliance obligations across the economy.

Why do they matter?

Carbon budgets translate the UK's long-term net-zero ambition into enforceable and intermediate targets, which create a structured pathway for emissions reduction. They shape government policy, regulatory frameworks and market signals, and also provide clarity and certainty for key stakeholders navigating the energy transition. The adequacy and transparency of previous UK carbon budgets have been subject to legal scrutiny in the English courts, with questions raised about their compliance with statutory requirements under the Climate Change Act.

What the Plan Proposes

The Plan outlines how the Government intends to deliver the UK's carbon budgets while driving economic growth and energy resilience. It consolidates over 300 policies and proposals across key sectors, such as power, industry, transport, heat and land use, which reflects a more integrated approach than previous climate strategies. Central themes include:

Energy security and diversification: with continued emphasis on scaling up renewable generation, nuclear power and low-carbon hydrogen. The Plan identifies key national infrastructure priorities, including the delivery of Sizewell C in East Anglia and the expansion of carbon-capture and storage projects in the North West and North East, both viewed as essential to maintaining stable baseload supply and supporting industrial decarbonisation.

Economic growth through clean technology: highlighting the UK's ambition to position itself as a global leader in green finance and net-zero innovation. The Plan forecasts the creation of 400,000 new jobs by 2030, underpinned by major investments in offshore-wind infrastructure in Wales and Scotland, grid upgrades and manufacturing of electric vehicle components.

Transport and industry: the Plan also highlights measures to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors, including aviation. The forthcoming Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate came into effect in 2025, requiring SAF to comprise 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, rising linearly to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The mandate is intended to stimulate innovation in advanced fuels, promote the diversification of feedstocks and reduce reliance on limited bio-based resources. Beyond its emissions benefits, the policy is designed to attract private investment in domestic SAF production facilities and to position the UK as a competitive hub for low-carbon aviation fuel production and technology.

The Plan follows a period of legal and political scrutiny over earlier government climate strategies, which courts found insufficient under the Climate Change Act 2008. This iteration is therefore more data-driven and designed to be litigation-resilient, setting out clearer sectoral milestones, accountability mechanisms and evidence-based modelling to demonstrate compliance with statutory carbon budgets.

Financing and Investor Signalling

For the first time, the Plan is accompanied by a dedicated Investor Prospectus4 aimed at translating the UK's climate ambition into clear investment opportunities and financing pathways. The Investor Prospectus was developed with the Department for Business and Trade's Office for Investment and provides high-level guidance on where investors (from institutional financiers to infrastructure developers) can identify opportunities within the UK's net-zero transition.

In the coming months, DESNZ is expected to release a series of detailed sector factsheets, providing further clarity on policy interventions, timelines and anticipated impacts on power, heat, buildings, transport and industry.

For market participants, the Investor Prospectus signals a more transparent, partnership-based model for climate investment. It may potentially also inform due diligence and financing assumptions, particularly for long-term infrastructure and energy projects.

UK Methane Action Plan

Published in parallel, the UK Methane Action Plan5 complements the Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan by focusing on reducing methane emissions domestically and internationally. It sets out actions across agriculture, energy and waste, which are sectors responsible for a significant share of the UK's methane output, and also reaffirms the UK's commitment to the Global Methane Pledge, which targets a 30% global reduction by 2030 from 2020 levels. Recent efforts include the UK being elected Co-Chair of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition alongside Brazil in February 2025, signalling a strengthened commitment to international collaboration, as well as the promotion of the use of Earth Observation technologies to improve the monitoring and verification of methane emissions, a move intended to enhance transparency and data-driven policymaking. Connections and comparisons will be drawn with the EU Methane Reduction Regulation (MERR), discussed here.

Conclusion

The Plan sets a clearer pathway for how the UK intends to meet its statutory carbon budgets while promoting investment and energy security. In the suite of documents accompanying the Plan, the Government has also published a report on ""Unlocking the benefits of the clean energy economy""6, setting out the government's overarching strategy to reduce emissions to enhance energy security and create economic growth, as well as its response to the Climate Change Committee's Progress Report.7 Together, the Plan provides greater policy transparency for investors and businesses, particularly across the power, industry and transport sectors. However, delivery will depend on timely implementation of enabling regulation and funding mechanisms. It is important that organisations operating in affected sectors monitor upcoming DESNZ updates, which will define the detailed measures needed to achieve the UK's net-zero trajectory.

LanzaJet, Neste, World Energy, Gevo, and Alder Fuels are among the key players in the sustainable aviation fuel space, developing innovative technologies and scaling up production.
Furthermore, ensuring a consistent and high-quality feedstock supply from municipal waste requires robust waste management and sorting systems.","The mounting challenge of global waste management meets the urgent need for aviation decarbonization in a groundbreaking solution: transforming municipal solid waste (MSW) into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This innovative approach promises not only to divert mountains of trash from landfills but also to power airplanes with up to 90% lower emissions compared to conventional jet fuel, offering a compelling pathway toward a cleaner, more circular economy for air travel.

The Dual Challenge: Waste Crisis and Aviation Emissions

Cities worldwide grapple with ever-increasing volumes of municipal solid waste, a complex stream of organic matter, plastics, paper, and other materials. Traditionally, much of this waste ends up in landfills, consuming valuable land and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions through decomposition, or is incinerated, which can contribute to air pollution. Simultaneously, the aviation sector faces intense pressure to reduce its environmental footprint. Airplanes currently account for approximately 2.5% of global planet-warming gas pollution, and without significant intervention, these emissions are projected to more than double in the coming decades as air travel demand surges.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a critical solution for decarbonizing aviation. Unlike traditional jet fuel derived from fossil sources, SAF is produced from renewable and waste-derived resources, such as agricultural residue, used cooking oil, forestry waste, animal fats, and critically, municipal solid waste.

The Science of Turning Trash into Thrust

The conversion of municipal solid waste into jet fuel is a sophisticated process that typically involves several key stages, predominantly relying on thermochemical conversion technologies.

Gasification: Breaking Down the Waste

The journey begins with gasification, where pre-processed MSW is heated in a controlled, oxygen-limited environment. This process breaks down the solid, carbon-rich waste into a synthesis gas, or “syngas,” primarily composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This initial step is considered a core technical challenge in biomass energy development due to the heterogeneous nature of municipal waste. Improvements in gasification systems are crucial for scaling up this technology.

Following gasification, the syngas enters a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactor. Here, with the aid of catalysts, the carbon monoxide and hydrogen molecules undergo a polymerization reaction, combining to form long-chain hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons are the building blocks for various fuels.

Refining and Hydrocracking: Tailoring for Aviation

The hydrocarbons produced in the Fischer-Tropsch process then undergo further refining, often through a step called hydrocracking. This process breaks down the long-chain hydrocarbons into the precise molecular structure required for jet fuel (kerosene). The resulting fuel is chemically very similar to conventional jet fuel, allowing it to be a “drop-in” fuel that can be blended with regular jet fuel (currently up to 50% for commercial flights, though 100% can be used on modern airliners) and used in existing aircraft engines and airport infrastructure without modification.

Significant Emissions Reduction and Environmental Benefits

Studies, including one published in Nature Sustainability, indicate that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-90% compared to conventional jet fuel on a life cycle basis. This substantial reduction stems from both the sustainable sourcing of the fuel and the diversion of waste from landfills, which are a major source of methane—a potent greenhouse gas.

Beyond carbon emissions, waste-to-jet fuel also offers additional environmental advantages. The production process can lead to a 90% reduction in particulate matter emissions during combustion, contributing to improved air quality around airports. Moreover, by repurposing waste, this technology promotes a circular economy, conserves landfill space, and reduces pollution pressure on watersheds when wet wastes are utilized.

Global Potential and Economic Outlook

The potential impact of waste-to-jet fuel is significant. Researchers estimate that globally, more than 62.5 billion liters of trash-based jet fuel could be produced annually, which could cut global aviation pollution by 16%. If green hydrogen is integrated into the process, production could reach 80 million tons per year, potentially supplying up to 28% of global jet fuel demand and reducing emissions by as much as 270 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

Several companies are actively pursuing waste-to-jet fuel solutions. LanzaJet, Neste, World Energy, Gevo, and Alder Fuels are among the key players in the sustainable aviation fuel space, developing innovative technologies and scaling up production. Partnerships, such as the one between NetJets and WasteFuel, aim to establish biorefineries that convert municipal waste into SAF, with targets of converting millions of tons of waste into tens of millions of gallons of SAF annually.

Challenges and the Path Forward

Despite its immense promise, widespread adoption of waste-to-jet fuel faces hurdles. The primary challenge remains cost, with SAF often being significantly more expensive than fossil jet fuel. Scaling up the complex gasification process for diverse waste streams is also a technical challenge that researchers are actively working to overcome. Furthermore, ensuring a consistent and high-quality feedstock supply from municipal waste requires robust waste management and sorting systems.

Overcoming these challenges will require continued research and development, supportive policies, and financial incentives to make SAF cost-competitive and to scale up production facilities. The “waste-to-fuel” approach is a critical step in the aviation industry’s journey toward net-zero emissions, offering a tangible way to clean up the skies while simultaneously addressing one of humanity’s most persistent environmental problems. The opportunity to turn a negative-value waste stream into a high-value energy asset is a powerful driver for this sustainable transition.",https://enertherm-engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/file-569.png,N,,2025-11-13 12:57:03.577045

By 2024, that number had soared to 9.5 billion, and projections from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Airports Council International (ACI) suggest global air #travel could reach 22.3 billion passengers by 2053, nearly 2.4 times today’s volume.

Growth is driven by expanding middle-class travel in emerging markets, new routes, and the strengthening of global tourism networks. Yet, this expansion also brings challenges. Airlines remain committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) still meets less than 0.5% of fuel demand, with high costs and limited supply slowing progress.

As the world advances, balancing accessibility with sustainability will define the next era of global aviation, where progress in the skies must also entail responsibility on the ground.

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy will apply to out-bound passengers, but not transit passengers, from 1 October 2026.

The amount charged will depend on the distance flown – with four geographical bands – and the cabin of travel. Premium cabin passengers, which includes business and first class, will pay four times more than economy cabin fliers, which includes both economy and premium economy.

The four bands are as follows: Southeast Asia; Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea; Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands and New Zealand; and the Americas.

Those flying to Southeast Asia in economy will pay S$1 (59p), while those travelling in a premium cabin to the Americas will pay S$41.60 (£24.35).

The decision to charge premium cabin passengers four times more comes from the IATA Passenger CO2 Calculation Methodology for working out the carbon emissions of passengers.

Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS said, “The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

The money collected will go into a SAF Fund managed by CAAS, which will be used to purchase sustainable fuel.

Across two action-packed days, the event brought together some of the brightest minds in engineering to network, collaborate, and share real-world solutions to today’s toughest industry challenges. Key players from aerospace, automotive, and defence shared insights and looked ahead to the innovations set to shape the future of engineering in the year to come.

The event gave Exactaform the opportunity to learn from more than 200 expert speakers, connect with peers across the engineering landscape, and gain valuable insight into emerging trends and technologies. Of particular interest were developments within the aerospace sector, where discussions highlighted the increasingly critical role that precision tooling will play in driving performance, efficiency, and sustainability in future manufacturing.

Sessions on sustainable aerospace and ESG integration - led by speakers from Rolls-Royce, Innovate UK, and ADS Group - explored how achieving the UK’s 2050 net-zero targets will depend on collective action across the supply chain. From Philipp Visotschnig’s insights on the evolution of sustainable aviation through lightweight materials, advanced aerodynamics, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to Rolls-Royce’s pioneering work on composite fan systems that cut emissions at scale, the message was clear: sustainability and responsible engineering are now central to the future of aerospace.

For Exactaform, these conversations reinforced the company’s ongoing commitment to innovation, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. As industries like aerospace embrace cleaner, more responsible practices, Exactaform continues to play an active role in reducing environmental impact across the manufacturing supply chain.

For Exactaform, sustainability is a core principle guiding both its engineering and operations. It’s not only about the tools it makes, but how the company designs, manufactures, and collaborates across the supply chain.

Insights from leading aerospace players such as Rolls-Royce, which emphasised the shift towards sustainable design, lightweight materials, and energy efficiency, resonated strongly with Exactaform’s own approach. The company shares this commitment to advancing precision engineering in ways that reduce impact and support long-term environmental goals.

Exactaform’s specialised one-shot tooling solutions are engineered for high-performance machining of complex, lightweight materials. By combining multiple cutting operations into a single tool and delivering exceptional tool life, Exactaform helps manufacturers minimise machine run time, reduce energy consumption, and advance sustainable production goals.

At the event, Exactaform showcased its latest precision tooling innovations for the aerospace and automotive sectors, demonstrating how PCD and carbide tooling can lower cost per part, reduce cycle times, and improve component quality.

Visitors saw tooling engineered for lightweight, high-strength materials such as CFRP, aluminium, and titanium – supporting the industry’s shift towards energy-efficient, low-emission aircraft design. Products on display included the ExactaMil XE13 and XE22 Series of carbide end mills, newly launched in the USA, along with the Exacta-Set milling system – all designed for high accuracy and repeatable performance.

It specialises in aerospace, building technologies, industrial automation and energy solutions.

Through all of its operations, it follows its sustainability guidelines, with the aim of becoming carbon neutral by 2035.

Honeywell has been named 39th in Sustainability Magazine’s Top 250 World’s Most Sustainable Companies 2025.

Honeywell’s sustainability goals

Honeywell’s environmental priorities include the impact of its products and services, decarbonisation and its climate strategy.

It aims to be carbon neutral in its facilities and operations by 2035 and it has set emissions goals that are validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

These targets are to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2037 from a 2019 base year and to reduce absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 23% within the same timeframe.

In 2025, it achieved a more than 90% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas intensity since 2004.

It has also developed more than 6,800 efficiency, emissions reduction, water and waste projects since 2010.

The company predicts that its technologies will have a cumulative impact of mitigating two billion metric tons of CO2e between 2023 and 2030.

This is 175 times Honeywell’s projected Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions over the same period.

Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO at Honeywell, says: “From our efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to our work to minimise waste and conserve water, our commitment to environmental responsibility plays an important role in our efforts to drive growth across our operations.

“As a result, we are developing innovative products and solutions that help improve energy efficiency and are advancing offerings that help our customers reach their performance and emissions reduction goals.”

Providing energy solutions

With energy efficiency as a main priority for Honeywell, it looks for opportunities to upgrade and make existing equipment more energy efficient.

It is working on replacing elements such as dryers, compressors and pumps with newer and more efficient designs.

Honeywell has converted many of its facilities to using LED lighting and continues to replace outdated systems.

All of the company’s new construction projects are compliant with strict energy standards, using LED and occupancy sensors to maximise energy efficiency.

In 2025, Honeywell introduced a new technology that converts agricultural waste into renewable fuels for the maritime and aviation industries.

This produces lower carbon marine fuel, gasoline and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from abundant biomass sources.

Today, the prospects for the sector are more favourable in Europe.

While the SAF market in Europe has continued to gain momentum over the past year, sentiment in the US has cooled following the anti-climate stance of the Trump administration.

In Europe, visibility into revenues for SAF producers is getting clearer, while their US counterparts have spent 2025 shrouded in uncertainty.

Despite this, US corporates have been putting more money into funding initiatives for SAF. Just last month, a coalition of aviation players got together to launch the $150m Oneworld BEV Fund, anchored by American Airlines and Alaskan Airlines, and managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. That followed another group of corporates that backed the $100m United Airlines Sustainable Aviation Fund in 2023, which gained more LPs from the industry over the following year.

Regulatory cliff

But a US-based SAF investor was downbeat about the SAF market in the US. “It’s a different market from November of last year, that’s probably what the decisive turning point was,” says the investor, referring to Donald Trump’s election victory, which pulled a curtain down over sustainability initiatives backed by the US federal government, including subsidies for SAF developers.

“When the notion of the fund first got started, the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States, was much different,” says the SAF-focused investor.

“All this stuff takes lots of capital, and that capital really was going to be unlocked by virtue of government support, in one form or another, that was going to underpin the funding for it. That support has waned,” he says.

Federal tax credits in the US for sustainable fuels such as the 45Z credits under the Inflation Reduction Act which are given per gallon of SAF produced are less certain than they would have been when some startups last raised money. The new administration’s Treasury Department gave guidance earlier this year that softened expectations for the eligibility of certain feedstocks, and legislative proposals are in the works that might cap the credit-per-gallon below where it was expected.

45Z credits are meant to start this year but are set to expire in 2027 unless extended. That might change depending on the results of the mid-term elections.

At the state level, there are low carbon fuel standards (LCFS), which incentivise producers to lower the average lifecycle carbon intensity of their fuels below a declining annual target.

While LCFS rules are legally independent from federal regulations, the value of the credits is not unaffected by federal regulations. If 45Z support goes down, LCFS credits can actually become more valuable because there is less supply of credits overall, but any state-level increase would not likely compensate for the loss of federal support.

The SAF investor tells GCV that their portfolio companies do have enough liquidity for the next couple of years. For now, they’re in a holding pattern, watching to see how regulations evolve.

By contrast, European players are more confident. Both the UK and the EU have incremental blending mandates that are starting to kick in. The UK SAF mandate requires 2% of the UK’s aviation fuel demand to be met with SAF, ratcheting up to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

The EU’s ReFuelEU mandate starts slower but then accelerates faster than the UK’s, requiring 2% of member states’ fuel to be met with SAF this year, increasing to 6% by 2030, 34% by 2040, and 70% by 2050.

A European startup that recently raised funds is UK-based OXCCU, a company developing technology to convert carbon into fuels and chemicals. Its recent $28m series B saw more participation from corporates including Eni, Aramco, IAG, Safran, and Orlen compared with its series A. Encouraged by the success of its OX1 pilot plant at London Oxford Airport, it is seeking to open its second, larger demonstration plant next year.

Apart from OXCCU, other European SAF startups to get funded this year include Norwegian SAF producer Wastefront and Swiss SAF technology company Metafuels.

Tech advances

While SAF policy is progressing by fits and starts, the technology to produce low carbon aviation fuel is making headway. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and eSAF have expanded the feedstock landscape. A large amount of money is still needed to build out commercial-scale facilities, although it may prove to be cheaper to retrofit existing refineries that are not making money.

SAF producers are seeking to change the kind of feedstocks they are using. Regulators and entrepreneurs are prioritising carbon feedstocks such as biogas, waste wood, agricultural waste and captured CO2 because they don’t bring the challenges of food displacement that crop-based bio-fuels do.

“We can start from biomethane or CO2, and I don’t think CO2 is in short supply,” says Nacho Gimenez, COO at OXCCU, who previously considered investments in SAF while an investor at BP Ventures and energy investor DTEK. The problem becomes more a logistical one of capturing the carbon and transporting it than sourcing it in the first place, he adds.

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is increasingly popular because it takes waste products such as used cooking oil, fatty streams from industrial waste, and other fats and vegetable oils, and can heavily reduce the lifecycle emissions.

But the availability of sustainable feedstock for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids compared with other feedstocks such as cultivated palm oil is not enough to meet demand. It is also more costly.

eSAF is also gaining popularity because it is made with renewable hydrogen and captured CO2, typically reducing emissions by at least 70% compared with jet fuel. It circumvents the supply constraints of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and benefits from a sub-mandate for synthetic fuels under ReFuelEU.

Wider outlook

The price of SAF production is still high, requiring economies of scale and large capex.

The price of jet fuel is tied to oil, while the ultimate price of SAF is determined by negotiated contracts.

The capex for building the production infrastructure will only come if investors see that offtake contracts are available at a good price. And at least in the US, where there is no federal blending mandate, that’s even harder to picture than in Europe. Some US investors are taking a step back to see where things go before committing more capital.

“We’ve laid our bets around the space [in terms of technologies], but the market kind of in a trough right now as it relates to climate tech, and sustainability in particular,” says the SAF investor.

“We’re being very prudent and measured with where we deploy capital going forward.”

But, even in Europe, if the costs aren’t brought down by the time the heavier mandates kick in, those costs will be passed on to consumers. Volume by itself is not enough, it will be the most cost-efficient startups that succeed.

Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit organised by FICCI in partnership with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Minister underlined the urgent need for clarity, collaboration, and commitment among all stakeholders to meet the aviation sector’s growing energy demand.
“Our ATF consumption is projected to reach 15–16 million tonnes by 2030 and 30–31 million tonnes by 2040.
Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, Director General of Civil Aviation, noted that decarbonising aviation is a shared global responsibility.

Highlighting India’s 750 million tonnes of biomass capacity, he said the country could emerge as a global leader in SAF production, cutting carbon emissions and crude oil imports while creating up to one million green jobs.

Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit organised by FICCI in partnership with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Minister underlined the urgent need for clarity, collaboration, and commitment among all stakeholders to meet the aviation sector’s growing energy demand.

“The aviation sector continues to expand faster than most other transport segments, with an annual growth rate of 6.7 per cent and nearly 10 million passenger trips expected in 2025,” said Kinjarapu. “Our ATF consumption is projected to reach 15–16 million tonnes by 2030 and 30–31 million tonnes by 2040. The solution lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuels.”

He confirmed that the Ministry is finalising the SAF policy to accelerate adoption. “The Ministry has been taking robust steps to speed up the SAF movement, and we are committed to releasing the SAF policy soon,” he stated.

Highlighting India’s potential, Kinjarapu said that as an agricultural powerhouse generating over 750 million tonnes of biomass, the country can become a global leader in SAF production. This transition, he said, could reduce India’s crude oil import bill by US$ 5–7 billion annually and generate around one million green jobs across the SAF value chain.

Over the past nine years, India has added 90 airports and 400 aircraft, while scheduled flight movements have risen by 78 per cent . The government plans to add 50 airports in the next five years and 200 more over the next two decades, with passenger traffic projected to reach 500 million annually.

Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, Director General of Civil Aviation, noted that decarbonising aviation is a shared global responsibility. “Our ambition to achieve a 5 per cent SAF blending target by 2030 is not just a goal but a declaration of intent to lead by example,” he said.

Adding an industry perspective, Jurgen Westermeier, Chairman, FICCI National Civil Aviation Committee and President & MD, Airbus India & South Asia, called SAF a transformative opportunity. “For India, SAF goes beyond environmental targets—it can enhance energy security and sovereignty,” he said.

Ashish Saraf, Co-Chairman, FICCI Civil Aviation Committee and Vice President & Country Head India, Pratt & Whitney, added, “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the cornerstone of India’s Net Zero aviation story. It can reduce emissions by up to two-thirds, positioning India as a global SAF hub.”

But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.
A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80–90% compared with conventional jet fuel.
Municipal solid waste as a feedstock Municipal solid waste includes organic matter like food scraps and paper as well as plastics and metals.
Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs.","Aviation currently contributes about 2.5% of total global carbon emissions, and with air travel demand expected to double by 2040, cutting those emissions has become a pressing priority. One path forward is sustainable aviation fuel, a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops. But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.

A new study in Nature Sustainability points to a promising breakthrough: using municipal solid waste as a reliable, low-emission, cost-effective feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

Researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment evaluated municipal solid waste-based jet fuel produced through industrial-scale gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80–90% compared with conventional jet fuel. The main technical hurdle lies in scaling up gasification systems for widespread use.

""Unlike road transport, which is quickly shifting toward electrification, there's no silver-bullet solution for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,"" said Jingran Zhang, the study's first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-China Project who is supported by the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard. ""Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today's engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.""

Municipal solid waste as a feedstock

Municipal solid waste includes organic matter like food scraps and paper as well as plastics and metals. Traditionally, much of this waste has been landfilled or incinerated, which consumes land or can contribute to air pollution. As landfill space shrinks and waste generation rises, converting municipal solid waste into liquid fuels could conserve land, cut emissions, and produce cleaner energy to help cities move toward zero-waste goals.

The Harvard study explores the largely under-researched potential of municipal solid waste-based jet fuel using real-world data on Fischer-Tropsch gasification technology. The researchers analyzed key emission sources, calculated greenhouse gas impacts, and identified ways to boost efficiency.

They found that while the process significantly lowers emissions, only about 33% of input carbon is converted into fuel due to gas composition mismatches. Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing.

Global implications

Many countries are ramping up efforts to make aviation more sustainable by adopting cleaner fuels. In the United States, the government aims to produce up to 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels annually by 2050, supported by strong financial incentives. In the European Union, new regulations will require all departing flights to gradually increase their share of sustainable aviation fuels, catapulting from 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050. On a global scale, the International Civil Aviation Organization's CORSIA program requires operators to offset emissions growth, which they can do by buying eligible offsets or by using sustainable fuels.

The study examined how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel under several scenarios. In the most practical case, global municipal solid waste could yield around 50 million tons (62 billion liters) of jet fuel globally, cutting aviation's greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 16%. If waste management and conversion systems are inefficient, the benefits drop substantially.

However, if green hydrogen is integrated into the process, production could reach 80 million tons per year, which is enough to supply up to 28% of global jet fuel demand and reduce emissions by as much as 270 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

In Europe, the projected output would already exceed the European Union's jet fuel-blending targets while remaining compliant with sustainability standards. Economically, the study suggests that adopting municipal solid waste-based jet fuels could save airlines money under carbon pricing systems like CORSIA, particularly when government incentives and subsidies are factored in.

Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs. This underscores the urgent need for strong policy action and financial incentives to scale up supply.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/airplane-wing.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:57:40.008757

The October fuel deliveries mark the company’s second and third major SAF deployments at U.S. airports within six months, following its first deployment at Los Angeles International Airport in May.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, FedEx chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by early signs of increased SAF production globally this year.”

Chicago-O’Hare International Airport

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a total of one million gallons of neat SAF blended at a minimum 30% mix from Air bp. With its first delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at the airport.

“Existing fuel infrastructure and enabling policy conditions at the state level made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel procurement strategy,” Blanks Ellis said.

Miami International Airport

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started receiving approximately three million gallons of blended SAF at a minimum 30% blend from AEG.

“With FedEx flights from Miami serving Latin America and the Caribbean daily, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, president of FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and shows our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we are embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and contributing to our global sustainability strategy.”

SAF Part of Broader Aviation Sustainability Efforts

Neat SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use, while blended SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that does not require changes to aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure. FedEx aims to source 30% of its fuel from alternative sources, on a blended basis, by 2030.

SAF is a key part of FedEx’s broader aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. While SAF and conventional jet fuel have similar emissions profiles when burned, SAF production can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional fuels. To meet industry-wide emissions goals, airlines must also focus on reducing overall fuel consumption and improving operational efficiency alongside SAF adoption.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel-saving initiatives allowed FedEx to avoid using 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, saving the company $400 million. In the same year, FedEx met its previous target of reducing aircraft emissions intensity by 30% from a 2005 baseline and has since set a new goal of a 40% reduction by 2034.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-7.png,N,,2025-11-13 07:57:14.575017

By directly funding sustainable aviation fuel, Singapore is helping to pave the way for a greener future in air travel.","Singapore is taking a bold step towards sustainable aviation with the introduction of the green fuel levy, effective from April 2026. This levy will support the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, and help reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. By charging passengers a small fee, the government ensures that the costs of transitioning to greener aviation practices are fairly distributed. This initiative positions Singapore as a global leader in aviation sustainability, setting an example for other nations and marking a significant milestone in efforts to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

In a groundbreaking move, Singapore is introducing a “green fuel levy” on flights departing from Changi Airport, starting from April 2026. This levy, aimed at funding the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marks a significant step in the aviation industry’s efforts to address climate change. As one of the first countries to incorporate environmental accountability into flight pricing, Singapore is setting a global example for how major air hubs can balance the demand for air travel with the need for sustainability. While the levy is modest, it signifies a major shift in how airlines and passengers will approach eco-conscious flying.

What Is the Green Fuel Levy?

The green fuel levy is a new charge introduced by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, derived from renewable, low-carbon sources such as waste biomass and used cooking oil. SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel. However, it is still significantly more expensive to produce. To bridge this cost gap, the green fuel levy will be applied to all departing flights from Singapore, with the funds earmarked solely for the purchase of SAF.

The levy varies based on the distance of the flight and the class of travel. For example, passengers in economy or premium economy class will pay between S$1 (approximately Rs 68) for short regional flights and S$10.40 (around Rs 700) for long-haul journeys, such as those to the Americas. Business and first-class travellers will pay more, ranging from S$4 (Rs 270) to S$41.60 (around Rs 2,800), reflecting the higher fuel consumption associated with longer, more energy-intensive flights. Cargo flights are also subject to the levy, with charges ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram, depending on the flight distance.

Key Dates and Applicability of the Green Fuel Levy

The green fuel levy officially takes effect from October 2026, but it will only apply to tickets issued from April 1, 2026, onward. Passengers who book tickets before this date will not be subject to the levy, even if their flight departs after the policy is implemented. The levy is applicable exclusively to flights departing from Singapore, meaning transit passengers who only pass through Changi Airport will not be required to pay the charge. For transparency, the levy will be clearly listed as a separate line item on flight tickets, ensuring passengers are fully informed of the additional cost.

The Rationale Behind the Green Fuel Levy

Singapore, as one of Asia’s busiest and most strategically important aviation hubs, plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of sustainable aviation. The levy is designed to help Singapore achieve its target of using sustainable aviation fuel for 1% of the country’s total jet fuel consumption by 2026, with plans to increase this figure to 3-5% by 2030. The initiative is in line with Singapore’s broader sustainability goals, which aim to reduce carbon emissions and improve the environmental footprint of air travel.

By introducing the green fuel levy, Singapore is also spreading the cost of greener air travel in a fair and transparent way. Rather than placing the burden solely on airlines or taxpayers, the government is asking passengers to contribute to the cost of cleaner aviation. This ensures that the transition to sustainable fuel remains financially viable while making a tangible impact on the country’s carbon reduction targets. The funds collected through the levy will be dedicated exclusively to the procurement of SAF, ensuring that the money is used efficiently and effectively for its intended purpose.

What Does the Green Fuel Levy Mean for Travellers?

For most passengers, the impact of the green fuel levy will be relatively small. The additional charge for economy class travellers ranges from Rs 68 to Rs 700, depending on the flight’s length. While this may be an additional expense, it is minimal compared to the overall cost of a flight ticket, especially for long-haul trips. For business and first-class passengers, the levy is higher, reflecting the larger carbon footprint of these more premium services.

One key point for travellers to remember is that tickets purchased before April 1, 2026, will not include the levy, even if the flight is scheduled after the policy comes into effect. This gives passengers some time to plan and adjust their travel arrangements if they wish to avoid the additional charge.

The introduction of the green fuel levy marks a significant shift in the aviation industry, as airlines, airports, and passengers are increasingly being asked to play a role in tackling climate change. By directly funding sustainable aviation fuel, Singapore is helping to pave the way for a greener future in air travel. This initiative not only reduces the environmental impact of flying but also sends a powerful message about the role of the aviation industry in contributing to broader sustainability goals.

Setting a Global Example for Sustainable Aviation

As one of the first countries to introduce a formal green fuel levy, Singapore’s move is likely to set a precedent for other global aviation hubs. The airline industry has long been one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, with fuel consumption being a significant source of emissions. By integrating environmental costs into flight pricing, Singapore is leading the charge in making sustainable air travel a reality. Other countries and airports around the world will likely follow suit, adopting similar models to support the transition to SAF and reduce the carbon footprint of global aviation.

While the green fuel levy is a small price to pay for most travellers, it represents a significant step toward sustainable air travel. The initiative not only supports Singapore’s ambitious carbon reduction goals but also encourages the global aviation industry to adopt more environmentally responsible practices. By charging passengers a modest fee to fund the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel, Singapore is not just reducing the environmental impact of its own aviation sector—it is helping to drive a global movement toward cleaner, greener skies.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-11-13T104513283.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 03:57:09.316190

Following the acquisition, TGPL plans to change its name to TruAlt Sumi Gas Private Limited (hereinafter “TSGPL”). TSGPL aims to construct 16 compressed biomethane gas (CBG)*1 production facilities across India over the next three years and commence operations sequentially from 2026. The total daily production capacity of the 16 facilities is expected to reach approximately 320 tons, equivalent to the daily gas consumption of around 800,000 households in India. The raw materials for CBG production will include sugarcane and ethanol residue at TruAlt and other suppliers. The CBG produced will primarily be sold as automobile fuel to major city gas distributors within India. Alongside CBG production, Sumitomo Corporation and TruAlt also plan to collaborate on expanding bioethanol production and producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) derived from bioethanol.

Through its participation in the CBG production business and the bioenergy business in India, Sumitomo Corporation will accelerate the growth of its Energy Solutions Business, one of the key growth areas in its current Medium-Term Management Plan.

Promotion of CBG Supply in India

India, the world's third-largest energy consumer, is aiming to improve its energy self-sufficiency and achieve energy independence by 2047 in view of the country's growing energy demand. CBG is regarded as an important energy source that contributes both to effective waste utilization and improved energy self-sufficiency, as it can be produced from agricultural residue and other waste generated in India, a major agricultural nation. To promote domestic CBG supply, the Indian government has made it mandatory to blend CBG into automobile fuel and city gas for households. City gas distributors in India are required to gradually increase the CBG blending ratio and achieve a 5% CBG mix by 2028. Consequently, expansion of CBG production facilities in India is an urgent priority as the CBG market continues to grow.

Purpose of Investment in TSGPL

TruAlt is India's largest ethanol manufacturer and belongs to the same group with Nirani Sugars, one of India's major sugar producers. The company produces approximately two million liters of ethanol per day. TSGPL expects to achieve stable CBG production by sourcing raw materials such as residue generated during sugar manufacturing and ethanol production from TruAlt and other group companies’ production sites. Sumitomo Corporation will leverage its accumulated expertise and domestic network in India, particularly in the areas of CBG sales and marketing activities and will combine the strengths of both companies to promote CBG production across India.

Future Initiatives

TSGPL will first commence construction of four CBG production facilities in Karnataka and Maharashtra, major sugarcane-producing regions in southern India, while formulating strategies for the expansion of production bases and conducting feasibility studies. Furthermore, by leveraging the knowledge and experience of Sumitomo Corporation and TruAlt, the two companies will also consider future initiatives to expand bioethanol production facilities and produce SAF derived from bioethanol.

In addition, aiming to contribute to the Japan–India Bilateral Credit Mechanism (JCM) agreement signed in August 2025, Sumitomo Corporation will work through TSGPL to generate carbon credits.

Sumitomo Corporation's Bioenergy Business

Sumitomo Corporation positions bioenergy as an important means to achieve carbon neutrality in its business activities by 2050 and to realize a sustainable energy cycle. In June 2025, Sumitomo Corporation established North Sky A/S, a biogas production business in Denmark, marking its first participation in a biogas manufacturing business. In Japan, the company is advancing the Project Morisora, which aims to achieve domestic production of SAF. Sumitomo Corporation has also signed an MOU with Malaysia-based reNIKOLA for bioenergy development and is pursuing development opportunities in numerous countries.

The Energy Innovation Initiative SBU of Sumitomo Corporation will continue to strengthen its efforts in the bioenergy business field.

With aviation responsible for a significant portion of global carbon emissions—approximately 2.5%—the pressure to find viable alternatives to traditional jet fuel has never been more urgent. As global air travel demand is projected to double by 2040, the study emphasizes that adopting sustainable aviation fuels could be pivotal in mitigating the aviation sector’s environmental impact.

The research, conducted by a team of experts from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment, proposes that sustainable aviation fuel derived from municipal solid waste could cut greenhouse gas emissions by an impressive 80-90%. This reduction is in stark contrast to the conventional jet fuels that dominate the market today. The study presents a compelling case for this transformative fuel source, focusing on the industrial processes of gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis as methods to convert everyday waste materials into a viable jet fuel alternative.

Municipal solid waste comprises a myriad of elements, including organic matter, plastics, and metals. Traditionally, this waste has faced disposal challenges, often ending up in landfills or incineration facilities that contribute to various environmental issues, including land degradation and air pollution. As urban areas grapple with shrinking landfill spaces and increasing waste generation, the transition to converting waste into liquid fuels represents a dual opportunity: creating cleaner energy solutions while addressing waste management crises.

The life cycle analysis conducted by the researchers utilizes real-world data pertaining to the gasification processes. Their findings indicate that the conversion of municipal solid waste not only lowers greenhouse gas emissions dramatically but also reveals the complexities associated with the efficiency of the gasification technology. Despite the significant positive outcomes, they found that only about one-third of the input carbon could be effectively converted into usable jet fuel due to inherent challenges in gas composition. However, the study also points toward potential enhancements in efficiency, suggesting that the integration of carbon capture technologies or the inclusion of green hydrogen could significantly improve output.

One of the most notable aspects of this research is its global implications. The United States has already outlined ambitious goals, aiming for the production of up to 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels annually by 2050. This initiative will be propelled by strong financial incentives designed to encourage industry participation and innovation. Similarly, the European Union is set to enforce regulations requiring departing flights to progressively incorporate an increasing share of sustainable aviation fuels, starting from 2% in 2025 and escalating to an astonishing 70% by 2050.

The researchers evaluated various scenarios to understand how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. In the most promising scenario, the global accumulation of municipal solid waste could yield up to 50 million tons (approximately 62 billion liters) of jet fuel, significantly slashing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. However, they caution that erratic waste management practices could reduce these projected benefits substantially. Conversely, should efficient waste processing and conversion be implemented, particularly with green hydrogen integration, the potential production could skyrocket to 80 million tons annually, enough to meet 28% of global jet fuel requirements and curtail emissions by an impressive 270 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.

From an economic standpoint, this research underscores the tangible benefits that airlines could experience by shifting toward municipal solid waste-derived jet fuels. With various carbon pricing policies such as the CORSIA program implemented by the International Civil Aviation Organization, airlines would stand to save substantially under these initiatives, especially when considering government support and subsidies aimed at fostering a more sustainable aviation sector.

As the industry faces pressure to innovate and reduce emissions, the findings of this study provide a roadmap for future developments in sustainable aviation fuels. The lead author of the study, Michael B. McElroy, a distinguished environmental studies professor at Harvard, emphasizes the necessity of collaboration among stakeholders. From governments to fuel producers, airlines, and aircraft manufacturers, a synergistic approach will be crucial to scaling production and ultimately decreasing costs.

Designed to initiate discussions on sustainable aviation fuel production methods, this research also calls for increased awareness of waste’s potential as a resource rather than a liability. By reimagining municipal solid waste, this transformative approach sets the stage for an aviation sector that is not just cleaner but also more economically sustainable. It raises a critical question about how society views waste—which is often regarded as a problem— suggesting instead that it could be re-envisioned as a valuable asset in the fight against climate change.

Furthermore, this study highlights the broader social and environmental implications of utilizing municipal solid waste. It positions cleaner jet fuel production within the context of global environmental goals, such as achieving zero waste in urban areas, conserving land, and generating cleaner energy sources. With the effects of climate change already apparent, catalyzing investment in this research domain could encourage a much-needed realignment of how societies manage waste and energy.

In conclusion, as the aviation industry navigates the complex requirements of sustainability amidst rising emissions, the shift towards municipal solid waste-derived sustainable aviation fuels opens up new avenues for environmental stewardship and economic opportunity. The collaboration outlined by researchers may not only unlock the full potential of this innovative fuel pathway but could also inspire a global movement towards rethinking waste management practices.

At Chicago, FedEx will initially receive one million gallons of blended fuel from Air bp, while Miami will see deliveries of about three million gallons from AEG.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, FedEx chief sustainability officer, in a company statement.

Broader U.S. Adoption

The development follows Neste’s recent expansion of its partnership with United Airlines to supply SAF to Houston, Newark, and Washington Dulles airports. The partnership builds on previous deliveries in Chicago and San Francisco.

“Introducing sustainable aviation fuel for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone,” said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley.

U.S. producers including Valero and Montana Renewables have recently increased capacity, while distributor Avfuel has expanded its SAF supply networks to eight locations nationwide. State programs in California, Oregon, Washington, and others provide ongoing incentives as federal grant funding incentivizing the fuel decreases.

SAF adoption faces major hurdles where cost gaps between it and traditional fuels exist. Although funds and legislative measures look to address this issue, it is still a major roadblock, particularly where legislation does not play a strong role in local markets. Shell, for instance, cited the cost gap in its decision to halt work on a major European plant in September.

SAF Funds and Global Legislation

Internationally, several recently formed funds and legislative measures look to accelerate adoption.

A partnership between Breakthrough Energy Ventures, oneworld alliance, and several individual member airlines launched an investment fund initially worth $150 million in September that aims to expedite SAF commercialization.

As people continue to fly more and more, MHIAEL is set to take off alongside them.","People want to fly. They want to travel, explore and connect and modern air travel is simply the most efficient – and often the only practical – way to do so.

The numbers bear this out: in 2024, global air traffic, measured in Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK), grew more than 10%(link is external) year-over-year, exceeding the pre-pandemic peak of 2019. So far this year, RPKs are up 5%(link is external), with international flights 7% higher and Asian airlines reporting an increase of almost 10%.

Clearly, the strong relationship between RPK growth and global GDP growth continues to hold, with the former expanding several percentage points faster every year. The COVID-19 pandemic that challenged our industry so brutally a few years ago, now looks like a blip. This gives us confidence in our prognosis that the market for aero engines, our particular business line, is set to double over the next two decades.

We believe this will remain the case despite growing pressure on the aviation sector, which is responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, to decarbonize. Some critics are even calling for an outright reduction in air travel to reduce emissions, such as the Swedish-inspired ‘flygskam’ or ‘flight shame’ movement. The reality, though, is that the most effective way to reduce emissions is for a profitable industry to continue to invest in increasing efficiency as well as into low-carbon technology.

Already, the introduction of geared turbofan engines™, high-pressure ratio core engines and very high-bypass ratio engines has significantly improved fuel efficiency, leading to a double-digit reduction in fuel consumption with each new generation of engines. The next step is to blend sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), produced from used cooking oil and biowaste, with traditional kerosene to power today’s engines. And longer term, the industry is working on electric and hydrogen-fueled propulsion systems, though these will be limited to smaller, short-haul aircraft – at least initially.

Grounded in partnerships

Our task at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aero Engines, Ltd. (MHIAEL) is to contribute to the aviation sector’s growth and sustainability by helping to design and build the most advanced and efficient engines possible. In a business that requires a lot of upfront investment and R&D and then faces operational risks over the many years that an engine flies, the only way to succeed is in partnership.

That is why MHIAEL is much more than a supplier. We are either a risk and revenue sharing partner (RRSP) or an outright joint venture (JV) partner in all of the engine programs in which we participate. In the case of Pratt & Whitney’s PW1100G-JM engine series, which powers the Airbus A320neo family – the world’s most popular narrowbody aircraft – we are part of a JV that includes five companies from the US, Germany and Japan.

Our collaboration with Rolls-Royce, which currently stretches over three Trent engine programs for widebody planes, including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner as well as the A330neo and A350XWB, is structured as a series of RRSPs.

Across these programs, revenues and, indeed, risks are shared in proportion to each partner’s share, with Japan’s three ‘Heavies’ – Kawasaki Heavy Industries, IHI and MHIAEL – often accounting for around a one quarter share. In addition, each company designs and builds a part of the engine.

Our focus is on what I like to think of as the ‘heart of the engine’: the combustors and combustion chamber, where fuel is mixed with high-pressure air and ignited to create the high-temperature exhaust gases that drive the turbine. The fact that we are part of MHI Group, the world’s leading manufacturer of large-scale gas turbines for power stations, is key to our ability to design and build these critical components. And we collaborate actively with colleagues at MHI’s Research & Innovation Center to ensure we retain our technological edge.

A factory on autopilot

Another strength is the heavy investment at MHIAEL’s main locations in Nagoya and Nagasaki, into both component production and our maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities – ensuring the highest standards and, hence, smooth approval from the world’s key aviation regulators.

Our new Nagasaki factory, completed five years ago, where we make the combustion chambers for the PW1100G-JM, is probably the most modern in the entire MHI Group. The 280-meter-long building is filled with machine tools – from high-speed lasers to high-pressure water jets – that can drill a thousand holes into the nickel alloy of a combustor with speed and precision. Each of the more than 50 machines is set up with the correct drill heads and parts by mobile robots that travel up and down the hall on rails.

The human supervisors, meanwhile, use their cellphones to monitor a machine’s operational status, how much of the monthly production target has been achieved and the day’s electricity consumption. They can check real-time raw material prices, order new supplies once the current stock drops below a certain weight, or chat about the most recent race result of their colleague Ryota Kondo, one of Japan’s top marathon runners.

We will continue to invest in and expand our facilities to support the growth we expect MHIAEL to achieve. Our confidence in the future is based not only on the underlying market expansion I have already discussed, but also on the fact that the newer engine programs we are part of – such as the PW1100G-JM – are only now starting to generate spare parts and maintenance revenue. This is the most profitable element of such a program and since such programs can extend for 40 years, our MRO business is set for steady growth.

A third reason to be optimistic is that we have won larger work shares on the more recent engine programs and, based on our technological and service track record, we expect that trend to continue.

One of the most significant components of the NEA’s five-year plan is the push for green hydrogen. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable electricity through the process of water electrolysis, is a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuels. By splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules, green hydrogen can serve as a low-carbon fuel, powering everything from heavy industries to transport vehicles, and even airplanes. This hydrogen can also be used in the production of green ammonia and green methanol, which are essential for fertilizers and shipping. For aviation, this could mean a sustainable fuel option that reduces the industry’s reliance on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the sector’s carbon reduction goals. The scalability of green hydrogen production makes it a key candidate for meeting the aviation sector’s energy needs in a sustainable manner.

Offshore Wind Energy: Key to Fueling Sustainable Aviation

Offshore wind energy is expected to play a key role in China’s transition to green aviation. The NEA has recommended that coastal regions explore the potential of offshore wind to produce green hydrogen, an emerging technology with the potential to revolutionize both energy production and fuel supply for aviation. By harnessing the abundant wind resources along China’s coastline, the country aims to create a sustainable supply chain for green hydrogen and eco-friendly aviation fuel, thereby reducing the aviation sector’s carbon footprint. This initiative is expected to reduce the industry’s dependency on traditional fuels and significantly decrease carbon emissions, helping China meet its climate goals.

Addressing Energy Surplus with Eco-Friendly Aviation Fuel

As China’s renewable energy capacity grows, the issue of curtailment – where excess wind and solar energy cannot be absorbed by the grid – has become more pressing. To address this, the NEA is working to ensure that surplus energy is directed towards the production of green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. By channeling excess energy into eco-friendly fuel production, China aims to create a more efficient energy system and contribute to the decarbonization of the aviation sector. With excess solar and wind power that often goes unused, China is looking to create a sustainable and efficient energy ecosystem by transforming this surplus into valuable resources for the aviation industry, reducing both waste and emissions.

China’s Position as a Leader in Sustainable Aviation

The NEA’s strategy aligns with global efforts to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and increase the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). By prioritizing green hydrogen and other eco-friendly fuels, China is positioning itself as a leader in the global push for more sustainable air travel. This vision reflects China’s broader decarbonization goals and sets a clear path for the future of aviation, not only within the country but across the globe. As other nations look to reduce aviation emissions, China’s plans serve as an example of how large-scale adoption of green hydrogen and SAFs can support the transition to a carbon-neutral aviation industry. By advancing these technologies, China aims to set the standard for a cleaner, greener aviation future.

The future of renewable energy could lie in a more efficient process that transforms corn into methanol.

Supported by Minnesota Corn, University of Minnesota Professor Paul Dauenhauer is leading a project that aims to make full use of corn’s glucose polymers through inorganic catalysis.

Currently, corn ethanol production yields about three gallons of fuel per bushel. However, traditional fermentation methods consume a third of the glucose in yeast metabolism, releasing CO2 as a byproduct.

Dauenhauer proposes using inorganic catalysts instead, allowing 100 percent conversion of corn glucose into methanol.

“Methanol has a universality to it,” Dauenhauer explained. “Using existing technology you can make methanol into jet fuel. You can also make clean burning diesel fuel, and you can make polyethylene polymers—plastics.”

His team is testing metal catalysts to find the most efficient and cost-effective method for large-scale production. The project aims to boost fuel yields by 50 percent while preserving essential corn coproducts like fiber and oil for livestock feed.

Methanol-based fuels could play a key role in reducing carbon emissions. Dauenhauer highlighted, “The benefit of using dimethyl ether in a diesel engine versus conventional diesel is it burns really cleanly.” The potential for corn-derived methanol to supply the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market is also under study.

The research continues through 2028, focusing on process refinement and assessing the economics of converting ethanol plants into methanol facilities.

Minnesota Corn is funding other ethanol innovation projects, including efforts to run diesel engines on high-ethanol blends and turn ethanol with captured CO2 into sustainable jet fuel. These advances mark a major step toward a cleaner, more flexible bioenergy future.

EU and UK to begin carbon market link negotiations

A spokesperson for Denmark stated on Wednesday that EU countries have agreed to begin negotiations with the United Kingdom to link their carbon markets. Beginning January 1, the European Union will impose a carbon border fee on cement, steel, and other imports. The UK government has claimed that the new tariff will cost UK industries around 800 million pounds (over $1 billion) annually. The link is intended to reset relations between the EU and the UK following Brexit. While this link will allow countries on both sides to avoid carbon border tariffs, it is unlikely to go into effect before the EU’s January 1 start date.

China to expand renewable energy use, looking to sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen

China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) aims to use excess wind and solar output to explore new renewable energy projects. In the new five-year plan, China hopes to expand industrial bases for sustainable aviation fuel, green ammonia, green methanol, and green hydrogen. A document outlining the 2026-2030 plan highlights the use of renewable energy, such as offshore wind, to produce green hydrogen and other new energy sources. As industry accounts for around 60% of China’s electricity use, renewables are critical for decarbonization goals. Currently, solar and wind can sometimes generate more electricity than the grid can accept. In an effort to stop this phenomenon, known as curtailment, the government aims to channel this energy into alternative uses.

Co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme, part of the ATI Programme, the Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS) project brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London and Heathrow.

The benefits of SAF for reducing end-to-end CO2 emissions from fuel are well understood, and SAF is expected to play a key role in aviation’s decarbonisation journey. However, in-flight measurements behind aircraft have also shown SAF’s potential to reduce the number of ice crystals in contrails and therefore the potential climate impact of these thin clouds of ice particles that can form behind aircraft.

The amount of SAF currently available is only a small proportion of aviation’s overall fuel requirements. It is typically mixed with conventional fossil fuel, resulting in wide-scale deployment at very low SAF blend ratios. However, SAF use is expected to increase in the UK with the introduction of the SAF mandate which came into force at the start of the year and will see 10% of SAF in the UK fuel in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

Constantly changing weather means different flights cause contrails at different times and locations, yet most of the potential climate impact comes from only a small proportion of flights. This creates an opportunity for smart SAF use targeting those flights expected to form persistent contrails. The QRITOS project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, at one of the world’s busiest airports. It will do this by combining data from British Airways flight trials, advanced modelling and satellite observations to monitor contrail formation following this targeted SAF usage.

The project aims to show that we can prioritise particular flights for SAF, focusing on where it can deliver the greatest environmental benefit and maximise the effectiveness of the current levels of supply.

The Non-CO2 Programme focuses on addressing challenges with reducing non-CO2 emissions from aircraft, as outlined in the ATI’s Non-CO2 Technologies Roadmap. The funding programme is delivered by the Aerospace Technology Institute, Department for Business and Trade (DBT) and Innovate UK, in partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of environmental affairs at FedEx, said, “Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help to scale the SAF market.

“The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs of increased SAF production globally this calendar year.”

Fedex will receive a blend to include one million gallons of neat SAF at a minimum blend of 30% from Air bp at O’Hare, and has started to receive three million gallons of blended SAF at 30% blend minimum from AEG at Miami.

According to FedEx, it is the first US all-cargo airline to deploy SAF at O’Hare airport.

Aviation sustainability strategy

Using blended fuels means airlines do not need to make any changes to existing aircraft engines or fuelling infrastructure. By 2030, Fedex aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources on a blended basis.

Though total emissions of SAF and traditional jet fuels and SAF are similar when burned, the production of SAF produces significantly fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels.

However, reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go together with alternative fuel uptake to reach emissions goals.

Fedex reports that aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives have enabled it to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in US$400m in savings for the company.

FedEx also reports that in FY 2024 it achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline.

Jet Fuel From City Waste,Kellie Nault,,,,,https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2025/11/next-frontier-clean-flight-jet-fuel-city-waste,"One path forward is sustainable aviation fuel, a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops.
But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.
A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-90% compared with conventional jet fuel.
The study examined how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel under several scenarios.
Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs.","Aviation currently contributes about 2.5% of total global carbon emissions, and with air travel demand expected to double by 2040, cutting those emissions has become a pressing priority. One path forward is sustainable aviation fuel, a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops. But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.

A new study in Nature Sustainability points to a promising breakthrough: using municipal solid waste as a reliable, low-emission, cost-effective feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

Researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment evaluated municipal solid waste-based jet fuel produced through industrial-scale gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-90% compared with conventional jet fuel. The main technical hurdle lies in scaling up gasification systems for widespread use.

“Unlike road transport, which is quickly shifting toward electrification, there’s no silver-bullet solution for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,” said Jingran Zhang, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-China Project who is supported by the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard. “Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today’s engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.”

Municipal solid waste as a feedstock

Municipal solid waste includes organic matter like food scraps and paper as well as plastics and metals. Traditionally, much of this waste has been landfilled or incinerated, which consumes land or can contribute to air pollution. As landfill space shrinks and waste generation rises, converting municipal solid waste into liquid fuels could conserve land, cut emissions, and produce cleaner energy to help cities move toward zero-waste goals.

The Harvard study explores the largely under-researched potential of municipal solid waste-based jet fuel using real-world data on Fischer-Tropsch gasification technology. The researchers analyzed key emission sources, calculated greenhouse gas impacts, and identified ways to boost efficiency. They found that while the process significantly lowers emissions, only about 33% of input carbon is converted into fuel due to gas composition mismatches. Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing.

Global implications

Many countries are ramping up efforts to make aviation more sustainable by adopting cleaner fuels. In the United States, the government aims to produce up to 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels annually by 2050, supported by strong financial incentives. In the European Union, new regulations will require all departing flights to gradually increase their share of sustainable aviation fuels, catapulting from 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050. On a global scale, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA program requires operators to offset emissions growth, which they can do by buying eligible offsets or by using sustainable fuels.

The study examined how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel under several scenarios. In the most practical case, global municipal solid waste could yield around 50 million tons (62 billion liters) of jet fuel globally, cutting aviation’s greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 16%. If waste management and conversion systems are inefficient, the benefits drop substantially. However, if green hydrogen is integrated into the process, production could reach 80 million tons per year, which is enough to supply up to 28% of global jet fuel demand and reduce emissions by as much as 270 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

In Europe, the projected output would already exceed the European Union’s jet fuel-blending targets while remaining compliant with sustainability standards. Economically, the study suggests that adopting municipal solid waste-based jet fuels could save airlines money under carbon pricing systems like CORSIA, particularly when government incentives and subsidies are factored in.

Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs. This underscores the urgent need for strong policy action and financial incentives to scale up supply.",https://seas.harvard.edu/themes/custom/seas/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-12 10:57:08.163913

This facility, named Project Beacon, will combine Aether’s proprietary Aurora technology with operational resources from Aster’s integrated refining and chemical hub.

It is designed to transform industrial waste gas and biomethane into CORSIA-certified SAF, with an intended production capacity of up to 50 barrels a day, or around 2,000t annually.

According to the project partners, the process is expected to achieve over 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Construction is scheduled for 2026, and commercial operations are projected to begin in 2028.

Aster CEO Erwin Ciputra said: “Today marks an important step forward in reducing carbon intensity and advancing new energy pathways.

“By bringing together Aether’s technology with the expertise of our Bukom facility, we are demonstrating how partnerships between established industrial leaders and agile innovators can catalyse the introduction of disruptive solutions on a commercial scale.”

Aster will provide renewable energy supply, waste carbon feedstock, utilities, and ongoing site support for the initiative.

The choice of the Pulau Bukom site enables integration with existing infrastructure and supports development of alternative fuel technologies within Singapore’s energy sector, according to companies.

Project Beacon will use a range of waste carbon feedstocks, addressing challenges faced by earlier SAF production methods that depend on limited sources such as used cooking oil.

The tax will apply on tickets sold from 1 April 2026 for flights departing from 1 October next year and will affect anyone flying from Singapore.
The band rates for economy passengers are S$1, S$2.80, S$6.40 and S$10.40 (€0.66, €2.42, €5.53 and €8.99).
However, CAAS says: “The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made.” The SAF tax will also be levied on private jets.
Flying from Singapore in your Gulfstream G-IV, for example, will cost you between S$100 (€86) and $1,040 (€899) depending on distance.","Singapore has claimed a world first with the introduction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel levy (SAF) from next year, with rates depending on class of travel and distance flown.

The tax will apply on tickets sold from 1 April 2026 for flights departing from 1 October next year and will affect anyone flying from Singapore. It is designed to fund the amount of SAF needed to meet the 1% target Singapore has set for 2026 and varies on distance travelled.

The amount paid depends on four geographical bands; Band 1 covers southeast Asia and Band 2 most of Asia and Australia plus Papua New Guinea. Band 3 covers Europe, Africa, Central and West Asia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands, while Band 4 is the Americas.

The band rates for economy passengers are S$1, S$2.80, S$6.40 and S$10.40 (€0.66, €2.42, €5.53 and €8.99). The rates are not that punitive and there is good news for those flying in premium economy, as it will be rated the same as economy. Another bonus is that transit passengers are exempt.

However, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) says: “The SAF Levy for Premium Cabin (business and first class) is four times that for the Economy Cabin for the same geographical band,” so this increases the top rate to S$41.60, more than €35.

It could have been worse; as the authority originally estimated the basic levy for a Singapore-London flight at S$16, or €13.83. However, CAAS says: “The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made.”

The SAF tax will also be levied on private jets. Flying from Singapore in your Gulfstream G-IV, for example, will cost you between S$100 (€86) and $1,040 (€899) depending on distance.

CAAS says all revenue will go directly towards the purchase of SAF and environmental measures. Its director-general, Han Kok Juan, adds the levy “provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub”.

He argues: “We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

Singapore has set a 1% SAF target for 2026, with a goal to raise this to 3 to 5% by 2030, so there is a risk the levy may increase in future.

Until now, countries have shied away from imposing green levies, while airlines like Lufthansa have made SAF contributions voluntary.

So, could other countries follow Singapore? Most are aware that anything that makes flying more expensive will not be well-received by voters.

This week, UK Transport Minister Heidi Alexander told a conference that demand for flying “was only going in one direction” and that the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, due to become law next spring, would include safeguards so that “passengers see little-to-no change in the price of a ticket”.

However, Singapore, may have opened the door to making green levies acceptable, particularly if they are not too much of a burden on the average traveller – to begin with, at least.",https://www.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2175448985-1024x767.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:57:38.753748

Some of the more promising fractionation technologies, however, set the stage for, or even fully morphed into, new front-end diversification processes that could find a better fit in our modern biorefineries. Tech companies have adapted wet-mill technologies and explored hammer mill alternatives to achieve value-added systems offering flexibility and increased yield.

Diversification can also come without plant expansion. Chippewa Valley Ethanol Co., historically a standout in innovation and process improvements, continues to forge ahead with corn kernel fiber cellulosic ethanol, decarbonization and efficiency upgrades. Some technologies—such as gasification of corn stover to produce syngas blended with natural gas for energy production—have come and gone with evolving markets and energy prices, while others have proven beneficial longer term—such as low energy distillation. Find out more about CVEC’s diversification strategies, starting on page 18.

Technology experts are innovating beyond traditional coproducts such as corn oil and DDGS, forging new paths for advanced food protein, feed additives, new textiles, fibers, biopolymers and commercial-grade pigments and even cosmetics. It’s done through precision fermentation, with one featured modular technology designed to operate alongside an ethanol plant using leftover fermentation yeast to produce microbial proteins and food-grade yeasts. A handful of companies are in the space, partnering with research labs to bring their technologies to commercial scale. It’s a new twist on coproduct diversification and it starts on page 24.

Finally, this issue delivers updates on the green methanol production process launching in Luverne, Minnesota, at an ethanol plant idled since 2022. A collaboration among AgriEnergy Innovations, CapCO2 Solutions and Methylennium Energy, the project is full steam ahead, with promise in sustainable aviation fuel and maritime markets. It will use a water-based electrolyzer to produce hydrogen for combination with waste CO2 to generate green methanol. The project’s developers hope it will be a blueprint for the industry and for further expansion.

The deliveries, which started in October, build on FedEx's first major US SAF rollout at Los Angeles International Airport earlier in 2025, the company said Nov. 10.

The move underscores the company's broader push to integrate lower-carbon fuels across its aviation network as it targets sourcing 30% of its fuel from alternative sources by 2030.

""Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,"" Karen Blanks Ellis, FedEx's chief sustainability officer and vice president of environmental affairs, said. ""While supply still lags demand, we're encouraged by early signs of increased global SAF production this year.""

At Chicago O'Hare, FedEx will receive around 1 million gallons of neat SAF blended to at least 30%, supplied by Air bp. FedEx said existing fuel infrastructure and supportive state policies made O'Hare a ""logical next step"" in its alternative fuel strategy.

At Miami International Airport, FedEx began taking delivery of roughly 3 million gallons of blended SAF, also at a minimum 30% blend, supplied by AEG.

""With FedEx flights from Miami heading across Latin America and the Caribbean every day, this milestone reinforces our commitment and demonstrates to our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it is a regional priority,"" Luiz R.

SAF, which can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, can be used as a ""drop-in"" replacement requiring no engine or infrastructure modifications.

FedEx said SAF deployment forms part of its wider sustainability plan, which also includes aircraft modernization and fuel-saving initiatives.

The company avoided using 140 million gallons of jet fuel in fiscal 2024 through efficiency improvements, saving about $400 million. It has already met its previous goal of a 30% cut in aircraft emissions intensity from 2005 levels and now targets a 40% reduction by 2034, it said.

At the same time, policy decisions in Washington can increase market access, spur demand and ensure fair competition. This new Market Intel series will examine six priority policy areas - trade, biofuels, whole milk in schools, interstate commerce, transparent input markets and prioritizing U.S.-grown produce - and how each can help strengthen the farm economy and rural communities.

In this article, the first of two exploring opportunities in biofuel markets, we examine permanent year-round E15 authorization. In the next installment, we will turn to the growing sustainable aviation fuel market, biodiesel, tax incentives that support biofuel production and the potential impact of small refinery exemptions on these evolving markets.

Few markets tie together energy security and farm profitability as closely as ethanol. For more than two decades, ethanol has provided a reliable outlet for U.S. corn, strengthened domestic fuel supplies and saved consumers money at the gas pump. Around the world, nations are turning to ethanol to bolster their own energy security, and global consumption has more than doubled since the early 2000s. This continued growth highlights the important role of American-made ethanol in meeting fuel demand.

Ethanol

Ethanol currently uses about 5.6 billion bushels of corn each year, roughly 33% of total U.S. corn production. The standard gasoline blend contains 10% ethanol (E10), and in 2025 the national average blend reached about 10.2%. Some states, including top ethanol producers like Iowa and Minnesota, utilize higher blends such as E15 (15% ethanol) and E85 (85% ethanol) in flexible-fuel vehicles. However, the reach of these blends is limited by regulatory restrictions, particularly the seasonal limitation on E15 sales during the summer months.

E15 Uncertainty Stalls Growth

Each summer, federal limits on fuel volatility restrict the sale of E15 in many parts of the country. The rule stems from the Clean Air Act. In 1978, the EPA waived the requirements for E10 but left E15 subject to tighter standards even though it performs just as cleanly. E15 can reduce harmful tailpipe emissions by roughly 46% compared to non-ethanol gasoline, ethanol burns cleaner and represents a step toward more sustainable fuel consumption. To provide temporary relief, the Environmental Protection Agency has used emergency authority to issue nationwide waivers allowing summer E15 sales. In April 2025, EPA approved such a waiver for the second consecutive year. However, emergency waivers must be reissued each year, creating uncertainty for fuel retailers and consumers. Without a permanent policy, retailers are less likely to invest in E15 infrastructure and marketing.

This uncertainty comes as ethanol demand overall faces broader headwinds. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that motor gasoline use will decline over the next decade, even under optimistic scenarios. National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) finds that if blend rates remain near a 10.5% average, domestic ethanol use could fall from about 14.2 billion gallons in 2025 to 13.1 billion gallons by 2035, roughly 400 million fewer bushels of corn used for ethanol. This reduction reflects the EIA’s forecast for lower U.S. motor gasoline consumption over the next decade, driven by more fuel-efficient vehicles, increased electric-vehicle adoption, and slower growth in overall driving miles.

Year-Round E15 Authorization Would Speed Up Demand

Nationwide, year-round E15 authorization presents the most straightforward path to preserve existing ethanol demand and create new growth. Even a modest increase in the national blend rate could have a measurable impact. According to NCGA, a 1% increase in the average ethanol blend rate would add 1.36 billion gallons of ethanol, equal to about 486 million bushels of corn. A 5% increase, to move from E10 to E15, would translate to 6.8 billion gallons of ethanol, or roughly 2.4 billion bushels of corn a year.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Analysis/MarketIntel/MI-Graphics/_socialwFacebook/249676/MI_2025-E15.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 08:56:17.370264

The two-year project, known as Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), is co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI).
It brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport to study how smarter deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, could reduce the climate impact of contrails.
“At British Airways, we believe sustainable aviation fuel is central to the future of flying,” said Tom Byrne, the airline’s Head of Net Zero and Environment.
“This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation,” he said.","Rolls-Royce is leading a new UK research initiative aimed at finding more effective ways to use sustainable aviation fuel to reduce both carbon and non-carbon emissions, the company stated.

The two-year project, known as Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), is co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). It brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport to study how smarter deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, could reduce the climate impact of contrails.

While SAF is already recognised for its potential to cut carbon emissions compared with fossil jet fuel, studies have shown that it can also reduce the number of ice crystals that form in aircraft contrails. According to Rolls-Royce, fewer and thinner contrails could lessen aviation’s wider climate impact.

Alan Newby, Director of Research and Technology at Rolls-Royce, said “SAF will not only play a vital role in decarbonising aviation, but has also been shown to reduce certain non-CO2 emissions. This project will demonstrate smarter ways of using SAF which could unlock additional value through reducing non-CO2 climate effects as well.”

Because contrails are only formed under specific weather conditions, most of the climate effect is caused by a relatively small number of flights. The QRITOS project aims to determine whether SAF can be prioritised for those flights most likely to produce persistent contrails, using flight trials, atmospheric modelling, and satellite data collected at Heathrow.

Marcin Dutka, Environmental Sustainability Technologist at Rolls-Royce and project manager for QRITOS, said “Measurements have already shown that fuel composition can influence contrail properties. This project aims to demonstrate how contrail climate impact might be reduced by targeting SAF at flights predicted to form persistent contrails.”

British Airways is contributing operational data from its fleet. “At British Airways, we believe sustainable aviation fuel is central to the future of flying,” said Tom Byrne, the airline’s Head of Net Zero and Environment. “Through the QRITOS project, we’re exploring how SAF can go beyond reducing carbon emissions to also help minimise the climate impact of contrails.”

Heathrow Airport is also participating. Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy, said “As SAF continues to scale it is important to take a closer look at how we can use it to deliver the greatest climate benefit. As one of the world’s busiest airports we’re proud to participate in this project to demonstrate how targeted SAF use could help to address non-CO2 emissions.”

The research team at Imperial College London will develop new computational models and satellite imaging tools to monitor contrail formation. Associate Professor Sebastian Eastham said “We will develop and trial advanced computational contrail modelling and satellite image analysis techniques, with the goal of performing both prediction and near real-time assessment of the effectiveness of targeted SAF deployment for contrail warming reduction.”

Industry Minister Chris McDonald described the project as an example of collaboration between government and business. “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation,” he said.

According to the ATI, QRITOS will conclude in April 2027 and aims to improve forecasting methods, advance understanding of contrail formation, and develop new ways to verify environmental outcomes using satellite data.",https://ukdjassets-b4d.kxcdn.com/34bd6acbb37094e43de8c481b94ca2cc_/turbinerollsroyce1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:56:13.097070

From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we’re embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and actively contributing to the corporation’s global sustainability strategy.”

Under current fuel standards, neat, or unblended, SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels. However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Through aircraft modernisation and other fuel-saving initiatives, FedEx avoided 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, saving the company $400 million. The airline also met its FY 2024 goal of cutting aircraft emissions intensity by 30% from a 2005 baseline and has now raised its target to a 40% reduction by 2034.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/11/12/88647-download-4-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:56:25.835284

This initiative, aimed at reducing the aviation sector’s carbon footprint, will add a modest surcharge to passengers’ flight tickets to fund the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). By doing so, Singapore is positioning itself as a global leader in eco-friendly aviation.

With the aviation industry being a major contributor to global emissions, this move is part of Singapore’s broader strategy to make air travel more sustainable. While the levy is small, it reflects the country’s commitment to creating a cleaner and more responsible aviation sector, inspiring other global hubs to follow suit.

How the Green Fuel Levy Works

The green fuel levy will be applied as a fixed charge on flight tickets, depending on the class of travel and flight distance. This levy will support the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—a renewable fuel made from sustainable sources like used cooking oil, algae, and waste biomass. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF can cut carbon emissions by up to 80% throughout its lifecycle, making it a vital part of the aviation industry’s path to decarbonization.

Here’s how the levy will break down:

Economy and Premium Economy Passengers: The levy will range from S$1 (around ₹68) for regional flights to S$10.40 (roughly ₹700) for long-haul flights to destinations like the Americas.

Business and First-Class Passengers: These travellers will contribute between S$4 (approximately ₹270) and S$41.60 (about ₹2,800), depending on the distance of their flight and the fuel consumption.

Cargo Flights: For cargo shipments, the levy will be based on weight, ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram (roughly ₹0.68 to ₹10/kg).

While the levy is not a significant increase in travel costs, it plays a key role in financing the transition to a more sustainable aviation future.

Key Dates and What Travellers Need to Know

The green fuel levy will apply to all flights departing Singapore starting in October 2026, but it will be effective for tickets issued from April 1, 2026 onward. Passengers who book their tickets before April 2026 will not be charged the levy, even if their flight departs after the official start date.

Only passengers flying out of Singapore will be affected, while transit passengers passing through Changi Airport without departing will not incur the levy. The charge will appear as a distinct line item on passengers’ tickets, ensuring transparency and clarity.

Singapore’s Commitment to Sustainable Aviation

Singapore’s introduction of the green fuel levy is part of a broader strategy to ensure that the country plays a leading role in the sustainable aviation sector. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set a target for sustainable aviation fuel to comprise 1% of total jet fuel consumption by 2026, with the goal to increase this to 3-5% by 2030.

This levy allows the government to ensure that the cost of adopting SAF is shared fairly by passengers rather than burdening airlines or taxpayers. By placing responsibility for funding sustainable fuel directly on those who benefit from aviation, Singapore is ensuring a model that is both financially sustainable and environmentally responsible.

What It Means for Passengers

For most passengers, the green fuel levy will not drastically affect their overall travel budgets. The levy is designed to be affordable, with charges ranging from ₹68 to ₹700 for economy passengers, depending on the flight length. For business and first-class passengers, the cost will be higher, reflecting the larger environmental impact of longer flights.

Though the levy is modest, it ensures that Singapore’s aviation industry remains a leader in sustainability. The charge will be clearly listed on tickets, making it easy for passengers to understand their contribution to cleaner skies.

A Global Example of Green Aviation

By introducing the green fuel levy, Singapore is setting a global standard for how the aviation industry can reduce its carbon emissions and move towards sustainable fuel alternatives. This levy represents a small but significant step in the country’s efforts to combat climate change while continuing to support the growth of global aviation.

As the first country to formally implement such a levy, Singapore is showing the world that aviation can be both economically viable and environmentally responsible. This initiative could serve as a model for other aviation hubs and governments looking to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

A New Era for Eco-Friendly Aviation

The introduction of the green fuel levy is more than just an additional charge for travellers. It is a key element of Singapore’s broader strategy to shape the future of aviation. By incorporating sustainability directly into flight pricing, Singapore is pioneering a new model for the global aviation industry.

This move is an important step towards ensuring that future generations of travellers can continue to enjoy air travel while minimizing the environmental impact. With the introduction of the levy, Singapore is leading the way towards a cleaner, more sustainable future for aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-11-12T154127955.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:56:51.176306

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has introduced the green fuel levy to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel. This is a cleaner alternative made from low-carbon sources such as used cooking oil and waste biomass. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, though it's still far costlier to produce.

To help cover this gap, every passenger departing from Singapore will pay a small, fixed contribution that goes toward SAF purchases. The amount depends on the flight distance and travel class:

Economy/Premium Economy: Between S$1 (around Rs 68) for short regional routes and S$10.40 (around Rs 700) for long-haul flights to destinations like the Americas.

Business/First Class: Between S$4 (around Rs 270) and S$41.60 (around Rs 2,800) for longer, more fuel-intensive journeys.

Cargo Flights: Levies range from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram (around Rs 0.68-Rs 10/kg) depending on distance.

As one of Asia's busiest air hubs, Singapore plays a key role in shaping aviation's future sustainability. The levy supports the country's target for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1% of total jet fuel use by 2026, with plans to increase this to 3-5% by 2030, depending on global supply and cost trends. Rather than burdening airlines or taxpayers, the government is spreading the cost fairly among air travellers who directly benefit from aviation. This ensures that Singapore's path to greener skies remains both financially viable and environmentally responsible.

The policy also offers predictability: airlines know how much to collect, passengers see the charge clearly, and the funds are dedicated solely to sustainable fuel procurement. It's a carefully designed model that other nations are likely to watch closely.

What The Green Fuel Levy Means for Travellers

For most passengers, the levy won't dramatically change travel budgets. However, it does reflect a meaningful shift in how the aviation industry is tackling its carbon challenge. Here's what travellers should keep in mind:

For economy travellers, the additional cost ranges from Rs 68 to about Rs 700, which is negligible compared to the total ticket prices. Business and first-class flyers will pay more, reflecting their larger share of flight emissions.

Tickets bought before 1 April 2026 won't include the levy, even for later travel dates.

The funds directly finance sustainable aviation fuel, helping make air travel more eco-friendly.

Singapore’s green fuel levy: A step forward but harder work awaits To make low-carbon fuels a lasting part of the energy mix, the country must now focus on building up the supply side Summary: Singapore’s new green fuel levy marks a pivotal step in decarbonising transport. From 2026, all flights departing Singapore must use at least 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), rising to 3–5% by 2030. The levy, managed by CAAS, will fund SAF procurement and help airlines manage higher costs—sending a strong demand-side signal for low-carbon transition. But lasting progress hinges on the supply side. To avoid long-term dependence on imported SAF, Singapore must support local and regional biofuel production, incentivise R&D and innovation, and attract private capital through de-risked financing. Emerging biofuel players face high capital costs, limited economies of scale, and price volatility, yet circular business models—turning waste into fuel and by-products into value—can strengthen both sustainability and profitability. Regionally, ASEAN’s biomass-rich landscape offers a huge opportunity. Singapore can play a convener role, harmonising standards and enabling a cross-border biofuels market—anchoring its position as a trusted hub for sustainable finance, technology, and trade.

Singapore will introduce a fixed levy on all departing flights from 2026 to fund the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel. The measure aims for greener fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in its first year. Former Temasek chief executive Ho Ching defended the move after criticism from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), saying it is reasonable for airlines and passengers to bear the cost of reducing emissions rather than taxpayers. She described the levy as a practical approach for a small country with limited capacity to produce its own green fuel, one that could help stabilise prices and encourage investment in new production.

This policy adjustment could also support rapeseed oil demand, potentially offsetting downward pressure from this year’s larger crop as the market relied more heavily on HVO production, the report said.
Sources indicated this could apply retroactively for two years, potentially disqualifying some small- to medium-sized suppliers from selling to Germany and creating a premium in the German market.
The German policy change came as UCO markets faced additional pressure from increasing Chinese sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, a 24 October Vesper report said.
The removal of double-counting advantages will fundamentally alter the economics of UCOME production versus HVO processing,” Vesper wrote.","The German government had reached an informal agreement to end double-counting for advanced biofuels, including used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME), towards greenhouse gas (GHG) quotas, the 6 November report quoted industry sources as saying.

According to an internal memo from industry association VDB, the energy ministry expects a legal amendment to take effect on 1 January 2026, coinciding with the European Union (EU)’s RED III legislation implementation into German law.

The proposed change would have significant implications for used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME), which could become substantially less relevant in Germany’s biodiesel market, the report said.

Market sources had indicated this shift would likely increase demand for hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), Vesper wrote.

This policy adjustment could also support rapeseed oil demand, potentially offsetting downward pressure from this year’s larger crop as the market relied more heavily on HVO production, the report said.

Germany was also addressing supply chain concerns and the environment ministry had reached an agreement on “protection of trust” provisions, which would allow authorities to cancel certificates generated through fraudulent activity, including false declarations of biofuel imports, Vesper wrote.

Sources indicated this could apply retroactively for two years, potentially disqualifying some small- to medium-sized suppliers from selling to Germany and creating a premium in the German market.

“This possibly means that if this law is introduced, large buyers such as Shell will include clauses in their contracts transferring liability to suppliers for any potential fraud,” one market player was quoted as saying.

The Netherlands is pursuing similar reforms, according to the report.

The Dutch Emissions Authority had confirmed that UCOME would be treated as a fossil fuel if supplied to the maritime sector under the country’s upcoming RED legislation, the report said.

While UCOME would remain eligible for compliance in road transport and inland waterways sectors, bunkering demand for UCOME was expected to decline.

The German policy change came as UCO markets faced additional pressure from increasing Chinese sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, a 24 October Vesper report said.

China had approved three additional biofuel refiners for SAF exports, issuing quotas totalling 788,000-828,000 tonnes/year to Shandong Haike Chemical, Shandong Sanju Bioenergy and Bain Capital-backed EcoCeres, Vesper wrote.

According to a Reuters report, China has increased projected SAF exports to 1.2M tonnes this year, leading to increased competition for UCO feedstock.

European biodiesel producers now faced a strategic decision point, with the elimination of double-counting in Germany removing a significant economic incentive for UCOME production, while growing Asian demand for UCO feedstock had created additional supply constraints, the report said.

“For UCOME producers and biodiesel buyers, the next two months present a critical window to reassess supply strategies before the anticipated German policy implementation.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said the charge will range from SGD1 to SGD41.60 per passenger, depending on destination and travel class.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April 2026, for flights departing from 1 October that year. The additional fee will appear as a separate line on air tickets, and travellers on longer routes or in higher cabin classes will pay more.

Levy Rates By Destination And Cabin Class

CAAS has divided destinations into four geographical bands. Passengers travelling within Southeast Asia will pay the lowest amount, while those heading to the Americas will pay the highest.

Levy for passengers (SGD)

CAAS said travellers to Bangkok will pay SGD1 (about RM3.20) in economy or SGD4 in business class, while those heading to Tokyo will pay SGD2.80 and SGD11.20 respectively. Flights to London will see levies of SGD6.40 and SGD25.60 , while trips to New York will cost SGD10.40 and SGD41.60 .

These rates are lower than estimates made in 2024, when economy passengers were expected to pay up to SGD16 for long-haul flights. CAAS said prices of SAF have since moderated, allowing for a smaller surcharge.

When the Levy Will Take Effect

The rollout will give airlines and travellers time to prepare. The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore, nor to training, humanitarian, or charitable flights.

Tickets issued before April 2026 will not include the levy, even if travel occurs after October that year. The rates will remain fixed “for a few years” as Singapore targets having 1% of all jet fuel at Changi and Seletar airports derived from sustainable sources.

By 2030, that share is expected to rise to between 3% and 5%, depending on fuel availability and market conditions.

Existing Passenger Fees at Changi

The new SAF levy will be added on top of Singapore’s existing departure charges, which are already scheduled to rise over the next few years.

Existing departing passenger fees (SGD)

This means that by 2026, an economy passenger flying from Singapore to New York will pay a total of SGD75.60 in fees, while a business or first-class passenger will pay SGD106.80.

CAAS said these increases are needed to fund airport expansion projects and to offset rising operational costs such as energy and labour.

Implications For Malaysian Travellers

For Malaysians who often travel through Singapore, especially on long-haul routes, the new levy could mean slightly higher airfares. Many passengers from Johor and Kuala Lumpur use Changi Airport for international flights, particularly to destinations in Europe and North America that may not have direct connections from Malaysian airports.

For example, a traveller flying from Johor Bahru to Changi and onwards to London in economy class would face an additional SGD6.40 levy on top of Singapore’s standard fees. Business-class passengers on the same route would pay SGD25.60 more.

Although the levy itself is modest, it may make Singapore flights marginally more expensive compared with similar routes departing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). Airlines operating connecting flights between Malaysia and Singapore could also adjust their ticket pricing to reflect the higher overall cost.

According to regional aviation analysts, Malaysia may eventually consider adopting comparable measures, as countries face increasing pressure to align with global carbon-reduction targets under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Targeting a 2028 start of operations, the facility is expected to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) and bio-naphtha, according to a joint statement.

Feedstocks will include wastes such as used vegetable oils and animal fats, as well as residues from processed vegetable oils.

""Leveraging the synergy and strength of our partnership, the new biorefinery is one of Petronas’ key initiatives to deliver on our energy transition strategy through a holistic bio-based value chain and an expanded suite of cleaner energy solutions"", said Petronas executive vice president and chief executive for downstream Sazali Hamzah. ""This is in lockstep with Petronas’ larger aspiration to become an integrated energy leader in the next decade, serving the world’s energy needs, safely, reliably and sustainably"".

Euglena founder and president Mitsuru Izumo said, ""This project represents a global endeavor and a powerful step toward decarbonization and a more sustainable future, through enhanced clean energy supply capacity, particularly across the ASEAN region and beyond"".

""In our continued efforts to expand decarbonization solutions in response to climate change, we will continue to invest in research and development of microalgae, and advance our efforts toward the commercialization of algal biofuel"", Izumo added.

Stefano Ballista , chief executive of Eni biofuels arm Enilive, said, ""With Enilive’s biorefineries that are already operational in Italy and in the United States of America, and with new plants under construction in Italy and South Korea, the new biorefinery in Pengerang is a further and relevant step forward towards the achievement of a production capacity over five million tons per year and over two million tons of SAF by 2030, supporting the growing need for more sustainable mobility"".

Italy's state-backed energy major Eni has set goals to grow its biorefining capacity to over three MMtpa by 2028 and more than five MMtpa by 2030, with the potential to produce up to two MMtpa of SAF by 2030.

Eni's current biofuels production come from two Italian plants in Venice and Gela and a United States plant in Louisiana, operated under its 50 percent-owned joint venture St Bernard Renewables LLC, according to the company.

Earlier this year Eni began construction for a biorefinery project with LG Chem at the latter's Daesan Chemical Complex in South Korea.

Targeted for completion 2027, the plant will have an annual bio-feedstock processing capacity of about 400,000 metric tons and produce HVO and SAF, Eni said August 4.

Eni said last month it had launched the authorization process for an Environmental Impact Assessment to build another biorefinery and a chemical recycling plant in Sicily, after receiving approval from Italy's Environment and Energy Security Ministry.

Designed to produce up to 500,000 metric tons per annum of HVO diesel and SAF, the Priolo project will rise on the site of an Eni ethylene plant set to be decommissioned, Eni said in a press release October 9.

Eni said it will be its second biorefinery in Sicily, after the Gela plant, which began biofuel production 2019 after being transformed from a petrochemical site.

The Priolo biorefinery will be fed mainly by vegetable waste and oils and animal fats, Eni said.

On September 23 Eni said it had received approval from the ministry to convert several units at the Sannazzaro de' Burgondi refinery in Pavia into a biorefinery.

The refinery will continue traditional operations alongside a new processing capacity of 550,000 metric tons a year for biofuel feedstock, mainly waste and residues. Expected to start operations 2028, the biorefinery will have the flexibility to produce SAF and HVO diesel.

""The new Sannazzaro biorefinery will strengthen the site's strategic role in supplying traditional jet fuel and SAF to north-west Italian airports, via both the pipeline connection to Milan Malpensa airport and depots connected to the refinery near other airports"", Eni said.

""Through Enilive, Eni is already the second-largest producer of HVO biofuels in Europe, including both diesel and biojet (SAF)"", the company said.

Microsoft believes AI’s capacity to measure, predict and optimise complex systems will be fundamental in developing and scaling climate solutions.

Since 2020, Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund has directed over US$800m of a pledged US$1bn into a portfolio of 67 companies.

While the fund’s scope is broad, its investment direction shows an increasing focus on AI-driven strategies.

Examples include an investment in Vibrant Planet, which uses AI-powered geospatial analytics to help mitigate wildfire risk.

Another is Terradot, a start-up applying AI to enhanced rock weathering, which is a method for carbon removal.

Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) at Microsoft, sees AI as essential for progress despite the energy demands of the technology itself.

“The force creating this distance from our goals in the short term is the same one that will help us build a bigger, faster and more powerful rocket to reach them in the long term: artificial intelligence,” Melanie explains. “This is not hyperbole.”

AI’s role in hard-to-abate sectors

The fund directs capital towards sectors where decarbonisation is a major challenge, including steel and aviation.

Microsoft invested in Stegra’s commercial-scale facility in Sweden, which uses green hydrogen to produce steel with up to 95% fewer emissions than traditional methods.

Microsoft paired this with purchase agreements for steel to be used in its data centre equipment.

In aviation, Microsoft is backing the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The fund has supported Twelve’s carbon transformation technology and LanzaJet’s alcohol-to-jet process.

Microsoft also participated in a book-and-claim accounting model with Alaska Airlines, enabling the reporting of emissions reductions from SAF without requiring its physical delivery for specific flights.

These initiatives create complex systems and supply chains where AI could be used for future optimisation and efficiency gains.

“Through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, we invest in ambitious ideas and scalable technologies that create real impact,” says Brad Smith, Vice Chair (VC) and President of Microsoft.

Financing and scaling new climate models

A portion of the fund is dedicated to catalysing new markets and financing models. According to Microsoft, a financing gap often exists for nascent climate technologies, which can be too large for venture capital but too risky for traditional infrastructure investors.

Microsoft estimates this gap is between US$100m and US$180m per project.

To address this, the fund has committed more than US$100m to “first-of-a-kind” projects. It provided project finance for the Climeworks Orca plant, the first commercial direct air capture facility and supported this with a 10-year offtake agreement for 10,000 tons of CO₂.

In Nigeria, the fund backed Konexa’s development of renewable energy infrastructure for Heineken’s operations, aiming to create a replicable model for the country's power sector.

This strategy, which combines corporate investment with procurement and technology support, has attracted US$12bn in follow-on capital across the fund's portfolio companies, according to a report from Microsoft.

Measuring impact with data

To evaluate the success of its investments, Microsoft has worked with Rhodium Group to develop a framework that assesses both direct emissions reductions and the “catalysed” reductions that occur when new technologies are helped towards cost parity.

For emerging technologies like low-carbon steel, the fund reports that catalysed reductions could substantially exceed direct reductions.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a4df115508ce0c79a6f289138b9ba1ba:f447dc23fa486680c2ac4afd1a22b1ef/brad-smith.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:57:57.075900

Aviation alone produced 882Mt of CO₂ in 2023, according to the Air Transport Action Group.

In response, the Commission has adopted its communication on a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).

This establishes a roadmap to accelerate the energy transition in these critical industries, forming a key part of the EU Competitiveness Compass.

Fuelling the future of transport

The plan is designed to unlock capital and increase the production of renewable and low carbon fuels.

Its targets are aligned with the EU’s ReFuelEU aviation and FuelEU maritime regulations that are central to the energy strategy for transport.

The ReFuelEU aviation regulation promotes a greater uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This could include synthetic aviation fuels, advanced biofuels and recycled carbon aviation fuels to lower CO₂ emissions from air travel.

The FuelEU maritime regulation imposes limits on the yearly average greenhouse gas intensity of energy used by ships more than 5,000 gross tonnes calling at European ports.

To tackle air pollution, it also mandates that from 1st January 2030, passenger and container ships must use onshore power supply or other zero-emission technologies when docked.

Meeting the ambitious targets set by ReFuelEU and FuelEU will require an estimated 20 million tonnes of SAF and investments totalling €100bn (US$115.6bn) by 2035 to facilitate this energy transition.

Unlocking investment for new energy

Providing regulatory certainty is fundamental to attracting the necessary investment.

Through the STIP, the European Commission is signalling to the market that its targets are firm and that it will support the sector throughout this transition.

The plan's EU measures are expected to mobilise at least US$3.1bn by the end of 2027.

This includes several key funding streams:

InvestEU to mobilise at least US$2.1bn for sustainable alternative fuels by 2027

About US$320m via the European Hydrogen Bank to support hydrogen production for SAF and sustainable maritime fuel (SMF) by year-end

Around US$142m for research and innovation projects under Horizon Europe

A projected US$164m for synthetic aviation fuel projects and US$314m for maritime fuel projects through the Innovation Fund

In the medium term, the EU plans to establish an intermediary mechanism to connect fuel producers and buyers.

This will provide revenue certainty and de-risk investment in new energy production.

Singapore is set to impose a new charge for travelers flying out of the country, starting in 2026. The “sustainable aviation fuel levy” (SAFL) will be levied on passengers departing Singapore from 1 October 2026, with tickets for these flights being sold from 1 April 2026. This new charge will apply to all international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport and Seletar Airport, marking a significant step towards making aviation more environmentally friendly.

The levy is part of Singapore’s broader efforts to contribute to global sustainability goals by promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The country has long been a leader in aviation innovation, and this initiative seeks to make air travel cleaner by reducing the industry’s carbon footprint.

What Is the Green Fuel Levy and How Will It Affect Passengers?

The green fuel levy, which will be added to the cost of flight tickets, aims to support the aviation industry’s transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel and is made from renewable sources such as waste products, algae, and plant oils. The goal of the levy is to ensure that more airlines adopt SAF, thereby reducing the carbon emissions produced by air travel.

The new levy will vary depending on the destination and the class of travel. For example, passengers flying to nearby Southeast Asian destinations will pay as little as SGD 1 (approximately USD 0.75) per ticket. In contrast, those traveling to long-haul destinations such as North America will be charged up to SGD 41.60 (approximately USD 30) per ticket. Business and first-class passengers will face higher charges compared to economy passengers, reflecting the larger carbon footprint associated with premium classes.

While the levy is not excessively high, it will contribute to the broader goal of decarbonizing the aviation sector. The funds raised from the levy will be used to accelerate the adoption of SAF in Singapore and fund the development of sustainable aviation technologies. This marks a major step towards aligning the aviation sector with the Singapore government’s sustainability goals.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: A Necessary Step for Greener Aviation

The aviation industry is one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions. As countries around the world work to meet their climate targets, reducing emissions from aviation has become a critical priority. SAF is considered one of the most promising solutions to help reduce the sector’s carbon footprint. SAF has the potential to lower life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

However, SAF is still in its early stages of development, and its production is currently limited. The green fuel levy will help make SAF more financially viable and encourage airlines to adopt this eco-friendly fuel. Singapore’s government has already committed to making its air hub a leader in the global push for greener aviation. As part of this vision, the country aims to meet its goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the aviation sector by 2050.

This levy will also put pressure on other countries to follow suit and consider similar charges or incentives to encourage the use of SAF. As more nations implement policies that encourage the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels, the global aviation industry will move closer to its decarbonization goals.

What Travelers Need to Know About the Levy

For travelers, the introduction of the green fuel levy means that the cost of flying out of Singapore will increase, but by a relatively small amount. The levy will be clearly itemized on the flight ticket, ensuring that passengers are aware of the charge before they book their tickets.

Passengers flying to nearby destinations in Southeast Asia will only see a small increase in their ticket prices, while those traveling to further destinations like the Americas and Europe will pay a larger charge. The levy will apply to both direct flights and connecting flights that depart from Singapore. However, passengers who are merely transiting through Singapore will not be required to pay the levy.

For airlines, this levy will encourage them to make the transition to SAF. The funds generated from the levy will be used to develop more sustainable aviation technologies and make SAF more affordable and accessible. The government has committed to working closely with airlines, fuel producers, and other stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable aviation fuel.

A Step Towards Sustainable Travel

This move by Singapore represents a significant step towards achieving global sustainability in the aviation sector. The sustainable aviation fuel levy will not only help reduce the carbon footprint of air travel but will also encourage innovation in green technologies. It reflects Singapore’s commitment to becoming a leader in sustainable aviation, and the introduction of this levy will likely inspire other countries to consider similar measures.

While the levy may add a small cost to flight tickets, it will play an important role in creating a more sustainable future for aviation. The funds generated will help accelerate the development of SAF and other green technologies, which are essential for the future of air travel.

As the world moves towards a greener future, the introduction of the green fuel levy in Singapore is an important step that demonstrates the country’s leadership in sustainable travel. Travelers can expect a small increase in their ticket prices starting in 2026, but they can also feel good knowing that their contribution is helping the aviation industry move towards a more sustainable future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s2-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:58:17.571953

In a step towards sustainability, Singapore will introduce a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy from 1 April 2026, with the charges applying to flights departing from 1 October 2026. The levy aims to accelerate the adoption of greener jet fuel and reduce aviation emissions, marking a significant move towards the nation’s decarbonisation goals.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) shared in a press statement on 10 November that as longer flights consume more fuel, the SAF levy will be based on the distance travelled. All destinations from Singapore have been grouped into four geographical bands. For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

Here is the breakdown of the SAF levy geographical bands:

Geographical bandRegions & countries ISoutheast AsiaIINortheast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New GuineaIIIAfrica, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands, New ZealandIVAmericas

SAF levy for passengers

The SAF levy will apply on a per-passenger basis, with charges varying by geographic zones, travel distance, and cabin type:

Economy Cabin which includes Economy Class and Premium Economy Class, or

Premium Cabin which includes Business Class and First Class.

Premium Cabin passengers will pay significantly more under the SAF levy — about four times the Economy Cabin within the same travel band, which CAAS said reflects industry standards that account for the higher carbon footprint of premium seating. Airlines will collect the SAF levy and must display it as a as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold.

The SAF levy will only apply to 'Origin-destination passengers' — a passenger who departs from Singapore to another destination — and not those transiting through Singapore.

Premium cabin: S$41.60

CAAS had initially estimated the SAF levy for economy passengers to be around S$3, S$6, and S$16 to Bangkok, Tokyo, and London, respectively. The actual charges, however, are much lower — S$1, S$2.80, and S$6.40 respectively. The difference reflects the current lower cost of sustainable aviation fuel compared to when the original estimates were made.

SAF levy for cargo shipments

For cargo shipments, the SAF levy will be charged per kilogramme and will vary by distance, grouped into four geographical bands.

Certain flights — such as training flights or those for charitable and humanitarian purposes — will be exempt from the SAF levy.

All collected levies will go into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS, dedicated solely to purchasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and/or SAF environmental attributes (EAs), as well as covering related administrative costs.

To ensure transparency and value for money, the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) will oversee the procurement, allocation, and administration of SAF and EAs.

Commenting on the move, Han Kok Juan, Director-General, CAAS said:

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has introduced the green fuel levy to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel. This is a cleaner alternative made from low-carbon sources such as used cooking oil and waste biomass. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, though it's still far costlier to produce.

To help cover this gap, every passenger departing from Singapore will pay a small, fixed contribution that goes toward SAF purchases. The amount depends on the flight distance and travel class:

Economy/Premium Economy: Between S$1 (around Rs 68) for short regional routes and S$10.40 (around Rs 700) for long-haul flights to destinations like the Americas.

Business/First Class: Between S$4 (around Rs 270) and S$41.60 (around Rs 2,800) for longer, more fuel-intensive journeys.

Cargo Flights: Levies range from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram (around Rs 0.68-Rs 10/kg) depending on distance.

When It Kicks In: Key Dates and Who It Applies To

The levy officially begins in October 2026, but it applies only to tickets issued from 1 April 2026 onward. Travellers who book their tickets before April 2026 will not be charged the levy, even if their flight departs after implementation. The levy applies only to flights departing from Singapore. Transit passengers merely passing through Changi Airport will not have to pay for it. The fee will appear as a separate line item on air tickets for full transparency.

Why Singapore Is Introducing The Green Fuel Levy

As one of Asia's busiest air hubs, Singapore plays a key role in shaping aviation's future sustainability. The levy supports the country's target for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1% of total jet fuel use by 2026, with plans to increase this to 3-5% by 2030, depending on global supply and cost trends. Rather than burdening airlines or taxpayers, the government is spreading the cost fairly among air travellers who directly benefit from aviation. This ensures that Singapore's path to greener skies remains both financially viable and environmentally responsible.

The policy also offers predictability: airlines know how much to collect, passengers see the charge clearly, and the funds are dedicated solely to sustainable fuel procurement. It's a carefully designed model that other nations are likely to watch closely.

What The Green Fuel Levy Means for Travellers

For most passengers, the levy won't dramatically change travel budgets. However, it does reflect a meaningful shift in how the aviation industry is tackling its carbon challenge. Here's what travellers should keep in mind:

For economy travellers, the additional cost ranges from Rs 68 to about Rs 700, which is negligible compared to the total ticket prices. Business and first-class flyers will pay more, reflecting their larger share of flight emissions.

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net-zero by 2050. This statistic isn’t just a number—it’s a mandate for transformation that I see reshaping the entire aviation ecosystem. In my work with global energy and transportation leaders, I’ve witnessed the quiet revolution happening behind the scenes. We’re at a pivotal moment where the aviation industry, responsible for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions according to the World Economic Forum, is fundamentally reinventing its energy foundation. The current state reminds me of the early days of renewable energy in other sectors—limited production capacity, high costs, but undeniable momentum building toward an inevitable tipping point. What we’re seeing now is just the beginning of a complete overhaul of how we power flight.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting work with aviation leaders is the massive gap between current SAF production and what’s needed to meet climate targets. As noted by McKinsey & Company, current SAF production accounts for less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption, despite growing demand from airlines and corporate travelers. The reality is that scaling production isn’t just about building more facilities—it’s about creating entirely new supply chains, securing consistent feedstock, and navigating complex regulatory environments across different regions. I’ve sat in boardrooms where executives grapple with the chicken-and-egg problem: without guaranteed demand, investors hesitate to fund large-scale production facilities, but without sufficient supply, airlines can’t commit to meaningful SAF adoption. This creates a systemic bottleneck that requires coordinated action across multiple stakeholders.

Challenge 2: The Cost Competitiveness Conundrum

The economic reality of SAF presents another significant barrier. According to Deloitte research, sustainable aviation fuel currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel, creating a substantial financial hurdle for widespread adoption. In my experience advising airline executives, this cost differential creates a competitive disadvantage for early adopters unless mechanisms are in place to share the burden across the value chain. The Harvard Business Review notes that while corporate sustainability commitments are driving some demand, the premium price of SAF makes it challenging for airlines to absorb these costs without passing them to consumers. What I see happening is a delicate balancing act between environmental responsibility and economic viability—a tension that requires innovative business models and policy support to resolve.

Challenge 3: Technological and Infrastructure Limitations

The third challenge revolves around technological maturity and infrastructure compatibility. As PwC highlights in their energy transition reports, most current SAF production relies on limited feedstock options and conversion technologies that haven’t yet achieved commercial scale. From my perspective as a technology futurist, the infrastructure challenge extends beyond production to distribution and storage. Existing airport fuel systems weren’t designed for widespread SAF integration, and the “drop-in” nature of current SAF formulations—while beneficial for compatibility—limits innovation in next-generation fuel technologies. I’ve seen how this creates a conservative approach to innovation, where the safe bet of incremental improvement often outweighs the potential rewards of breakthrough technologies.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. Leading organizations are implementing several key strategies that I believe will accelerate SAF adoption.

First, strategic partnerships are becoming crucial. I’ve advised companies on forming consortiums that bring together airlines, fuel producers, technology providers, and corporate customers to share risks and rewards. These partnerships, like the one between Microsoft and Alaska Airlines that I’ve studied, create guaranteed demand that enables production scale-up while distributing costs across multiple stakeholders.

Second, technological innovation is rapidly advancing. Companies like LanzaJet are commercializing alcohol-to-jet technology, while others are exploring power-to-liquid pathways that use renewable electricity, water, and CO2 to create synthetic fuels. In my analysis, these second and third-generation technologies will dramatically expand feedstock options and reduce land-use concerns.

Third, policy mechanisms and carbon markets are creating new economic models. As the World Economic Forum reports, blending mandates in regions like Europe and tax incentives in the United States are helping bridge the cost gap while carbon offset programs are generating additional revenue streams for SAF producers.

Fourth, digital platforms are emerging to track, verify, and trade SAF certificates and environmental attributes. I’ve consulted with companies developing blockchain-based systems that provide transparent accounting of emissions reductions—a critical element for corporate sustainability reporting and regulatory compliance.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a picture of rapid transformation. According to BloombergNEF projections, SAF production capacity could grow from less than 0.5 billion liters today to over 30 billion liters by 2030 under optimistic scenarios. The International Energy Agency forecasts that SAF could account for 10% of aviation fuel demand by 2030 in their accelerated case scenario, representing a hundred-fold increase from current levels.

In my foresight exercises with industry leaders, I envision several breakthrough moments in the coming decade. By 2026, I predict we’ll see the first commercial-scale power-to-liquid SAF facility become operational, demonstrating the potential for carbon-neutral aviation fuel. By 2028, I anticipate that SAF will reach cost parity with conventional jet fuel in certain regions due to scaling effects, technological improvements, and carbon pricing mechanisms.

The market size projections are equally compelling. Accenture analysis suggests the global SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million today to over $15 billion by 2030, creating massive opportunities for innovators across the value chain. What excites me most is how this transformation will ripple through adjacent industries, creating new markets for agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and direct air capture technologies.

By 2030, I believe we’ll see regional SAF hubs emerge around major airport clusters, supported by dedicated renewable energy infrastructure and circular economy partnerships. The aviation fuel ecosystem of 2030 will look fundamentally different from today’s linear model, incorporating diverse feedstocks, multiple production pathways, and digital tracking systems that provide unprecedented transparency.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, sustainable aviation fuel will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream energy source that fundamentally reshapes aviation’s environmental footprint. The transformation will be driven by converging forces: regulatory pressure, technological innovation, corporate sustainability commitments, and growing consumer awareness. Airlines that successfully navigate this transition will gain competitive advantages through lower emissions profiles, strengthened brand reputation, and preferential access to increasingly scarce sustainable fuel supplies. The risks of delay are substantial—including regulatory non-compliance, stranded assets in conventional fuel infrastructure, and loss of market share to more agile competitors. The opportunity lies in building resilient, diversified fuel strategies that incorporate multiple SAF pathways and create value beyond mere compliance.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of flight is being rewritten today, not in distant laboratories but in boardrooms, policy forums, and innovation hubs around the world. What we’re witnessing is more than an energy transition—it’s the reinvention of one of humanity’s greatest achievements. As I often tell leaders in my keynotes: “The most sustainable fuel isn’t just what powers the aircraft, but the innovative thinking that powers the transformation.”

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel production reached over 600 million liters in 2023—a 200% increase from 2022, yet still representing less than 0.2% of total aviation fuel consumption. This statistic reveals both the explosive growth and the monumental challenge ahead. In my work advising global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed an industry at a critical inflection point. We’re no longer debating whether SAF will transform aviation—we’re grappling with how quickly and completely this transformation will occur. The World Economic Forum notes that aviation accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon emissions, making SAF adoption not just an environmental imperative but an economic necessity. What fascinates me most is how we’re approaching a threshold where technological innovation, policy alignment, and market forces converge to create unprecedented acceleration. Having consulted with airlines, fuel producers, and government agencies across three continents, I see patterns emerging that suggest we’re on the verge of a breakthrough moment that will redefine air travel as we know it.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Feedstock Scarcity Paradox

The most immediate bottleneck I’m observing across the industry isn’t technology or funding—it’s the fundamental limitation of sustainable feedstock. As noted by McKinsey & Company, current SAF production relies heavily on limited feedstocks like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, creating intense competition for resources that simply cannot scale to meet projected demand. In my consulting work with major European airlines, I’ve seen firsthand how this scarcity drives up costs and creates supply chain vulnerabilities. The Harvard Business Review recently highlighted that feedstock constraints could limit SAF adoption to just 5-10% of total aviation fuel by 2030 unless alternative sources emerge. What’s particularly concerning is how this scarcity creates a ripple effect—when one airline secures a long-term feedstock contract, it immediately disadvantages competitors and slows overall industry progress. I’ve sat in boardrooms where executives acknowledge that their sustainability commitments may be physically impossible to fulfill given current feedstock limitations.

Challenge 2: The Infrastructure Conversion Dilemma

The aviation industry faces a massive infrastructure challenge that many outside observers underestimate. According to Deloitte research, over 90% of existing airport fuel infrastructure requires significant modification to handle high-percentage SAF blends efficiently. Having consulted on fuel logistics projects in Asia and North America, I’ve witnessed how the “drop-in” nature of SAF creates a false sense of compatibility. While SAF can technically replace conventional jet fuel, the reality is more complex. Storage tanks, pipelines, and refueling equipment all need adaptation, and the capital requirements are staggering. PwC estimates that global aviation infrastructure upgrades for SAF compatibility could exceed $150 billion over the next decade. What’s particularly challenging is the coordination problem—airports, fuel suppliers, and airlines must synchronize their investments, creating a classic chicken-and-egg scenario that slows adoption. I’ve advised clients that the infrastructure challenge represents a greater barrier than production capacity itself.

Challenge 3: The Green Premium Economic Model

The economic reality of SAF creates what I call the “green premium paradox.” According to Accenture analysis, SAF currently costs 2-4 times more than conventional jet fuel, creating an unsustainable economic model for widespread adoption. In my work with airline CFOs, I’ve seen how this premium creates tension between sustainability goals and financial viability. The World Economic Forum notes that even with projected efficiency improvements, SAF is unlikely to reach price parity with conventional jet fuel before 2040 without significant policy intervention. What makes this particularly challenging is the competitive dynamics—airlines that aggressively pursue SAF face higher operating costs, potentially putting them at a disadvantage against less sustainable competitors. I’ve observed how this creates a collective action problem where individual rational decisions (minimizing costs) conflict with collective needs (decarbonizing aviation). The current patchwork of subsidies and mandates creates market distortions rather than sustainable economic models.

Solutions and Innovations

The solutions emerging give me tremendous optimism about our ability to overcome these challenges.

First, I’m particularly excited about the advancement of power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies that create synthetic fuels from green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. Major European energy companies are now scaling PtL facilities that could eventually eliminate feedstock constraints entirely. In my consulting work, I’ve helped organizations understand how these technologies create a virtuous cycle—using renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, capturing CO2 from industrial processes or directly from the air, and synthesizing carbon-neutral jet fuel.

Second, modular and distributed production models are revolutionizing SAF infrastructure. Rather than building massive centralized refineries, companies are developing smaller-scale production units that can be located near airports or even integrated into existing refinery infrastructure. I’ve advised several startups pursuing this approach, which dramatically reduces infrastructure conversion costs and creates more resilient supply chains. The World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative highlights how these distributed models could reduce infrastructure investment requirements by 40-60%.

Third, advanced financing mechanisms and offtake agreements are creating more sustainable economic models. Major corporations like Microsoft and Amazon are entering long-term SAF purchase agreements that provide producers with the revenue certainty needed to finance expansion. In my strategic planning sessions with airline executives, I’ve helped structure these agreements to balance cost concerns with sustainability commitments. These innovative financing approaches, combined with emerging carbon pricing mechanisms, are gradually closing the green premium gap.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of technology adoption curves and industry dynamics, I project that SAF will reach 10% of global aviation fuel by 2030 and 30% by 2040. McKinsey estimates the SAF market will grow from approximately $1 billion today to over $30 billion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate of 25%. What excites me most are the technological breakthroughs on the horizon—particularly in synthetic biology and catalytic processes that could dramatically improve conversion efficiency.

My foresight exercises with industry leaders suggest several “what if” scenarios that could accelerate adoption. What if major oil companies reallocate 20% of their conventional refining capacity to SAF production by 2030? What if carbon capture technology advances enable cost-effective atmospheric CO2 harvesting for fuel synthesis? What if electric and hydrogen aircraft begin displacing short-haul routes, freeing up SAF for long-haul flights where alternatives aren’t feasible?

I predict we’ll see the first SAF-powered transatlantic flight by a major carrier within two years, followed by rapid scaling as production increases. By 2030, I expect at least three major airports will operate exclusively on SAF, creating demonstration hubs that accelerate global adoption. The International Energy Agency projects that SAF could account for 65% of aviation’s carbon reduction by 2050, but I believe this is conservative—with the right policy support and technological acceleration, we could see 80% or higher.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

The next decade will witness the most dramatic transformation in aviation fuel since the jet age began. SAF will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream solution, driven by technological breakthroughs, policy support, and changing consumer expectations. The industry will overcome current scalability challenges through synthetic fuels and advanced bioengineering, while new business models will make sustainable flying economically viable. Airlines that embrace this transformation early will gain competitive advantage, while laggards face regulatory and reputational risks. The coming decade represents both an unprecedented challenge and the greatest opportunity in aviation history—to fundamentally reinvent how we power flight while preserving the connectivity that defines our modern world.

Ian Khan’s Closing

I often tell leaders that the future doesn’t happen to us—we build it through the decisions we make today. Sustainable aviation fuel represents one of those pivotal opportunities where our choices will echo for generations. As I’ve witnessed in my work with forward-thinking organizations, the companies that thrive in the coming decades will be those that see beyond immediate constraints to the possibilities ahead.

“In our early days, few travelers ever mentioned sustainability — most just wanted to support local communities,” she says.","According to a report issued earlier this year by the World Travel and Tourism Council, consumer interest into responsible travel doesn’t always translate to more planet-friendly bookings.

The study, ""Bridging the Say-Do Gap: How to Create an Effective Sustainability Strategy by Knowing Your Customers,"" found that barriers to booking more low-impact travel include cost and lack of awareness. The good news: This is an opportunity for travel advisors to play a vital role, by connecting clients with meaningful experiences that benefit local communities and protect the planet’s natural resources.

Susan Blume, founder and CEO of Personal Escape Travel, is among the advisors finding success by educating clients about travel with reduced environmental impacts. “Given the present economic climate, many guests prioritize cost initially,” she says. “However, after we inform them about businesses that provide both value and eco-friendly practices, they are eager to engage with those brands.”

Education is crucial, according to Blume. “A significant number of travelers remain uninformed about sustainable practices in tourism,” she says, noting that some do have ideas about what responsible tourism can mean. “The main issues they bring up revolve around overtourism and how locals perceive visitors. Additionally, some travelers wish to contribute to local communities, not only through financial means but also by investing their time and efforts towards environmental well-being.”

Finding the right partners is key for advisors looking to sell more of this type of travel, Blume adds. “As a travel consultant, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive understanding of suppliers and partners who demonstrate a real commitment to sustainability,” she says. “Once this knowledge is acquired, personally engaging with the product, resort or destination is crucial. Such firsthand experience will enable you to engage in a more genuine and informed dialogue with your guests.”

Blume’s vetting process includes finding suppliers with certifications from organizations including Oceanic Global, EarthCheck and Green Globe — and seeing what suppliers are doing in person. “We believe in visiting these destinations or resorts to witness firsthand the initiatives in place that combat greenwashing,” she explains, citing Sandals and Beaches resorts — use PADI-certified diving boats to aid coral reef restoration in the Caribbean — as examples of sustainability in action.

Responsible Travel Becomes Mainstream

Monika Sundem, CEO of Adventure Life, an Affluent Traveler Collection affiliate, has witnessed an evolution in how consumers perceive the concept of responsible travel. “In our early days, few travelers ever mentioned sustainability — most just wanted to support local communities,” she says. “Over time, we’ve seen growing awareness around things like habitat preservation, plastic reduction and carbon impact. It’s evolved from a niche concern into something more mainstream, though still secondary to the desire for a meaningful travel experience.”

Still, “most travelers don’t come to us asking specifically for a ‘sustainable vacation,’” Sundem said. “They just want a great trip — and they trust that we’ve already vetted who we partner with given our statements about responsible travel on our website.”

To sell clients on more mindful experiences, Sundem emphasizes the benefits. “True sustainability often enhances the experience: fresh local food, deep cultural connection and access to pristine wilderness are luxuries in their own right,” she states. “In the early days, this sometimes felt like an either-or choice, that you could either have luxury without sustainability, or a more 'rustic' experience with sustainability. While that dichotomy may still exist in some respects, the gap between those two options has narrowed drastically.”

Encouraging Mindful Travel

For Abbie Synan, a travel advisor with Fora, leading by example helps to encourage more low-impact bookings. “Many of my clients seek me out because of my style of travel,” she says. “By showing my own mindful travel experiences, it can inspire clients to incorporate more sustainable travel elements into their own itineraries.”

Synan advocates for “slow travel” and for beginning each client conversation with intentionality. “If they haven't thought about these concepts, I really encourage advisors to have that conversation at the beginning of the planning process,” she explains. “You'll find people are much more open to weaving more sustainable practices into their vacations.”

Supporting local communities is the easiest entry point to ethical travel, according to Synan. “Having a connection locally is a win-win for both the destination and the traveler,” she says. “Community-based tourism is a really approachable way into the conversation.”

She shares an example from Portugal’s Douro Valley, where she sent clients during the shoulder season to work with a small local tour operator who grew up in the region. “Part of their tour is a boat ride on the river, and we worked with a company that has an electric version of the traditional Rabelo boats,” she says. “We took a destination where overtourism has been a pain point and we traveled off season, we avoided tourism leakage by keeping our euros in the community and we helped the environment of the Douro region by taking a better means of transportation — all while not sacrificing the experience.”

Ideal Destinations and Suppliers

Sundem looks for authenticity when considering travel options that reduce environmental impacts. “We look for sustainability that’s built into their DNA — not just in written policies, but in the heart of how they operate,” she says. “Are they doing more to preserve culture, local community, habitat and reduce emissions than others in that region? If so, we will opt to work with them should we feel they are also a good fit for our ethos.”

Advisors can also spotlight airlines with strong initiatives — such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) programs — and destinations that are leading the way. Paris, for example, is transforming its infrastructure with an emphasis on walkability and green living, by prioritizing pedestrians and cyclists, expanding urban green spaces and promoting local and organic food. Meanwhile, Kittilä, Finland is a showcase for Visit Finland’s Sustainable Travel Finland program, which helps travel professionals create itineraries that minimize impact while maximizing local benefits.

One thing is certain, according to Synan: consumer attitudes about mindful travel will continue to evolve. “The conversation about ways to be a better traveler is nuanced, complex and a moving target,” she says. “We are learning more about things we can do as global citizens to continue to be curious about the world we all live in, explore new places and move from less harm to a more net-positive approach.”",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/TW_Elearn/Sales/Strategic_Content/Air_France_Sustainability_Lead_Resize.jpg?n=3030&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-11-12 02:56:17.187311

Questions & Answers When will the aviation fuel levy take effect?
The aviation fuel levy will take effect from October 2026.","Air travellers departing from Singapore will be subject to a sustainable aviation fuel levy starting October 2026. The levy, whose rates will vary between S$1 to S$41.60 (US$0.77 to US$31.92), applies to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, onwards for flights departing on or after October 1, 2026, as stated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.

Detailed Breakdown of the Levy

The exact levy amount is contingent on the travel class and destination. The destinations are divided into four geographical bands, with the levies increasing progressively.

Passengers travelling to destinations in Band 1, which encompasses Southeast Asia, will incur an additional charge of S$1 for economy or premium economy tickets and S$4 for business or first class tickets.

For Band 2, which includes Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea, travellers will face an added fee of S$2.80 for economy class and S$11.20 for business class.

Travellers to destinations in Band 3 – Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, and New Zealand – will incur additional levies of S$6.40 and S$25.60 respectively.

Lastly, passengers flying to the Americas, falling under Band 4, will be charged an extra S$10.40 for economy class and S$41.60 for business class.

Exceptions and Special Cases

Passengers merely transiting through Singapore will not be subjected to the above levies. For multi-stop flights, the fee will be determined by the next destination after departing Singapore.

Moreover, the levy will also extend to cargo, with rates ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram. This calculation will follow the same geographical bands as those used for passenger flights.

The levy will also be applicable to general aviation, which includes private, non-commercial flights, and business aviation, such as private jets and chartered flights.

Origins and Impact of the Levy

The levy was first introduced in 2024 as a component of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which aimed to achieve net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.

Han Kok Juan, the director-general of the aviation authority, emphasized the commitment of Singapore, as a global air hub and an International Civil Aviation Organisation council member, to its environmental responsibilities. He reiterated that the country would take necessary steps to contribute to the cause while maintaining the competitiveness of the Singapore air hub.

*******************************************************

​The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, attended the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, on November 11 (Belém time). He met with the Chinese delegation and delivered a speech at the China Pavilion's side event.

In the morning, Mr Tse, together with the Director of Electrical and Mechanical Services, Mr Poon Kwok-ying, and the Commissioner for Climate Change of the Environment and Ecology Bureau, Mr Arthur Lee, met with the head of the Chinese delegation, Mr Li Gao, to exchange views on the work of the country and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on climate change actions and green transition.

In the afternoon, Mr Tse attended the China Pavilion's side event, guided by the Department of Climate Change of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) and cohosted by the Environment and Ecology Bureau of the HKSAR Government, Friends of the Earth (HK) and the Hong Kong Financial Services Development Council. The side event, titled Converging Innovation in Hong Kong: Forging a Resilient City and a Global Green Finance Hub, focused on exploring Hong Kong's role, achievements, and strategies in addressing climate change. Key discussion areas include climate action, energy transition, green and sustainable finance, climate resilience enhancement, and strengthening regional and international co-operation frameworks.

In his opening speech, Mr Tse said that, to tackle climate change, Hong Kong stopped building coal-fired power plants in 1997 and reached its carbon peak in 2014. Greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by about a quarter now, compared to the peak in 2014. The per-capita greenhouse gas emissions fell nearly 30 per cent to below 4.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is about a quarter of that of the United States and 60 per cent of the European Union.

Mr Tse added that Hong Kong targets to reduce Hong Kong's emissions by half before 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. He shared that the HKSAR Government has put forward a four-pronged strategy in the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050: namely net-zero electricity supply, energy saving and green buildings, green transport, and zero waste landfilling. Related energy measures include stopping the use of coal for power generation by 2035, increasing the share of zero carbon electricity supply to over 60 per cent, and publishing the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong last year to build a framework environment to the local development of hydrogen in a prudent and orderly manner.

He said that Hong Kong is also progressing well in promoting green transport. Out of 10 newly registered private cars, seven are now electric. A public charging network based on super-fast charging technologies is being developed and an electric vehicle battery recycling facility will be put into operation next year.

On waste-to-energy, the first large-scale waste-to-energy facility is coming into operation this month and the second one is being tendered for completion by 2030. Hong Kong is also working with the Chinese Mainland to develop a production base for sustainable aviation fuel in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area as well as gearing up to develop Hong Kong into a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre.

Regarding green finance, Mr Tse stated that as an international financial centre and sustainable finance hub in Asia, Hong Kong can help channel international capital to support the green transition. He illustrated, with an example, that as of October 2025, the HKSAR Government has issued green bonds totalling an equivalent of about US$31 billion. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards was implemented to fully align with the global baseline set by the International Sustainability Standards Board.

Mr Tse expressed that international co-operation is critical for tackling the challenge of climate change. ""The low carbon green transition is a difficult journey, and yet it has opened up many new collaboration opportunities. Hong Kong looks forward to working hand in hand with all of you to build a climate resilient and sustainable future for our next generations,"" said Mr Tse.

Other guest speakers at the event included the President of the BRI International Green Development Coalition and former Vice Minister of the MEE, Mr Zhao Yingmin; the Chairman of the Council for Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development, Dr Lam Ching-choi; the Secretary General of ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, Mr Gino Van Begin; and Vice-Chairperson of Friends of the Earth (HK) Ms Ophelia Lin.

Mr Poon and Mr Lee also spoke at the roundtable forum of the side event to exchange views with other speakers on accelerating energy transition and achieving carbon neutrality. Dr Lam spoke at another forum session to exchange views with other speakers on the topic of Building Climate-Resilient Cities: Managing Climate and Health Risks.

To achieve an interim target to halve the peak emission before 2035 and carbon neutrality before 2050, the city’s Climate Action Plan 2050 has put forward a four-pronged strategy: to go for net-zero carbon electricity supply; to promote energy saving and green buildings; to promote green transport; and to achieve zero landfilling of wastes, which is necessary to reduce methane, said the secretary for environment and ecology.

By 2035, Hong Kong will stop using coal for power generation, increase raise share of zero carbon electricity supply to over 60 percent, stop selling conventional fueled private cars including hybrids, and stop landfilling of municipal wastes, he added.

Tse pointed out that the use of coal for electricity generation has been cut to about 15 percent, while around 60 percent of the electricity supply is by natural gas and 25 percent by nuclear, as of now.

Speaking about the progress on promoting green transport, he said, “Out of 10 newly registered private cars, seven are now electric. We are also developing a public charging network based on super-fast charging technologies. Furthermore, an electric vehicle battery recycling facility is coming into operation next year.”

The SAR has made tremendous efforts in the last three years to achieve zero landfilling, which has successfully reduced waste disposal by 10 percent, while quantities of material recycled have increased by 30 percent, according to the environment chief.

The first large-scale waste-to-energy facility is coming into operation in November, and the second one is being tendered for completion by 2030, he added.

While gearing up to develop itself into a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading center, the HKSAR is working with the Chinese mainland to develop a production base for sustainable aviation fuel in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area, he said.

“Our capital market offers a wide range of green and sustainable investment products. As of June 2025, over 200 ESG (environmental, social, and governance) funds were authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission, with assets under management over HK$1.1 trillion.”

In this context, the secretary mentioned that the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong last year amounted to around $43 billion, capturing around 45 percent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years.

As of October 2025, the SAR government has issued green bonds totaling about $31 billion equivalent denominated in Hong Kong dollar, Renminbi, euro, and US dollar, providing important benchmarks for potential issuers in Hong Kong and in the region.

Stressing the vitality of accurate, consistent and relevant information about sustainability-related matters, Tse said Hong Kong's Core Climate is currently the only carbon marketplace offering settlement in both Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi for international voluntary carbon credits.

“The low-carbon green transition is a difficult journey and yet has opened up many new collaboration opportunities,” he said, calling for international cooperation to tackle the challenge of climate change.

The levy will apply to Origin-Destination traffic, cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights departing Singapore from 1 October 2026, applicable for tickets or services sold from 1 April 2026.

The levy will be split into four bands:

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, New Zealand

Band 4: Americas

This will then be levied based on distance and class of service

Economy Cabin: comprising Economy Class and Premium Economy Class

Premium Cabin: comprising Business Class and First Class

The SAF Levy for Premium Cabin is four times that for the Economy Cabin for the same geographical band. The airline must collect the SAF Levy and display it as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold.

The SAF Levy will only apply to Origin-Destination passengers and not those transiting through Singapore.

So, what do the numbers look like?

Not that much in the grand scheme of a ticket – but still a chunk of cash.

Geographical Band Passenger SAF Levy (Per Passenger Charge) Economy Cabin Premium Cabin Band I

Southeast Asia S$1.00 S$4.00 Band II

Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea S$2.80 S$11.20 Band III

Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand S$6.40 S$25.60 Band IV

Americas S$10.40 S$41.60

The CAAS had previously estimated the SAF Levy to be around S$3.00, S$6.00, and S$16.00 for a passenger in economy class travelling direct to Bangkok, Tokyo, and London, respectively. The actual SAF Levy amounts for economy tickets to these same destinations are S$1.00, S$2.80 and S$6.40, respectively. The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made.

If you’re shipping cargo, expect this to go up per kilogram. For those who have a private jet, well, open your wallet, I think the term is. The table below shows you how much

Certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF Levy.

The SAF Levy collected will go into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS.

Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, said:

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

Yup. Another charge on your ticket

We’re all used to extra charges across our tickets, with little bits being tacked on.

For a lot of passengers (especially in Economy or Premium Economy), you’re not going to see a lot tacked onto your ticket. For even long-haul tickets, the additional taxes are not too much of a burden.

For those connecting through Singapore as a pit-stop, this is one cost you won’t have to deal with.

What will be a burden is if you bring your private jet to Singapore. But then money is an odd concept at that point, especially if you’re flying in your mobile place.

Thankfully, scientists have found a sustainable way to cut that contribution by turning everyday trash into jet fuel.

A study published in Nature Sustainability shows that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel could reduce pollution by 80-90% compared to conventional jet fuel. The findings support that one day, food scraps and packaging could power commercial flights.

Researchers from the U.S. and China found that trash-based jet fuel could account for 62.5 billion liters annually, enough to cut global aviation pollution by 16%, as Anthropocene Magazine reported.

""There is a wealth of organic waste deserving our attention,"" said research team member Michael McElroy, an environmental studies professor at Harvard University.

In addition to waste, the Nature Sustainability study also noted that integrating green hydrogen into the process could remove even more carbon, while the biggest hurdle is improving the gasification process, which has been a ""technical challenge.""

For cities already struggling with landfill waste, this breakthrough could turn that problem into a climate solution.

This isn't the only recent advancement in sustainable aviation technology. Scientists at Chalmers University in Sweden presented hydrogen-powered aircraft designs that could reduce fuel consumption. Meanwhile, aviation company Eviation introduced Alice, the world's first all-electric commuter plane, last year.

Choosing low-impact travel options helps support this transition. While no single solution can fully replace dirty-energy-producing fuel just yet, innovations such as waste-based sustainable aviation fuel and electric aircraft are taking us in the right direction.

Conclusion The Section 45Z Clean Fuels Credit offers considerable opportunities for both fuel producers and credit market participants.","The Clean Fuels Credit, codified under 26 U.S. Code Section 45Z, has quickly become a central focus for businesses pursuing opportunities in the evolving energy sector. Designed to incentivize the production of cleaner transportation fuels, this credit not only benefits fuel producers but has also started attracting interest from companies seeking to purchase credits under the transferability provisions of 26 U.S. Code Section 6418. Initially introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Clean Fuels Credit stands out as one of the few tax incentives that received an extension through 2029 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). As the regulatory landscape continues to shift, it is essential for companies to understand both the strategic advantages and the legal requirements associated with this incentive.

This article examines the critical features of the Clean Fuels Credit, assesses its practical impact for businesses, and highlights key legal considerations necessary for maximizing its value.

Clean Fuels Credit Qualifications

Section 45Z Clean Fuels Credits apply to qualified fuel produced between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2029. The value of the credit is directly linked to the fuel’s greenhouse gas emissions as compared to conventional petroleum fuels, meaning the fewer the emissions, the larger the credit a producer can earn.

Emissions for the 45Z credit are determined using the U.S. Department of Energy’s 45ZCF-GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies) Model. This model calculates the total greenhouse gas emissions generated throughout the entire lifecycle of the fuel, beginning with the cultivation of feedstock and ending with the combustion of the fuel itself. It considers variables such as transportation methods, agricultural techniques, and processing practices. The result is a carbon intensity (CI) score for each gallon of fuel produced. The lower the CI score, the higher the tax credit available to the producer. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues an annual table that specifies the CI values for various types of fuels, most recently published in Notice 2025-11. Apart from the expansion of the credit period, another noteworthy update under the OBBBA is the exclusion of emissions resulting from indirect land use changes (ILUC)—such as converting additional land to grow feedstocks for biofuels—from the emissions calculation for crop-based fuels, which can lower reported emissions and thereby increase potential credits for biofuel producers.

To qualify for the credit, a fuel must produce less than 50 kilograms of carbon dioxide per unit of energy, about half the emissions of traditional petroleum-based fuels. Meeting this threshold earns a base credit of 20 cents per gallon. However, fuels that achieve greater emissions reductions can earn even more, providing a strong incentive for innovation and cleaner fuel production. The maximum credit for standard biofuels is $1 per gallon (based on the emissions factor), while sustainable aviation fuel qualifies for an enhanced rate of up to $1.75 per gallon, reflecting its strategic importance for decarbonizing the aviation sector.

Eligibility for the 45Z credit is further determined by sales requirements. The fuel must be produced at a qualified facility and sold to an unrelated third party, either for use in blended fuel mixtures or directly in trade or business activities. Alternatively, if the fuel is sold to an unrelated party who then resells it at retail, the producer may still claim the credit.

Finally, there are strict sourcing requirements: all eligible fuel must be produced from feedstocks grown or produced exclusively in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. This condition supports domestic and regional agriculture, ensures supply chain transparency, and aligns the credit with North American climate and economic goals.

Legal Considerations for Sellers and Purchasers of Clean Fuels Credits

Whether you are producing, selling, or purchasing Section 45Z credits, meticulous attention to legal details is essential. Below are key considerations and best practices for all participants in this growing marketplace:

Compliance with Emissions Standards: The value and eligibility of Section 45Z credits hinge on accurate lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions calculations, performed using the 45ZCF-GREET model. All parties should ensure fastidious recordkeeping, including data on feedstock sourcing, production methods, and emissions modeling and verification. Well-documented pathways not only substantiate the credit claim but also provide essential protection in the event of IRS audits or transfer disputes.

Ensuring a Qualifying Sale: Eligibility for Section 45Z credits depends on specific statutory requirements, including that the fuel be sold to an unrelated party for prescribed uses. Transactional parties should ensure that contracts and sales documentation clearly establish compliance with these requirements. Careful contract drafting—including representations, warranties, and indemnities—can help manage risk and facilitate smoother credit transfers.

Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship Compliance: For purchasers and sellers aiming to access the full value of Section 45Z credits, compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship mandates for construction, alteration, or repair work at qualifying facilities is crucial. Comprehensive protocols and documentation supporting adherence to these labor standards can mitigate the risk of credit disallowance and enhance the marketability of credits.

Land Use and Regulatory Changes: Recent updates exclude indirect land use change considerations from federal lifecycle emissions calculations for crop-based fuels. However, state incentives and regulations may continue to treat ILUC differently. Ongoing monitoring of both federal and state policy developments is essential to ensure ongoing compliance and to optimize credit eligibility across jurisdictions.

Insurance and Verification: The Section 45Z market is still evolving, with many transactions taking place in a novel regulatory context. Tax insurance has become a popular mechanism for mitigating the risks of IRS challenges, modeling errors, or regulatory reinterpretations. Parties should consider tailored insurance solutions and work with experienced counsel and insurance professionals to structure transactions that protect their interests.

Change in Laws: The IRS and Department of Energy (DOE) are expected to issue ongoing updates to carbon intensity tables, technical guidance, and compliance requirements. All market participants should maintain flexibility in transactional documents to accommodate future regulatory changes and should regularly consult with legal advisors to remain aligned with the latest developments.

Conclusion

The Section 45Z Clean Fuels Credit offers considerable opportunities for both fuel producers and credit market participants. However, the program’s complexity and the evolving regulatory landscape require careful planning and diligent compliance. By proactively addressing these legal and operational considerations, participants can maximize credit value, minimize risk, and position themselves at the forefront of the clean energy transition.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15872_4946.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 02:57:03.851002

This new green tax is set to have a significant impact on passengers flying out of the city-state, marking an important move towards making aviation more sustainable. The tax will be implemented gradually, with full enforcement expected by October 2026.

What Is the SAF Levy?

The SAF levy is essentially a green tax that aims to promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel. Airlines will be required to pass on the cost of the levy to passengers, with the charge appearing as a distinct line item on ticket prices. The exact levy will vary depending on the class of service and the destination of the flight.

How Will the SAF Levy Be Structured?

The SAF levy will be structured according to four geographical bands, which group destinations based on their distance from Singapore. These bands will determine the surcharge added to passengers’ tickets. Each band has a different levy rate, with the highest surcharges applying to long-haul flights.

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$1

Business/First Class: SGD$4

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$2.80

Business/First Class: SGD$11.20

Band 3: New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, and the Middle East

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$6.40

Business/First Class: SGD$25.60

Band 4: North and South America

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$10.40

Business/First Class: SGD$41.60

How the SAF Levy Will Be Used

The money raised from the SAF levy will be put into a fund designed to purchase sustainable aviation fuel. This fuel is considered a more eco-friendly alternative to conventional jet fuel, as it reduces carbon emissions during flights. By creating this fund, Singapore aims to make air travel more sustainable and contribute to its green goals for the aviation industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has stated that the levy was designed based on the projected volume of SAF needed to meet the country’s 1% SAF target for 2026. The tax will also account for the price premiumof SAF over regular jet fuel and other associated costs. With global aviation contributing significantly to carbon emissions, Singapore’s decision to implement this green tax is part of its broader effort to reduce its environmental footprint and support the development of sustainable technologies.

Exceptions to the SAF Levy

The SAF levy will only apply to departing passengers, meaning those who are transiting through Singapore will not be subject to the tax. For example, passengers flying through Changi Airport on their way to a final destination in another country will not see the SAF levy on their tickets, even if they are changing flights in Singapore.

An important exception to this rule includes through-flights such as those operated by Singapore Airlines, flying from Australia to Europe, or flights like Qantas’ Kangaroo Routes (QF1/QF2) and British Airways’ BA15/BA16 services. These flights, which pass through Singapore but originate in other countries, will also be exempt from the levy. This distinction ensures that the levy only affects flights that begin their journey in Singapore, keeping the tax targeted and specific to local travel.

The Wider Impact of the SAF Levy on Passengers and Airlines

The introduction of the SAF levy could influence travelers’ decisions, particularly those flying in premium cabins. The surcharge for business and first class tickets will be significantly higher, with Band 4 routes seeing a levy of SGD$41.60for premium cabins. This could raise the cost of long-haul flights from Singapore to destinations in North America and South America, making it a more expensive option for travelers in higher classes.

For economy and premium economy passengers, the levy is relatively more modest, ranging from SGD$1 for Southeast Asia to SGD$10.40 for flights to the Americas. However, these fees will still add to the overall cost of air travel, which could lead to some passengers adjusting their travel budgets or reconsidering their travel plans.

For airlines, the levy introduces a new set of operational and marketing challenges. While the tax will be passed on to passengers, airlines will need to clearly communicate these charges in their pricing structure. This will require updates to ticket booking systems and possibly adjustments to how airlines market their fares, especially for premium service classes where the levies are more pronounced.

Moreover, the SAF levy will impact the aviation sector’s profitability, as the extra surcharge could affect demand, particularly on long-haul flights. However, airlines that are able to successfully integrate sustainable practices into their operations may benefit from the growing demand for environmentally conscious travel options. This shift toward green aviation could become a point of differentiation for airlines that focus on sustainability in their fleets and operations.

The Future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Its Role in Global Aviation

As the SAF levy becomes effective, it will help pave the way for broader adoption of sustainable aviation fuels in the industry. Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel. This is particularly important as the aviation industry faces increasing pressure from governments and global climate organizations to cut down on its carbon emissions.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7888-8.jpeg,N,,2025-11-11 22:56:29.182037

“New York is one of the busiest private aviation markets in the world,” Gregg says.

Founded by Gregg Brunson-Pitts, the Washington, D.C.–based charter and logistics firm supports corporate, government, and high-profile clients across the U.S. and abroad.

Gregg’s aviation story began inside the White House under President George W. Bush, where he started as an intern in the scheduling office and, over time, rose to become Director of the White House Travel Office — overseeing the charter aircraft that fly alongside Air Force One, carrying the press corps, senior staff, and Secret Service. “You learn quickly that there’s no room for error,” he says—that experience—managing fast-moving operations and unpredictable personalities—shaped how he approaches aviation today.

He launched Advanced Aviation Team in 2015, channeling that White House precision into campaign and executive travel. “Since candidates are on the road for weeks at a time, we try to make the aircraft feel like a comfortable, familiar space,” Gregg says. “Everything —from the catering and lighting to how the cabin is arranged—is meant to make them feel at home between events.”

AAT has since become the go-to firm for campaign flying, managing more than 1,100 flights during the Biden–Harris 2020 campaign alone. The company has worked with both sides of the aisle — Steve Forbes, George W. Bush, John Kerry, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ron DeSantis, and others — always with the same goal: to keep the entire operation running smoothly behind the scenes.

Outside of politics, AAT plans and manages charters for corporate executives, family offices, and former national leaders. Its operations staff coordinate aircraft, crew, and ground handling from takeoff to touchdown, partnering with security teams to manage multi-stop itineraries, VIP movements, and global missions.

The company also maintains a strong presence in the New York metropolitan area, working daily through LaGuardia (LGA), JFK, and Newark (EWR). “New York is one of the busiest private aviation markets in the world,” Gregg says. “We’re constantly moving clients in and out — CEOs heading to Wall Street meetings, families flying to warm-weather getaways, entertainers traveling for high-profile events.”

Each airport offers different advantages, and AAT helps clients choose the right mix of proximity, privacy, and logistics. And as public flight-tracking tools have made privacy harder to maintain, more high-net-worth travelers are choosing charter over ownership. “Privacy has become a big part of the conversation,” Gregg notes. “With aircraft data now public, charter gives clients flexibility and discretion that ownership can’t.”

Looking ahead, Gregg sees the next decade of private aviation shaped by sustainability, smarter technology, and service consistency. “Whether it’s sustainable aviation fuel, better trip tracking, or more seamless ground coordination, it’s about blending innovation with a human touch,” he says. “Our job is to make travel effortless — so our clients can focus on what really matters.”",https://metroairportnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Advanced-Aviation-Team-Gulfstream-G550.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 22:56:33.621670
