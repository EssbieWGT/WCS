At first glance, used cooking oil is about as uninspiring a material as one can imagine. It is greasy, sticky, and malodorous. It comes in dented tins left out in the heat behind roadside stalls, in sloshing plastic drums beside hotel kitchens, or in small bottles kept under household sinks. For decades, it was treated as a nuisance, something to be discarded rather than valued. Some poured it down drains, causing blockages and pollution. Others sold it to informal operators who found low-value and unhealthy uses for it in animal feed or soap making. Almost no one, however, ever thought of it as a strategic commodity. And certainly not as something that could help decarbonize one of the hardest-to-abate industries in the world: aviation.

The story of how used cooking oil made its way from trash bins to jet engines is one of persistence, vision, and stubborn belief. It is also the story of how Malaysia, through the work of FatHopes Energy, stood at the center of building the world’s first truly scalable used cooking oil supply chain. To understand how this unlikely waste stream became the bedrock of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, one must go back to the late 2000s, a time when the very idea was treated as laughable.

In 2007, when I first began speaking about the potential of used cooking oil as a biofuel feedstock, the reaction was almost universally dismissive. Policymakers smiled politely but quickly moved on to more serious topics like palm oil or rapeseed. Energy executives shook their heads and asked why anyone would bother with such a messy, inconsistent waste stream when clean, uniform crop oils were plentiful. Even within the emerging biofuels community, which prided itself on innovation, used cooking oil was considered marginal at best. The refrain was familiar: it was too dirty, too variable in quality, impossible to collect at scale, and unlikely ever to pass certification. Those who were generous called it an interesting curiosity. Those less charitable called it a distraction.

But I saw something different. I grew up surrounded by kitchens, hawker stalls, restaurants, and food factories that produced oil waste every single day. I saw that this material, ignored by everyone else, was everywhere and in enormous quantities. What others considered a liability, I saw as an untapped resource. Every bowl of fried noodles, every piece of fried chicken, every snack prepared on the streets generated a residue that could be captured, cleaned, and transformed into energy. If only a system existed to do so at scale, then this so-called waste could become a feedstock as significant as any crop oil.

The problem was not availability, but aggregation. There was no infrastructure to collect used cooking oil consistently. The market was dominated by informal traders operating in cash, with no concern for traceability, sustainability, or quality. Certification bodies were skeptical. Policymakers ignored it. Yet the kitchens kept producing it, day in and day out. I became convinced that the barrier was not the feedstock itself, but the absence of a structured supply chain. And so began the journey of building that system from the ground up.

The early years were brutal. Convincing vendors to give up their oil was difficult. Many saw no reason to part with it. Some disposed of it cheaply, others feared the hassle of collection, and almost none trusted that there would be a consistent buyer. On the other side, trying to persuade refiners or policymakers to take the material seriously was an even greater uphill battle. They asked why anyone would want to fuel vehicles, let alone aircraft, with fryer grease. The more polite audiences smiled at the idea; the harsher ones laughed openly. I was told repeatedly that aviation would never run on waste oils, that no regulator would approve it, and that even if it were technically possible, the economics would never make sense.

But every day I looked around me and saw proof that the skeptics were wrong. Waste oil was everywhere. The only thing missing was a system to channel it. And so I began to lay the foundations for what would later become FatHopes Energy’s defining achievement: the first large-scale, transparent, and traceable used cooking oil supply chain in Southeast Asia.

We started small, visiting eateries one by one, explaining the concept, offering to pay for the oil that would otherwise be discarded. It was slow and painstaking. Many were unconvinced. Some thought we were crazy. But a few agreed, and with each new vendor, the supply chain began to take shape. We invested in small collection trucks, later mini-tankers, designed to navigate narrow streets and pick up oil in small but regular volumes. We established depots where oil could be aggregated, filtered, tested, and stored safely before being exported. Week by week, month by month, the system grew. What began as an idea ridiculed by many began to take the shape of a functioning supply chain.

At the same time, I knew that building physical infrastructure was not enough. Perception had to change. Certification bodies had to be convinced. Policymakers had to be engaged. And so we began to travel relentlessly, taking the case for used cooking oil to every forum that would listen. From small workshops to major global conferences, I presented again and again on why wastes and residues, particularly UCO, represented the true sustainable pathway for biofuels. I argued that unlike crop oils, they did not displace food. Unlike fossil fuels, they did not add new carbon to the atmosphere. And unlike unregulated informal markets, a structured and certified system could provide trust and transparency. At first, the response was skeptical. But repetition matters. Presence matters. And gradually, the narrative began to shift.

By 2011, the first cracks in the wall of resistance began to appear. ASTM International, which sets the standards for aviation fuels, approved hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids — HEFA-SPK — as a blending component for jet fuel. This was the breakthrough. For the first time, lipid-based pathways, including those derived from used cooking oil, were officially recognized as viable for aviation. Around the same time, airlines began conducting their first demonstration flights on bio-jet blends. Some of these included UCO-derived fuels. What had seemed laughable only a few years before was now becoming a technical reality. The skepticism did not disappear overnight, but the door was open.

Even so, scaling remained daunting. Most of the global industry continued to rely on virgin vegetable oils as feedstocks. UCO volumes were small, fragmented, and uncertain. Certification remained complicated. Policymakers were slow to adapt. But the momentum had begun. And for FatHopes Energy, the mission was clear: prove that UCO could be aggregated at scale, prove that it could be certified, and prove that it could become a dependable cornerstone of biofuels.

In those years, conferences became our second home. From Amsterdam to London, from Singapore to Washington, I found myself on stages where the message was simple but urgent: wastes and residues must come first. The industry could not continue to lean on virgin oils if it wanted to claim sustainability with integrity. Again and again, I told rooms filled with skeptical faces that the fryer oil in their kitchens was the future of jet fuel. Slowly, the laughter faded. Slowly, the questions became less dismissive and more curious. How much volume could actually be collected? What would the cost structure look like? Could it really be scaled beyond niche markets?

To answer these questions, we had to show proof. We began publishing weekly buying prices, creating transparency in a market that had previously thrived on opacity. We expanded our fleet, optimized collection routes, and invested in depots that could handle growing volumes. Vendors who once distrusted us began to see that this was not a fly-by-night scheme but a genuine business model. They began to call us rather than wait for us to show up. Trust was forming, one vendor at a time, one liter at a time.

For refiners and policymakers, the credibility came from certification. We worked closely with ISCC to ensure that every drop could be traced, verified, and audited. We brought auditors to the depots, showed them the trucks, introduced them to the vendors. We proved that this was not theoretical but real. And gradually, UCO began to appear on official lists of recognized feedstocks. The once unthinkable was becoming accepted.

By 2013 and 2014, volumes were rising. European biodiesel plants were beginning to integrate UCO more consistently. The term “waste-based biodiesel” began appearing in regulatory documents. Airlines began exploring longer-term contracts for waste-based SAF. It was still early days, but the tide was turning. What had once been dismissed was now being considered. And in every forum, FatHopes Energy was there — not just as a participant but as the face of UCO.

As the supply chain matured, the importance of credibility only grew. Buyers in Europe and later in North America wanted assurances that the oil they were purchasing was truly waste and not disguised virgin palm or soy. The risk of fraud loomed large, and regulators were tightening their oversight. We recognized early on that if used cooking oil was to become a cornerstone feedstock, it could not rest on verbal promises or paper trails. It required traceability. This realization led us down a path that would become one of FatHopes Energy’s defining contributions to the industry: the development of a digital traceability system years before the world demanded it.

By 2016, we were investing heavily in digital infrastructure that would give us real-time visibility across the collection network. It was a bold move. Technology at the time was still catching up, and most operators were content with spreadsheets, receipts, and manual checks. But I was convinced that data integrity would become the single most important differentiator in the feedstock business. If you could prove origin, if you could show chain-of-custody, if you could quantify carbon savings, then you could build trust not only with refiners but also with regulators and airlines. Without it, growth would always be capped by suspicion.

We created a suite of applications that tied together vendors, drivers, rangers, and consumers in one ecosystem. Vendors could schedule collections, track payments, and monitor their performance through a mobile app. Drivers had an app that optimized their routes, accounted for truck capacity, and logged every collection in real time. Rangers, individuals who offered their homes or shops as collection points, could open and close their “stations” at optimal times suggested by AI to maximize income. Even consumers could participate, finding their nearest ranger and dropping off household UCO. Behind it all sat a back-end dashboard powered by algorithms that predicted waste generation, optimized collection schedules, and provided carbon accounting.

This was more than technology. It was a philosophy: transparency by design. Every liter collected had a digital footprint. Every handoff was recorded. Every vendor and driver could be rated, creating a feedback loop of accountability. Certification bodies embraced it because it made their job easier. Buyers loved it because it de-risked their purchases. And vendors, many of whom were small businesses or households, trusted it because it gave them clarity and fairness.

The industry did not yet realize it, but we had leapt ahead of the curve. Only years later, when “blockchain traceability” and “AI-powered supply chains” became buzzwords, did people begin to understand that we had been operating that way for years. What others described as future aspirations was, for us, already daily practice. This foresight gave us an enormous credibility advantage, and it strengthened our position as the global face of UCO.

At conferences in Europe and Asia, I began to notice a shift. The questions were no longer about whether UCO could be collected but about how much could be scaled, what costs looked like, and how quickly it could be integrated into aviation supply chains. Airlines that once dismissed the concept were now actively pursuing offtake agreements. Regulators who once ignored it were now writing it into their renewable energy directives. The narrative had flipped, and used cooking oil was suddenly in high demand.

But demand brought new challenges. As volumes increased, so did competition. Traders who had once dismissed UCO began to enter the market, some playing fair, others less so. The risk of adulteration — mixing virgin palm with UCO — increased as prices rose. This was precisely why our investment in digital traceability mattered. While others struggled to prove authenticity, we could show data, audits, and history. This gave us resilience and kept buyers loyal.

It also meant that we had to expand rapidly. By the late 2010s, our collection network stretched across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and into other parts of Southeast Asia. Each country had its own dynamics, but the fundamentals were the same: waste oil was abundant, but it needed structure, trust, and certification. By building this across borders, we positioned Southeast Asia as a global hub for UCO exports, supplying refiners in Europe and North America with volumes they desperately needed to meet mandates.

The irony was striking. A feedstock once dismissed as too dirty and small-scale was now being shipped across oceans to power aircraft in some of the most advanced economies in the world. The same oil that once clogged drains in Kuala Lumpur or spoiled in drums behind hawker stalls was now certified, traceable, and refined into jet fuel for airlines in Frankfurt, San Francisco, and Singapore. What had changed was not the material itself but the systems around it — systems that we had built, often against the tide of skepticism.

As the world entered the 2020s, the urgency of aviation decarbonization became undeniable. The industry’s 2050 net-zero pledge, announced in 2021, made clear that sustainable aviation fuel would account for 65 percent of the sector’s required carbon reductions. The math was brutal: hundreds of millions of tonnes of SAF would be required annually by mid-century. No single feedstock could deliver that volume, but in the near term, only HEFA — the pathway based on oils and fats — could scale fast enough to meet demand. And within HEFA, used cooking oil stood out as the most sustainable, most socially acceptable, and most credible source.

This realization drove demand through the roof. Airlines scrambled to sign long-term contracts. Governments introduced mandates. Investors poured money into refinery projects. Yet behind the headlines, the reality remained the same: without credible, large-scale collection of wastes like UCO, the system could not deliver. Once again, the work we had done years earlier positioned us at the center of the solution.

By this time, FatHopes Energy was no longer just a collector. We had become an ecosystem: a logistics company, a technology company, a certification partner, and a trusted voice on global platforms. At events like the World Economic Forum, Argus Biofuels, and countless policy summits, I spoke not as someone trying to convince the world that UCO mattered but as someone showing proof that it already did. We had lived through the skepticism, we had built the systems, and now we were scaling them.

The role of UCO in SAF was now indisputable. Volumes were measured in millions of tonnes annually. UCO-based HEFA SAF was being used on commercial flights around the world. Policymakers explicitly prioritized wastes and residues in their regulations, making UCO not only desirable but essential. In Europe, RED II mandated double-counting for UCO, effectively giving it a higher value. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act created incentives that made waste-based SAF financially attractive. In Asia, countries like Singapore positioned themselves as refining hubs precisely because of their access to regional UCO flows.

Still, challenges persisted. Collection remained fragmented in many parts of the world. Fraud risks continued to haunt the industry. And the volumes, while impressive compared to a decade earlier, were still tiny compared to the total demand for jet fuel. UCO was never going to be the sole solution. But it was the best available bridge — the feedstock that could anchor SAF supply in the 2020s while other technologies matured. Without it, aviation’s net-zero targets would already be out of reach.

Looking back, the transformation is almost surreal. In 2007, I was told repeatedly that fryer grease would never fuel a plane. In 2025, the same material is considered indispensable to aviation’s future. The shift is not only technological but cultural. It reflects a broader rethinking of value: that what was once waste can be wealth, that sustainability is not about perfection but about pragmatism, and that sometimes the dirtiest feedstock can be the cleanest solution.

At conferences around the world, our presence became more than symbolic. It was a signal that used cooking oil had a voice, and that this voice came from Southeast Asia — a region that had long been overlooked in the global energy transition narrative. I stood on stages in Amsterdam, London, New York, and Beijing, often surrounded by representatives of the oil majors, government ministries, and large agricultural lobbies. Many of them still preferred to talk about rapeseed, soy, or palm. They had long histories, entrenched infrastructure, and powerful political backers. Yet our story was different. We were not offering a theory or an ambition. We were showing reality: real volumes, real trucks, real vendors, and real data.

It was not uncommon to be the lone voice advocating UCO in those early sessions. I remember vividly the looks I received when I would say that street hawkers in Kuala Lumpur were, in their own way, fuelling the future of aviation. Some chuckled, some shook their heads, but increasingly, some leaned forward and asked, “Tell us more.” Slowly, the skepticism began to transform into curiosity, and curiosity into belief. By being present, by telling our story over and over, we became the face of UCO.

Representation mattered because the world needed proof. On the ground in Malaysia, we were proving it by collecting thousands of liters every day. On the global stage, we were proving it by shifting narratives and persuading policymakers to enshrine UCO into law. At industry roundtables, when the debate turned to the sustainability of crop oils, I would remind them that waste streams like UCO had no food-versus-fuel controversy. When critics questioned scalability, I would point to our expanding network across Malaysia, Indonesia, and beyond. When certification bodies hesitated, I would walk them through our data, our audits, and our digital records. Piece by piece, we dismantled the objections that once seemed insurmountable.

But credibility in sustainability is fragile, and the higher the stakes, the higher the scrutiny. By the mid-2010s, as UCO volumes and prices increased, so too did the risks of fraud and manipulation. Stories began to surface of virgin oils being passed off as waste, of documents being forged, of middlemen cutting corners. These incidents threatened not only the reputations of individual companies but the credibility of UCO as a feedstock category. For us, this was a defining moment. If the integrity of the supply chain was compromised, all the work of the past decade could unravel.

This is why in 2016 we made the strategic leap into digital traceability. At the time, most of the industry was content with paperwork — receipts, delivery notes, audit visits once or twice a year. But we understood that the future would demand real-time verification. It would demand proof that could not be faked. And it would demand data that could withstand scrutiny from regulators, investors, and airlines alike.

We began building what would later be recognized as one of the most advanced digital ecosystems in the waste-to-biofuels industry. It was not just software; it was a philosophy of radical transparency. The vendor app gave small eateries and factories the ability to schedule pickups, track payments, and monitor their environmental impact. The driver app provided optimized routes, real-time volume logging, and performance tracking. Rangers, the community collectors who played such a crucial role in expanding access, were empowered with tools to decide when to open their collection points and how to maximize their returns. Even households, often overlooked in waste systems, were included through consumer-facing interfaces that allowed them to find the nearest drop-off points.

On the back end, we layered artificial intelligence to make the system smarter over time. It predicted which vendors would have oil ready and when, optimizing truck utilization and reducing wasted trips. It forecasted volumes across regions, enabling us to plan depot capacity and export flows more efficiently. And it calculated carbon savings with granularity, providing every stakeholder with a tangible measure of their contribution to decarbonization.

This digital ecosystem did more than make operations efficient. It made the supply chain trustworthy. Every collection created a digital footprint, geotagged and timestamped. Every liter could be traced back to its source. Every transaction was logged, and every stakeholder could be rated. This level of accountability transformed vendor relationships. For the first time, small restaurants and households could see their role in the global sustainability movement. They were no longer just disposing of waste; they were participants in the decarbonization of aviation.

For certification bodies, the platform was a gift. Auditors no longer had to rely on static paperwork. They could see live data, cross-check records, and verify claims with confidence. For refiners and airlines, it was a guarantee that the fuel they were buying was genuinely waste-based, not tainted by fraud. For regulators, it was proof that policy incentives were being directed at the right feedstocks. And for us, it was a shield — a way to defend the integrity of UCO even as the market grew more complex and competitive.

Looking back, this move was visionary. Today, in 2025, digital traceability has become an industry-wide buzzword. Everyone talks about blockchain, AI, and real-time verification. But we were practicing it nearly a decade earlier. That head start not only protected our credibility but positioned us as the standard-bearer for integrity in the UCO supply chain. When others speak of aspirations, we speak of experience. And that difference matters.

By the early 2020s, UCO had fully arrived on the global stage. Airlines that once ignored it were now signing long-term offtake agreements with refiners reliant on UCO. Policymakers in Europe, the UK, and the US had enshrined it in mandates and incentives. Analysts projected millions of tonnes of demand annually. The EU’s RED II directive gave UCO double-counting benefits, reflecting its sustainability advantages. The US Inflation Reduction Act created tax credits that made waste-based SAF commercially attractive. Singapore, leveraging its refining infrastructure, positioned itself as an Asian hub for SAF, reliant heavily on UCO imports. Everywhere one looked, UCO had gone from curiosity to cornerstone.

The carbon math was compelling. Lifecycle analyses showed that UCO-based HEFA SAF could deliver greenhouse gas savings of up to 80 percent compared to fossil jet fuel. Few other pathways could match that performance. Unlike crop oils, UCO carried no risk of indirect land-use change, one of the most contentious issues in biofuels. Unlike more experimental pathways, it was already proven at commercial scale. It was not just a good option; it was, in many ways, the best option available in the critical decade of the 2020s.

This did not mean the challenges disappeared. Fraud risks remained, particularly in regions without robust traceability. Collection was still fragmented in many countries, with vast volumes slipping through the cracks. Logistics costs were significant, and competition for feedstock was intense. And even at scale, UCO could only ever supply a fraction of global jet demand. But it was a vital fraction. It was the bridge that aviation desperately needed while other technologies matured. Without UCO, the industry’s 2030 targets would already be out of reach.

For us at FatHopes Energy, this was both validation and responsibility. We had spent more than a decade being told it was impossible, only to prove that it was not only possible but indispensable. We had fought battles for recognition, only to see policymakers now writing our arguments into law. We had built systems from scratch, only to see others scrambling to replicate them. And yet, the journey was far from over. Because while UCO had secured its place, the scale of the challenge ahead was immense. Aviation’s decarbonization would require not just millions but hundreds of millions of tonnes of SAF. UCO alone could not deliver that. But it could provide the foundation upon which the rest would be built.

When airlines began to move from trial flights to long-term commitments, the role of UCO shifted from symbolic to strategic. In the early 2010s, demonstration flights had been powerful but limited. Airlines such as KLM, Lufthansa, and United operated routes with small blends of bio-jet to show technical feasibility. These flights made headlines, but they were not yet commercially significant. By the late 2010s and early 2020s, however, the conversation changed. SAF was no longer a novelty — it was being integrated into decarbonization strategies, and UCO was at the center of these plans.

Consider the case of KLM. As one of the early movers in sustainable aviation, the Dutch carrier committed to incorporating SAF into its regular operations. In 2011, it operated its first commercial flight using a UCO-based blend. At the time, it was a milestone celebrated worldwide, but skeptics dismissed it as a stunt. Yet a decade later, KLM was investing in long-term SAF offtake agreements, much of which relied on HEFA fuels made from UCO. What had been symbolic had become structural.

In the United States, United Airlines took a similar path. It became the first airline to operate a commercial flight using a 100 percent SAF engine on one side, with fossil jet on the other for comparison. The SAF used was HEFA-based, produced in part from UCO. United then went on to sign multibillion-dollar offtake agreements with producers like World Energy and Neste. Each of these contracts hinged on the availability of reliable waste-based feedstocks — with UCO chief among them.

Singapore Airlines, positioned in a region where UCO availability was rich, became another case study. With its government committing to SAF as part of the nation’s green aviation strategy, Singapore Airlines secured SAF supplies from Neste’s Singapore refinery, one of the largest SAF production sites in the world. That refinery, which began operations in 2010 and later expanded specifically for SAF, relies heavily on imported UCO and residues from across Asia — including Malaysia. Here, geography mattered: Malaysia’s proximity and its established UCO collection systems made it a natural partner.

On the refining side, Neste’s story illustrates UCO’s centrality. Starting as a company focused on renewable diesel, Neste expanded into aviation by leveraging its expertise in HEFA pathways. By the 2020s, it had become the world’s largest producer of SAF, with UCO as a cornerstone feedstock. Its Singapore facility was strategically chosen not only for port access but for proximity to Southeast Asia’s vast waste oil flows. In California, World Energy’s Paramount facility followed a similar trajectory, converting refineries once used for fossil fuels into hubs for UCO-based SAF. These facilities demonstrated that scaling SAF was not a dream but a reality — provided feedstock supply chains were credible and reliable.

All of this underscored the irony of UCO’s journey. A material once dismissed as unsuitable, unscalable, and even laughable was now underwriting contracts worth billions of dollars, influencing government policy, and fueling the planes of some of the world’s largest carriers. For those of us who had fought the early battles, it was vindication — but also a reminder of the responsibility we carried.

Scaling UCO for SAF was never going to be without its challenges. Even at peak efficiency, the global pool of used cooking oil is limited by human behavior. The amount of UCO available is a function of how much food is fried, processed, and cooked in oil. Analysts estimate that globally, UCO availability could reach perhaps 30 million tonnes per year. That is a significant number, but it is small compared to total aviation demand, which exceeds 300 million tonnes of jet fuel annually. This means that while UCO can anchor SAF supply in the 2020s, it cannot be the sole solution for 2050. Other pathways — alcohol-to-jet, Fischer–Tropsch, and eventually power-to-liquids — must mature and scale.

Yet this limitation does not diminish UCO’s importance. Quite the opposite. Because the 2020s are the critical decade for SAF adoption, UCO is the feedstock that buys the world time. It provides the credibility, the carbon savings, and the volumes necessary to bridge aviation into the future. Without UCO, the 2030 blending mandates in Europe and the United States would be unattainable. Without UCO, airline decarbonization strategies would be hollow. Without UCO, SAF would remain a promise rather than a practice.

For Malaysia, this presented a profound opportunity. Unlike many countries, Malaysia was blessed with abundant access to UCO and other residues. Its dense urban centers — Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Johor Bahru — generated massive quantities of waste oil daily. Its food and beverage industry, one of the largest in Southeast Asia, contributed consistently to the supply. Its geographic location on the Straits of Malacca made it an ideal hub for aggregation and export. And critically, its industrial workforce, trained in the oleochemical and palm industries, already possessed the skills needed to handle lipid feedstocks at scale.

This combination of resources, infrastructure, and talent meant that Malaysia could be more than just a supplier of raw UCO. It could become a refining hub — turning waste oil into finished SAF for domestic airlines and for export across the region and beyond. The development of a SAF refinery in Port Klang exemplified this vision. Situated at one of the busiest transshipment hubs in the world, such a facility could leverage not only Malaysia’s domestic feedstock but also UCO flows from neighboring countries. It could serve as the anchor for a regional SAF ecosystem, positioning Malaysia as the leader of Southeast Asia’s contribution to aviation decarbonization.

Of course, leadership required more than infrastructure. It required credibility. This was where FatHopes Energy’s early investments in traceability paid dividends. By proving that UCO could be collected, certified, and digitally tracked at scale, we gave Malaysia an edge over competitors. When global refiners or airlines considered sourcing feedstock, they looked not only at volume but at integrity. They wanted assurance that the oil was real, that it was sustainable, and that it would withstand regulatory audits. By offering that assurance, Malaysia could distinguish itself in a crowded and competitive market.

The case for Malaysia’s leadership became even stronger with its upcoming chairmanship of ASEAN in 2025. As the region’s chair, Malaysia would have the platform to drive policy harmonization on SAF, encouraging neighboring countries to align on certification, traceability, and trade rules. This could unlock regional feedstock flows, reduce duplication, and build confidence among international buyers. Rather than competing in silos, ASEAN nations could present a unified front, with Malaysia at the helm. The potential impact was enormous. A coordinated ASEAN SAF strategy, anchored in Malaysia’s Port Klang refinery, could transform the region into a global hub, rivaling Europe and the United States.

For all of this to succeed, however, action was required. Policies needed to incentivize collection and refining. Investments needed to be mobilized for infrastructure. Airlines needed to sign binding offtake agreements that gave financiers confidence. And the public needed to be engaged, understanding that even the oil left over from household cooking could play a role in fueling planes sustainably. FatHopes Energy had already built much of the foundation — the collection networks, the traceability systems, the credibility. But scaling to the level aviation demanded required collective effort.

When I reflect on the journey from 2007 to 2025, I am struck by how much has changed and yet how much remains the same. The skepticism has faded, replaced by enthusiasm. The infrastructure has matured, with global refineries now running on UCO. The policy environment has shifted, with mandates and incentives in place. And yet, the work is still about convincing, building, and scaling. We no longer need to prove that UCO works. We now need to prove that it can meet the world’s urgent demand.

The future of used cooking oil in the SAF supply chain will not be without tension. On one hand, UCO has achieved what few could have imagined even a decade ago: it has become the cornerstone of aviation’s decarbonization strategy in the 2020s. On the other hand, its inherent limitations remind us that it cannot carry the weight of the industry alone. The global availability of UCO, even under the most optimistic scenarios, is capped. By 2030, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects SAF production to rise to around 30 million tonnes annually. UCO, at best, could account for one-third of that. By 2050, when aviation requires hundreds of millions of tonnes, UCO’s contribution will be proportionally smaller.

But the measure of UCO’s importance is not its ultimate volume share. It is the role it plays as a foundation. Without UCO, the SAF industry would lack the bridge feedstock it needs in this critical decade. Other pathways — alcohol-to-jet, Fischer–Tropsch from municipal waste, and eventually power-to-liquids from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon — will take years, even decades, to mature at scale. UCO is here now. It is available, it is certified, it is proven. That makes it indispensable.

The 2030s will likely be the decade when alternative pathways begin to come online in earnest. Already, pilot projects for e-fuels are producing small volumes, and FT plants using agricultural residues are being tested. But scaling them to tens of millions of tonnes will take enormous investment and political will. In the meantime, UCO will remain the backbone of SAF supply. Its role may evolve — perhaps supplying 20–25 percent of global SAF in 2030, and 10–15 percent by 2040 — but it will always be the feedstock that made the transition possible.

This reality is both comforting and challenging. Comforting, because it validates the work of those who spent decades building the UCO supply chain. Challenging, because it underscores the responsibility we bear to maximize its impact today. Every liter collected matters. Every vendor onboarded matters. Every household that participates matters. The success of aviation’s decarbonization in the 2020s hinges on whether UCO systems are robust, credible, and scalable. That is why FatHopes Energy continues to push relentlessly for expansion, innovation, and collaboration.

Malaysia’s role in this future is clear. With its combination of feedstock availability, geographic advantage, and industrial expertise, it is positioned to be more than just a participant. It can be the leader. The development of a SAF refinery in Port Klang is not just a business venture; it is a national project, one that symbolizes Malaysia’s ambition to stand at the forefront of the energy transition. Positioned at one of the busiest maritime crossroads in the world, the refinery will have access not only to domestic UCO but to flows from across Southeast Asia. With digital traceability ensuring integrity, and with global airlines hungry for supply, Port Klang can become the beating heart of SAF in Asia.

ASEAN leadership further amplifies this opportunity. In 2025, as chair of ASEAN, Malaysia has the chance to drive regional harmonization of SAF policies. Imagine a Southeast Asia where feedstock definitions are aligned, certification systems are interoperable, and trade barriers are minimized. Imagine a bloc that presents itself to the world not as fragmented markets but as a unified hub for waste-based SAF. The impact would be transformative. It would give global airlines confidence. It would attract investment. And it would ensure that Southeast Asia’s vast potential for waste-based feedstocks is fully realized.

For Malaysia, the strategic calculus is also compelling. While the nation has invested heavily in data centers, palm oil, and other industries, SAF provides a hedge — a sector with global demand, geopolitical relevance, and long-term growth. Unlike physical infrastructure projects that may lose competitiveness, SAF is tied directly to the world’s decarbonization agenda. Aviation will not stop flying; it will only seek cleaner fuels. By embedding itself in that future, Malaysia ensures resilience, relevance, and prosperity.

None of this is theoretical. The work has already begun. FatHopes Energy’s traceability systems are operational. Vendors across the region are already participating. Depots are in place, mini-tankers are running, exports are flowing. Certification bodies recognize the integrity of the system. Airlines are signing contracts. Refiners are expanding capacity. The foundation is solid. What is required now is acceleration — more investment, more policy support, more stakeholder engagement.

When I reflect on 2007, the contrast is striking. Back then, I stood in rooms where people laughed at the idea that fryer grease could fuel planes. Today, the same people — or their successors — speak of UCO as indispensable. The laughter is gone, replaced by urgency. The dismissal has turned into demand. What changed was not the feedstock itself but the belief around it. Belief that it could be collected, that it could be certified, that it could be trusted. That belief was not given; it was built. It was built through years of persistence, through data, through presence, and through proving it again and again.

The story of UCO is not just about waste oil. It is about reimagining value. It is about taking something discarded and making it essential. It is about challenging entrenched assumptions and proving that alternatives are possible. It is about the stubborn conviction that sustainability is not only necessary but achievable — if we are willing to do the work.

Looking forward, I see UCO continuing to play this role — not as the sole solution, but as the anchor. It will remain the feedstock that underwrites credibility, that sustains momentum, that bridges us into a future of diverse SAF pathways. Malaysia will remain central to this story, not only as a supplier but as a leader. And FatHopes Energy will remain committed to the mission we began nearly two decades ago: to prove that waste is not waste, that transparency is power, and that persistence can turn the unthinkable into the indispensable.

As aviation races toward 2050, the stakes could not be higher. Climate change is no longer a distant threat; it is a lived reality. Aviation’s social license to operate depends on decarbonization. Passengers, policymakers, and investors are watching closely. In this context, SAF is not a choice but a necessity. And within SAF, used cooking oil is not an afterthought but a foundation.

To all stakeholders — governments, airlines, refiners, vendors, and consumers — the call is clear: act now. Collect every liter. Certify every drop. Invest in every depot, every refinery, every piece of digital infrastructure. Do not wait for the perfect solution. Do not wait for tomorrow’s technologies to mature. Use what we have today, and scale it. Because every liter of UCO-based SAF used this decade is a liter of fossil fuel avoided, a ton of CO₂ not emitted, a step closer to the net-zero future we owe our children.

The journey from 2007 to 2025 is proof that change is possible. The journey from 2025 to 2050 will determine whether it is enough. Let us ensure that when history is written, used cooking oil is remembered not just as a feedstock but as the unlikely hero that made sustainable aviation fuel possible.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEBMU2_HzH9Vw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B56ZmY_8B9JoAI-/0/1759208525471?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=4pFoW2ZyT6VZh6Sx5Duc9qu9yWl83EGcTpEC4t3PhN8,N,,2025-10-03 10:56:11.810237

Abstract

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a drop-in alternative to conventional jet fuels, designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while requiring minimal infrastructure changes and certification under the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D7566 standard. This study assesses recently identified high-energy-density (HED) strained polycycloalkanes as SAF candidates. Strain energy (Ese) was calculated using density functional theory (DFT), while operational properties such as boiling point (BP) and flash point (FP) were predicted using support vector regression (SVR) models. The models demonstrated strong predictive performance (R2 > 0.96) with mean absolute errors of 6.92 K for BP and 9.58 K for FP, with robustness sensitivity analysis. It is found that approximately 65% of these studied polycycloalkanes fall within the Jet A fuel property boundaries. The polycycloalkanes (C9–C15) with strain energies below approximately 60 kcal/mol achieve an balance between energy density and ignition safety, aligning with the specifications of Jet A. The majority of structures were dominated by five-membered rings, with a few three- or four-membered rings enhancing favorable trade-offs among BP, FP, and HED. This early pre-screening indicates that moderately strained polycycloalkanes are safe, energy-dense candidates for next-generation sustainable jet fuels and provide a framework for designing high-performance SAFs.

1. Introduction

The rapid growth of the aviation industry is expected to drive a significant increase in global aviation fuel demand, which is projected to more than double by 2050 [1], intensifying both demand and environmental concerns. As a result, it is crucial to develop SAF to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint and to mitigate the impact of GHG emissions. These developments are becoming particularly essential as the aviation industry seeks all viable pathways, including electrification techniques and hydrogen propulsion, as other alternatives to achieve sustainability [2,3,4]. Among the available options, SAF offers a more practical solution, providing an intermediate reduction in carbon emissions of up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel [5].

SAF must meet the stringent safety and performance standards set by the ASTM D7566 [3,6]. Currently, seven ASTM-approved pathways for the production of SAF [7] include Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK) and FT-SPK with aromatics (FT-SPK/A), bio-based routes such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) and catalytic hydrothermolysis jet fuel (HC-HEFA-SPK), hydroprocessed fermented sugars to synthetic iso-paraffins (HFS-SIP), alcohol-to-jet synthetic paraffinic kerosene (ATJ-SPK), and fuels derived from the hydrothermal conversion of fatty acids (CHJ) [3,8]. Each of these pathways represents the leading technologies for SAF production, each with distinct feedstocks and processing methods, while all adhering to the rigorous performance and safety standards required for aviation use [2,3,4,9,10]. Blending SAFs with conventional jet fuels—up to 50% by volume—can preserve critical properties such as HED and favorable O-ring swelling, both of which are essential for optimal engine performance [3,9,10,11]. However, incomplete combustion of these blends can result in substantial soot and particulate emissions, highlighting a trade-off between achieving performance standards and minimizing environmental impact [2,9].

To address these challenges, strained polycycloalkanes have emerged as promising HED SAF candidates [2,3,12]. Their unique molecular structures and synthetic accessibility contribute to enhanced energy performance, with the potential to increase both volumetric specific energy and energy density [2]. These properties are critical in aviation due to the limited fuel capacity of Jets, where a higher energy content directly translates to greater payload capacity and extended flight range [2,4]. In particular, alkanes (paraffins) are saturated hydrocarbons consisting of carbon–carbon (C–C) and carbon-hydrogen (C–H) single bonds, which confer greater chemical bond energy compared to unsaturated hydrocarbons. Alkanes burn more cleanly than alkenes, producing less soot and particulate emissions [13]. This results in lower engine deposits and reduced maintenance requirements for aviation engines, enhancing overall efficiency and performance [14].

The inherent stability of alkanes supports energy storage and combustion safety. In addition to increasing energy density [2,3,11,12,15,16,17,18], structural strain within polycyclic alkanes can also alter fuel properties that are critical for efficiency and operational safety. For example, JP-10—exo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene (C10H16), an HED synthetic strained polycycloalkane fuel primarily used in military applications—exhibits superior combustion characteristics and operational performance compared to conventional Jet A aviation fuel in commercial use [2,3,18]. Optimizing strained hydrocarbons for aviation applications requires a careful design to balance energy output with operational safety. However, despite their potential to be HED fuels, the safety profiles of these polycycloalkane candidates remain underexplored. To ensure their viability as SAF, these compounds must also satisfy ASTM D7566/D4054 certification standards [6,19], which set rigorous thresholds for key physicochemical and operational properties, including specific energy (SE ≥ 42.80 MJ/kg), density (0.76–0.84 g/mL at 288.15 K), freezing point (FrP ≤ 226.15), (FP ≥ 311.15 K), and (BP ~ 433.15–573.15 K) [12]. In practice, consistently meeting the stringent FrP, FP, and density requirements, along with compatibility tests such as O-ring swell, remains particularly challenging for many candidates.

In one of our previous studies, we identified several HED-strained hydrocarbons as promising candidates for aviation fuel applications [2]. In this work, we employed DFT calculations [20] to analyze the molecular structures and Ese of a selected group of polycycloalkane SAF candidates. We then employed machine learning (ML) techniques [21,22] and the group contribution (GC) method [23,24] to predict key fuel properties. Subsequently, we evaluated quantitative structure–property relationships (QSPR), specifically the BP and FP. This computational evaluation supports early-stage pre-screening of SAF candidates and assesses their safety for aviation applications, in accordance with ASTM D7566 [6] and D4045 standards [19]. This comprehensive assessment aims to accelerate SAF development through the optimization of synthetic pathways.

2. Computational and Predictive Methods

2.1. Target Polycycloalkanes and Strain Energy Calculation

Twenty selected strained HED polycycloalkanes, identified as potential SAF candidates through ML [2], are evaluated further for aviation fuel properties. These candidates are listed as entries 1–20 in Table S2 of the Supplementary Materials (SM), with their corresponding structures shown in Figure 1.

Ese in hydrocarbons refers to the extra energy stored in a molecule due to distortions in its bond angles, bond lengths, or torsional angles from their ideal, low-energy conformations. The total Ese of a compound is typically the result of several contributing factors [25], including bond strain, angle strain (also called Baeyer strain), torsional strain, and steric strain (or van der Waals/Prelog strain). Bond strain occurs when chemical bonds are stretched or compressed beyond their optimal lengths. This type of strain is energetically costly and uncommon in stable organic molecules. Molecules generally adopt conformations that minimize bond strain, as the high energy cost associated with it is unfavorable. Angle strain (also called Baeyer strain) is caused by deviations from ideal bond angles (e.g., 109.5° in sp3-hybridized carbon) [26]. While angle strain contributes to the overall energy of a molecule, it is generally less severe than torsional or steric strain. Torsional strain, also known as eclipsing or Pitzer strain, results from eclipsed interactions between adjacent bonds, where atoms or groups are aligned in a way that leads to increased electron repulsion. Torsional strain often contributes significantly to the overall strain energy of a molecule. Steric strain (or van der Waals/Prelog strain) occurs when atoms are forced close together, leading to repulsion between electron clouds [26]. A specific type of steric strain, known as transannular strain, is common in medium-sized rings, where non-bonded atoms across the ring interact unfavorably.

Cyclic hydrocarbons adopt conformations that minimize the total Ese by balancing various types of strain [25]. Since bond strain is particularly destabilizing, molecules typically avoid it by tolerating more manageable forms of strain, namely torsional, steric, and angle strain. Cyclic compounds are classified as small rings with (three- or four-membered), common rings with (five- to seven-membered), medium rings with (eight- to eleven-membered), and large rings with (twelve- or more-membered). Rings of similar sizes tend to have comparable characteristics. Most of the cyclic hydrocarbon fuel candidates exhibit small rings (three- or four-membered), and common rings (five- to seven-membered), which are often grouped into classical rings [25]. Small rings exhibit rigidity and significant strain due to substantial deviations from ideal tetrahedral bond angles, resulting in pronounced angle strain, as well as considerable torsional strain from eclipsed interactions. In contrast, common rings maintain bond angles close to the tetrahedral ideal, with their substituents oriented exclusively outward from the ring structure [25].

Ring strain energy (RSE) refers to the increase in energy or destabilization that occurs when an open-chain (acyclic) molecule forms a ring structure [27]. The Ese of polycycloalkanes can be estimated using two different methods. That is, the ring superposition (RS) method [28,29] and the isodesmic reaction (IR) approach [30]. In the RS method, the Ese of a polycycloalkane is calculated as the sum of the strain energies (Ering(i)) of the individual rings [28,29].

Ese = ∑ni Ering(i)

(1)

where ni indicates the number of various members of the ring of type i, and Ering(i) represents the Ese of the ith ring. The Ese of an individual ring (Ering(i)) is given in Table S1 in the SM. For example, Compound 19 (camphane) appears with two five-membered rings as detailed in Table S2 in the SM. Therefore, the Ese of compound 19 (camphane) is given by

Ese (camphane) = 2 × (6.19) = 12.38 kcal/mol

The IR method [30] to estimate the Ese of a polycycloalkane is determined as

Ese = ΔHf(Cn+mH2(n+2m+1)) − ΔHf(CnH2(n−m + 1)) − m ΔHf(ethane)

(2)

where ΔHf denotes the standard enthalpies of the compounds involved in the isodesmic reaction. Here, n corresponds to the number of carbon atoms in the polycycloalkane, while m represents the number of ethane units introduced to balance the isodesmic reaction. This IR method compares the target molecule (polycycloalkane) to a set of reference compounds with similar bonding environments [27]. For example,

camphane + 2 ethane → tetradecane

(3)

So that Ese (camphane) = ΔHf(tetradecane) − (ΔHf(camphane) + 2 ΔHf(ethane)) = 12.72 kcal/mol.

Details regarding the IR method used are given in Tables S3 and S4 of the SM. For large-strain polycyclic molecules, direct high-accuracy quantum chemical calculations become computationally prohibitive due to the steep scaling with system size [31]. To overcome this limitation, isodesmic reactions exploit systematic error cancelation by comparing molecules to reference compounds with similar bond types, providing a practical and reliable means to compute strain energies. Although the IR method is often described as “bond-conserving,” polycyclic strain energy calculations may involve equations that are formally unbalanced in hydrogen count. This approach assumes that only the differences between similar bonding environments—rather than the absolute energies—are relevant, allowing errors to cancel out between comparable fragments. By carefully matching carbon environments (sp3, strained, bridgehead, etc.), most basis set and correlation errors are minimized, making the IR method a rapid and practical estimation tool.

The enthalpies in Equation (2), used to calculate Ese, were computed using DFT; therefore, the overall approach is referred to as the DFT-based IR method (DFT-IR). These calculations were performed at the B3PW91/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, following the geometry optimization. The B3PW91 DFT functional was selected based on its demonstrated reliability and consistency in predicting thermochemical properties across diverse hydrocarbon systems. A recent benchmark study by Dutra and Custodio [32], which evaluated 24 DFT functionals, identified B3PW91 as one of the most robust performers under varied computational conditions. Additionally, the literature reports show that B3PW91 yields enthalpy predictions with a mean absolute error of approximately 2 kcal/mol [33], making it suitable for evaluating strain energies in hydrocarbon fuels. The aug-cc-pVTZ basis set complements this choice by offering triple-zeta quality with diffuse functions, which is essential for accurately describing strained and delocalized electronic environments. As a result, B3PW91/aug-cc-pVTZ offers a well-balanced approach that strikes a balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly for systems involving ring strain and non-classical bonding. The absence of imaginary frequencies in the optimized structures indicates that these structures correspond to true energy minima, indicating they are stable [15,16,18]. All DFT calculations are performed using the Gaussian 16 program [34].

2.2. Machine Learning for Fuel Property Prediction

ML models were developed to evaluate two key thermophysical properties essential for the fuel candidates: BP and FP. The BP is defined as the temperature at which a pure liquid transitions to the gas phase under 1 atm pressure, while FP is the lowest temperature at which a liquid emits sufficient vapor to ignite in the presence of a flame or spark [35]. Although BP and FP are experimentally measurable, predictive modeling offers significant value by enabling rapid screening of strained polycyclic molecules, where evaluation of the ASTM standard can be costly and time-consuming. Establishing these structure–property relationships, therefore, supports early-stage SAF design by prioritizing candidates with favorable volatility and safety profiles. Rücker and Rücker [36] refined structure–BP correlations for saturated hydrocarbons using high-quality data and topological indices, noting errors in earlier cycloalkane values. However, their study did not examine strained polycycloalkanes, which will be addressed in the present work. The property dataset consisted of 85 cycloalkanes for BP and 80 cycloalkanes for FP, where the latter included a combination of experimental and computational values. Data were collected exclusively for cycloalkane structures from peer-reviewed literature [11,37] and authoritative chemical databases, including the CRC Handbook [38], the NIST Chemistry WebBook [39], and the Chemical Properties Handbook [40].

Molecular descriptors were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) representations of the compounds using RDKit [41] and Mordred [42], resulting in more than 900 initial descriptors. A systematic preprocessing workflow was applied to ensure descriptor quality and reduce redundancy following the same steps as in recent work in fuel [43]. First, non-numeric and constant (low-variance) descriptors were removed. Next, descriptors exhibiting strong pairwise correlations (Pearson’s |r| > 0.90) were excluded to avoid multicollinearity. Moreover, feature relevance was assessed using Spearman correlation [44] and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) [43]. The final 10 most informative descriptors for each property (Table S6, SM) were identified and standardized using Z-score normalization [45].

Model development was carried out using SVR, which had been previously benchmarked in our earlier work [2] and consistently outperformed alternatives such as Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for related fuel property predictions. The preference for SVR is also supported by recent reviews that identify it as one of the most widely applied algorithms in QSPR modeling of fuel ignition properties [46]. Its ability to model both linear and nonlinear relationships, while maintaining good generalization on small datasets, makes it particularly suitable for this application. Datasets were partitioned into 80:10:10 splits for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Hyperparameters (regularization constant C, epsilon tolerance ε, and kernel type) were optimized through GridSearchCV [47]. The linear kernel consistently emerged as the most effective choice for both BP and FP prediction, as detailed in optimized parameters (Table S7, SM). Final models were retrained on the combined training and validation sets using the optimal hyperparameters, and predictive performance was assessed on the independent test sets.

Model validation was performed using three repeated 5-fold cross-validations in training data [48], while model sensitivity was assessed through bootstrap analysis [49]. To determine the applicability of the model to a new molecule, the classical Joback and Reid GC models [23,24] were also implemented and evaluated for the candidate molecules (Table S10, SM). All modeling and visualization were performed in Python 3 (Jupyter) [22,50], utilizing a standard data science stack: Pandas (1.5.3) and NumPy (1.24.4) for data handling, scikit-learn (1.3.2) for feature selection, model training, and validation, SciPy (1.10.1) for statistical analysis, and Matplotlib (3.7.1) and Seaborn (0.12.2) [50] for visualization.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Strain Energy in the Polycycloalkanes

Ese plays a crucial role in determining the stability and energy output of polycycloalkanes, which are an important structural characteristic in many HED fuels. The Ese of these target polycycloalkanes is estimated using the RS and the DFT-based IR method (DFT-IR), as expressed in Equations (1) and (2). Table 1 compares the RS and DFT-IR results with the available reference Ese for compounds 7 (quadricyclane) and 10 (prismane), as reliable data for the studied compounds are limited.

The RS method estimates the total Ese of a molecule using a simple additive approximation; hereby, the overall strain is considered as the sum of the strain energies of its individual ring components (e.g., cyclopropane, cyclobutane) [29,53]. While this approach represents a proper first-order estimate, it overlooks several essential factors that influence strain distribution in polycycloalkanes and therefore often fails to provide accurate predictions. First, the RS method assumes that the strain contributions from each ring are independent. However, in fused and bridged ring systems, the rings are structurally interconnected, and interactions between them can redistribute Ese—often leading to strain relaxation. These inter-ring interactions are inherently neglected in the RS framework. Second, the RS method assumes rigid molecular geometries and does not account for electronic delocalization or steric effects, both of which can alleviate strain. In reality, these factors can significantly reduce the total Ese but are not captured in the additive RS model. Third, the RS method lacks the capacity to accommodate geometric flexibility. It treats the rings as fixed units, whereas real molecules can adopt more favorable conformations through bond angle and torsional relaxation. This geometric adaptability is crucial for determining the true minimum-energy structure, especially in complex polycyclic systems.

In contrast, DFT calculations inherently account for these effects. DFT enables complete molecular geometry optimizations, allowing the system to relax into its lowest-energy conformation while accounting for both electronic structure and steric interactions. This quantum mechanical approach is essential in multi-ring systems, where Ese does not scale linearly with the number of rings due to strain delocalization across the molecular framework.

The advantage of the DFT-IR method over RS becomes clear when comparing calculated Ese to experimental or high-level computational benchmarks. For example, the DFT-IR calculated Ese for compound 7 (quadricyclane, C7H8, tetracyclo [3.2.0.02,7.04,6]heptane) deviates from the experimental value by only 0.14%, while for compound 10 (prismane, C6;H6, tetracyclo[2.2.0.02,6.03,5]hexane), the deviation is just 1.02% as detailed in Table 1. In contrast, the RS method exhibits significantly large and inconsistent deviations: 18.78% for 7 (quadricyclane) and 4.77% for 10 (prismane). These discrepancies emphasize the limitations of the RS method and highlight the accuracy and reliability of quantum mechanical approaches such as DFT-IR. Furthermore, comparisons with prior studies also reveal substantial mismatches between RS-derived and experimentally determined strain energies, reinforcing the need for more sophisticated methods in Ese evaluation [28,29].

For HED fuel applications, it is ideal that the polycycloalkanes have moderate to high positive Ese. High Ese indicates the molecule stores extra potential energy in its bonds due to ring strain. If the Ese is too high, issues such as synthesis, stability, and safety may outweigh the benefit [54]. Upon combustion, this strain is released in addition to the standard chemical enthalpy, boosting the net heat of combustion per unit mass or volume. As a result, the optimal range of Ese for HED fuels can be assumed between 10 and 60 kcal/mol, which is within the vicinity of compound 6 (exo-THDCPD) and 7 (quadricyclane). Compound 6 (exo-THDCPD) is already used as a military fuel, JP-10, while 7 (quadricyclane) is extensively investigated as a top candidate for HED fuel [55]. Figure 1 presents the molecular structures of the twenty studied compounds and compares Ese values for selected polycycloalkanes determined via RS and DFT-IR, with both methods showing consistent trends. The Ese of all compounds is under 100 kcal/mol except for compound 10 (prismane), which is estimated at 126.69 kcal/mol.

These observed Ese in Figure 1 are due to the ring structures of the compounds. The compounds with relatively high Ese actually hold the strained three- or four-membered cyclic structures. As discovered by Dragojlovic [25], the strain energy per –CH2 group is highest in smaller rings, with 9.17 kcal/mol for cyclopropane (n = 3) and 6.58 kcal/mol for cyclobutane (n = 4). In polycyclic systems, however, additional factors such as ring fusion, bridging, and angular strain complicate the Ese landscape. For instance, high strain of compound 7 (quadricyclane) arises from its highly constrained geometry, comprising five rings with two three, two five, and one four-membered ring. In contrast, compound 16 (spirodecane) shows the lowest Ese at 5.59 kcal/mol among these compounds. It is noted that compound 6 (exo-THDCPD, i.e., JP-10) has a moderate Ese of 12.57 kcal/mol. The calculated Ese of the compounds is given in Table S2 of the SM.

3.2.1. Property Dataset and ML Model Performance

An overview of the fuel property dataset and the molecular descriptors used to develop ML models is provided. Specifically, this section focuses on designing a model and validation to predict the BP and FP of the polycycloalkanes listed in Figure 1. The distribution of carbon numbers and ring sizes within the property dataset is shown in Figure 2. It includes a structurally diverse collection of monocyclic and polycyclic hydrocarbons, with carbon numbers ranging from C3 to C21 for BP data and C3 to C20 for FP data. The dataset covers ring sizes from three- to twelve-membered structures, encompassing a wide range of cyclic frameworks. Notably, within the carbon range typical of conventional jet fuels (C7–C18), the BP and FP distributions peak at total carbon numbers of C8 and C9, respectively, which are well represented in the dataset [3].

As shown in Figure 2, five- and six-membered rings are the most prevalent in both BP and FP datasets because they offer an optimal balance between thermodynamic stability and synthetic accessibility. Their conformations (e.g., envelope for cyclopentane, chair for cyclohexane) minimize both angle and torsional strain [25,36], making them energetically favorable. Additionally, they are readily formed in many synthetic and biosynthetic pathways and can accommodate diverse substitutions, thereby increasing their occurrence. In contrast, smaller rings suffer from high strain, while larger ones are less accessible and often less stable.

Figure 3 highlights the importance scores of the 10 selected molecular descriptors used in training the ML models. For BP prediction (Figure 3a), the number of carbon atoms (NC) was identified as the most influential descriptor, with an importance score of approximately 0.87 out of 1. The BertzCT graph-based descriptor appears as the second-most influential in predicting BP, which assesses the complexity of the molecules [56]. In contrast, FP prediction (Figure 3b) was influenced by the information content descriptor (Ipc) [57], which achieved an importance score of approximately 0.60. As demonstrated in SM (Figure S1), NC and Ipc are strongly correlated because both descriptors capture molecular size. In the preprocessing stage, NC was excluded from the FP model, with Ipc retained as the representative size-related variable. While feature selection in ML models is mainly determined by statistical correlations with the target property to improve predictive accuracy, it does not necessarily prioritize descriptors with clear physical significance [58]. It may instead choose less chemically informative variables. Therefore, although NC is more chemically intuitive, Ipc preferred for the FP model to strike a balance between statistical rigor and predictive performance. To maintain chemical interpretability and ensure consistency across both the BP and FP models, NC was still emphasized in our discussion of results.

Aside from size-related descriptors, other features also played a significant role in FP prediction, reflecting the interaction of topological and electronic factors. Including VE1_A, BalabanJ, and GATS1Z emerged as key predictors (Table S6, SM). The VE1_A descriptor, derived from graph theory, describes molecular connectivity and tends to increase with branching, which may affect ignition behavior [56]. The BalabanJ topological index measures molecular complexity by considering both atomic connectivity and distances [2,56], while the GATS1Z descriptor captures autocorrelation of atomic properties (such as atomic number) across a specified topological distance, emphasizing the role of electronic distribution [56]. Collectively, these descriptors improved predictive power compared to models relying only on size descriptors. Their combination demonstrates how ML-based selection of complementary features can produce strong predictive models, while also highlighting the importance of balancing chemical interpretability with statistical performance in developing property prediction models.

Figure 4 shows the relationship between the descriptor NC (number of carbon atoms in a single ring) and the BP dataset, which contains only experimental values. For monocyclic alkanes with three- to twelve-membered rings, the BP increases approximately linearly with ring size. The experimental BP value for cycloundecane (eleven-membered ring) in the property dataset of the NIST Chemistry WebBook [39] shows a slight deviation from this trend. For consistency in the analysis, a more recent value (491.55 K) from Guidechem [59] was adopted. This trend reflects the influence of increasing molecular mass and van der Waals surface area, which enhances intermolecular dispersion forces and raises the BP. Smaller rings such as cyclopropane (C3H6) and cyclobutane (C4H8) have significantly lower BPs, while larger rings exhibit progressively higher values due to their greater surface area and stronger cohesive forces [60].

The predictive performance of the BP and FP using the SVR models was evaluated using three standard metrics: the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), which are similar to our previous study [2], and details are given in the SM. Figure 5 reports the model performance for BP and FP across all datasets. In Figure 5a, the model shows a consistent and high R2 value of 0.99 across the training, test, and validation sets for BP prediction, indicating an excellent linear correlation between the predicted and reported values in the property dataset. For instance, the test set yielded an MAE of 6.92 K and an RMSE of 8.46 K, suggesting the model accurately predicts BP with minimal deviation. Even in the validation set, which serves as a test of model reliability, the error metrics remain low (MAE = 5.04 K, RMSE = 6.21 K), highlighting the model’s ability to generalize well to unseen data. While a few minor outliers can be observed (e.g., particularly at higher BP values >490 K), they do not significantly affect the overall predictive performance, and the majority of data points fall close to the parity line (y = x).

Similarly, in Figure 5b, the FP prediction model also exhibits strong performance, albeit with slightly lower R2 values compared to the BP model. The training, test, and validation sets show very similar R2 values of 0.98, 0.96, and 0.98, respectively, indicating consistent model performance. The test set in particular demonstrates high accuracy with an MAE of 9.58 K and an RMSE of 12.50 K, supporting the model’s strength in FP estimation. However, a few deviations are noticeable in the validation set. Despite these discrepancies, the majority of predictions remain closely aligned with the reported values. Hence, the strong agreement between predicted and reported values in both BP and FP models, particularly with consistently high R2 values and low error values across all datasets, demonstrates the efficacy of the SVR approach.

To ensure the robustness and real-world applicability of the developed machine learning models, multiple validation strategies were employed. Specifically, three repeated 5-fold cross-validations [48] were conducted on the training dataset, providing reliable estimates of model generalizability. The models demonstrated strong predictive performance for both BP ( M A E = 5.65 ± 1.70 K , R M S E = 8.08 ± 2.86 K , R 2 = 0.98 ± 0.01 ) and FP ( M A E = 8.28 ± 2.41 K , R M S E = 11.05 ± 4.01 K , R 2 = 0.94 ± 0.05 ) as summarized in SM (Table S8). Because the target property dataset is relatively small, we further assessed model stability and confidence intervals through a sensitivity analysis using 100 bootstrap iterations [49]. The bootstrap analysis further confirmed the stability of the models, with the BP model achieving a mean R2 of 0.99 (σ = 0.01) and the FP model achieving a mean R2 of 0.95 (σ = 0.02). Consistently low MAE and RMSE values across bootstrap samples indicate reliable predictive accuracy and minimal variability, as detailed in SM (Table S9). Slightly higher variation observed for FP can be attributed to the inclusion of both experimental and computational data in the property dataset.

Even with multiple validation strategies, the risk of overfitting or underfitting cannot be entirely eliminated, which remains a key challenge in ML models when applied to new data [61]. In this study, the dataset is relatively small and restricted to strained cycloalkanes only; therefore, while reliability was assessed by comparing ML predictions with values obtained from the GC method and available experimental data in SM (Table S10), a formal Applicability Domain (AD) analysis (e.g., Williams plot) was not performed. Given the limited chemical space considered here, such an analysis would be more meaningful for larger and more diverse datasets [62]. Future studies involving broader chemical datasets will likely incorporate AD approaches. The close agreement across these comparisons supports the robustness of the ML models within the present domain and highlights their practical relevance. In addition to predictive accuracy, the ML models provide rapid estimations and reveal meaningful structure–property relationships, thereby enhancing both efficiency and interpretability in molecular property prediction.

3.2.2. Structure-Property Trends in Polycycloalkanes

To assess the thermal properties of aviation fuels and evaluate the structural influence of the polycycloalkanes listed in Figure 1, trained models were applied to predict their BP and FP, as summarized in Table S10 of the SM. Figure 6 shows the BP/FP relationship, which follows a well-established linear trend [24]. The green boundary in Figure 6 marks the polycycloalkanes that meet both BP and FP requirements. Approximately 65% of the compounds fall within the operational BP/FP range for Jet A (BP: 433.15–573.15 K; FP ≥ 311.15 K) [12,35]. Thirteen polycycloalkanes (1–6, 9, 13, 15–17, 19, and 20) meet these criteria, supporting their strong potential as candidates for aviation fuel design. Notably, compound 6 (JP-10), a well-established military fuel, is also identified by these criteria as a promising candidate, thereby validating the effectiveness of the method. Since both boiling point (BP, reflecting volatility) and flash point (FP, reflecting ignition characteristics) influence fuel safety, a balanced BP/FP profile is critical. Excessive volatility (low BP) can lead to evaporative losses at altitude, while insufficient volatility (high BP) can impair combustion efficiency [63].

A detailed analysis of the molecular structure within the defined boundary in Figure 6 was conducted to evaluate its influence on the studied properties. Figure 7 presents the structures of polycycloalkanes that satisfy both BP and FP requirements, together with the corresponding predictions from the GC and ML approaches. The strong agreement between GC and ML validates the predicted thermal properties. Most candidates feature a dominant five-membered ring structure, often accompanied by a few smaller three- or four-membered rings. For example, compound 2 (THTCPD; NC = 15, BP = 558.68 K, FP = 422.29 K), which contains five five-membered rings, exhibits the highest BP and FP in the studied set. These results indicate that the number of carbon (NC)—a proxy for molecular size—and the presence of ring structures are primary factors influencing BP and FP. Furthermore, Figure S2 in the SM in the illustrates a nearly linear relationship between BP/FP and NC, which likely arises from the increasing contribution of van der Waals volume with molecular size and associated packing effects, as noted in a prior study [64]. Volatility and ignition performance are observed in the C9–C15 range, consistent with previous reports that cycloalkanes in this window generally meet jet fuel specifications [65].

In addition to carbon count, Ese may also modulate thermal behavior. The majority of the candidates within the boundary exhibit moderate strain (Ese < 60 kcal/mol), which appears beneficial for balancing stability and volatility. For instance, compound 5 (tetracyclononane; NC = 9, BP = 439.75 K, FP = 323.27 K, Ese = 63.46 kcal/mol) displays higher BP and FP than compound 18 (5-ethylnorbornane; NC = 9, BP = 424.07 K, FP = 307.30 K, Ese = 12.13 kcal/mol), despite identical NC values, placing 5 inside the boundary and 18 outside. This indicates that constrained topologies with moderate strain can enhance intermolecular interactions, elevating volatility and ignition thresholds. In contrast, excessive strain (>60 kcal/mol), typically arising from multiple small rings, reduces both BP and FP by limiting effective NC and molecular flexibility. Such effects are evident in compound 7 (quadricyclane; NC = 7, BP = 386.89 K, FP = 272.75 K, Ese = 78.59 kcal/mol), which fails to meet BP/FP requirements despite satisfying other fuel criteria and being widely researched as a potential aviation fuel [51,55]. Thus, a balance between molecular size, ring topology, and moderate strain emerges as the key design principle for identifying viable polycycloalkane fuel candidates, as determined by this study. These findings indicate the dual role of Ese in polycyclic fuel performance. Moderate strain improves molecular rigidity and elevates BP and FP, while excessive strain compromises both properties. Polycyclic structures dominated by five-membered rings, with controlled incorporation of three- and four-membered units, strike an effective balance between energy density and operational safety (BP&FP), making them strong candidates for SAF design. Figure 6 and Figure 7 provide a structural rationale for targeted molecular screening.

While this study emphasizes the influence of Ese on volatility, ignition, and stability, it is essential to acknowledge that real-world fuel performance also depends on additional parameters beyond the scope of this work. The cyclic and strained nature of the candidate molecules is particularly relevant, as literature reports that highly strained polycyclic structures can alter reaction pathways, rupture C–C bonds, and thereby promote the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and increase soot production during combustion [66]. For example, while compounds like 1 (pentacyclododecane) and 2 (THTCPD) exhibit promising energy, BP, and FP profiles, their complex polycyclic structures may act as precursors to PAHs, resulting in undesirable sooting behavior in engines. Similarly, strained cyclic motifs, while beneficial for energy density, can influence ignition kinetics and flame propagation in ways that are not captured by the current screening. Incorporating these combustion considerations into future ML- and DFT-based frameworks will be essential for a more accurate assessment of fuel suitability. DFT studies of high-potential molecules, such as 6 (JP-10), could provide additional insight into internal bond strain and reactivity, complementing empirical observations and guiding the design of SAFs.

In addition to combustion performance, cold-flow properties, such as FrP and viscosity, are critical determinants of aviation fuel suitability [3,12,35]. Molecular compactness, ring size, and rigidity strongly affect freezing behavior, potentially disqualifying otherwise promising candidates [18]. For instance, while compound 6 (JP-10, exo-THDCPD) remains suitable with a FrP of 194.15 K [67], its isomer endo-THDCPD solidifies at 350.15 K, making it unsuitable [18,67] for aviation fuel. Likewise, compact molecules such as 5 (tetracyclononane) may exhibit elevated FrP, which can limit performance in extreme cold, despite meeting volatility and ignition criteria. These trade-offs support the importance of integrating cold-flow analysis into future screening frameworks, using computational modeling and ML methods combined with quantum chemistry to ensure that candidate molecules meet the full spectrum of operational requirements for SAFs.

4. Conclusions

This study demonstrates the utility of combining DFT with ML to study fuel properties of strained polycycloalkanes as potential HED SAF. Machine learning using SVR models provided fast and reasonably accurate predictions of BP and FP, enabling the preliminary screening of candidate molecules. Thirteen (approximately 65%) of the compounds, including JP-10, met key volatility and ignition criteria. Although Ese showed no direct correlation with fuel suitability, the limited dataset suggests that promising candidates may cluster below approximately 60 kcal/mol in Ese, indicating a potential balance between energy content and stability that warrants further investigation. The identified C9–C15 compounds, predominantly five-membered ring structures, fall within the typical Jet A range for energy, BP, and FP, suggesting practical potential in aviation fuel. However, these results represent only an initial computational screening, and the actual viability of these candidates as SAFs will depend on a thorough evaluation of their combustion behavior and cold-flow properties. Overall, this work illustrates how integrating ML-based screening with quantum-level analysis can provide a cost-effective and scientifically grounded approach for the early-stage assessment of SAF candidates.

Industry Adoption: Plug Power’s Strategic Pivot to Aviation Fuel Production in 2025

Between 2021 and 2024, Plug Power’s primary market was hydrogen fuel cells for material handling equipment. Its connection to aviation was indirect and speculative, such as its technology being used in test programs by startups like the now-defunct Universal Hydrogen. This period established the company’s core competency in Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology but kept it largely outside the mainstream aerospace conversation. The year 2025 marks a dramatic inflection point. Plug Power has executed a decisive strategic pivot, repositioning itself as a critical enabler of aviation decarbonization, not through direct propulsion, but by supplying the core technology for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

This shift is evidenced by a series of large-scale commercial commitments. The cornerstone of this new strategy is a 2 GW electrolyzer deal with Allied Green Ammonia for a facility in Uzbekistan explicitly designed to produce SAF. This is not an isolated move; the company is also engaged in over 300 MW of SAF projects in Europe with Arcadia and is delivering a 100 MW system to Galp’s Sines Refinery in Portugal. This pattern demonstrates a clear strategy: focus on the immediate, commercially viable market of producing green hydrogen for SAF. This approach allows Plug Power to generate near-term revenue and forge partnerships with major industrial players, de-risking its aviation ambitions. The key opportunity is capturing value across the entire hydrogen-for-aviation value chain, from fuel production to end-use. However, this aggressive expansion introduces a significant new threat: execution risk. The company’s credibility now hinges on its ability to deliver on these massive, multi-gigawatt-scale projects.

Geography: Plug Power’s Global Expansion into Aviation-Adjacent Markets

Prior to 2025, Plug Power’s geographic footprint was heavily concentrated in North America, driven by its core material handling business. The company’s activities were largely domestic, focused on warehouse and logistics operations within the United States.

The period from January 2025 to today reveals a rapid and deliberate international expansion, directly tied to its new SAF and large-scale hydrogen strategy. Europe has emerged as a primary target, with Plug Power securing a 100 MW electrolyzer project at Galp’s refinery in Portugal and engaging in over 300 MW of SAF-related projects in Denmark and France with Arcadia. This shows the company is targeting regions with strong regulatory support for decarbonization and established industrial partners. The most significant move is into Central Asia with the 2 GW electrolyzer deal in Uzbekistan, a government-backed project that plants Plug Power’s flag in an emerging energy export hub. Simultaneously, the partnership with GH2 Global in Brazil signals an expansion of its core logistics business into South America, targeting the broader ecosystem that includes airports. This geographic diversification is not random; it follows global capital and policy aimed at green hydrogen production, reducing reliance on the US market alone. The risk, however, is the increased exposure to geopolitical and regional economic instabilities, particularly with a massive project in a location like Uzbekistan.

Technology Maturity: From Niche Fuel Cells to Gigawatt-Scale Electrolyzers

Between 2021 and 2024, Plug Power’s technology story was centered on the maturity of its PEM fuel cells for the low-power demands of forklifts. Its PEM electrolyzer technology, while proven, had not yet been deployed at a massive, industrial scale. The use of its fuel cells in the now-defunct Universal Hydrogen’s test aircraft was a notable but early-stage, speculative application, representing a proof-of-concept for aviation propulsion rather than a commercially ready product.

Starting in 2025, the narrative of technology maturity has fundamentally shifted from fuel cells for mobility to electrolyzers for fuel production. The technology being scaled is not the in-aircraft propulsion system, but the foundational green hydrogen production equipment. The live customer demonstrations of its 1 MW and 5 MW GenEco electrolyzers in May 2025 served as a prelude to this scale-up. The subsequent announcements of the 100 MW project delivery to Galp in Portugal and the massive 2 GW deal in Uzbekistan are the ultimate validation points. These projects prove that Plug Power’s PEM electrolyzer technology has moved beyond the pilot phase and is now being deployed at a commercial scale previously unseen for the company. In contrast, the direct application of its fuel cells for commercial aircraft propulsion remains speculative. The company’s most mature and commercially impactful technology for the aviation sector today is the electrolyzer—the key that unlocks green hydrogen for SAF.

Table: SWOT Analysis of Plug Power’s Aviation Strategy

SWOT Category 2021 – 2024 2025 – Today What Changed / Validated Strength Established PEM fuel cell technology and leadership in the material handling market. Leveraging core PEM expertise to secure massive-scale electrolyzer deals (e.g., 2 GW with Allied Green Ammonia for SAF). Strong government backing via a $1.66B DOE loan guarantee. Validated the strategic pivot from a niche mobility provider to a key technology supplier for industrial-scale decarbonization and SAF production. Weakness Primarily focused on a single market (material handling) with limited exposure to the broader energy transition. High dependency on government incentives (IRA’s Section 45V credits) and execution of large, complex projects. Lacks a flagship partnership with a major aerospace OEM like Airbus or Boeing for direct propulsion. The business model’s success is now explicitly tied to political stability regarding clean energy incentives and the immense challenge of executing gigawatt-scale projects. Opportunity Potential to leverage PEM technology for new hydrogen applications and markets. Tapping into the explosive growth of the aviation fuel cell and SAF market (projected to reach $24.63B by 2035). Generating near-term revenue by supplying the SAF value chain. The opportunity crystallized from a general “hydrogen economy” concept into a specific, high-growth, and commercially tangible vertical: providing electrolyzers for SAF. Threat Competition from other fuel cell manufacturers in the material handling space. Significant execution risk on large-scale international projects (e.g., Uzbekistan). Potential for political headwinds to undermine critical tax credits (Section 45V). Loss of early aviation testbeds (e.g., Universal Hydrogen’s failure). The scale of its ambitions has introduced commensurate risks. Project execution and political policy stability have become the primary threats to its growth strategy, far outweighing niche market competition.

Forward-Looking Insights and Summary

The data from 2025 signals that Plug Power has firmly committed to a pragmatic, two-pronged aviation strategy, with an immediate focus on the SAF supply chain. The year ahead will be a test of execution. Market actors should closely watch for progress updates on the 2 GW Uzbekistan project and the 100 MW Galp refinery deployment; successful commissioning of these facilities will be the most potent validation of the company’s ability to deliver at scale.

Another critical signal to monitor is the finalization and political durability of the IRA’s Section 45V hydrogen production tax credit. This incentive is the financial cornerstone for Plug Power’s domestic expansion funded by the $1.66 billion DOE loan. Any dilution or instability in this policy poses a direct threat to the economic viability of its U.S. projects.

While the electrolyzer business for SAF is gaining significant traction, the direct propulsion side of its strategy remains a long-term, speculative upside. The next major milestone for investors would be the announcement of a formal development partnership with a major aerospace OEM like Airbus or Boeing. Without it, Plug Power’s role in aviation will likely remain that of a crucial fuel infrastructure provider rather than an integrated aerospace technology partner. For now, the company’s most bankable contribution to decarbonizing flight is on the ground, producing the green hydrogen that will power the sustainable fuels of tomorrow.

According to Allied Biofuels representatives, the project aligns with Uzbekistan’s national strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.
Governor Rahimov emphasized that the project would strengthen Khorezm’s position as a leading region in the field of green energy.
Allied Biofuels was officially registered in Uzbekistan in July this year.","In a groundbreaking move for Central Asia, Uzbekistan has announced plans to build the region’s first plant dedicated to producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The facility will be constructed in the Tuprakkala district of Khorezm region and is being developed by international firm Allied Biofuels, with an estimated investment of $5.9 billion, according to Fergana news agency.

The project was formalized during the International Investment Forum in Khiva, where Allied Biofuels CEO Alfred Benedict and Khorezm Regional Governor Jurabek Rahimov signed an agreement to initiate the venture. As part of the deal, local authorities have allocated land for the plant and committed to providing access to water supply systems.

Once completed, the facility will be the first fully integrated biorefinery of its kind in Central Asia. Annual production is expected to include 382,000 tons of SAF, 152,000 tons of electro-synthetic fuel (e-SAF), and 11,000 tons of renewable diesel produced using green hydrogen generated via 2 GW electrolysis.

According to Allied Biofuels representatives, the project aligns with Uzbekistan’s national strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. It is also seen as a significant step toward reducing the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.

Allied Biofuels CEO Alfred Benedict described the agreement as “historic” for the company. Governor Rahimov emphasized that the project would strengthen Khorezm’s position as a leading region in the field of green energy. He also highlighted the initiative’s potential to generate hundreds of new jobs and make a meaningful contribution to the local economy.

Allied Biofuels was officially registered in Uzbekistan in July this year. The company is headed by Benedict, who also leads Australian-based Allied Green Ammonia. Earlier in 2024, Allied Biofuels signed a memorandum of understanding with the Uzbek government, expressing its intent to invest around $5.5 billion in renewable energy initiatives across the country.

Previously, regional officials briefed President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on the project, outlining initial investments of $820 million. They also proposed installing 4 GW of solar panels over 5,500 hectares to supply energy for the plant.",https://old.asiaplustj.info/sites/default/files/articles/353408/c9bff1b33871bd324f7e294ba39b9cfd.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 01:56:22.486847

,,2025-10-03 02:01:52+00:00,global.honda,The Bond between Honda and Authorized Service Centers Supporting HondaJet Customers ...,Honda Stories,,,,,https://global.honda/en/stories/178-2510-HondaJet-Service-interview.html%3Ffrom%3Dtop_stories_area_A,"In 1979, when I was 25, I decided to establish a maintenance service company specializing in small charter companies with three or fewer aircraft.
The AMS program (Aircraft Management Services) offered by Honda Aircraft Company, which allows owners to entrust aircraft maintenance, pilot training, and operational planning and management to HACI-certified experts, also seemed appealing.
Don’s company is not just a business partner but a company that deeply resonates with Honda’s philosophy and works alongside us with that same commitment.
This approach embodies the Honda Philosophy and aligns perfectly with the principles and philosophy that we at Banyan have always valued.
We will leverage the service quality expertise we have cultivated in other products, such as motorcycles, automobiles, and power products, to achieve further evolution.","Since its founding, HACI has focused not only on selling aircraft but also on improving the quality of after-sales service. We have made safety, quality and customer satisfaction our top priorities, and in 2024, we announced a new commitment to quality management. We outlined three pillars: fostering a culture of quality first, continuous improvement, and the pursuit of customer satisfaction.

These principles are embodied by our network of 21 Authorized Service Centers worldwide, which play a significant role in ensuring the quality of HACI’s services. These centers handle aircraft repairs, upgrades, inspections, and any other maintenance events.

Banyan Air Service is one of the HondaJet’s Authorized Service Centers, and has supported the HondaJet and its operators from the launch of the HondaJet program to the present day.

Thank you. We currently handle maintenance for 60 HondaJets, providing fuel supply for aircraft in the southeastern United States, as well as repairs, inspections, and part replacements for aircraft and electronic equipment in accordance with various guidelines, and aircraft sales.

As mentioned earlier, when we heard the news in 2014 that Honda was developing an aircraft, we were confident that this business would succeed and believed our services could meet Honda’s quality standards. We applied for a business partnership and have been providing after-sales service for HondaJet for over 10 years.

In the field of very light business jets, it is truly innovative to provide a 24/7 rapid response and delivery service for AOG (Aircraft On Ground) situations while maintaining a globally unified and consistent quality standard. This is only possible thanks to the extensive network of HACI owned as well as authorized service centers. As a result, we have achieved a dispatch reliability rate* of 99.81% (As of August 2025), which is among the highest in the world, and this is entirely due to their cooperation.

I first encountered Honda products when I was 15 years old. In the rural town in Nigeria where I grew up, scooters and mopeds with bicycle-style pedals were the most common mode of transportation. One day, I saw a Honda motorcycle without pedals. I begged my parents to buy it for me. That motorcycle had no oil leaks, the lights were bright, and the engine was surprisingly quiet. It was like magic.

Two years later, when I was 17, I rode a Honda CB175 (175cc sports bike) and traveled across West Africa and neighboring countries. I embarked on a journey from my hometown of Egbe in Nigeria to London, England, crossing the Sahara Desert. There were no roads, and I had to refuel at fuel stations at oases every 500 miles on a bike that could cover approximately 250 miles per day. During that 2,000-mile journey, I became completely captivated by Honda products. This experience is the foundation of my trust and affection for Honda. To date, I have purchased over 100 Honda products (motorcycles, automobiles, power products, and aircraft), including those for my family.

When I was a child, the hospital where my parents worked and the boarding school I attended were about 500 miles apart, and the only way to travel was by small aircraft. A journey that would take two and a half days by Land Rover (off-road SUV) could be completed in just three and a half hours by light aircraft.

From this childhood experience, I realized how useful aviation could be as a mode of transportation in rural areas like Africa, and I was deeply attracted to its safety, time-saving efficiency, and comfort. I earned money by repairing and restoring Honda Civics, which at that time were still relatively unknown, but something I knew to be a quality car, while studying aviation in Toronto, Canada.

After graduating from school, I began working as a contract pilot for light aircraft. I flew piston-engine light aircraft carrying about 10 passengers, but I gradually noticed that many small charter aircraft were struggling with maintenance. For small companies with only two light aircraft, it was not practical to hire full-time mechanics and meet the strict maintenance requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Additionally, there were not many companies offering maintenance services for such small operators.

In 1979, when I was 25, I decided to establish a maintenance service company specializing in small charter companies with three or fewer aircraft. Together with a friend I had known since childhood, I founded Banyan Air Service in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Since founding the company, I have dedicated myself to providing swift and high-quality service. For example, if a customer called at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night saying, “The battery has failed, but we need to fly passengers on a charter flight tomorrow morning,” I would rush to the site within 10 minutes and repair the aircraft. Such service and rapid response gained recognition gradually became our reputation.

Time passed, and in 2014, I heard about Honda’s announcement that they were developing an aircraft. The beauty and efficiency of the HondaJet were the epitome of corporate aviation. I was also strongly drawn to the Over-The-Wing-Engine-Mount (the HondaJet’s distinctive feature of positioning engines on top of the wings, rather than on the sides of the fuselage) developed by HACI. The AMS program (Aircraft Management Services) offered by Honda Aircraft Company, which allows owners to entrust aircraft maintenance, pilot training, and operational planning and management to HACI-certified experts, also seemed appealing. I proposed a business partnership with Honda, and here we are today.

“The Power of Dreams” represents a vision, while “How We Move You” symbolizes the emotional connection we strive to create. We are not just a fueling station, we are partners. Our goal is for customers to feel that Banyan is their home.

Additionally, we refer to our associates as “teammates” and have built long-term relationships with them. Many teammates have been with us for decades since our founding. This aligns with Honda’s philosophy of “Respect for the individual,” does it not?

Exactly. At HACI, we treat not only our associates but also our business partners with the same honesty and integrity as a family, pursuing the highest standards of quality and customer satisfaction from a long-term perspective. This mindset is the very essence of Honda’s philosophy. Don’s company is not just a business partner but a company that deeply resonates with Honda’s philosophy and works alongside us with that same commitment.

Just as Don was excited about the development of the HondaJet and believed in its success from the start, it remains our unwavering mission to provide both the power to turn dreams into reality and the emotion that moves people. Honda’s brand slogan is deeply rooted in all our activities.

The Honda Philosophy and brand slogan have guided us since the pioneering efforts in aircraft development led by HACI’s first president, Michimasa Fujino, and they continue to be carried forward under the leadership of the current HACI president, Hideto Yamasaki.

I recall the words Fujino-san (HACI’s first President and CEO) shared with me during my first visit to the HACI factory. At that time, through our discussions, I gained a deep sense of how Honda envisions the long-term future.

Paying close attention to user feedback and incorporating it into improvements. This approach embodies the Honda Philosophy and aligns perfectly with the principles and philosophy that we at Banyan have always valued.

Honda’s “Three Joys” philosophy is something I feel constantly in my work. The joy of buying is evident in the delivery experience at HACI. It is a special moment when the new owner is congratulated by the staff who actually manufactured the aircraft. The joy of selling is felt when conveying the appeal of the HondaJet. And the joy of creating is also realized by Banyan through customization and maintenance.

We have not only met the FAA's strict standards, but have actively pursued the acquisition of AS9100, an aerospace industry quality management standard, and the introduction of our own quality management system. Going forward, we will focus on innovation, including the successful development of the HondaJet Echelon, flight tests using 100% SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), and improvements in aerodynamic performance and manufacturing costs.

Under the slogan “One Honda Team,” we will further accelerate the integration of Honda’s global culture. We will leverage the service quality expertise we have cultivated in other products, such as motorcycles, automobiles, and power products, to achieve further evolution.

As I mentioned earlier, our goal is to provide service that makes HondaJet owners feel that Banyan is their home. Recently, we opened a new hangar in St. Augustine, Florida, to enhance service levels for customers in the southern region. We are also considering the construction of a larger facility by 2026. We are committed to continuing to provide new value to the aviation industry alongside Honda, a company I believe in.",http://global.honda/content/dam/site/global-en/stories/cq_img/178-2510-hondajet-service-interview/social.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 01:56:34.653874

Under the proposed regulations, foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50% of the RIN value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.
In the Sept. 30 letter, the lawmakers commend provisions of the proposed “Set 2” rule related to biobased-diesel (BBD) RVOs and foreign-produced fuels and feedstocks.
“This is exactly the outcome Congress intended when it created and expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard.
“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with Congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks,” the lawmakers added.","A bipartisan group of 47 federal lawmakers, led by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Sept. 30 sent a letter to U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin urging the agency to maintained proposed biomass-based diesel renewable volume obligations (RVOs) and move forward with plans to boost the domestic ag industry in its upcoming Renewable Fuel Standard “Set 2” rule.

The EPA on June released its proposed RFS “Set 2” rule, which aims to set 2026 and 2027 RVOs, including record high blending targets for biomass-based diesel. The rulemaking also includes provisions that make substantial changes to the RFS program by limiting the participation of imported fuels and feedstocks and eliminating electricity from the program.

As part of the effort to boost the domestic agriculture industry, the proposed rule would modify the value renewable identification numbers (RINs) based on whether the biofuel is derived from domestic or foreign sources. Under the proposed regulations, foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50% of the RIN value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.

In the Sept. 30 letter, the lawmakers commend provisions of the proposed “Set 2” rule related to biobased-diesel (BBD) RVOs and foreign-produced fuels and feedstocks. “The combination of the strong BBD volumes coupled with prioritizing U.S. feedstocks represents a commonsense approach that puts American farmers first, strengthens domestic biofuel markets, and delivers tangible economic benefits to rural communities,” they wrote.

“Soybean oil may only represent 20 percent of the bean, but it accounts for more than half of its value in the U.S. market, and about half of that oil is used to make advanced biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” the lawmakers continued. “That means roughly a quarter of every bushel's value processed here in the U.S. is directly tied to biofuel demand. At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.

“The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal: it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities where oilseed processing facilities are located,” they continued. “This is exactly the outcome Congress intended when it created and expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard.

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with Congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks,” the lawmakers added. “Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called “used cooking oil” from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufacturing.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Grassley2025_9dbf3e3707.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 19:56:14.211476

Beyond reducing emissions, the SAF mandate is expected to add over £1.8 billion to the UK economy and create 10,000 skilled jobs across the country.
While SAF currently costs more than traditional jet fuel, the government is taking steps to protect consumers from price hikes.
This policy marks a significant step toward decarbonizing UK aviation without limiting travel demand.","The UK government has officially announced its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, setting a legally binding target for 10% of all jet fuel used on UK flights to come from sustainable sources by 2030. Set to take effect in January 2025, pending parliamentary approval, the mandate places the UK among the first countries in the world to enshrine SAF usage in law.

The move follows the successful launch of the world’s first 100% SAF-powered transatlantic flight from Heathrow in November 2023, backed by up to £1 million in government funding. Now, the government aims to supply 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually—enough to fuel flights circling the globe 3,000 times.

Beyond reducing emissions, the SAF mandate is expected to add over £1.8 billion to the UK economy and create 10,000 skilled jobs across the country. Recent investment through the £135 million Advanced Fuels Fund is already supporting 13 pioneering SAF projects nationwide.

While SAF currently costs more than traditional jet fuel, the government is taking steps to protect consumers from price hikes. A built-in review mechanism and price control measures will allow adjustments in response to supply shortages or cost fluctuations, ensuring ticket fares remain within typical seasonal ranges.

As part of its broader net zero strategy, the government also launched a consultation into a SAF revenue certainty scheme, proposing a Guaranteed Strike Price (GSP) model. This would give SAF producers pricing stability and incentivize further investment.

Transport Secretary Mark Harper emphasized that SAF is critical for safeguarding British aviation, protecting jobs, and allowing passengers to continue flying sustainably. SAF can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 70% and is made from waste materials like used cooking oil, industrial gases, and household waste.

I GRADUATED with a master’s in chemical engineering from the University of Strathclyde in 2018. I’ve worked at Atkins -Réalis since graduating in a variety of roles in and around the water sector. I started with some drinking water work, then did some desalination work in the Middle East, and now currently my job title is principal bioresources process specialist. Essentially, I focus on how process technology can help tackle some of the water sector’s most pressing challenges associated with wastewater treatment and sewage sludge management.

What attracted you to the sector?

I always had a kind of natural pull towards water treatment. Even back at high school I did my advanced higher chemistry project looking at using roasted banana peel – which you might even now call biochar – as a means of removing heavy metals from water. And I did my master’s thesis in looking at selective recovery of copper from acid mine drainage. So, I’ve always had a kind of interest in water treatment processes. I really thought a career in the water sector could be rewarding and fulfilling. And I also always liked the idea that you could recover some value from waste.

What attracted you to your role?

My role really centres around looking at how process technologies can be utilised to best process sewage sludge, which can typically be the arrow out of the end of the wastewater treatment flow sheet. There’s real global uncertainty in the future of sewage sludge management. This is driven by challenges from public perception issues, contamination, through to things like microplastics and PFAS, process emissions and regulatory uncertainty. And at the same time, we’re wising up to the real energy and nutrient value in sewage sludge and looking at wastewater in general as a sort of feedstock for the circular economy. So, I was attracted to this role in the AtkinsRealis bioresources team, so I could be part of deploying some of the fascinating chemical engineering taking place in the sector.

What does your typical day or week involve?

I’ve got a real variety in my workdays, which I guess is a benefit to working for a consultancy. Often, you’re involved in quite different types of projects, and it makes for a really good way to build up a nice breadth of experience early in your career. Day to day, I manage projects with civil, mechanical, electrical, geotechnical and hydraulic engineers, speak with regulatory experts and work with other process engineers and design, and prepare and run a lot of workshops. I help to develop biosolids management strategies, which requires a bit of creativity, which is nice. I discuss technologies with vendors, which is always interesting, and get to be competitive when preparing proposals for winning work.

What's the most exciting development or opportunity in your field that you wish more people knew about?

One of my favourites, we’re looking at filtering out toilet paper or cellulose pulp from sewage. We’re interested in the downstream benefits of that process, what happens downstream at the wastewater treatment works when you take the cellulose pulp toilet paper out. We’re also looking at what we can do with that cellulose pulp, so one of the avenues is looking at fermentation of that into green chemicals. I’m also supporting on a project where we’re looking at turning a significant portion of the UK’s sewage sludge into jet fuel – that is actually a thing! There’s a process called hydrothermal liquefaction which breaks organic matter such as sewage sludge into a biocrude oil, which can then be refined into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). So, lots of cool things going on.

What IChemE resources do you recommend students use to help them take the first steps in their career

I generally found IChemE’s Chartership programme really useful in shaping the initial years of my career. It ensured I got a good broad range of technical and general experience. And it really helped me, with my mentor, sort out target areas of development. In addition, I’d also advocate for engaging with special interest groups (SIGs) and attending IChemE events. I think it’s a really great way to learn more but, importantly, expand your network, which is something I’ve found to be really vital in my career so far.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/22935/1012studenthero.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-10-02 17:56:59.143117

U.S. commercial revenue grew 71% year over year, while U.S. government contracts rose 45%.","Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is once again in the spotlight as its stock edges closer to record highs. The company is gaining momentum thanks to strong demand in the U.S. and a new partnership with Boeing Defense, Space & Security.

Palantir’s data analytics and AI platforms are becoming more important. They impact both government and commercial markets. At the same time, investors remain focused on whether the AI company can balance growth with its high valuation.

From Data to Defense: Palantir’s Boeing Breakthrough

The company’s latest deal with Boeing is a key reason behind its recent stock rally. Boeing will integrate Palantir’s Foundry platform across its defense and space operations. Foundry will help Boeing manage data better, optimize supply chains, and make smarter decisions in its manufacturing facilities.

Steve Parker, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, noted:

“The game-changing capabilities this provides us … is it allows us to make decisions not in weeks, but in days and hours…This is really the AI synthesizing data, allowing us to make decisions.”

For Boeing, the partnership offers tools. These tools help cut costs from supply chain delays and production issues. For Palantir, it strengthens credibility with one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the world. This collaboration also shows how Palantir’s technology can move beyond government contracts into major commercial and industrial operations.

Palantir has been steadily growing its commercial business. Today, over 40% of its revenue comes from commercial clients. This is a shift from earlier years, when it focused almost entirely on government work. The Boeing partnership is expected to help drive more adoption of Palantir’s AI solutions across industries.

U.S. Market Momentum: Earnings on the Rise

Palantir’s financial performance in 2025 has been marked by rapid expansion in the U.S. market. In its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $884 million, beating analyst expectations.

U.S. commercial revenue grew 71% year over year, while U.S. government contracts rose 45%. These results show that Palantir is successfully expanding its reach in both defense and commercial sectors.

However, the picture is not equally strong across all regions. Palantir’s European commercial revenue fell by about 5%, suggesting weaker demand outside the U.S.

Even so, the company raised its full-year revenue forecast to nearly $3.9 billion, reflecting confidence in continued growth.

Investors have taken note of this momentum. Palantir shares have recovered from their late summer pullback, gaining nearly 18% and trading close to previous highs at $185. Analysts have set price targets that suggest further upside if the company can keep delivering growth.

AI in the Sky: Why Boeing Chose Palantir

The Boeing agreement shows how Palantir is placing itself at the heart of digital change in defense and aerospace. Boeing will use Palantir’s software to integrate data across its factories and programs. This could help the company predict supply chain issues, make decisions faster, and boost the readiness of its defense systems.

For Palantir, the partnership shows that its platforms can be applied to large-scale industrial problems. It may also open doors to further contracts with aerospace and defense companies worldwide. As more companies use AI-driven analytics, Palantir can grow in industries that need efficiency and security.

Mike Gallagher, Palantir’s head of defense, remarked on this partnership, saying:

“type of partnership that I think has the possibility to unlock transformation within the defense industrial base and enhance deterrence in the near term, not in a matter of distant decades.”

The deal also adds to Palantir’s credibility with investors. Palantir’s tech works well beyond government and niche markets. Their partnerships with big companies show this clearly. Instead, it is proving useful in some of the most complex and regulated industries.

Riding the Wave of Explosive Growth in AI and Data Analytics

The global data analytics software market is growing fast. In 2024, it was worth about $69 billion, and it’s expected to climb to $302 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~28%.

Meanwhile, the enterprise AI market could expand from around $97 billion in 2025 to $229.3 billion by 2030, growing at ~18.9 % per year.

These trends show strong demand for tools like Palantir’s platforms. As more companies adopt AI and analytics, Palantir may benefit from this rising tide of investment and interest.

Behind these financial and market momentum, the AI company is also paying attention to its sustainability commitments.

ESG and Emission Reduction: Palantir’s Net Zero Pathway

Palantir has committed to reaching net zero emissions across all scopes under its 2021 Climate Pledge. The company is working to cut emissions where possible and balance the rest with high-quality carbon offsets. This shows an effort to address both immediate impacts and long-term climate goals.

In 2019, Palantir set a baseline for its greenhouse gas emissions. By 2024, total emissions had risen slightly to about 23,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, a reduction of about 31% compared to the 2019 baseline. This increase of 1.7% from 2023 was due to a gradual return to business travel and operational activities. But overall emissions per employee have dropped 57% since 2019.

The company also achieved carbon neutrality for its UK operations in 2023, covering remaining emissions through offsets.

To support this progress, Palantir is taking these actions:

Invests in better measurement and reporting. This improves how the company tracks emissions from business travel, cloud computing, and employee commuting.

It uses energy-efficient data centers and optimizes software workloads to reduce cloud computing emissions.

For emissions it can’t fully cut, it buys verified offsets and uses sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for travel.

Overall, Palantir’s ESG strategy shows steady progress. While the reductions are gradual, the company is building systems to manage its footprint while aligning with broader net-zero goals.

Flying High or Overvalued? What’s Next for PLTR

Palantir’s path depends on its success in moving from government contracts to commercial industries. The Boeing partnership shows progress on this front, while strong U.S. demand continues to fuel revenue growth.

At the same time, investors remain aware of risks tied to valuation and uneven international performance. The company’s challenge will be to prove that it can replicate U.S. growth in other markets and continue delivering large-scale contracts.

If Palantir succeeds, it could strengthen its status as a top AI-driven software company. This would boost its influence in both public and private sectors. The coming quarters will reveal whether the Boeing deal and other partnerships translate into long-term performance.

As the company looks ahead, success will depend on expanding its global presence, managing valuation concerns, and delivering measurable results from its partnerships. For now, Palantir remains a key player to watch in the evolving world of AI and data analytics.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2556211139.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:57:31.422952

Green Taxi’s founder and chief executive David Valaer describes the Plano, Texas-based company’s technology as a retrofit allowing airlines to taxi jets using an electric motor in the main landing gear, powered by the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit (APU).

Valaer says the Zero Engine Taxi system could help airlines reduce fuel burn from running one or both engines at low thrust on taxiways. He also envisions ”faster, more efficient turns with reduced tug use” and reduced overall emissions.

The start-up claims the system could save commercial jet operators about $300,000 per aircraft annually through less fuel burn.

Delta confirmed the partnership with the electric taxi technology developer last month. It will initially see Delta use its operational experience to help Green Taxi optimise its system for regional aircraft.

But Delta says its big-picture vision for the system’s use ”extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline”.

”The Green Taxi partnership is another example of Delta’s approach to impact what it can control today while innovating future technologies like scaling sustainable aviation fuel and revolutionary fleet development,” the airline says.

Green Taxi Aerospace earlier this year launched a partnership with StandardAero aimed at US certification of the Zero Engine Taxi on Embraer 175s.

US regional carriers Republic Airways and SkyWest Airlines fly dozens of E175s on behalf of Delta under the Delta Connection brand.

Delta also recently added Dutch firm Maeve Aerospace to its technology incubator, with an an agreement to “advance development” of the start-up’s conceptual hybrid-electric Maeve Jet.

The Atlanta-based airline describes itself as Maeve’s “North American airline partner”, with plans to ”lend its operational expertise” in developing the regional aircraft.

Instead, we will make a technological leap forward – generating fuels directly from renewable electricity, in a so-called “power to liquid approach.” Vincent Hodder, CEO of Leeds Bradford Airport, said: “This initiative will strengthen our shared goal of accelerating the UK’s efforts to meet its net-zero emissions targets by 2050.","Leeds Bradford Airport is at the heart of a new £1.5 million government-backed study into producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in a move that could pave the way for cleaner, greener flights.

The funding, awarded by the Department for Transport, will support a detailed feasibility study into creating Power-to-Liquid SAF, a next-generation fuel made using renewable electricity and captured carbon, at or near the airport.

The project was initiated by the University of Sheffield and is being supported by Leeds North West MP Katie White, who has helped bring together industry, academic and regional partners.

Over the next eight months, the study will explore how this clean fuel – which can be used in today’s aircraft without changing engines or infrastructure – could possibly be produced and deployed at scale from a Yorkshire base. If successful, it could lead to major investment and job creation in the region, with the final report due in 2026.

Unlike biofuels, Power-to-Liquid SAF doesn’t rely on crops or waste. Instead, it uses renewable electricity to convert water and recycled carbon into a synthetic jet fuel with a much lower carbon footprint – a technology widely seen as key to decarbonising long-haul flights.

Katie White MP said: “Leeds is built for this kind of innovation. We have the talent, the ambition, and a track record of turning green innovation into real-world impact. This funding is a crucial step towards making sustainable jet fuel a reality at Leeds Bradford.

Professor Piers Forster, former Chair of the Climate Change Committee and Director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, said: “Aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise… current sustainable aviation fuels are made from waste fat or energy crops.

“They are not considered a long-term solution, as making our own would use more than 50% of UK farmland, which we need to grow our food. Instead, we will make a technological leap forward – generating fuels directly from renewable electricity, in a so-called “power to liquid approach.”

Vincent Hodder, CEO of Leeds Bradford Airport, said: “This initiative will strengthen our shared goal of accelerating the UK’s efforts to meet its net-zero emissions targets by 2050.

“Investment in decarbonising aviation will benefit not only our local community but also contribute to the broader national effort towards sustainable air travel and a greener future. We can’t wait to get started.”

Bombardier's Global 7500 Jet Soars to New Heights With its 150th Speed Record, Building on its Industry-Defining Record-Setting Performance Back to video

Article content

MONTRÉAL, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Bombardier today announced that its industry-defining Global 7500 business jet just notched a new performance milestone with its 150th speed record(1), the most ever set by a single business aircraft type. The latest achievements attained by this blazing fast business aircraft include key city pair speed records, such as Tokyo to Los Angeles, Toronto to Paris, New York to London and Hong Kong to Montreal. What’s more, the aircraft averaged a speed in excess of 1,000 km/hr on 20 of its record-setting missions, bringing passengers to their destinations in record time.

Finalizing the proposal would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard delivers on its promises of strengthening U.S. energy security, supporting American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers, and keeping investment and jobs here at home.","WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a lifelong family farmer and a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, led over 45 Senate and House colleagues in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize a rule on imported Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) and hold firm on the proposed biomass-based diesel volumes.

In their bipartisan, bicameral letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the members state such measures would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) continues to strengthen American energy security and support both American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically,” the members said.

In June, the EPA proposed record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in its Set 2 proposal and included a 50% reduction in RINs for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction).

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called ‘used cooking oil’ from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture and manufacturing,” the members continued.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal, saying it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation and manufacturing – particularly in rural communities.

Additional cosigners include Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Michael Rounds (R-S.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).

In the House, the letter was signed by Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Angie Craig (D-Minn.), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Derek Schmidt (R-Kan.), Brad Finstad (R-Minn.), Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.), Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), Don Bacon (R-Neb.), Tracey Mann (R-Kan.), Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), Max Miller (R-Ohio), James Baird (R-Ind.), Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.), James Comer (R-Ky.), Mike Bost (R-Ill.), David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), John Rose (R-Tenn.), Erin Houchin (R-Ind.), Mark Messmer (R-Ind.), Ron Estes (R-Kan.), Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.), Mark Alford (R-Mo.), Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Mich.), Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Rudy Yakym (R-Ind.), Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.), Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.).

Organizations endorsing the letter include the American Soybean Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Oilseed Processors Association and the National Sorghum Producers.

Grassley helped establish the RFS in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and has worked to ensure the executive branch implements the law as intended. In April, Grassley and Klobuchar urged the EPA to restore integrity, stability and growth to the RFS and the U.S. biofuel sector by raising RVO levels for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. The Biden-era EPA set RVOs at levels that fail to align with market conditions and production outlook, which has contributed to biodiesel plant closures in the Midwest.

The Honorable Lee M. Zeldin

Administrator

Environmental Protection Agency

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW

Washington, D.C. 20460

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We thank the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for proposing record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in the Set 2 proposal and for including a 50 percent reduction in Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction). The combination of the strong BBD volumes coupled with prioritizing U.S. feedstocks represents a commonsense approach that puts American farmers first, strengthens domestic biofuel markets, and delivers tangible economic benefits to rural communities.

Soybean oil may only represent 20 percent of the bean, but it accounts for more than half of its value in the U.S. market, and about half of that oil is used to make advanced biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. That means roughly a quarter of every bushel's value processed here in the U.S. is directly tied to biofuel demand. At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal: it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities where oilseed processing facilities are located. This is exactly the outcome Congress intended when it created and expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The Import RIN reduction also aligns with Congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called “used cooking oil” from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufacturing.

For these reasons, we urge EPA to finalize the Import RIN reduction as proposed and to hold firm on the biomass-based diesel volumes in the rule. Finalizing the proposal would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard delivers on its promises of strengthening U.S. energy security, supporting American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers, and keeping investment and jobs here at home.

More sensible New Yorkers did their best to avoid the melee, but New Private Markets dove right in last week and scurried from one event to another to get a sense of the mood at Climate Week, the first since Donald Trump began his second term as US president.

Trump, of course, delivered a characteristically long-winded and pugnacious speech on 23 September at the UN, labelling climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and criticising the organisation for raising the alarm about global warming.

“If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” he said.

Climate Week attendees put on a stoic face as Trump’s combative words hung over the proceedings, but many people present admitted that this year’s festivities had a more subdued tone, saying that the optimism and confidence of previous years had given way to a feeling of quiet resolve.

At the outset in the late 2000s, Climate Week was permeated by rampant optimism that change was afoot. That sense soon gave way to the realisation that a lot of hard work had to be done. This year the atmosphere was described by one prominent manager as “sober”.

As NPM heard from one institutional investor, Trump’s words put a damper on things, but climate investments continue as countries around the world make an inexorable, if halting, advance to a low-carbon economy. Earlier this year, for example, we documented how blue-state pensions were pushing on with climate investment plans.

In fact, as if to underscore the point, Net Zero Tracker released its annual report during Climate Week, revealing that the number of global organisations that have implemented net-zero targets continues to rise. And in the US, Net Zero Tracker found that company commitments to net-zero plans had grown 9 percent in the past year, including new commitments from eBay, Merck & Co and Goodyear.

Not everyone is impressed by commitments. One data centre developer we spoke to scoffed at the notion that companies were adopting new net-zero targets or even sticking to previously announced plans, at least in the technology sector. Tech titans may make all the right noises, they said, but their needs for new data centres to power the AI boom outweigh concerns for the environment. As Microsoft said in February: nearly five years after it announced its “moonshot” sustainability goals in 2020, “the moon has gotten further away”.

Among GPs, meanwhile, some fund managers insisted their firms were sticking to net-zero plans, while others were applying targets on a case-by-case basis.

One fund manager said that 80 percent of portfolio companies in his firm’s next fund will likely adhere to the Corporate Net-Zero Standard from the Science Based Targets Initiative.

Another said her firm had set a target for portfolio companies to reduce emissions by 15-25 percent, but only if it was economical, adding that it was not feasible for an airline, for example, to spend extra for sustainable aviation fuel. Yet another fund manager said their firm does not set specific goals for portfolio companies but does try to put them on a pathway to net zero.

A venture capital fund manager who makes the annual pilgrimage to Climate Week described the “atmospherics” as bad this year, but said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the turnout and encouraged that participants had “not just walked away”.

Perhaps they, like him, were drawn back by the prospects of outsized investment returns. Following a “supercycle” of climate technology investments in the past 10 years, the seeds of innovation are starting to sprout, he said, leading to a deal pipeline “unprecedented in terms of quality and quantity”.

Dealflow is up, valuations are down, and the market is still propelled by macroeconomic tailwinds from Europe, he said. “It is one of the most compelling times to invest capital.”",https://media.newprivatemarkets.com/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-53273228.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 12:56:54.477178

Under the terms of the EU and UK mandates, the fuel suppliers are the obligated parties and are liable for penalties if the 2% target is not met.
Airlines meanwhile, were less than 11% of respondents, exposed to SAF market dynamics but, in most cases, not obligated parties under the terms of the EU and UK SAF mandates.
The UK and EU have a clear SAF mandate, but in the US no mandate exists or is planned, and incentives have been patchy.
And elsewhere, while countries like Singapore and South Korea will introduce SAF mandates, many other states and regions lack clear plans to require or encourage SAF use.","It’s no surprise that the market survey revealed that interest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is most prevalent in the Americas and Europe. This is likely due to this year’s introduction of a 2% mandate in the EU and the UK, which is boosting demand, and the US growing its capacity which Fastmarkets predicts will double from 4 million tonnes in 2025 to 8 million tonnes in 2030.

But while these two regions were of interest to 65% of those surveyed, there is growing interest in developments in Latin America and Asia, with the former seeing key developments in places such as Brazil and the latter becoming a key current and future producer.

Government mandates and incentives were seen as the biggest factor driving SAF adoption, hardly surprising given that the UK and Europe led with the introduction of a 2% SAF blending mandate for 2025, which has cemented this region’s position as the primary demand base for sustainable aviation fuel.

Nevertheless, technological breakthroughs and cost reduction, followed by feedstock availability and sustainability, took the second and third spot respectively.

This was driven in part by concerns about the cost implications of novel production pathways such as alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) and power-to-liquid (PtL) technology, alongside restrictions on the use of certain feedstocks in SAF production and adoption in Europe, where only approved waste-based feedstocks are accepted.

Of the entities surveyed, fuel producers and suppliers were the most prevalent, more than 23% of those surveyed. Under the terms of the EU and UK mandates, the fuel suppliers are the obligated parties and are liable for penalties if the 2% target is not met.

But technology providers (15%) and investors and financiers (13%) were a sizeable portion of respondents with these firms playing a growing role in meeting the production challenges for SAF, with new technologies such as AtJ and PtL proving costly.

Airlines meanwhile, were less than 11% of respondents, exposed to SAF market dynamics but, in most cases, not obligated parties under the terms of the EU and UK SAF mandates.

Following on from the prior indicators, among all participants in the survey, the biggest hurdle to market and operational growth for SAF was indicated as regulatory uncertainty and inconsistency.

The UK and EU have a clear SAF mandate, but in the US no mandate exists or is planned, and incentives have been patchy. Furthermore, an extension of EU trade defence measures to cover US SAF will likely hamper future export potential.

And elsewhere, while countries like Singapore and South Korea will introduce SAF mandates, many other states and regions lack clear plans to require or encourage SAF use.

And beside production cost and financing issues, a lack of transparent pricing and market data was registered as a key point hindering operations and growth, highlighting the continued need for more pricing solutions.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2024/10/Ag_SAF_AerialPlaneRunway_Getty-72664754_Med.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 14:57:18.558719

The project is aligned with Uzbekistan’s national climate ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. By producing zero-carbon fuel at scale, the Khorezm SAF, e-SAF and green diesel will displace fossil fuel use in transport and industry, lowering greenhouse-gas emissions and advancing the country’s green energy transition.

In addition to its environmental benefits, the investment is expected to generate hundreds of skilled jobs and strengthen Uzbekistan’s position as a regional hub for green energy.

“This agreement is a landmark moment for Allied Biofuels and for Khorezm,” said Mr. Alfred Benedict, Chairman and Managing Director “By combining international expertise with local support, we are creating a facility that will not only supply sustainable aviation fuel at scale but also help Uzbekistan achieve its ambitious net-zero targets while fostering economic growth in the region.”

The Governor of Khorezm region, Mr. Jurabek Rakhimov, at a meeting within the framework of the International Investment Forum, expressed his gratitude to the company representatives for choosing the Khorezm region for the implementation of this project. He emphasized that the implementation of this project will further strengthen the region's position as a green energy center, create hundreds of jobs through the investments made, and make a significant contribution to the further development of the regional economy.

IAG invests in OXCCU to accelerate SAF development

International Airlines Group (IAG) has joined the £20.75 million ($28 million) Series B funding round for OXCCU, a UK SAF innovator.

The round attracted new and existing investors, including Safran Corporate Ventures, Orlen and Aramco Ventures, among other backers.

IAG invested through IAGi Ventures, its corporate venturing arm, which committed up to €200 million over five years earlier this year. This represents the largest such investment pledge by a European airline group to date.

OXCCU, spun out of Oxford University, has created a patented process converting waste carbon gases and hydrogen into jet fuel hydrocarbons. The process removes a conventional step, reducing capital and operating costs while allowing use of varied carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen inputs.

The Series B funding will help OXCCU execute its scale-up strategy and accelerate commercialisation of its technology. The raise follows the opening of its first demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport last year. It will also support a larger facility, expected to be operational in 2026, advancing the UK’s SAF mandate and IAG’s decarbonisation goals.

Ignacio Tovar, IAG’s Director of Innovation, said the group focuses on backing companies with meaningful climate impact. He highlighted OXCCU’s technology as vital for scaling sustainable aviation. According to him, IAG helps partners grow faster by acting as early adopters, sharing expertise, and encouraging collaboration across its airline ecosystem.

IAG was the first airline group to pledge net zero by 2050. It also targets 10% SAF usage by 2030. In 2024, 1.9% of its fuel came from SAF, saving 469,000 tonnes of CO2, nearly double the previous year.

,,2025-10-02 12:04:07+00:00,Federation Internationale de l'Automobile,FIA REPORTS PROGRESS ACROSS SUSTAINABILITY AND D&I IN 2024,Not Available,,,,,https://www.fia.com/news/fia-reports-progress-across-sustainability-and-di-2024,"The report shows the federation’s progress since the sustainability and D&I strategy was set out in 2020, and outlines its ongoing efforts to drive sustainable and inclusive practices across motorsport and mobility.
Please see the full report for details on all activities across Sustainability and Diversity & Inclusion in 2024.
It is a non-profit organisation committed to driving innovation and championing safety, sustainability and equality across motor sport and mobility.
Founded in 1904, with offices in Paris, London and Geneva, the FIA brings together 245 Member Organisations across five continents, representing millions of road users, motor sport professionals and volunteers.
It develops and enforces regulations for motor sport, including seven FIA World Championships, to ensure worldwide competitions are safe and fair for all.","The report shows the federation’s progress since the sustainability and D&I strategy was set out in 2020, and outlines its ongoing efforts to drive sustainable and inclusive practices across motorsport and mobility. It reaffirms the FIA’s commitment across both these areas, which remain a top priority for the FIA.

In environmental sustainability, highlights included:

Programmes with the wider community

The expansion of the Environmental Accreditation Programme during the year, which saw an 45% uptake increase from 2023

The launch of the Sustainable Fuel Certification Programme to guide responsible use of advanced fuels in competition

Investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel for the first time

€273,000 granted to sustainability programmes overall

FIA operations:

Maintained commitment to reduce absolute emissions by 2030

Carbon intensity measure fell by 7% year-on-year, despite an absolute emissions increase of 9%

This was against a backdrop of an increase in general activities, revenue and headcount

While the FIA recognises there is more to do, the above demonstrates a positive foundation to build from as it continues the push for decarbonisation and emissions reduction.

In D&I and social impact, highlights included:

Programmes with the wider community

Expansion of Girls on Track programme to new markets

The launch of two flagship initiatives:

FIA Women in Motorsport Mentoring Programme, which benefited 286 participants in 2024 across 79 countries, and has expanded to 445 participants so far 2025

CareerShift, which welcomed 50 students in its first year and has more than doubled participation since

Together, these programmes promote greater inclusivity within the sport by offering young people from different backgrounds and ethnicities the opportunity to connect with and learn from motorsport professionals across the career spectrum.

FIA people

32% of the FIA workface was female in 2024, with almost half of those women in senior roles

Headcount increased by 17% on prior year, with almost half of those new hires being women

The overall employee base comprised over 30 different nationalities across four regions

Alongside this growth trajectory, the FIA continued to improve gender equity practices through its EDGE certification, introduced more flexible working models for employees, and reviewed and improved recruitment and promotion polices and practices during the period

In June 2025 the FIA split its Sustainability and D&I function into two separate divisions, which now report into Willem Groenewald, Secretary General for Automobile Mobility and Sustainability, and Alessandra Malhamé, People, Workplace and D&I Senior Director, respectively. With this new structure in place, and at the mid-point of the 10-year strategy set out in 2020, the FIA will take this opportunity to review its approach to ensure it is driving impactful change against a clear strategy for both areas. A further update on this will be provided in due course.

Please see the full report for details on all activities across Sustainability and Diversity & Inclusion in 2024.

Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President of the FIA, said: “Five years into the FIA’s ambitious strategy, it is clear there is more to do. As we look to the future, I am confident the FIA will continue to play a leading role in facing the challenges ahead, which are significant. Together, with our Member Clubs, partners, and stakeholders, we will drive positive change, not just for performance, but for people, our communities, and our planet.”

Andrew Fraser, Chair, FIA Sustainability and D&I Committee, said: “We strengthened the FIA’s sustainability, diversity, and inclusion foundations to drive meaningful progress across sport and mobility during the year. While there is still more to do, we are determined to focus and lead. Together, these developments reflect our commitment to equipping our Members and the wider community with the tools, opportunities, and oversight needed to turn intent into lasting impact.”​

The plant represents an investment in the future of sustainable mobility and is a key part of Rivian's strategy to expand the adoption of EVs.

The project, which is expected to begin construction in 2026, cements a partnership with the state of Georgia to foster green technology and manufacturing.

“Our Georgia facility will support our global expansion and provide the scale necessary to get millions of future drivers in our incredible all-electric vehicles, both in the United States and overseas.”

The multi-billion-dollar investment is not only a step for Rivian but also a substantial development for the regional economy, framed within the context of the growing green sector.

The plant is expected to create 7,500 direct jobs by 2030. According to an analysis by IMPLAN, the project will also result in nearly 8,000 indirect jobs.

This influx of employment could generate more than US$1bn in labour income annually, supporting suppliers and local businesses in Jasper, Morgan, Newton and Walton Counties.

This development was marked by the attendance of state officials, including Georgia Governor Brian Kemp.

“Today is another milestone in bringing quality, good-paying jobs to Georgians in this part of the state,” says the Governor.

""With today’s groundbreaking, this company is further delivering on its commitment to the people of Georgia and the thousands of hardworking Americans who will work at this facility will see generational benefits for their families.”

This sentiment was echoed by Speaker of the House Jon Burns who noted the project will ""lay the foundation for billions in long-term economic benefits across our state"".

Environmental management in EV production

Rivian plans to build the facility in two phases, with each phase having the capacity to produce 200,000 units annually.

Once complete, the 400,000-unit total yearly capacity will be essential for supporting the sale of American-built EVs in international markets.

The scale of production is an important aspect of making EVs more accessible and accelerating the move away from fossil fuels.

The facilities form part of the Cranfield Hydrogen Incubation Integrator, a hub of laboratories, test cells and hydrogen fuel supply technologies which will be the foundation to bringing about a step-change in the UK’s hydrogen R&D capability.
Robert Abbot, Director of Airport Operations at Cranfield University, said: “Using the ULEMCo hydrogen tug is another step towards the net zero goal for aviation.
In the case of the hydrogen tug we’re pleased to support our colleagues at the National Flying Laboratory Centre (NFLC) who drove the project into life.
Additionally, Cranfield Airport has previously supported the first cross-channel hybrid electric flight and the world’s first hydrogen-electric passenger aircraft flight .","An airside hydrogen electric tug is now in operation at Cranfield Airport, in a significant development which is reducing carbon emissions and helping to prove hydrogen technologies in a working airport environment.

The tug is being used to manoeuvre aircraft and is being refuelled from an on-site HyQube hydrogen refueller, and in future it will be refuelled from a mobile hydrogen refueller truck, the HyTruck, supplied by Fuel Cell Systems. The facilities form part of the Cranfield Hydrogen Incubation Integrator, a hub of laboratories, test cells and hydrogen fuel supply technologies which will be the foundation to bringing about a step-change in the UK’s hydrogen R&D capability.

Built by the Ultra Low Emission Mileage Company Ltd (ULEMCo) the tug is an ex-RAF Medium Aircraft Tow Tractor that has been converted from diesel to electric hybrid running with a 100% hydrogen zero emission combustion engine. That means a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions and other air pollutants as an essential part of airport operations.

Robert Abbot, Director of Airport Operations at Cranfield University, said: “Using the ULEMCo hydrogen tug is another step towards the net zero goal for aviation. It’s easy to forget that airports aren’t just about the planes, and all of the vehicles used on site produce emissions that need to be reduced. In the case of the hydrogen tug we’re pleased to support our colleagues at the National Flying Laboratory Centre (NFLC) who drove the project into life.

“At Cranfield Airport we’re always aiming to be at the forefront when it comes to decarbonisation, whether that’s the hydrogen tug, moving to electrification for Executive Handling Vehicles or offering sustainable aviation fuel as a refuelling option. We’re continually exploring ways to make our operation more sustainable.”

Robert Harrison, Head of the NFLC, said: “The ULEMCo hydrogen tug is an important part of the NFLC’s drive to demonstrate sustainable aviation. Combined with the use of sustainable aviation fuel for the aircraft, and our electric Ground Power Unit, we’re using all available technologies to support airborne teaching and research with sustainability foremost in our minds.”

Tom Budd, Associate Professor of Airport Decarbonisation, who was closely involved with Project Acorn, a hydrogen refuelling trial at Bristol Airport , says that the development is “a significant step forward for airport operations.”

Both Cranfield University’s National Flying Laboratory Centre (NFLC) and the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) already use sustainable aviation fuel for certain flights , which can reduce emissions by up to 35%. Additionally, Cranfield Airport has previously supported the first cross-channel hybrid electric flight and the world’s first hydrogen-electric passenger aircraft flight .",https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/~/media/brand/androidicon192x192.png,N,,2025-10-02 07:56:14.130242

Semielliptical Modification of the Symmetrical Dolphin 0006 Airfoil

Abstract

The original Dolphin airfoil family, invented by Iosif Taposu, has greatly influenced the development and modifications of airfoils. This innovation has led to creating a family of seven hybrid Dolphin airfoils. In this paper, a new symmetrical hybrid semi-elliptical Dolphin airfoil is presented. Using the semi-elliptical modification method, also known as the natural optimization method, a novel airfoil, designated as the hybrid Dolphin 0006 M4 airfoil, was obtained. This modification method involves reshaping the sharp leading edge of the original Dolphin airfoils, resulting in a complete redesign in the nose domain. Numerical calculations of the original Dolphin airfoils for subsonic flow regimes and Reynolds numbers around 6.0 x 106, along with standard roughness, have shown significant flow separation occurring in the leading edge zone even at small angles of attack. As a result, around 30% of the leading edge zone had to be remodeled to preserve aerodynamic efficiency. The fourth and final modification of the airfoil resulted in the Dolphin 0006 M4, selected as the final name of the airfoil. Results demonstrate that the modified hybrid Dolphin 0006 M4 shows improved aerodynamic efficiency when compared to its geometrical counterparts, the NACA 0006 and the Original Dolphin 0006 airfoils. This airfoil is suitable for general aviation applications, and potentially UAVs, alongside other airfoils from the hybrid Dolphin airfoil family created by the authors of this paper. This symmetrical airfoil of small 6% thickness ratio would primarily be aimed for the tail surfaces of flying vehicles aimed for high speed cruise regimes.

Prioritizing Feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production: An AHP-Based Approach

Abstract

As the aviation industry seeks to reduce its carbon footprint, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) have emerged as a critical solution for achieving sustainability goals. The selection of appropriate feedstocks for SAF production is pivotal, given the diverse options available and their varying impacts on sustainability, cost, and scalability. This study aims to prioritize feedstocks for SAF production using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a well-established multi-criteria decision-making method. The feedstocks analyzed include waste oils and fats, municipal solid waste, cellulosic waste, cover crops, non-biogenic alternative fuels, jatropha, halophytes, and algae. The AHP framework was used to structure the decision-making process by organizing the feedstocks into a hierarchy, with the goal of identifying the most suitable option at the top level. Criteria such as environmental impact, economic viability, and technological maturity were considered in pairwise comparisons to determine the relative importance of each feedstock. The results reveal that Waste Oils and Fats (0.32), Municipal Solid Waste (0.24), and Cellulosic Waste (0.20) are the top feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. These feedstocks stand out due to their high sustainability potential and scalability. Their common strengths include efficient resource use and significant environmental benefits, making them key options for advancing SAF production. This study provides a systematic approach to feedstock selection, aiding the aviation industry in making informed decisions that align with sustainability objectives and the scaling of SAF production.

Fast Response Aerodynamic Multihole Probe – Mechanism for Calibration and Possibilities for Measurements

Abstract

Simultaneous measurements of 3D velocity field and pressure is of great importance. Complex air flows exist in nature, as well as in numerous technical systems. These flows exhibit high levels of turbulence, requiring high sampling rates for accurate measurement. Analyzing such flows is possible using optical methods (laser Doppler velocimetry or particle image velocimetry), hot-wire anemometry or spatial probes. The advantage of multihole probes is simultaneous measurement of 3D velocity field and pressure.

The problem with optical methods is that they require laboratory conditions and they are not often used, except in special well prepared cases, on-site.Their advantage lies in non-invasiveness, high sampling rates and precision. On the other hand, standard spatial multiholeprobes are not suitable for measuring flows with high levels of turbulence. Newer generations of the multiholeprobes are capable of these measurements with fewer drawbacks. Integrating fast pressure transducers into the probe handles has enabled high sampling rates. These probes are known as FRAP (Fast Response Aerodynamic Probe).

In this paper is presented five hole FRAP, mechanism and installation for its calibration. The developed half-automatic mechanism for pitch-yaw calibration in the Laboratory of the Hydraulic Machinery and Energy Systems Department, at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering is introduced. Calibration is performed by placing the probe in a known flow field in the nozzle of the wind tunnel with low level of turbulence (less than 2%). Specified pitch-yaw calibration angles should cover all the angles of attack that will encounter during application.

Investigating the Ability of Turbulence Models to Predict Stall

Abstract

A detailed numerical study of the flows around the airfoil NACA 23012 near stall, at angles-of-attack ranging between 12.4° and 16.2°, Mach number M = 0.18 and Reynolds number Re = 1.8 million, was conducted by Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations closed by the commonly employed Menter’s k–ω shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model in contrast to the wall-modelled large eddy simulation (WMLES). All these flow simulations were performed in ANSYS FLUENT on the same, sufficiently refined computational mesh with dimensionless wall distance y + ≈ 30. The comparison of the obtained numerical and available experimental results points to the inability of RANS modeling to adequately capture the flow in the post-stall region whereas it performs satisfactorily in the attached, pre-stall region. Although relative errors of lift and drag coefficients remain within an acceptable range, the numerical stall seems delayed or not predicted at all. On the other hand, WMLES manages to reproduce the expected trend of aerodynamic coefficients, while the actual numerical values appear underrated in comparison to the measured values. Both modeling approaches are critically evaluated with regard to the flow separation phenomenon appearing at airfoils at high angles-of-attack and some conclusions are provided.

Towards Realistic Urban Environment-Based UAV Simulations

Abstract

Up to date information about road surface conditions is a valuable asset that is globally relevant. An efficient system that can collect road surface data allows for targeted and timely use of resources in case of various road surface related problems. The most prevalent use cases are road maintenance planning, emergency repairs and weather effects including floods or snow. Using the data can also benefit road users through enhancing route planning. This study relates to the concept of utilizing a network of UAVs for road surface data provision. While UAVs are more than capable of collecting road surface data, developing a complete system, that can do so safely and efficiently is challenging. To aid the development of such a system, this study focuses on virtualization opportunities through urban environment modelling. Virtually representing road networks in a relevant environment enables more efficient development of the system by reducing cost, risk and greatly improving mission availability and execution performance. The presented methodology is capable of rapid model generation of arbitrary urban regions based on GIS data at a medium fidelity level. The various road surface features (potholes in this example) can be injected into this model and can be detected with UAVs using the Gazebo SITL simulation environment and a computer vision recognition system. The proposed approach demonstrates the viability of further system development within a virtual environment.

Safety of e-VTOL Aircraft Operations in the Context of Maintenance and Engineering Approach

Abstract

Urban air mobility operations using electric-Vertical Take-Off and landing (e-VTOL) vehicles intended for air transportation of passengers and mail within metropolitan areas. Several original aircraft manufacturers and new start-up entities have developed hundreds of e-VTOL aircraft models with various concepts and design architectures. The public expects these air vehicles to have lower operating costs, be less noisy, and be more accessible. Alongside with operational integration of the airspace and the air traffic management system, ground infrastructure development, implementation of vertiports to support the operations, and reliability of communication, navigation, and surveillance systems, this study presents an identification and discussion of future maintenance-related safety challenges. The study reveals that at the stage of initial operations, the most important components vulnerable to failure are the electronic speed controller, elements of battery system, motors, and propellers. Therefore, the original equipment manufacturers intending to obtain type certificates for their e-VTOL aircraft must establish sufficient, reliable Maintenance Planning Document (Maintenance Program) and training programs to adequately mitigate the safety issue. Applying a comprehensive approach and a detailed reliability analysis of safety precautions for e-VTOL aircraft in the context of maintenance and engineering contributes to preventing technical errors and reaching the goal of preserving airworthiness.

Probabilistic-Adaptive Kalman Filtering for Fault-Tolerant Estimation of UAV States

Abstract

A probabilistic-adaptive Kalman filter (pAKF) algorithm for the fault tolerant estimation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) dynamics in the presence of measurement faults is proposed. The proposed pAKF based on the evaluation of the posterior probability of the normal operation of the system, given for the current measurement. This probability is proposed to calculate via the posterior probability density of the normalized innovation sequence at the current estimation step. As a result, faults in the estimation system are corrected by the system, without affecting the good estimation behaviour. The developed pAKF algorithm is applied for the fault tolerant estimation of the UAV dynamics. The proposed pAKF algorithm is tested for the two different measurement malfunction scenarios; continuous bias at measurements and measurement noise increment.

ADS-B System Implementation in Civil Aviation: Benefits and Cyber Security Risks

Abstract

A giant step in the modernization and improvement of the quality of aviation operations is the introduction of the aviation system that relies on satellite positioning technology - Automatic Dependent Surveillance − Broadcast (ADS−B. It operates in two modes: ADS-B Out and ADS-B In. ADS-B Out, the core function for communication between the aircraft and air traffic control (ATC), has become a mandatory global standard. ADS-B In, an optional service, allows the aircraft to receive and display detailed information broadcast by other aircraft in the vicinity. ADS-B is designed with the latest technology, making it suitable for retrofitting on aircraft currently in operation. However, ADS–B transmits information over open and unencrypted protocols, so it can be easily compromised using existing hardware and software: ADS–B can be exposed to different types of cyber-attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing. According to ICAO assessments, the risk of a successful cyber-attack resulting in the loss of human life is relatively low compared to other types of terrorist attacks. However, recent incidents have shown a rising number of cyber disruptions affecting airline operations. While these incidents may seem minor, they are occurring with increasing frequency and could lead to more severe consequences.

Analysis of the Possibility of Measuring the Velocity Field Inside an Axial Fan Impeller Using PIV

Abstract

Although extremely important in the world of science, turbulence is one of the least described physical phenomena. In the world of turbomachinery, it represents an area of great importance to researchers in academia and industry worldwide. Turbulent swirling structures occur inside the fan’s impeller, as well as on its discharge and suction sides. To describe this phenomenon, it is necessary to measure the velocity field in the areas of interest. Various measurement methods are used for this, but PIV and LDA stand out as the most modern non-invasive methods. Taking into account that the mentioned flow must be considered as three dimensional, composed form three components it further complicates the measurement. From a technical point of view, the conduction of these experiments represents a very complex and challenging task. This is a great challenge, especially for the measurements inside the impeller.

In this article, we highlight how Australian airports are opening access to jet fuel infrastructure and the legal issues to consider in these transactions.
A necessary ingredient in the industry's success is SAF suppliers having access to jet fuel infrastructure to supply their customers.
The jet fuel infrastructure is a critical element in the complex supply chain dominated by vertically integrated fuel suppliers.
Jet fuel supply chain in Australia The Australian jet fuel supply chain is complex and comprises both off- and on-airport infrastructure, including JUHI and pipelines on airport land leased by airport operators from the Commonwealth.","The Labor Government's announcement of a record $1.1 billion investment in the low carbon liquid fuel industry signals the importance of opening access to jet fuel infrastructure to facilitate the reduction of carbon emissions in the aviation industry.

To capitalise on this investment, airport operators may consider the benefits of owning and operating their joint user hydrant infrastructure (JUHI). Transferring JUHI ownership to airport operators involves more than simply an asset sale agreement – a new ecosystem of interconnecting contracts and an open access model for its use must be created.

Current fuel setting

Climate change and industry's desire to reduce carbon emissions is reshaping global aviation. Airlines have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and identified that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is essential to achieving this goal. In Australia, SAF will be required for two-thirds of domestic flights and all international flights to meet the net-zero goal; as electrification and hydrogen offer medium-term solutions for short flights, SAF will be required for flights over 1000km.

While today SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of aviation fuel consumed, the aviation industry is working to ensure that the foundations are in place to enable adequate SAF supply at Australian airports by 2050. One of the key foundations is open access to jet fuel infrastructure. Any restrictions to access in the jet fuel supply chain in Australia may pose barriers to SAF supply and lessen competition between suppliers. In this article, we highlight how Australian airports are opening access to jet fuel infrastructure and the legal issues to consider in these transactions.

SAFs are fuels used in commercial aviation which can reduce CO2 emissions by 80%. It contains the same hydrocarbons as fossil-based jet fuel, but the hydrocarbons are derived from sustainable sources. While fossil fuels add to the overall level of CO2 by emitting carbon, SAF recycles the CO2 which had been absorbed by the biomass used in the feedstock. At this stage however SAFs are more expensive to produce and limited in their availability compared to conventional jet fuel.

Recent developments in the local SAF industry include:

Qantas has committed to using 10% SAF in its fuel mix by 2030, and in May this year accepted delivery of Australia's largest SAF import with nearly two million litres arriving in Sydney.

Between March and July 2025, Viva Energy supplied Virgin Australia with blended SAF (consisting of conventional Jet-A1 and a 30-40% synthetic blend made from waste and residue feedstocks) for flights departing from Proserpine, Queensland.

IFM Investors, GrainCorp and Ampol have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to assess the feasibility of a renewable fuel facility, including SAF, at Ampol's Lytton refinery in Brisbane. This project will explore the production of SAF from Australian feedstock and reduce Australia's dependence on overseas fuel imports.

Two of these projects (among others) are supported by the Government's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative.

A necessary ingredient in the industry's success is SAF suppliers having access to jet fuel infrastructure to supply their customers. The jet fuel infrastructure is a critical element in the complex supply chain dominated by vertically integrated fuel suppliers.

Jet fuel supply chain in Australia

The Australian jet fuel supply chain is complex and comprises both off- and on-airport infrastructure, including JUHI and pipelines on airport land leased by airport operators from the Commonwealth. Jet fuel is typically shipped from an overseas refinery, transported to a local refinery by tanker or pipeline, then pumped into the fuel tanks at the JUHI facility via a pipeline owned and operated by a fuel supplier.

JUHI owners are often vertically integrated fuel suppliers involved in an unincorporated joint venture which owns and operates the JUHI. Often the only means by which a new entrant can supply fuel to an airline is to purchase an equity stake in a JUHI joint venture.

Australian airport operators have traditionally not owned or operated the JUHI, but since 2020 the position has begun to change. Below is a snapshot of the fuel infrastructure ownership at major Australian airports:",https://www.claytonutz.com/cfimages/Infrastructure_707x501px copy.webp//public,N,,2025-10-01 21:56:10.046524

If the shutdown persists, work related to federal data reporting, rulemakings and other regulatory initiatives could face delays.

Ahead of the shutdown, many federal agencies published contingency plans that provide insight on how work at those agencies may be impacted in the short term.

The U.S. Department of Treasury indicated the Internal Revenue Service will continue to operate for five days following the lapse in appropriations but has not provided guidance on how a longer-term shutdown might impact operations. Treasury and the IRS are the agencies tasked with issuing guidance for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit. That guidance is currently scheduled to be issued in May 2026. It is unclear if a long-term government shutdown would impact the agency’s projected timeline.

The USDA is expected to furlough 42,256 of its 85,907 employees, equating to more than 49% of the agency’s workforce. Data products and website updates offered by the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service and Foreign Agricultural Service are among agency activities that are expected to cease during the funding lapse. NASS publishes a variety of reports of interest to the U.S. biofuels industry, including monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report, which provides forecasts for corn use in ethanol production and soybean oil use in biofuel production; the monthly Crop Production report, which includes data on corn and soybean production; and the Crop Progress and Condition report, which provides weekly data on the condition of U.S. corn and soybean crops. FAS also publishes a variety of data of interest to bioenergy producers, including monthly export data on ethanol, distillers grains, biodiesel and wood pellets. FAS’s Global Agricultural Information Network also publishes numerous reports that provide insight on foreign markets for biofuels and wood pellets.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration has posted an announcement to its website reporting that it will continue normal publication schedules and data collection “until further notice.” The EIA publishes weekly data on ethanol production, stocks, imports and exports, as well as monthly data on biodiesel and renewable diesel production, biofuel capacity, and feedstock consumption. The EIA also publishes monthly data on wood pellet production, prices, exports, feedstock and stocks.

The U.S. EPA’s contingency plan for a government shutdown indicates the agency will furlough 13,432 of its 15,166 employees, a number that equates to nearly 89% of the agency’s workforce. Numerous agency activities are expected to cease during the funding lapse, including website updates and the issuance of new guidance, regulations and policies, unless necessary for exempted or excepted activities. The EPA publishes monthly data on the generation of renewable identification numbers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard, as well as data on small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions. The agency is also in process of developing rulemakings to set 2026 and 2027 RFS renewable volume obligations (RVOs) and potentially reallocate waived SRE volumes. The RFS rulemaking is currently expected to be finalized in October or November. A long-term government shutdown could impact the timeline for release of the RFS rule and delay the release of monthly RFS-related data.

Government shutdowns are not uncommon. Most recently, the government shutdown for 35 days in late 2018 and early 2019. One thing that is uncommon regarding the current government shutdown is that the White House has signaled its intent to make some layoffs permanent in the event of an extended shutdown.

The White House Office of Management and Budget recently circulated a memo to federal agencies directing them “to use this opportunity to consider Reduction in Force (RIF) notices for all employees in programs, projects, or activities (PPAs) that satisfy all three of the following conditions: (1) discretionary funding lapses on October 1, 2025; (2) another source of funding, such as H.R. 1 (Public Law 119-21) is not currently available; and (3) the PPA is not consistent with the President’s priorities.”

“RIF notices will be in addition to any furlough notices provided due to the lapse in appropriation,” the notice continued. “RIF notices should be issued to all employees working on the relevant PPA, regardless of whether the employee is excepted or furloughed during the lapse in appropriations.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that plans for permanent layoffs are underway during an Oct. 1 press conference. “There are unfortunate consequences to a government shutdown, and the federal government is not receiving any cash at the moment,” she said. “So, the Office of Management and budget has been tasked with looking over the receipts and looking over the budget of the entire federal bureaucracy and…determining what needs to continue to go out the door and what can we continue to keep running and what unfortunately is going to have to come to and end. So, those decisions are being made. And, unfortunately, layoffs are very likely…are going to be a part of that.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2012/11/CapitalOutside_13529376078789.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 20:57:01.904792

XCF Global Inc., a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), announces that it has signed a letter of intent (LOI) with Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator, through its subsidiary New Rise Renewables Reno LLC to explore deploying Posh Energy's flex-fuel gensets at the New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's flex-fuel gensets are expected to be installed at New Rise Reno to convert byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into clean, renewable electricity. Its proprietary reforming and fuel cell platform can process propane-rich byproduct streams and transform them into zero-carbon electricity. In the coming weeks, XCF and Posh plan to publish a white paper outlining how Flex-Fuel Gensets can transform byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into scalable sources of renewable electricity.

By integrating Posh's Flex-Fuel Gensets, XCF expects to unlock a combination of tax incentives that enhances both facility economics and sustainability metrics. Hydrogen produced by the system is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, while electricity generated from that hydrogen is expected to produce renewable energy credits (RECs). When used to power on-site operations, the RECs can be retained and retired to lower the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno's SAF and renewable diesel, thereby boosting the value of the 45Z and LCFS credits.

Alternatively, the electricity and RECs can be sold into the Nevada power grid to serve the growing clean energy demands of the region's expanding data center hub. Located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where some of the world's largest technology companies operate major facilities, New Rise Reno could supply renewable power through wheeling arrangements that help operators meet both regulatory requirements and corporate sustainability goals.

The project is expected to be rolled out in two phases:

Pilot Deployment: Installation of a 100-kW Flex-Fuel Genset to validate performance using New Rise Reno's byproduct streams.

Modular Scale-Up: Expansion of the project through a modular approach targeting a total capacity of up to 10-MW, providing significant upside in both credit capture and revenue growth.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented, ""XCF's mission to lead the transition to carbon-neutral aviation will be achieved not only by producing SAF, but by reducing carbon emissions throughout the supply chain to create a future-proof energy ecosystem. Teaming up with Posh Energy highlights how next-generation fuels and power can converge to deliver impact at scale. Converting byproducts into renewable electricity strengthens our sustainability profile while unlocking new revenue streams that enhance profitability, growth, and long-term shareholder value.""

Wesley Zheng, co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy commented, ""Posh Energy's Flex-Fuel Gensets are designed to convert challenging, non-standard fuel streams into reliable renewable power. Working with XCF at New Rise Reno gives us a first-of-its-kind opportunity to demonstrate how our platform can help decarbonize industrial facilities while supplying clean energy to meet the rising demand from grids and data centers.""

The LOI is non-binding, and project execution remains subject to mutual due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Jeroen Kensmil, Team Leader PID, and Pieter Fontein, Sales Manager at Limax Logistics LLC, explain. Their main focus is the Operation and Business Development of the PID (Petrochemical Industrial Distillation). The PID installation distills (separates) products based on temperature and pressure.

An additional distillation unit called Unit 4 should be added by the end of next year. With these PID Units, Limax Logistics LLC is fully engaged in the energy transition and contributing positively to the major climate challenges.

“Limax Logistics LLC will be able to facilitate part of the rising global demand for SAF ”

Limax Logistics LLC is very well aware that the world needs to become more sustainable at a rapid pace, and that is certainly a challenge for the aviation industry. With the development of Unit 4, Limax Logistics LLC will be able to facilitate part of the rising global demand for SAF. Within Europe, there is a proposal to achieve a compulsory SAF proportion of 2% in jet fuel for all flights within and departing from Europe. “This is the opportunity for Limax Logistics LLC to be there on time and anticipate this development,” agrees Fontein. “Demand will only increase.”

For years, Bombardier’s Challenger 3500 has dominated the super midsize business jet market, winning over fractional ownership fleets, corporate operators, and private owners alike. Its blend of range, cabin comfort, and sustainability credentials has made it the benchmark since its 2021 debut.

Now Gulfstream has responded with the G300 — not a headline-grabbing flagship, but a carefully judged move to defend its flank.

The G300 replaces Gulfstream’s long-serving G280, bringing the super midsize jet in line with the company’s modern portfolio. More than a technical upgrade, it’s a brand reset: dropping the “280” moniker that dated back to the Israel Aerospace Galaxy and repositioning the aircraft against Bombardier’s Challenger 3500.

What’s changed from the G280 to the new G300?

For years, the G280 carried the flag in the super midsize category, while Gulfstream’s development focus shifted to its larger G500, G600, and G700 families. With the G300, the company is modernising its midsize offering and bringing the branding in line with the rest of the portfolio.

Compared to the G280, the G300 offers a quieter, more connected cabin, with Gulfstream’s latest interior design language, including larger oval windows, advanced cabin management systems, and improved ergonomics.

The flight deck benefits from updated avionics and enhanced connectivity, while efficiency refinements allow for lower emissions and full compatibility with sustainable aviation fuel.

Perhaps most importantly, the new name aligns the aircraft with Gulfstream’s broader family branding, a deliberate move to retire the “280” badge and reposition the jet directly against Bombardier’s Challenger 3500.

Bombardier Challenger 3500 vs Gulfstream G300

The heart of the story is the comparison with Bombardier’s Challenger 3500. On paper, both jets target the same high-value niche:

Performance: The Challenger 3500 offers a range of around 3,400 nm, while the G300 is expected to post comparable figures, balancing transcontinental reach with midsize efficiency.

Cabin: Bombardier has leaned on luxury — sustainable materials, advanced seating, cabin automation. Gulfstream’s counter emphasises quietness, connectivity, and signature oval windows for a lighter, more open cabin environment.

Sustainability: Both aircraft are marketed as SAF-ready, with Bombardier making carbon neutrality a key talking point. Gulfstream is highlighting efficiency gains without over-promising.

Positioning: The Challenger 3500 has become the darling of NetJets and other fractional players. The G300 will likely appeal to Gulfstream’s loyal base while giving operators fresh reasons not to defect to Bombardier.

This is not an arms race of range or speed, but of refinement — small margins that matter greatly to buyers in the segment.

More than conquest sales, the G300 looks like a retention tool. Gulfstream has hundreds of customers operating G200s and G280s. Without the G300, many of those owners risked migrating to Bombardier for their next aircraft. Now, Gulfstream has a mid-tier offering that keeps them in the family.

In order to make ethanol for SAF commercially viable, ethanol producers need carbon capture and sequestration at ethanol plants and climate smart agriculture.","The sustainable aviation fuel industry’s biggest players gathered in Minnesota last week to confront the sector’s steep challenges and chart its path forward. At the North American SAF Conference and Expo, held Sept. 22-24 in Minneapolis, more than 300 attendees and 35 exhibitors underscored their commitment to overcoming high costs, limited supply and policy uncertainty in pursuit of aviation’s decarbonization goals. Despite hurdles ranging from high costs to policy uncertainty, the event drew 300 attendees and 35 exhibitors—stakeholders united by a shared commitment to advancing the industry’s ambitious decarbonization goals.

Steve Csonka, executive director of the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative—the event co-organizer, along with SAF Magazine—took to the stage to moderate the leading panel of the show, “The Outlook for American Industry & Agriculture to Participate in Domestic and International SAF Markets.” The panel featured Jim Hileman, vice president and chief engineer, sustainability and future mobility with Boeing; Bruce Fleming, CEO of Montana Renewables; Monte Shaw, executive director with the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association; and Chris Cassidy, national business renewable energy advisor with the United States Department of Agriculture.

During the panel discussion, Hileman highlighted Boeing’s commitment to decarbonization goals. He explained that there are two ways to reduce CO2 emissions in an aircraft. The first is to make sure that the airplane maximizes fuel efficiency. “At Boeing, making safe aircraft as efficient as possible is job number one,” he said. “The second part of decarbonization is about the fuel tank’s contents, using renewable jet-range molecules. Now, the challenge is to get renewables in the tank at a low cost in large volumes.”

Hileman added that in 2026, Boeing intends to have 100% SAF drop-in approval for its planes. He also explained the value of Boeing’s Cascade information tool, which is used to inform policymakers in the U.S. and abroad about the opportunities that are available to reduce aviation emissions. The tool was used in conversation between Boeing and the German government about the challenges facing hydrogen and power-to-liquid fuels mandates. “I highly recommend you go check that out to,” he said. “Because we don’t have hydrogen trees, we do have a lot of agricultural products though.”

Fleming updated the assembly on the state of Montana Renewables 180 MMgy SAF facility, commissioned in 2022. He explained that this facility’s volume is only a small amount of the global volume objectives around SAF, but said he believes that it’s the last SAF plant that’s going to be built until something changes. Around the world, the number of SAF mandates is multiplying, but supply isn’t keeping pace, which could lead to a price short, making the price of SAF go to “infinity,” he said.

However, Fleming said that he remains bullish on SAF due to the potential for human creativity to rise to the challenge in the face of SAF mandates around the world. Montana Renewables’ facility is feedstock agnostic and holds a symbiotic relationship with the ethanol industry because of the low carbon intensity that distillers corn oil ethanol plants provide, Fleming explained.

Due to the expensive nature of SAF projects, long-term, consistent policy and regulations are crucial to continued growth. “We’ve got collectively supportive policy, but we do not have integrated, coherent policy,” he said.

Fleming praised the Greater MSP Partnership’s efforts to build a SAF value chain by pulling stakeholders together locally, contrasting it with the “central planning mentality” employed by regulators, which he said has not kept pace with human creativity.

In his remarks, Shaw discussed the trade and supply dynamics behind corn production, making a case as to why and how there is ample supply for the purpose of alcohol-to-jet fuel. American farmers have been overproducing for the market for many years, he said. Since 1980, the corn yield trend line shows that farmers have produced corn at an increasing rate, nearly four times more than demand growth, not including demand from biofuels. The 1980’s farm crisis was a result of this oversupply, and this year is the worst farm harvest economy that the Midwest has seen in roughly 40 years, as U.S. farmers experience a massive corn crop. This corn needs somewhere to go, Shaw said, and market opportunities such as SAF could help bring prosperity to the Midwest.

Shaw also delved into how innovations are driving up the volume of corn available in the U.S., even as the acreage used for farming in the Midwest decreases. Over the next 20 years, U.S. farmers will produce 5 billion bushels of corn each year that don’t exist this year, he said. Many different feedstocks will be needed to meet SAF goals, he added, but corn could make up 10 to 30 billion gallons of the market. In order to make ethanol for SAF commercially viable, ethanol producers need carbon capture and sequestration at ethanol plants and climate smart agriculture.

In regard to policy, Shaw said the perception he received from Congressional leaders and staffers on Capitol Hill is that 45Z SAF credit value reduction—from $1.75 per gallon to $1 per gallon—within the One Big Beautiful Bill was largely on account of SAF stakeholders not being on the same page—many presented different strategies, he said, and indirect land use change was seen as a priority by agricultural groups’ advocacy.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SAF_Conference_Photo2025_9ca03d1f32.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 15:56:10.593875

Through this collaboration, GPS Renewables will commercialise CSIR-NCL’s patented catalyst technology, enabling one-step oligomerisation of ethylene and olefins to replicate Aviation Turbine Fuel. The project, branded NG SAF, will be India’s first ethanol-to-jet commercial-scale plant.

“We are thrilled to partner with CSIR-NCL to build an indigenous and breakthrough SAF technology that can position India as a leader in SAF production. At GPS, we have always prioritised technology that can fast-track India’s transition to clean energy, and this collaboration reflects that commitment. With NG SAF, we aim to change that,” said Gomatam Ravi, CTO, GPS Renewables.

Overcoming India’s feedstock challenge

Currently, most SAF is produced globally through the HEFA route, which depends on used cooking oil and animal fats. In India, this is impractical due to limited UCO collection and import restrictions. Instead, ethanol derived from 2G biomass will serve as the feedstock for NG SAF, offering a home-grown, scalable solution for decarbonising aviation.

“Scientific research, when coupled with industry collaboration, can create promising solutions to address global challenges. This indigenous technology, named NG SAF, can be a game-changer to decarbonise the aviation sector,” said Dr Ashish Lele, Director, CSIR-NCL.

A world-class team driving innovation

Highlighting the strong advisory and engineering expertise behind the project, Mainak Chakraborty, Co-Founder and CEO of GPS Renewables, added: “The technical advisory team to the NG SAF project is a thing of dreams, all of whom have come together to make NG SAF a reality.”",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/10/01/GPS-Renewables-CSIR-NCL-to-develop-commercial-scale-production-of-Sust.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 14:57:38.451852

Johnson Matthey, a global leader in sustainable chemistry, is driving the scale-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technologies worldwide through innovative platforms like FT CANS™, co-developed with bp, and its HyCOgen™ technology for efficient syngas production. ChemAnalyst spoke with Alberto Giovanzana about the company’s strategy to enhance SAF production from diverse feedstocks, support greenfield projects and retrofits, collaborate with partners such as Honeywell and GIDARA Energy, and expand its role in adjacent low-carbon fuels like renewable diesel, e-fuels, and hydrogen to accelerate aviation decarbonisation globally.

Complete Interview with Alberto Giovanzana

To begin, could you introduce yourself and explain Johnson Matthey’s role in scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technologies globally?

Alberto Giovanzana: I am Alberto Giovanzana, Managing Director Licensing at Johnson Matthey. Johnson Matthey has a two-century legacy of using advanced chemistry and process innovation to solve global challenges. Today, one of the most urgent is aviation decarbonisation. The aviation sector contributes around 2–2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and without meaningful action, this proportion could grow sharply as other industries decarbonise.

We are supporting the scale-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technologies globally, with a focus on two complementary platforms: the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) CANS™ technology, co-developed with bp, and Johnson Matthey’s HyCOgen™ technology, which improves syngas production efficiency by capturing and recycling CO2. Together, these processes make SAF production more efficient, more flexible, and more scalable. Our technologies are already being deployed in large-scale projects in the US and beyond.

FT CANS™ technology is recognized as a breakthrough. How does it improve the Fischer-Tropsch process for SAF in terms of efficiency and scalability?

Alberto Giovanzana: Traditional FT systems have long faced challenges in terms of catalyst degradation, heat management, product purity and limited selectivity, which made smaller-scale deployment difficult. FT CANS™ technology was designed specifically to overcome these hurdles.

• Thermal management: The advanced catalyst carriers in the FT CANS technology ensure efficient heat removal during the highly exothermic FT reaction. This prevents hotspots that damage catalysts, thereby extending operational life.

• Catalyst selectivity: The catalyst formulations are precisely engineered, enabling higher selectivity to long-chain hydrocarbons suitable for SAF while minimising unwanted by-products.

• Scalability: The modular reactor design allows flexibility in deployment scale to maximise the use of eligible carbon feedstocks.

The result is a reliable, economically viable FT system that produces high purity synthetic crude suitable for upgrading and blending to produce ASTM-certified SAF.

With FT CANS already deployed in projects such as by USA BioEnergy and DG Fuels, what tangible benefits are project developers seeing in terms of yields, costs, and reliability?

Alberto Giovanzana : We are seeing clear, measurable benefits from real-world projects:

• USA BioEnergy (Bon Wier, Texas): The facility plans to process around one million tonnes of responsibly sourced forest thinnings each year into 65 million gallons of transportation fuels, including SAF, while capturing over 50 million tonnes of CO2 over its lifetime. This demonstrates both carbon efficiency and large-scale feasibility.

• DG Fuels (Louisiana, Nebraska and Minnesota): These projects, worth billions of dollars in investment, intend to use local agricultural residues under long-term supply agreements. This illustrates how the FT CANS process can be rooted in regional feedstock ecosystems, creating supply chain resilience while also supporting rural economies.

Developers benefit from higher yields, lower costs per gallon, and strong operational reliability thanks to integration with downstream upgrading technologies which Johnson Matthey facilitates through non-exclusive partnerships with upgrading technology providers.

SAF production depends on diverse feedstocks. How does FT CANS manage variability—from forestry residues to municipal waste—while ensuring consistent output quality that meets ASTM standards?

Alberto Giovanzana : Aviation requires fuels that meet stringent ASTM standards. The FT CANS flowsheet achieves this by leveraging a syngas platform which decouples fuel production from feedstock, enabling the use of a wide range of eligible waste- and biomass-derived feedstocks.

FT CANS technology converts syngas into hydrocarbons. Feedstocks include forestry residues, municipal solid waste, agricultural by-products, and even captured CO2 combined with renewable hydrogen. Plants are designed around local feedstocks, with long-term agreements in place, which ensures:

• Consistent quality of SAF via syngas, regardless of input material.

• Traceability and security, with less exposure to global commodity markets.

• This versatility is critical for scaling SAF globally, as it allows regions to build energy security around their own resources.

Scaling SAF is essential to meet IATA’s 2050 net-zero targets. How does FT CANS enable both greenfield projects and retrofits to expand quickly and economically?

Alberto Giovanzana: IATA’s net-zero 2050 roadmap depends heavily on SAF deployment. FT CANS technology helps achieve this by being both compact and modular, allowing rapid roll-out in multiple settings:

• Greenfield projects, where entirely new facilities can be built around local biomass or waste streams.

• Retrofits, where existing infrastructure such as refineries or industrial complexes can integrate FT units to produce SAF alongside other outputs.

HEFA- or HVO-based fuels are recognised to be limited by the availability of lipid feedstocks. By comparison, FT offers a more scalable pathway by tapping into a diverse range of abundant waste resources, which can be used to make syngas.

Feedstock supply and logistics remain a bottleneck. What role is Johnson Matthey playing in supporting developers to secure sustainable, cost-effective feedstock at commercial scale?

Alberto Giovanzana: Feedstock availability is one of the defining challenges of scaling SAF. Johnson Matthey is working with developers to:

• Maximise feedstock conversion potential, optimising processes to local conditions.

• Integrate carbon capture and utilisation, making use of CO2 as a feedstock through HyCOgen™ technology.

• Build partnerships, such as the SAF Technology Alliance with, GIDARA Energy, Johnson Matthey, Honeywell, and Samsung E&A, which is designed to help drive the end-to-end production of SAF from biomass and municipal waste.

As per your PR, Honeywell recently announced its intention to acquire Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business segment, while also collaborating with JM on SAF projects like Bon Wier. How do you view this dual dynamic shaping catalyst innovation, integration, and competitive positioning in SAF markets?

Alberto Giovanzana: Honeywell’s recent announcement of its intention to acquire Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business is completely distinct from the announcement about Johnson Matthey’s SAF customer projects. Discussions on the USA BioEnergy project were part of ordinary working discussions between Honeywell and Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business.

SAF projects such as USA BioEnergy and DG Fuels continue to build on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed between Johnson Matthey and Honeywell UOP in 2024, offering an end-to-end solution for businesses developing alternative fuels from a wide range of feedstocks including municipal solid waste, residual biomass, biogas, and CO2 (captured and renewable).

Looking beyond SAF, how does Johnson Matthey see opportunities in adjacent fuels such as renewable diesel, e-fuels, or hydrogen to complement aviation decarbonisation?

Alberto Giovanzana : Johnson Matthey sees opportunities across renewable diesel, hydrogen, and e-fuels. These can work alongside SAF to decarbonise other transport sectors, build energy resilience, and strengthen the broader net-zero ecosystem. Importantly, FT provides a platform technology capable of producing not just SAF but also renewable diesel, naphtha, and other fuels from the same feedstock base.

Finally, what are Johnson Matthey’s next strategic steps—whether through R&D, global collaborations, or scaling deployments—to reinforce its leadership in sustainable fuels?

Alberto Giovanzana: We will continue to invest in:

• R&D to further enhance catalyst resilience and reactor performance.

• Global collaborations such as the SAF Technology Alliance.

• Scaling deployments through existing partnerships and with leading developers worldwide.

• By combining our science with strategic partnerships, Johnson Matthey is committed to reinforcing its leadership in sustainable fuels and helping aviation achieve its decarbonisation goals.

ChemAnalyst Insights on Jet Kerosene

Jet kerosene is a traditional aviation fuel derived from petroleum, whereas Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a bio-based alternative engineered as a “drop-in” replacement. SAF can be blended with conventional kerosene and used in current aircraft and infrastructure without any modifications. The key connection between the two is that SAF serves as a partial substitute for jet kerosene, helping to lower the aviation industry’s carbon emissions by recycling atmospheric CO2 through feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste.

Jet kerosene spot prices in North America remained relatively muted during the second quarter of 2025, reflecting limited market momentum compared to the previous year. Despite some strength in crude oil prices, jet fuel rates stayed largely subdued due to ample refinery output, high inventory levels, and measured airline purchasing.

In June, the spot price index saw a modest month-over-month increase, driven by seasonal demand and speculative buying, although market fundamentals remained soft. Airline fuel consumption throughout the quarter stayed below prior-year levels, with usage declining in April despite rising passenger traffic, and fuel costs per gallon falling compared to March.

Supply conditions continued to support the market. Gulf Coast refiners reported stable operations without significant disruptions, while steady import flows, particularly from Nigeria’s Dangote refinery and Russia, helped maintain supply balance.

Industry attention is increasingly shifting toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Although availability is still limited, upcoming policy mandates and ESG compliance goals are gradually influencing procurement strategies, creating structural pressure on conventional jet fuel demand.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-01 14:57:45.465494

""Every day that goes by is a day I think we are more and more at risk of losing the world's largest soy consumer,"" said Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer and current president of ASA.

China continues to hold the line with a 34% tariff against U.S. soybeans compared to a 14% tariff on Brazilian beans. China ended September with no new U.S. soybean buys on the books.

""That's tough. It doesn't matter how good you are at producing, if the price is not in the ballpark, that really puts you behind the eight ball,"" Ragland said in an interview with DTN.

Chinese companies, including state-owned entities, also continue to invest heavily in Brazil and other South American countries. The U.S. permanently lost market share after the 2018-19 trade war, and that loss could deepen. ""Where we are now with this current trade war, we risk losing the rest of what we have left,"" Ragland said.

Ragland said he recognizes larger political implications in the disputes with China, but the trade war just gives Beijing an excuse to rely more heavily on Brazil.

WATCHING FOR FURTHER TALKS

Typically, 70% of U.S. soybean exports to China move from November through April. At the moment, prices are not the only issue. Chinese buyers -- much like 2018-19 -- have been told simply not to make offers on U.S. soybeans.

""They have said we're being told we cannot buy your beans,"" said John Newton, executive head for Terrain Ag, and a former economist for the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee.

Seth Meyer, USDA's chief economist, said the lack of Chinese purchases will require U.S. producers to export throughout the full marketing year instead of front-loading exports in the first half of the year. ""The Chinese are not buying from us, and they're only buying from the Brazilians; both we and the Brazilians now need to spread out our export program to all year,"" Meyer said.

Stephen Nicholson, global strategist for Grains & Oilseeds at Rabobank, said China eventually will return to the U.S. market when prices are low enough.

""If they're nothing, they are pragmatic. They will come back to the U.S., because that's where the cheapest price is going to be,"" Nicholson said.

Newton, Meyer and Nicholson each spoke last week on a panel at an Ag Outlook Forum in Kansas City, Missouri.

A day later, Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at Stone X, was on a panel at the inaugural (Barry) Flinchbaugh Forum in Manhattan, Kansas. Suderman said negotiations over rare earth minerals -- an area where China dominates -- takes precedent over ""almost everything else."" To reach a deal, Suderman said, ""We need China and the United States in the same room and right now we are having trouble getting them in the same room for sustained talks.""

Still, Suderman also questioned whether the U.S. would remain a long-term agricultural seller to China. He pointed to Chinese President Xi Jinping's goals of undermining both the U.S. economy and political stability. The two countries' different value systems will eventually lead to more clashes as Xi looks to achieve his goals, Suderman said.

""At some point we were going to lose China as a customer simply for those reasons,"" he said.

BRAZILIAN COMPETITION GROWS

Brazil has increased its soybean production by 52 million metric tons (1.9 billion bushels) just since 2020 when the U.S. and China ended their tariff war and signed the Phase One trade agreement.

The competition with Brazil will only continue. Brazil has millions of acres of grasslands that can continue to be converted to cropland and then produce multiple crops per year. The country also has a cheap currency that allows its producers to remain competitive.

Brazil is aggressively expanding its biofuels capacity as well, Suderman noted.

""We've heard about sustainable aviation fuel, but while we're sitting around talking about it here in the United States, Brazil has decided they are going to beat us and become the world's sustainable aviation capital.""

INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS AN ADVANTAGE

One of the problems Brazil continues to face is long wait times at ports. This could be one reason China also begins looking at buying from the U.S. again.

""That's the big advantage the U.S. has is there is a logistics issue that will move stuff out the door faster than what Brazil could do,"" Nicholson said in Kansas City.

U.S. railroad and highway infrastructure add to the U.S. shipping advantage, said Mike Seyfert, president and CEO of the National Grain and Feed Association, at the Flinchbaugh Forum.

""The biggest competitive advantage the U.S. has right now is the strength and the reliability and the resilience of that transportation system. But I worry that we're getting close to a tipping point if we don't make the investments we need to make in those systems compared to what we're seeing from our competitors,"" Seyfert said.

He pointed to billions of dollars in infrastructure going into Brazil and other South American ports. Most of that investment has been coming from China.

""There is concrete and steel going into the ground in terms of port development, railroad development, road development in Brazil around the clock,"" Seyfert said.

Meanwhile, locks and dams on the Mississippi River built in the 1930s continue to operate without needed upgrades. About 60% of exports go out of the Gulf of Mexico and nearly two-thirds of those commodities get to port by barges. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included roughly $16 billion to upgrade locks and dams, but those projects will take years.

MARKET RATHER THAN PAYMENTS

Government payments also do not make up for that lost demand.

""American farmers do not want to depend on the government for some type of assistance check in order to stay in business,"" Ragland said. ""Those situations are a Band-Aid on a wound. They never make us profitable, they never make us whole and often they don't 100% get into the hands of those who need it most due to various issues.""

China bought one-third of the U.S. soybean crop before the 2018-19 trade war. China's market share of U.S. beans has dropped to about 25% -- before being locked out of the market so far this harvest.

Looking at other prospective markets, Ragland said creating domestic markets such as sustainable aviation fuel will take years to effectively ramp up demand -- and that could focus more on corn demand than soybeans.

""I'm all for SAF and it certainly could help us, but SAF can't possible come along fast enough to fix this problem ... SAF has a lot of potential long term, but there's still a lot that has to be figured out within agriculture and within the biofuels community.""

EYES ON SOYBEANS

The Wall Street Journal editorial board on Monday weighed into the ""collateral damage"" of soybean farmers in the trade dispute with China, noting ""Whoever claimed trade wars are easy to win clearly wasn't an American farmer."" The op-ed pointed out U.S. farmers and Chinese consumers both lose right now, and U.S. taxpayers could be faced with providing farmers with more financial support.

On a lighter note, DTN Political Correspondent Jerry Hagstrom wrote in his newsletter, the Hagstrom Report, about a weekend trip to Massachusetts for a theater festival.

""When I traveled here this weekend to visit friends, I expected to be asked questions about the kinds of things that concern people in a liberal, resort community: farmers markets, food stamps, conservation, programs to support small farmers, such as farm to school sales.

""But to my shock, in bars, restaurants, at a party for an artist and on the sidelines of performances at the Tennessee Williams Theater Festival, when people found out I was an agriculture reporter, they asked what the soybean farmers are going to do if they can't sell soybeans to China,"" Hagstrom wrote.

The Asia–Pacific aviation market is expanding at breakneck speed. Rising middle classes, booming intra-regional tourism, and surging freight demand all point to more flights, bigger hubs, and rising emissions. Aviation has become the beating heart of regional integration — but it also represents a growing climate challenge.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is emerging as the most practical lever to square the circle. Yet supply is tight, costs remain high, and investors still need stronger policy signals. The question is how to reconcile rapid growth with credible decarbonization — without triggering ticket-price shocks or stalling aviation’s momentum.

Manufacturing: From Stopgaps to the Endgame

Near-term: Mature and proven Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) offer an approach to get early SAF volumes online. But the process which uses waste oils and animal fats, is in the view of many (Apeiron Included) neither scalable, nor sustainable.

Informed industry advocates see HEFA as a bridge, not the destination.

Medium-term: Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Fischer–Tropsch (FT) technologies hold more promise. By converting agricultural residues and municipal solid waste (MSW), they align with Asia’s resource profile — especially megacities that already struggle with waste management. Apeiron Energy are key advocates of MSW to SPK, its innovative, scalable, and with a global abundant feedstock.

Long-term: The ambition rests on e-SAF, or power-to-liquid fuels, synthesized from green hydrogen and captured CO₂. This is the gold standard: scalable, low-carbon, and globally fungible. But it hinges on two things: abundant, cheap renewable power, and commoditized hydrogen and CO₂ supply chains. In other words, Asia’s hydrogen economy will decide the region’s SAF destiny.

Policy Innovation: A Region in Motion

Governments are no longer standing still. Five markets illustrate the trend:

Singapore: Mandating 1% SAF on all departing flights by 2026, rising to 3–5% by 2030, with a passenger levy and centralized procurement.

Japan: Targeting up to 10% SAF by 2030, backed by price-gap mechanisms and clearer refinery obligations.

China: Developing industrial-scale projects that could serve both domestic and export demand.

India: Staging a blending pathway starting at 1% in the late 2020s, reaching 5% by 2030.

South Korea: Expected to begin with a 1% blend by 2027, reflecting a “start low, scale steadily” philosophy.

Australia has also entered the frame, publishing Refined Ambitions — roadmap for low-carbon liquid fuels.

Policy Design: Ambition Meets Bankability

Governments face a three-way trade-off:

Environmental credibility.

Economic competitiveness.

Social acceptability.

A workable policy stack can deliver balance:

Soft-start mandates with incremental rises (1% to 10%) to avoid sudden shocks.

Ticket levies to create a pooled fund for SAF purchase guarantees or contracts-for-difference (CfDs).

Producer de-risking tools — CfDs, low-interest loans, accelerated depreciation, and feedstock subsidies.

Flexible compliance mechanisms like book-and-claim, underpinned by mutual recognition of sustainability certifications.

Infrastructure: The Hidden Enabler

SAF must move seamlessly from plant to plane. That requires:

Blending facilities and hydrant system upgrades at major airports.

Intermodal pipelines and QA labs to lower handling costs.

A pan-Asia certificate registry, aligned with CORSIA, to let carriers arbitrage supply and pool demand across borders.

Demand Shaping: Keeping Fares in Check

Unchecked mandates risk ticket-price spikes. Consumers and business cannot and will not accept ticket price shocks. To avoid backlash, governments should pair mandates with:

Corporate and cargo pooled procurement.

Premium SAF options for business travellers.

Caps on levies tied to class of travel and route length.

Transparent disclosure, showing passengers how their contribution funds decarbonization.

Industrial Upside: Beyond Aviation

SAF offers more than climate compliance. MSW-to-fuel (particular reference to PtL) unlocks waste management jobs. Refinery conversions create short-term construction employment. e-SAF catalyses renewables, electrolyser manufacturing, and CO₂ capture.

In short, SAF is not just a decarbonization tool — it is a long-term industrial strategy.

The APAC Roadmap:

Pragmatic, Ambitious, Innovative.

Asia–Pacific could be considered as behind Europe and North America on SAF adoption. But that does not need to be the case. The region has the feedstock base, the demand at considerable scale, and the policy momentum to leapfrog.

The pragmatic path forward is iterative:

Start small, with modest mandates and transparent levies.

Deploy mature technologies like HEFA and co-processing first.

Build registry and logistics systems for regional efficiency.

Invest now in hydrogen and renewables to prepare for e-SAF.

Summary

Asia–Pacific SAF Playbook

Short-term: Existing & Mature Technologies for quick wins.

Medium-term: FT (potentially ATJ) from residues and MSW.

Long-term: e-SAF, dependent on hydrogen & CO₂ scalability.

Policy: Soft start mandates, levies, CfDs, book-and-claim.

Infrastructure: Blending upgrades, regional registry.

Demand shaping: Corporate procurement & levy fairness.

Industrial upside: Waste jobs, refinery retrofits, green hydrogen growth.

By enabling high-value face-to-face connections, we aim to ensure that North America not only meets its SAF ambitions but sets a global standard for innovation and collaboration.
North America has the resources, the policy support, and the entrepreneurial drive to lead, but its success will depend on the strength of its partnerships.","Over the past few years, North America has emerged as one of the most dynamic regions in the global sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market. Federal policies like tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, and growing state-level commitments have accelerated SAF development and deployment. Airlines have made historic offtake agreements, while energy majors and technology developers are investing billions into new production pathways.

Despite this momentum, challenges remain. The cost gap with conventional jet fuel continues to be significant, supply volumes are still a fraction of what is needed, and the race is on to secure reliable feedstock. At the same time, new technology pathways - from alcohol-to-jet to power-to-liquids - are moving closer to commercial readiness. The next five years will be critical in determining whether North America can scale SAF production to meet its targets for 2030 and beyond.

In this context, collaboration is no longer optional; it is essential.

Collaboration as the Catalyst for Scale-Up

The SAF value chain is complex, spanning agriculture, refining, technology development, logistics, and aviation operations. Unlike conventional fuels, no single entity can succeed in isolation. Joint ventures, co-investment structures, and long-term offtake agreements are increasingly necessary to distribute risk and align incentives.

While information on technology readiness, policy frameworks, and market developments is readily available, the translation of this knowledge into actionable partnerships depends on trust and shared objectives. These are most effectively established through direct, face-to-face engagement.

Over the past several years, our events have reflected the evolution of this industry. In the early days, attendees came primarily to “get to know the players” - to understand who was entering the market and what they were bringing to the table. Those meetings planted the seeds of partnerships that have since grown into joint ventures, supply agreements, and investment commitments.

Now, as the market matures, the emphasis has shifted. The need is less about introductions and more about strengthening ongoing relationships, advancing commercial agreements, and tackling shared challenges head-on.

That is where face-to-face meetings deliver their greatest value: creating space for candid conversations, alignment of objectives, and the type of collaborative problem-solving that accelerates real-world outcomes.

Creating Spaces for Connection

Our conferences are no longer just networking platforms; they have become catalysts for industry growth. Delegates come not only to exchange insights but also to move projects forward.

We recognize that senior executives’ time is scarce and valuable. Large conferences can make it difficult to connect with the right person, and busy schedules often mean missed opportunities. That is why we are introducing a new AI-powered Matchmaking App at our upcoming Houston event.

This tool is designed to remove the friction of networking. By connecting directly with LinkedIn, it maps your existing network, identifies relevant new contacts, and suggests high-quality connections based on your business priorities and interests. The result: no wasted time, fewer missed opportunities, and more productive conversations with the people who can genuinely advance your objectives.

For delegates, this means walking into the conference with a clear roadmap of who to meet, when to meet them, and why those meetings matter. In an industry as competitive and fast-moving as SAF, this level of efficiency and precision can make the difference between exploring opportunities and closing deals.

Looking Ahead: Building the Future of SAF Together

Financial Health Analysis

Despite its innovative approach, XCF Global's financial metrics reveal areas of concern:

Revenue Growth: Currently, the company reports zero revenue growth, indicating a nascent stage in its business operations.

Profitability: The EPS stands at -0.02, reflecting ongoing investments and development costs.

Margins: Operating, net, and gross margins are all reported at zero, highlighting the early-stage nature of XCF's business model.

Balance sheet analysis shows a lack of traditional financial strength metrics, such as current ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, which are not available. This absence of data suggests a need for cautious optimism regarding financial stability.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Current trading metrics provide limited insight due to the absence of traditional valuation ratios such as P/E, P/S, and P/B. However, technical indicators offer some perspective:

RSI (14): 30.32, indicating the stock may be oversold.

Moving Averages: The SMA-20 is at 1.36, and the SMA-50 is at 1.39, suggesting a bearish trend.

Institutional ownership is minimal at 1.42%, with no reported insider activity, which could imply limited market confidence or awareness at this stage.

Risk Assessment

Several risk factors are associated with XCF Global's current financial and market position:

Financial Health Grades: The Altman Z-Score and other financial health indicators are unavailable, which limits the ability to assess bankruptcy risk.

Sector-Specific Risks: As a player in the Utilities sector, XCF faces regulatory and technological adoption challenges.

Volatility: The stock's beta is reported as zero, suggesting a lack of correlation with market movements, which may not accurately reflect potential volatility.

In conclusion, while XCF Global's strategic partnership with FlyORO Technologies positions it well within the sustainable aviation fuel market, its financial metrics and market sentiment highlight the challenges of an early-stage company. Investors should consider these factors alongside the potential for growth in the sustainable energy sector.",https://static.gurufocus.com/images/global_logo_twitter_card.png,N,,2025-10-01 10:56:18.655032

Today, Alaska Airlines is investing in a sustainable and innovative future for aviation through Alaska Star Ventures, its venture capital arm.
Alaska Star Ventures partners with and invests in startups whose technologies aim to increase operational efficiency and even change the shape of aircraft.
“Rather than being bystanders, we want to make sure Alaska Airlines is part of driving meaningful changes in aviation,” he said.
A few companies in Alaska Star Ventures’ portfolio: Alaska Star Ventures is also creating technology companies through its partnership with UP.Labs.","At Alaska Airlines, elevating the future of travel means getting in on the ground floor of innovation.

Thirty years ago, Alaska Airlines revolutionized the passenger experience when it became the first airline to offer online ticketing. Alaska was also the first airline to use GPS to guide airplanes, and more recently, Alaska’s flight-operations teams were among the first to use artificial intelligence software to chart more efficient flight paths — conserving fuel and saving time for travelers.

Today, Alaska Airlines is investing in a sustainable and innovative future for aviation through Alaska Star Ventures, its venture capital arm. Alaska Star Ventures partners with and invests in startups whose technologies aim to increase operational efficiency and even change the shape of aircraft.

“We have a very rich history in innovation, and it’s truly disruptive innovation,” said Pasha Saleh, who has followed Alaska Airlines’ technology advances since he was a teen working toward his pilot’s license. Now, after a long career as a commercial pilot, Saleh leads Alaska’s corporate development through Alaska Star Ventures. “Rather than being bystanders, we want to make sure Alaska Airlines is part of driving meaningful changes in aviation,” he said.

A few companies in Alaska Star Ventures’ portfolio:

Alaska Star Ventures is also creating technology companies through its partnership with UP.Labs. The first new company, Odysee, launched last fall; its technology will leverage AI to optimize schedule plans to help put aircraft in the right place at the right time, improving reliability across flight operations. A second startup will be announced this year, and a third company is in development.

“All the companies we look at are developing technology that's completely disruptive to what we could figure out on our own,” Saleh said. Alaska Airlines’ in-house teams focus on continually improving the guest experience through innovations such as streamlining the check-in process, while the venture capital partnerships focus on technology advances outside the airline’s core expertise, with time horizons ranging from one year to 10 years.

“Passengers can be sure that because of the investments we're making, their trip is going to be safer, and it's going to be less prone to delays or misconnections,” Saleh said. “It's not on our shoulders to invent the future, but we want to find the smart people doing it, and give them the resources — not just financially, but also to train them on our problems and work with them to develop solutions first for our benefit, and for the airline industry, as well.”

One big challenge Alaska Airlines has taken on is the need to make air travel a more sustainable business. Alaska’s goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, and much of the technology Alaska Star Ventures invests in is designed to make progress toward that goal. “Our customers really care — and we really care — about being stewards of the environment and the pristine places in our country that we fly to,” Saleh said.

“Alaska Airlines is going to remain on the forefront of this innovation, like we have been with so many things in the past,” said Saleh, who suggested the name Alaska Star Ventures to honor the company’s history of innovation with a nod to one of its earliest names: Alaska Star Airlines.

“As an airplane geek growing up, I would read about this company (Alaska Airlines) that was associated with some of the great innovations in aviation,” Saleh said. “For me, it is super exciting and humbling to be adding to that journey.”

(""FlyORO""), a global leader in digital modular blending solutions for SAF, today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"").

Under the MOU, XCF and FlyORO will explore the creation of a global partnership to help solve one of aviation's biggest bottlenecks: SAF supply chain and blending inefficiencies. As most blending occurs upstream at production facilities, there are limitations to flexibility and scalability. Midstream and downstream infrastructure such as terminals or airports often lack the equipment and certification processes needed for blending. Together, XCF and FlyORO intend to co-develop an end-to-end solution to enable the ready uplift of SAF. By combining XCF's expertise in SAF production infrastructure with FlyORO's patented modular blending technology - AlphaLite™ - designed for flexible deployment either on-airport or pre-airport, the collaboration aims to support cost-effective, compliant, and scalable SAF integration into the global aviation fuel system.

The urgency to deploy scalable SAF infrastructure has never been greater. By 2030, the global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons. As this demand accelerates, next-generation blending solutions such as FlyORO's AlphaLite™ system, an innovative, flexible, and low-CAPEX technology, will be critical to bridging production with airports and fleets worldwide.

This potential partnership aligns directly with XCF's international expansion strategy announced in June 2025, under which the company is pursuing a capital-efficient, modular approach to global SAF deployment through regionally tailored partnerships. The potential collaboration with FlyORO would be expected to strengthen XCF's ability to deliver end-to-end SAF solutions, from production through blending and distribution, across the world.

XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), and FlyORO Technologies Pte. Ltd. (""FlyORO""), a global leader in digital modular blending solutions for SAF, today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"").

Under the MOU, XCF and FlyORO will explore the creation of a global partnership to help solve one of aviation's biggest bottlenecks: SAF supply chain and blending inefficiencies. As most blending occurs upstream at production facilities, there are limitations to flexibility and scalability. Midstream and downstream infrastructure such as terminals or airports often lack the equipment and certification processes needed for blending. Together, XCF and FlyORO intend to co-develop an end-to-end solution to enable the ready uplift of SAF. By combining XCF's expertise in SAF production infrastructure with FlyORO's patented modular blending technology - AlphaLite™ - designed for flexible deployment either on-airport or pre-airport, the collaboration aims to support cost-effective, compliant, and scalable SAF integration into the global aviation fuel system.

The urgency to deploy scalable SAF infrastructure has never been greater. By 2030, the global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons. As this demand accelerates, next-generation blending solutions such as FlyORO's AlphaLite™ system, an innovative, flexible, and low-CAPEX technology, will be critical to bridging production with airports and fleets worldwide.

This potential partnership aligns directly with XCF's international expansion strategy announced in June 2025, under which the company is pursuing a capital-efficient, modular approach to global SAF deployment through regionally tailored partnerships. The potential collaboration with FlyORO would be expected to strengthen XCF's ability to deliver end-to-end SAF solutions, from production through blending and distribution, across the world.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""This partnership has the potential to rewire how the aviation industry thinks about SAF deployment. Blending isn't just a technical step, it's a critical piece of the infrastructure puzzle that determines how fast SAF can scale. By combining FlyORO's cutting-edge blending technology with XCF's global strategy, we're creating a pathway to accelerate adoption, reduce costs, and unlock new growth opportunities for investors and stakeholders alike.""

Damian Mc Loughlin, Chief Commercial Officer of FlyORO commented:

""FlyORO was founded with the mission to eliminate barriers to SAF adoption. Our modular AlphaLite™ system makes blending more flexible, scalable, and affordable. Working with XCF, we can expand this vision globally, bringing smarter logistics and faster SAF deployment to airports and airlines around the world.""

The non-binding MOU reflects a shared vision to accelerate SAF adoption and position both companies as leaders in clean aviation infrastructure. Execution is subject to due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

This project, which would constitute an investment of over €100 million, is framed within the company’s strategy to lead the energy transition in Spain and Europe, by driving infrastructure adapted to new energy vectors.

The project is conceived as an energy transition terminal, designed to progressively adapt to market developments, regulation and industrial demand, and will be equipped to operate with both conventional products and sustainable fuels, such as renewable ammonia, captured CO2, green methanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and other biofuels.

The plans incorporate the development of a plant designed under strict criteria of safety, energy efficiency, automation, and environmental sustainability. It will be distributed across two separate but connected sites, with a total capacity of approximately 165 000 m3 across 22 tanks (atmospheric, cryogenic, and pressurised) equipped to store hydrocarbons, chemical products, ammonia, and CO2.

The proposal would include an Iberian gauge railway loading bay with a direct connection to the national network, the connection of the terminal to two berths for ships via a network of high-capacity pipes and pumps, and loading islands for tanker trucks, in addition to all auxiliary operating and safety systems.

The planned activities include the storage, blending, and dispatch of a wide range of products, like biodiesel, hydro biodiesel (HVO), bioethanol, methanol, naphtha, SAF, and raw materials for biofuels and traditional hydrocarbons. It also provides for the blending of these products, and multimodal distribution.

In the case of cryogenic CO2 , plans provide for reception and storage in pressurised and refrigerated conditions, and dispatch by land and maritime transport, with the possibility of a future connection by pipeline. With regard to ammonia, reception by the same routes is under study, as is the possibility of temporary reception in cryogenic tanks and subsequent distribution by different forms of transport.

This flexible and integrated multimodal logistics infrastructure will facilitate the optimisation of the regional logistics system, improve operating efficiency, and guarantee a secure and sustainable energy supply for Galicia and the northwest of the Iberian peninsula. Given the complexity of the planned infrastructure, and the types of products to be stored, a scaled implementation is planned, with operations forecast to begin in 2029.

This future terminal would turn the Port of A Coruña into a leading logistics hub at national and European level, due to its strategic location on routes to Northern Europe, America, the south of the continent, and the Middle East.

Jorge Guillén, Aviation & Spain Network Lead, commented: “This initiative reflects Exolum’s firm commitment to the development of new logistics infrastructure in Spain, to tackle the challenges and opportunities of the energy transition. The Outer Port of A Coruña offers exceptional operating conditions, with a privileged location, maritime access, and a multimodal connection that makes it the ideal location of projects like this one. Exolum is confident this installation will contribute to the competitiveness of the industry and the Galician economy, fostering the creation of qualified jobs in the construction and operation phase and attracting industrial investment linked to the decarbonisation of the sector and green molecules.”",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/spain-flag-02.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 08:56:27.577541

“From the skills workforce perspective, there's a huge gap.","From wind power and hydrogen to decarbonised aviation, projects aimed at making that happen were front and centre at IMechE Focus: Sustainability and Decarbonisation (8-12 September), a webinar series sharing cutting edge expertise from industry and academia.

Here are key messages from three of the six sessions.

‘Radical’ solutions needed for aviation emissions

In 2019, air transport was responsible for about 900 megatonnes (million tonnes) of carbon emissions. That represents 2.1% of CO2 emissions from all human sources, said Dr Ken Hart from the University of Hertfordshire, speaking at Aero 2050 – Flying More Sustainably.

That amount could skyrocket due to increased demand, however, despite gradual improvements to fuel efficiency. “We’ve got to do something more radical,” said Dr Hart, who shared analysis of trends up to 2050.

Greener energy sources could include batteries, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but each have their own drawbacks, from low energy density and feedstock availability to storage challenges.

With supply unlikely to meet demand by 2050, Dr Hart suggested that engineers aim even higher. “You're going to need aircraft configured with a variety of fuels, propulsion systems, and that will depend on the distance they're flying and how many people they carry,” he said.

“Those fuels will consist of battery-electric, hybrid – which is a mixture of hydrogen, perhaps, and battery-electric, or battery-electric and standard gas turbines – and the sustainable aviation fuel.

“So the key challenge is really a development certification of new aircraft fuels and propulsion systems, and the production of these sustainable fuels in quantities needed to meet the future demand.”

It’s time to build the hydrogen workforce

The hydrogen economy of the future could have a huge number of jobs, according to George Jenkins, project leader for the Hydrogen Skills Alliance (HSA) – but they might not fall into simple categories. “When we talk about hydrogen, we're not just talking about one specific sector that needs focusing on. It really is a huge mix,” he said.

Other challenges include uncertainty around the total workforce demand and how the technology will evolve. “We still don't know 100% how current roles are going to be impacted,” Jenkins said. “Additionally, there's a huge amount of competition for the sorts of skillsets that people working in hydrogen might need; competition from other sectors, from oil and gas, from wind.”

One thing is clear, however – a skilled workforce will be needed. Earlier this year, the HSA launched a strategic plan with four main points. “Firstly, we need to understand what the problem is, what the likely demand is, what's already out there. We then need to maximise what's already there.” The next steps are analysing gaps in provision and developing a new curriculum, followed by positioning hydrogen as an aspirational career destination.

The alliance is starting to make that happen with the development of a new framework, which breaks down the roles that might be affected by hydrogen, such as aerospace engineers. The organisation conducted research with industry to understand the roles and the skills they will need in future. That can then be used by industry to understand what should be included in qualifications.

The HSA is also launching the Hydrogen Skills Accelerator programme in the South West and North West of England, which aims to develop open-source training content for the UK hydrogen workforce.

It’s not going to be easy – but there are opportunities to take

Skills gaps, investment uncertainty, policy implementation – industrial decarbonisation is far from easy. A cross-industry panel explored those challenges, and how they might be tackled through effective use of industrial clusters, sector coupling and new technologies.

“Collectively, all the developers, investors and government policymakers need to create a friendly and also high-growth opportunity environment for the workforce, allow them to stay in the energy transition sector and support long-term growth,” said Dr Shengke Zhi from AtkinsRéalis.

“From the skills workforce perspective, there's a huge gap. So that also means an opportunity for all people – if you have transferable skills, if you have aspirations supporting energy transition, we can guarantee there is a big opportunity for you. You can then have a long-term career in the energy transition market.”

results of its inaugural 2025 Annual Contrails Report, further verifying the impact of contrails on global

warming, as both organisations continue to raise awareness of the CO2 and non-CO2 impact of business

aviation on climate change and urge all commercial airlines to immediately publish their own

transparent contrail analysis reports.

Contrails are long thin lines of cloud, usually seen behind an aircraft and are a product of aircraft engine

emissions interacting with the right combination of temperature and humidity in the upper atmosphere.

Depending on the location and time of day, long-lasting or “big-hit” contrails can have an outsized

warming impact, trapping and absorbing heat that otherwise would radiate back into space. Research

conducted by the European Commission indicates that contrails and non-CO₂ emissions are currently

responsible for about twice as much warming as the CO2 emitted by aviation. Recent estimates from the

University of Cambridge Aviation Impact Accelerator, show that contrails cause about the same amount

of warming each year as all the CO₂ emitted by all flights from 1945 to 2018.

Toby Edwards, co-CEO at Victor stated: “One misconception is that private jets fly above contrail regions,

our report proves this isn’t always the case. We want our private jet clients to have the option to avoid

contrail formation by choosing progressive operators that are proactively making small adjustments to

their flight paths to avoid contrail-forming regions, thereby lowering their environmental

impact. Operators that are working on contrail avoidance using smart flight management software,

which is already readily available, would be transparently recommended to clients. Such an offering

would be a natural extension to our existing product, which includes aircraft estimate fuel-burn data and

Neste sustainable aviation fuel.”

Victor’s transparent Contrails Report, the first of its kind from a private jet charter broker, and set to be

republished annually, analysed 2,987 flights across a mixed fleet worldwide. The findings revealed that

just 1% of contrails accounted for 48% of total warming impact, highlighting how a small number of

high-impact contrails are disproportionately responsible for climate effects, which demonstrates that

meaningful change is achievable by targeting specific flight profiles.

A similar previous study by 4AIR also showed the concentration of a majority of the contrail impact

emerging from a small minority of flights, underscoring the opportunity to cut climate impact

substantially by addressing just a fraction of flights.

Results from the comprehensive analysis by 4AIR, who used the open-source Contrail Cirrus Prediction

model from Contrails.org and hindcast weather data plus ADSB data within a flight, shines the spotlight

on the non-CO2 impact of Victor’s charter flights and highlights the alarming impact of contrails by the

growing commercial airline sector, reinforcing calls to accelerate the deployment of known mitigation

techniques that could quickly reduce these effects.

Kennedy Ricci, President of 4AIR points out this is an industry wide aviation issue, not isolated to

business aviation. “Avoiding atmospheric regions likely to create big hit contrails represents a very large

opportunity to reduce the impact from aviation. But effectively mitigating these regions will require proactive flight planning by operators as well as coordination with Air Traffic Control. As we look at meeting aviation’s climate goals, it is critical to raise awareness of both the impact and opportunity of non-CO2 impacts and encourage operators to understand their contrail footprint”.

Weisler, former CEO of HP Inc., has relied on the Most Advanced Single for many years: the PC-12 PRO is his fourth PC-12.
In the PC-12 PRO, you’ve got the new ‘Safety Autoland’ emergency function — which I think is absolutely invaluable.
Weisler couldn’t pass up the opportunity to fly his PC-12 PRO back to Australia himself, together with one of the Pilatus pilots.
The PC-12 PRO is the latest version of the world’s best-selling single-engine turboprop in its category.","The Pilatus Advanced Cockpit Environment ACE, based on the Garmin G3000 Prime, is at the heart of the new PC-12 PRO.

Following on from the launch of the new model in spring 2025, the very first customer, Dion Weisler, recently took delivery of his brand-new aircraft and personally flew it home from Switzerland to Australia.

Weisler, former CEO of HP Inc., has relied on the Most Advanced Single for many years: the PC-12 PRO is his fourth PC-12. Having previously owned a PC-12 NG and two PC-12 NGXs, his move to the PC-12 PRO is a clear sign of his long-standing faith in one of the best-performing aircraft in its category.

“To me as a pilot, you rely on two things in particular: there’s the airplane, and then there’s the pilot. And if something happens to the pilot, what are your options? In the PC-12 PRO, you’ve got the new ‘Safety Autoland’ emergency function — which I think is absolutely invaluable. It keeps my family, my friends and anyone else on board safe. If something happens to me, this system automatically takes control to get the aircraft back on the ground at the nearest airport. You can’t put a price on that additional peace of mind,” said Weisler.

Weisler couldn’t pass up the opportunity to fly his PC-12 PRO back to Australia himself, together with one of the Pilatus pilots. The total flight time of 41 hours was split across six days, which saw them leave from Switzerland, and fly via Crete, Egypt, Oman, India, Malaysia, Bali, and Darwin, before arriving “home” in Adelaide, South Australia.

“It was an incredible learning opportunity to fly your own aircraft home over such a vast distance with a factory pilot sitting right seat. In addition to visiting all these amazing countries, it really allowed me to consolidate the crossover training within the new Garmin cockpit environment, and have someone right there to ask any questions about anything that popped up. I am thrilled to own this new intuitive and highly innovative aircraft, and look forward to flying many missions in the future with it.”

“Every decision behind the PC-12 PRO was driven by one question: How do we create more value for our customers? From enhanced cockpit technologies to refined comfort and performance, the PC-12 PRO reflects the voices of those who fly it. It is the result of listening, learning, and delivering – a new aircraft shaped entirely around the people at the heart of Pilatus,” said André Zimmermann, vice-president, Business Aviation.

The PC-12 PRO is the latest version of the world’s best-selling single-engine turboprop in its category.

Equipped with the Garmin G3000 Prime and a completely redesigned cockpit which includes five high-resolution touchscreen displays, it offers state-of-the-art technology and comfort, coupled with a suite of new safety features which includes Safety Autoland. In a nutshell, it is The Most Advanced Single.

In a single-engine aircraft, a proven engine is the most important component. Fortunately, the PC-12 PRO is equipped with the latest version of the most reliable aircraft engine ever produced – the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6.

With over 60,000 engines in use and over 400 million flight hours, the PT6 family of engines has an unrivalled track record. The PT6 engine has already been successfully tested in over 11 million flight hours with the PC-12. Like its predecessor, the PC-12 PRO is also capable of operating with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which enables more sustainable flying at a consistently high level of performance.

In combination with the fully automatic Electronic Propeller and Engine Control System (EPECS), the digital thrust control – or autothrottle system – reduces pilot workload, increases fuel efficiency, ensures a smoother flight experience and protects against engine overload.

The round saw participation from new investors including Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), and Hostplus, alongside continued support from Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

The funds will support OXCCU’s commercialization efforts, expand operations, and advance the next phase of its technology scale-up. This follows the 2024 launch of its OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport, with the second demonstration plant, OX2, expected to be fully operational in 2026.

“The successful funding shows that investors are backing technologies with real potential to make a difference,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “Our goal is to make SAF more affordable and accessible, helping the aviation sector decarbonize at scale.”

OXCCU’s patented iron-based catalyst simplifies SAF production by converting gaseous waste carbon directly into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons in a single reaction, eliminating costly intermediate steps. The technology works with a range of input gases, including reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and carbon dioxide with hydrogen, lowering both operating costs and carbon intensity.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG, highlighted the strategic importance of the investment: “Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 requires new fuels. This investment in OXCCU supports our commitment to meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030 and helps develop next-generation fuels.”

Ireneusz Fafara, President of ORLEN, added: “Supporting OXCCU aligns with our goal of becoming a leading SAF producer in Europe by 2035. Their technology helps us produce renewable fuels and move toward carbon neutrality.”

Nathalie Stubler, Chief Sustainability Officer at Safran, said: “We support scaling promising SAF technologies alongside our own decarbonization efforts in engines and aircraft systems.”

Daniel Goldman of Clean Energy Ventures noted OXCCU’s rapid progress: “In just a few years, OXCCU has gone from lab to commercial demonstration, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost.”

Dr. Robert Trezona from IP Group added: “This funding is a milestone for the SAF sector and demonstrates the UK’s ability to turn world-class science into solutions that decarbonize aviation while creating jobs.”

OXCCU’s technology also has potential applications beyond aviation, including the production of chemicals and plastics. Symes emphasized the urgency: “The climate challenge is increasing.

There is an additional pyrolysis oil capacity of more than 300,000 tonnes/year under construction or undergoing commissioning.","The second half of 2025 could see renewed investment in chemical recycling after the EU set out its approach to mass-balance accounting in early July. But what effect will these new rules actually have in practice, and is there still room for additional changes? ICIS’ Mark Victory tells us more.

The EU has proposed a fuel-exempt approach to pyrolysis oil, and a consultation period on these proposals ended on 19 August.

The Commission is currently conducting a review before presenting a final draft to its technical, with the aim of adopting the proposals under an implementing decision in Autumn 2025. The extent of any changes to the SUPD proposals resulting from the consultation is currently unclear.

The lack of clarity over the EU’s approach had delayed some investment decisions in 2024 and H1 2025.

Nevertheless, while this goes some way to clarifying one of the key regulatory uncertainties facing the market, there remain areas of legislative doubt that continue to negatively impact demand and investment decisions. These include:

Definitions of waste and recycling under Directive 2008/98/EC - also known as the Waste Framework Directive – which forms the basis of the majority of EU recycling legislation definitions

The End-of-life Vehicles Regulation (ELVR) and whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards proposed targets, and what those proposed targets will be

Whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) targets

This was underscored on 5 August by OMV, whose CEO told ICIS that it needs a more secure regulatory environment before it is willing to risk further investment in scaling up its chemical recycling facilities.

With Europe the first region to detail its approach to mass-balance accounting, there are also concerns over the impact of a fuel-exempt approach on cost-competitiveness with other regions – should they adopt more lenient mass-balance accounting practices such as free-allocation – along with the negative impact on profitability domestically compared with a free-allocation approach.

Legislation surrounding renewable fuels, meanwhile, enjoys greater clarity, and targets under legislation such as the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) III and the Fit for 55 package are encouraging the use of pyrolysis oil as fuel (under the Fit for 55 package fuel derived from plastic waste can count towards targets such as those for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) provided it meets certain criteria such as demonstrating emissions reduction).

This continues to encourage tyre-based pyrolysis oil producers to separate out bio-attributed content and polymer content in pyrolysis oil production, with bio-attributed content attracting premiums compared with polymer-derived tyre-based pyrolysis oil. This is a trend expected to continue in H2 2025 and further in to the mid term.

The wider investment climate remains challenging, particularly given the consolidation of cracker volumes in Europe. Nevertheless, despite both regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainty, investment into pyrolysis oil continues, and brand owners still see pyrolysis oil as a key solution for mass-scale food-contact recycled packaging.

Prices have proved resilient so far in 2025 to the wider macroeconomic malaise afflicting the European chemical sector – particularly for plastic-derived grades - which is at least in part due to structural shortages.

Pyrolysis is expected to be the world’s largest chemical recycling technology by capacity. Europe has a current plastic-derived pyrolysis oil installed input capacity of approximately 150,000 tonnes/year, according to the ICIS Recycling Supply Tracker - Chemical. There is an additional pyrolysis oil capacity of more than 300,000 tonnes/year under construction or undergoing commissioning.

A number of pyrolysis oil plant start-ups have faced delays in 2023-2025 as a result of:

Access to suitable quality waste

Challenges managing the variability of feedstock properties

Delays in environmental permits

Longer than expected commissioning phases for process optimization

Negative macroeconomic conditions creating financing challenges and changing cost structures

This has created a challenge for upstream recycled agglomerate players. Many waste managers have added agglomeration capacity in recent years with a view to serving the burgeoning pyrolysis oil market.

Nevertheless, plant start-up delays has meant the while agglomeration capacity has come onstream, the pyrolysis oil capacity this feedstock was intended to serve has not. This has meant a reduction in investment in agglomeration, and some lines being idled.

There are concerns that this could create challenges for the pyrolysis oil industry as it grows, with access to sufficient high quality waste continuing to be seen as one of the core potential barriers to market scale.

Players continue to expect demand to scale up for pyrolysis oil – particularly plastic-derived grades – in the next 12-24 months, but expect a more rapid increase in supply and demand from 2027-2028 as players gear up to meet voluntary and regulatory recycling targets for 2030.

This new capital will enable OXCCU to accelerate its commercialisation efforts, expand its operations, and advance its next phase of technology scale-up. It builds on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Its second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale. OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said: ""We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of ORLEN, said: “We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year, we introduced SAF – sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials – into our offering. In line with our strategy, by 2035 we aim to become one of the leading producers of SAF in Europe. Supporting the achievement of this goal is a new investment by ORLEN VC in the technology of OXCCU, a company enabling the conversion of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic aviation fuel. Its commercialisation will strengthen our market competitiveness and support our pursuit of carbon neutrality.”

Nathalie Stubler, Safran Chief Sustainability Officer comments: “At Safran, we are committed to advancing the decarbonisation of aviation. In addition to the development of new technologies in our own products such as engines and aircraft equipment, we are also supporting the de-risking and industrial scale-up of the most promising sustainable aviation fuel technologies.”

Daniel Goldman, Managing Partner and Co-Founder of Clean Energy Ventures, said: ""OXCCU stands out not only for its differentiated technology but also for the speed of its progress toward commercial plants. In just a few years, the company has advanced from the lab to a commercial demonstration facility, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost. That rapid progress is reshaping the sustainable aviation fuel market, unlocking the affordability aviation needs to decarbonise.

Immingham site to be flagship SAF Plant

Altalto is based in North Lincolnshire. They aim to transform waste into sustainable, advanced biofuels. They use a mix of commercial and household waste to produce clean biofuels that reduce greenhouse emissions.

The award will enable Altalto to integrate two technologies into its waste-to-SAF process.

The first is NEXTCHEM’s NX Circular gasification: a process which converts waste materials into a synthesis gas. The other is NX CPO, a catalytic process which provides a low-carbon solution to producing synthetic gas.

The integration of new technology will make the Immingham plant the most advanced SAF site in the UK.

Altalto has reported that it will produce 30 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel each year. This achievement will support the UK in achieving its SAF mandate. The mandate requires 10% of jet fuels to have sustainable origins by 2030.

Who are Altalto?

Altalto has developed a plan for the UK’s first commercial waste-to-sustainable fuel plant. The plant, once fully operational will take over 500,000 tonnes of household and commercial waste and convert it into 60 million litres of sustainable fuel each year. This will replace the current disposal process of sending to landfill or incineration.

Altalto combine several technologies in an effort to deliver a more cost-effective supply of sustainable energy. There is a focus on the product being acceptable for use for long-haul air travel due to the reliance on liquid fuels.

The new plant will save 80,000 tonnes of CO2 waste per year, reducing greenhouse gases. It will also bring 100 long term employment opportunities to the local area.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/home-image-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 06:56:57.804791

If strong climate measures are not implemented, emissions will more than double during the long-term planning period. However, with robust measures, much of the increase can be avoided, even as the Armed Forces grow significantly.

Climate change is a serious threat to the Armed Forces and NATO, so the Armed Forces have a vested interest in reducing emissions as much as possible. Moreover, climate measures can contribute to increased combat capability and improved adaption to future combat environments – if done correctly. For example, climate-friendly energy and fuel technologies may enhance the Armed Forces’ energy and supply security. At the same time, it must be assessed whether new vulnerabilities and risks arise. Climate-adapted defensive forces could save operational costs related to fuel and climate taxes, especially in the long term. However, that path may be more expensive in the short and medium term. Therefore, thorough assessments of possible climate measures in the Armed Forces are needed, where climate impact, economics, and operational capability are considered together. A climate budget can support this.

A climate budget is a management tool for cutting emissions. It is reminiscent of a financial budget, but instead of money, it deals with emissions – and how to reach specific climate goals. The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) has been tasked with developing a climate budget for the defence sector, and this report documents our initial results.

However, creating such a climate budget is not enough. The knowledge FFI has gathered here – and will continue to gather in the coming years – will only contribute to a real green transition if followed up with decisions and actions.

In this report, we have modelled the Armed Forces’ future greenhouse gas emissions. Both direct and indirect emissions could increase significantly if no measures are taken. We have thus examined three initiatives to reduce these emissions: 1) the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), 2) climate assessments in the concept phase, and 3) zero-emission technology on new standard vessels. All three measures can lead to significant emission reductions, and we recommend the sector proceed with them. Nevertheless, these will not be sufficient to meet the sector’s own climate goals. Additional measures will be needed.

We also present a selection of success criteria for implementing a climate budget in the defence sector. These include integrating climate efforts more closely into investment and budgeting processes, creating ownership and anchoring, ensuring sufficient resources and organization, and building competence and communication.

Finally, we point to areas that require further work. The projections can be improved. There is a need to develop tools that make it easier to use the climate budget in practice. FFI is planning a study on how SAF can strengthen supply preparedness, and we aim to delve deeper into climate-economic issues that may be relevant for the defence sector.",https://www.ffi.no/en/publications-archive/er-det-mulig-a-ruste-opp-forsvaret-pa-en-klimavennlig-mate-forsvarssektorens-klimabudsjett-2025/_/image/81842178-6336-4e3b-8aa5-9d84a92041ca:4dc6adec38f0d7aed0fc61b0513eefb79a74b502/block-1200-630/FFI_SEO-bilde_m%C3%B8rk.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 06:57:07.976682

‍OXCCU, the Oxford University spin-out developing a one-step process to convert waste carbon into SAF, has raised £20.75 MM ($28 MM) in an oversubscribed Series B funding round. The round includes new investors Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), Hostplus, and TCVC, alongside continued support from existing backers Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

This new capital will enable OXCCU to accelerate its commercialization efforts, expand its operations, and advance its next phase of technology scale-up. It builds on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. The second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonization at scale. OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said: ""We recognize the need for the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of ORLEN, said: “We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year, we introduced SAF—sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials—into our offering. In line with our strategy, by 2035 we aim to become one of the leading producers of SAF in Europe. Supporting the achievement of this goal is a new investment by ORLEN VC in the technology of OXCCU, a company enabling the conversion of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic aviation fuel. Its commercialization will strengthen our market competitiveness and support our pursuit of carbon neutrality.”

Nathalie Stubler, Safran Chief Sustainability Officer comments: “At Safran, we are committed to advancing the decarbonization of aviation. In addition to the development of new technologies in our own products such as engines and aircraft equipment, we are also supporting the de-risking and industrial scale-up of the most promising sustainable aviation fuel technologies.”

Daniel Goldman, Managing Partner and Co-founder of Clean Energy Ventures, said: ""OXCCU stands out not only for its differentiated technology but also for the speed of its progress toward commercial plants. In just a few years, the company has advanced from the lab to a commercial demonstration facility, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost. That rapid progress is reshaping the sustainable aviation fuel market, unlocking the affordability aviation needs to decarbonize. With the extraordinary leadership team and support of its strategic investors, we are confident OXCCU will lead the decarbonization of fuels and chemicals in the coming years.""

The Department for Transport (DfT) has provided £1.5m for a feasibility study looking at whether sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from elements of carbon dioxide and water could be manufactured at the Yeadon-based airport.
The eight-month study will look at whether the the energy, known as Electrolysis Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF), could be made and then used at LBA to power aircraft.

The Department for Transport (DfT) has provided £1.5m for a feasibility study looking at whether sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from elements of carbon dioxide and water could be manufactured at the Yeadon-based airport.

SAFs are man-made alternatives to fossil fuels and are typically created from plant oils or household waste.

The eight-month study will look at whether the the energy, known as Electrolysis Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF), could be made and then used at LBA to power aircraft.

The study is being delivered by the University of Sheffield in partnership with the airport and with support from academics at the University of Leeds.

While SAFs still release carbon when burned by aircraft, as the fuel is recycled it will not be adding to the overall load of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

LBA Chief Executive Vincent Hodder said: ""I know this sounds like science fiction, but it is just science.

""The only ingredients that go into eSAF are electricity, water and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

""All of that is available locally and then all we have to do is transport the liquid to the aircraft and you've got a completely circular carbon movement.""

Leeds North West MP Katie White, who campaigned for the study, said: ""This funding is a crucial step towards making sustainable jet fuel a reality at Leeds Bradford.

""It's about cutting emissions in one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, and creating the skilled jobs and investment that come with it.

""I'm proud to see our region leading the way.""

If the study is deemed a success, a production facility powered by green electricity could be built at the airport to extract carbon elements from the air alongside hydrogen elements from water. These would then be recombined to create the eSAF.

Transport and Environment, a campaign group which lobbies for clean energy and fuel, has welcomed the news but warned there was a ""mountain to climb"" to ""create enough SAF to satisfy the UK aviation industry"".

Roger Tyers, the group's UK aviation policy manager, said: ""We think this is the future for aviation but these kind of fuels are still in their infancy.

""The tech is proven but we don't have any being developed on a large commercial scale yet.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/93b4/live/48ec56c0-995a-11f0-af33-e32b3939e8ca.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 06:57:15.322675

Sheldon Hee, IATA Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific, emphasised that aviation contributes approximately US$14.4 billion (RM68.1 billion) annually and supports over 650,000 jobs, including 100,000 direct aviation roles.

Hee stressed the importance of policies that avoid negative impacts on airlines and passengers, particularly concerning taxes, levies, and security-related fees beyond border controls.

Malaysia’s position as an international travel hub relies on maintaining efficiency and competitiveness, while higher operating costs could harm airlines, travellers, and Malaysia’s global connectivity.

A positive development noted by Hee is the recent introduction of the first locally blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). IATA is in discussions with the government about establishing a robust SAF policy by 2027 to align with global carbon reduction efforts in aviation.

As part of its engagement with policymakers, IATA has submitted six proposals for Budget 2026. These include calls for stable and predictable policies to support renewable energy and fuel production, transparency in SAF pricing, and mechanisms to ensure airlines can reliably claim environmental benefits from using SAF.

The association also urged the government to avoid introducing a SAF mandate as a stand-alone measure without incentives to help bridge the price gap with conventional fuel. In addition, it recommended recognising global SAF accounting and reporting standards to support market access and participation in international SAF trade.

Looking ahead, Hee said Malaysia stands to benefit from the Asia Pacific region’s projected rapid aviation growth over the next 20 years, provided that the right policies are in place.

He highlighted digitalisation as a key area for improvement, with IATA’s ONE ID system for passengers and ONE Record for cargo offering opportunities to improve efficiency and productivity.

ONE ID aims to streamline travel through identity management and biometric recognition, while ONE Record provides a unified view of shipments through shared data and digital logistics.

Hee underscored the need for training incentives to develop the skilled workforce required for future industry demands. Aviation not only generates direct employment but also supports wider economic activities such as tourism, trade, and investment. He pointed out that each flight connecting Malaysia to the world contributes to the country’s economic opportunities.

Concluding, Hee reaffirmed IATA’s readiness to collaborate with the government to ensure Budget 2026 policies fully unlock Malaysia’s international aviation potential. The budget is scheduled to be presented by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim in Parliament on October 10.

A UK-based climate technology firm has secured $28 million in Series B funding to commercialize a novel process for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The core development is a patented iron-based catalyst that converts waste carbon dioxide (CO2) and green hydrogen directly into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons in a single exothermic reaction. This breakthrough simplifies the complex e-fuel production supply chain by eliminating costly intermediate steps, immediately lowering the capital and operating expenditure required to scale production. The successful funding round validates a critical pathway for the aviation sector, which is currently struggling to meet decarbonization targets, with the resulting fuel offering up to an 85% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Context

The informed professional has consistently wondered → What is the true cost of e-fuels, and can they be produced at a scale that matters? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is seen as the only viable near-term solution for aviation decarbonization, yet high production costs and feedstock scarcity have kept its adoption rate low, accounting for only 0.7% of total airline fuel consumption. The industry consensus has been that without a major technological or policy intervention to drive down the cost of synthesis, mandated targets would remain out of reach.

Analysis

This development is driven by a technological breakthrough in catalysis. Traditional e-fuel production pathways require multiple energy-intensive chemical steps, such as the reverse water gas shift or the creation of e-methanol as an intermediate product. The new patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet fuel from the two core building blocks → waste CO2 and green hydrogen → in one reactor. Think of this catalyst as a shortcut that bypasses two expensive toll booths on the fuel production highway.

This simplification reduces the required equipment footprint and energy input, which is the primary cause of the high cost of e-fuels. Manufacturers are expected to react by accelerating partnerships and offtake agreements with companies that can demonstrate a clear, cost-competitive path to meeting the growing regulatory and corporate demand for SAF.

Outlook

This development implies that the cost curve for e-fuels will bend downward faster than previously modeled, making SAF a more competitive commodity. The next simple thing to watch for is the operational status of the company’s second demonstration plant, OX2, which is expected to be fully operational in 2026. A successful demonstration at this larger scale will signal that the technology is moving from lab-validated to commercially de-risked, which will trigger a wave of new, large-scale offtake agreements and final investment decisions for full commercial plants.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Allium-Inflorescence-Morphology-Supporting-Pollinator-Biodiversity-Sustainable-Agroecosystem-Functionality.jpeg,N,,2025-10-01 02:56:13.462066

The ...,Sayan Chakravarty,,,,,https://luxurylaunches.com/travel/phantom-3500-private-jet-gets-massive-order-09302025.php,"A business jet with no traditional windows, its fuselage wrapped in smooth composite skin, cameras feeding live footage to six-foot-wide displays lining the cabin walls.
According to the WSJ, Otto claims the Phantom 3500 will burn 60% less fuel than comparable midsize jets.
Flexjet’s massive order, one of the largest firm commitments in business aviation history, signals this isn’t just vaporware.
The Ohio-based fractional ownership giant, fresh off an $800 million capital raise led by L Catterton, is positioning the Phantom 3500 as a core platform for its fleet.
The company is also pushing a climate narrative, designing the aircraft to fly at altitudes where contrails are less likely and using Williams engines compatible with 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel.","The private aviation world has a new disruptor, and it doesn’t have windows. Texas-based Otto Aerospace’s Phantom 3500, backed by a substantial 300-aircraft order from Flexjet, is betting that passengers will trade their porthole views for panoramic digital screens and fuel savings that could make flying private more affordable than business class.

At first glance, the idea sounds like science fiction. A business jet with no traditional windows, its fuselage wrapped in smooth composite skin, cameras feeding live footage to six-foot-wide displays lining the cabin walls. CEO Paul Touw calls the experience “surreal,” promising passengers can “look at the entire world around you,” including the curvature of Earth at cruise altitude.

The company has branded this setup “SuperNatural Vision,” and while it might take some convincing for travelers used to pressing their noses against Gulfstream glass, there’s serious engineering behind the spectacle.

The real story is efficiency. According to the WSJ, Otto claims the Phantom 3500 will burn 60% less fuel than comparable midsize jets. That’s not a modest improvement, it’s a generational leap. The secret lies in laminar flow aerodynamics. Without window cutouts interrupting the fuselage, air slides smoothly over the carbon-fiber skin. Add smaller engines made possible by reduced fuel needs, and Otto argues it can deliver 3,200 to 3,500 nautical miles of range, 590 mph cruise speeds, and access to short runways, all at a target list price of $19.5 million. That undercuts super-midsize incumbents and threatens high-end light jets on total ownership costs.

Flexjet’s massive order, one of the largest firm commitments in business aviation history, signals this isn’t just vaporware. The Ohio-based fractional ownership giant, fresh off an $800 million capital raise led by L Catterton, is positioning the Phantom 3500 as a core platform for its fleet. Chairman Kenn Ricci frames the bet as “introducing tomorrow’s standards,” and with 300 aircraft on order, Flexjet is clearly banking that tomorrow arrives soon.

The timeline is aggressive but not fantasy. Otto has unveiled a full-scale mockup, first flight is targeted for 2027, and deliveries should begin around 2030. Manufacturing will happen at a one-million-square-foot smart factory at Jacksonville’s Cecil Airport, backed by $515 million in state incentives. The supply chain reads like a who’s who of aerospace: Leonardo for composites, Williams International for engines, Garmin for avionics, Mecaer for landing gear. Leadership includes former Boeing Chairman Dennis Muilenburg and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the board, lending heavyweight credibility to what could otherwise appear to be startup moonshot territory.

Regulations won’t block the concept either. FAA Part 25 certification doesn’t mandate passenger windows, though emergency exits need viewing capability. Otto will install small traditional windows at exits and build redundancy into the camera system. The company is also pushing a climate narrative, designing the aircraft to fly at altitudes where contrails are less likely and using Williams engines compatible with 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel. Otto claims a 90% carbon dioxide reduction with SAF and up to 97% total warming impact reduction when contrail avoidance is factored in.",https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/otto-aerospaces-phantom-3500.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 16:57:02.923322

Masdar plans to apply the UAE's experience in producing sustainable aviation fuel to Azerbaijan, Murad Sadigov, head of the Masdar representative office in Azerbaijan, said at the Baku Climate Action Week (BCAW2025), Trend reports.

The evolution of sustainable energy modalities in Azerbaijan transcends mere export initiatives, concurrently striving to enhance the robustness and dependability of the national energy infrastructure.

In his perspective, the primary objective transcends merely addressing inefficiencies within the energy infrastructure; it also encompasses the development of a robust and dependable framework. ""The volatility of energy resources renders them devoid of intrinsic value; conversely, the reliability of energy systems is paramount,"" he asserted.

Consequently, the energy strategy was formulated to facilitate stakeholder engagement with the grid infrastructure while concurrently upholding a robust and reliable energy provision.

Sadigov highlighted the criticality of deploying energy storage architectures, optimizing balancing mechanisms, and integrating diverse renewable energy portfolios, while underscoring the significance of continuous investigation into offshore wind energy technologies and green hydrogen innovations.

He pointed out that Masdar is actively investing in green hydrogen production and is already implementing a pilot project to produce sustainable aviation fuel in the UAE, a project the company plans to apply in Azerbaijan.

Masdar has also launched the largest '24-hour generation' project-a combination of solar power (5.5 GW) and storage systems (19 GWh)-under construction in the UAE.

The company intends to implement similar solutions in Azerbaijan on a smaller scale.

""Such technological challenges make it possible to bring renewable energy as close as possible to commercial generation. This is made possible by the support of the Azerbaijani government and the availability of qualified personnel, as the country has always been a leading energy hub and is currently transferring innovations to the renewable energy sector,"" Sadigov explained.

He also noted that the Azerbaijani government is investing in grid modernization and recently announced the construction of two large storage systems to control frequency and energy flows, which will increase grid resilience and reliability.

As Sadigov puts it, Azerbaijan's sights are set on the horizon, reaching for the stars and aiming to do much more than just send green energy across to Europe.

""We have also witnessed the signing of agreements with Central Asia. This is a step toward the formation of a large-scale energy network that will ensure stability throughout the region. Azerbaijan is becoming the heart of an energy hub that will play a key role in the energy transition not only for the Caucasus but for all of Eurasia,"" he added.",https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-09/30/TNA_6a8dbimage_story.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 16:57:17.303481

London, 29 September 2025 - International Airlines Group (IAG) has participated in the £20.75 million ($28 million) Series B funding round for OXCCU, a UK-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) innovator. IAG has been joined by new and existing investors including Safran Corporate Ventures, Orlen and Aramco Ventures, among others.

IAG invested in OXCCU through IAGi Ventures, its dedicated corporate venturing arm, which earlier this year announced an investment commitment of up to €200 million over five years – the largest by a European airline group. OXCCU exemplifies the type of high-potential company IAG is seeking to support through IAGi Ventures.

Spun out of Oxford University, OXCCU has developed a novel, patented process which directly converts gaseous waste carbon and hydrogen into jet fuel range hydrocarbons. This process eliminates a key step required in conventional methods with the potential to reduce both capital and operating costs. It can operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions giving it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks into SAF.

The Series B fundraise will enable OXCCU to deliver on its scale-up strategy and accelerate the commercialisation of its technology. It follows the opening of their first demonstration plant1 at London Oxford Airport last year, and will support the development of a larger-scale facility expected to be operational in 2026. OXCCU’s facilities could play a crucial role in helping meet the UK’s SAF mandate and IAG’s decarbonisation goals.

“We’re focused on backing companies whose technologies have the potential to deliver meaningful impact and we’re excited to be supporting OXCCU as it embarks on the next stage of its scale-up journey,” said Ignacio Tovar, IAG Director of Innovation. “By leveraging our industry expertise, acting as early adopters, and fostering collaboration across our airlines and broader partner ecosystem, we help the companies we back to scale faster.”

IAG was the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050 and has a goal of meeting 10% of fuel needs with SAF by 2030. In 2024, 1.9% of IAG’s total fuel used was SAF, saving 469,000 tonnes of CO2, up almost 200% versus 2023.

The EU could further consider a percentage for clean innovation in defence, scaling already existing programmes, such as those of the EDA.","This op-ed was originally published in The Brussels Times on 29 September, 2025.

In twenty years, future generations may ask why European NATO members failed to use this period of astronomical defence spending to advance broader goals — including the energy transition. After all, there is a precedent.

On the eve of World War I, Winston Churchill led the British Navy away from burning coal to burning oil. The move, considered bold by many, ultimately benefited the British fleet by making its ships faster, quieter and safer, ushering in a new era of oil.

Historically, defence innovation has been beneficial for advancements in other sectors, too. GPS and the microwave, two technologies now acknowledged as indispensable, were initially developed for military purposes, before later being adopted for commercial use.

Semiconductors, biotech and cybersecurity are other examples of transformative innovations that originated in the defence sector but have since contributed to societal development.

Defence spending as a missed opportunity

The 5% spending target, agreed by NATO member states this summer in The Hague, therefore risks becoming a missed opportunity to address non-military, yet equally critical, issues. This isn’t about using electric tanks or solar-powered missiles by tomorrow; it is about shoring up the continent’s long-term energy resilience through clean innovation.

The security imperative is clear. Supply chains for fossil fuels have already proven to be an operational vulnerability for militaries. Sustaining fuel supplies and their storage was one of Russia’s weaknesses in 2022.

For NATO troops, the logistics of securing and protecting diesel supplies during combat proved a challenge in Afghanistan and Iraq, with many lives being lost.

On top of that, Europe’s domestic liquid fuel refining capacity has been steadily declining. Relying on even more fuel imports to meet militaries’ growing demand in the coming years poses significant security risks, as highlighted by Europe’s most recent energy crisis.

How the defence sector can reshape Europe's energy future

Any decision to invest in fossil-based infrastructure and fuel sources is thus strategically short-sighted. So how then could European NATO members optimise their spending? So-called dual-use technologies are a good place to start.

Research into sustainable fuels, for instance, shows that they could be cheaper, safer, quieter and less visible on foreign radars. The Netherlands, a frontrunner in the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity, just published its National SAF Roadmap to scale the production of SAF’s by 2035. Increasing demand by the Royal Netherlands Air Force, who already operated F-16 jets on SAF as early as 2019, could significantly boost this ramp-up in the decade ahead.

Elsewhere, the development of ultra-lightweight materials could help to reduce tank weight – a growing challenge for modern military logistics – which would be a boost for energy efficiency. At the same time, these materials might be adapted for commercial heavy-duty vehicles and aviation to facilitate the use of biofuels and electrification.

Another example might be the development of an integrated smart grid and battery storage system to help remote military bases withstand significant energy vulnerabilities. In civilian spaces, these kinds of micro-systems could also be deployed in natural disaster zones during power outages. It’s a clear ‘win-win’, given the environmental challenges that are already straining armed forces and public communities alike.

This will not be straightforward, but there is a path to take. To begin with, European policy makers must focus on reducing our fossil fuel dependency and carbon footprint. By directing resources, including some of NATO’s 5% pledge, toward clean innovation, militaries can herald a more strategic approach which strengthens Europe’s collective deterrence and its energy security.

An EU toolbox for clean defence

Attempts to build bridges between energy, climate and defence stakeholders will be key. Fortunately, work is already well underway: The continuation of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS), an EU-funded initiative run by the European Defence Agency (EDA) until 2028 is one such example and something which can be built on.

Attracting investments in clean innovation is another important step in putting the European Defence Industrial Strategy (EDIS) and its key piece of regulation, the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP), into practice.

To support this, defence procurement criteria could include a life-cycle assessment of the costs of new defence systems with a premium on the costs of imported fossil fuels. This would likely lower the costs of military equipment that could be powered by more sustainable fuels in the long run. The planned amendment of the regulation on defence and sensitive security procurement, as recently proposed by the European Commission, could include such rules.

The EU could further consider a percentage for clean innovation in defence, scaling already existing programmes, such as those of the EDA. Research and development through the European Defence Fund might also be connected to Horizon Europe, which has a long tradition of funding innovation in clean technologies.

In addition, akin to industrial alliances such as the European Battery Alliance and the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, a new public-private coalition could be set up to strengthen industry collaboration around dual-use innovation.

Future-proofing Europe’s defence

Lowering the military’s reliance on oil and gas will not be simple, and concerns about new insecurities linked to the raw materials needed for clean technologies are valid. Yet these challenges cannot justify short-sighted choices. Europe must avoid reactive decisions today that would lock its militaries into new fossil fuel dependencies tomorrow. The EU should invest not only in stronger defence capabilities but also in more sustainable, future-proof ones. History shows it’s a smart idea.",https://www.clingendael.org/sites/default/files/styles/c_header_image/public/2025-09/Rutte%20Nato.jpg?itok=65mjTH6a,N,,2025-09-30 11:56:21.649219
