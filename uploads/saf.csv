Twelve, the carbon-transformation company, is pioneering E-Jet® SAF — a drop-in sustainable aviation fuel made from CO₂, water, and renewable energy. Unlike traditional biofuels, Twelve’s Power-to-Liquid (PtL) process doesn’t rely on biomass. It uses captured CO₂ plus hydrogen (from water) and renewable electricity to create synthetic gas, which is then converted into jet fuel. The environmental impact is significant. E-Jet SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel. It also uses 1,000× less water and 30× less land than biofuels. Twelve is moving from lab to scale. Their first commercial plant, AirPlant™ One in Moses Lake, Washington, is under construction. This facility will produce E-Jet fuel that meets ASTM D7566 Annex A1 specification, meaning it can be used with today’s aircraft without engine modifications. Corporations are backing this movement. Companies like Autodesk, BCG, McKinsey, and Novo Nordisk are purchasing SAF certificates (SAFc) from Twelve via the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA).

,,2025-12-02 16:01:02+00:00,Vogue Scandinavia,“We see more green juice on board than champagne”: The new jet set are flying private differently,Not Available,,,,,https://www.voguescandinavia.com/articles/the-new-jet-set,"Private aviation usage reflects this: aviation industry data platform WingX ranks Sweden eighth in Europe for private jet flights in the first half of 2025.
“Private aviation is the best efficiency tool to give people their time back,” he continues.
Private aviation wasn’t always synonymous with history-making feats or on-the-clock optimisation.
“Business travel is back, it just looks different than before,” says Kelly.
Hedge fund and analysts use private jet flight tracking data to gain an edge by predicting upcoming M&A deals before they are publicly announced (a fitting Succession plot line, if we’ve ever heard one).","In May of 1927, Charles Lindbergh – 25 years old, sleep-deprived, and half-frozen – descended through the Parisian night sky in his custom-built, single-engine, high-wing aircraft ‘The Spirit of St. Louis’. Having set off from a muddy, rain-soaked runway on Long Island, he had flown for 33.5 hours alone, navigating storm clouds, turbulence, fog, and bouts of hallucination to complete the first ever non-stop transatlantic flight. On arrival, Lindbergh circled the Eiffel Tower before landing at Le Bourget airfield, where 150,000 people were waiting. Attendees surged toward him, ripped open the cockpit, and carried him across the tarmac on their shoulders, a celebration that ended with trophy hunters tearing the aircraft apart.

Lindbergh was half-Swedish; his father hailed from Smedstorp in Skåne, a fact often buried beneath his legend. But in many ways, that detail is uncannily relevant now. Private aviation’s latest chapter, like its earliest, has a profound connection to Sweden and the Nordics’ particular relationship with flight: pragmatic, efficient and discreetly ambitious. That may explain why, nearly a century after Lindbergh’s history-making flight, our region has become a nucleus for new-era air travel. The Nordics are among Europe’s most resilient economies, Sweden being a hub of private wealth boasting more than 520 centi-millionaires and over one trillion US dollars in assets under management, according to Knight Frank and Henley & Partners report in 2024. Private aviation usage reflects this: aviation industry data platform WingX ranks Sweden eighth in Europe for private jet flights in the first half of 2025.

But where Lindbergh navigated by dead reckoning (he rejected radio navigation gear as heavy and unreliable), today’s elite travellers are in search of something equally elusive: taste and time. “You can’t buy more hours in the day, but you can spend them better,” says Mats Leander, president of the Nordics and Eastern Europe at VistaJet, a subscription-based private aviation company. “Private aviation is the best efficiency tool to give people their time back,” he continues.

For Brian Kelly, founder of website The Points Guy and a travel cultural analyst, the shift in values is palpable. “People still want premium,” he says. “But the markers have changed. Privacy, personalisation, and time, they’re the real luxuries now.” Kelly points to a broader segmentation across travel: “Even in business class, it’s no longer one-size-fits-all,” he says. “In Lufthansa’s new Allegris Business Class, there are over five seating options. British Airways now charges to choose a seat, even if you paid for a Business Class ticket. So, segmentation is the biggest thing I see happening.” With private flight being perhaps the ultimate segment in the market, it seems that, as commercial prices climb, private aviation is starting to make sense for more people – especially for those who can’t afford delays. “Private travel is all about convenience and saving time since airports are as packed as ever, with a record number of travellers going through while airports have, generally, not gotten bigger,” adds Kelly.

Private aviation wasn’t always synonymous with history-making feats or on-the-clock optimisation. During the golden age of ‘Come Fly With Me’, Frank Sinatra lugged his Rat Pack around in a dual-prop plane he dubbed ‘El Dago’, which came complete with a full bar and a piano and helped codify the myth of flying private as something raucous, romantic, and deeply male. Elvis and Priscilla borrowed that same plane to go get married in Las Vegas. The Beatles flew it. The ‘Jet Set’, a term coined by The New York Times in 1951, became shorthand for a glamorous world where proximity to a cocktail cart was as important as your passport stamp count.

By the early 2000s, the Bling Ring era of aviation saw the likes of Paris Hilton clutching her Chihuahua boarding Gulfstreams. It was a champagne-laced level of hyper luxury that was synonymous with diamanté velour track suits, Motorola Razr phones, and staged paparazzi tarmac walks with silver monogrammed Rimowa suitcases. It was the sort of Y2K pop princess look of Juicy Couture revivalism now championed by Zara Larsson. But that is not the VistaJet client of today. Theirs is a low-profile traveller, more akin to Alexander Skarsgård’s Succession character Lukas Matsson than a member of the Entourage set. “Our clients aren’t looking to show off,” says Leander. “In fact, today, we see more green juice on board than champagne.”

Founded in 2004 by Swiss entrepreneur Thomas Flohr, VistaJet recognised the shift to that excess and rejected the traditional ownership and charter models in favour of a sleek, subscription-based service. Effectively, this brought the on-demand logic of Spotify and Netflix to the skies. Travellers don’t own a plane (no depreciating asset on the books) and wherever they are in the world, they have access to an identical fleet – in VistaJet’s case, a global fleet of more than 350 aircraft guaranteed to be ready for take-off within 24 hours.

Still, the question of emissions can’t be ignored. Aviation accounts for around two and a half per cent of global CO₂ emissions, and private jets, for all their glamour, are famously inefficient. VistaJet doesn’t pretend otherwise. What they do instead is measure obsessively, report transparently, and invest aggressively. In 2025 alone, the company purchased over 27 million litres of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the equivalent of 11 Olympic swimming pools and 10 flights to the moon, for example. But why, in our digital age, do we feel the need to travel for business at all? “Business travel is back, it just looks different than before,” says Kelly. “It’s changed in that people travel on a less frequent basis but companies have more off-sites and in-person bonding.”

In the Nordics, Leander and his peers see two typical types of private jet travellers: “It’s multinationals and entrepreneurs,” he says. “People who need to be in Munich one day, back in Oslo for a shareholder meeting the next, and closing an infrastructure deal in Singapore two days later.” These are not the people who Instagram their in-flight meals. They’re business leaders who need flexibility, with zero risk of cancellation, delays or missed flights. And, most importantly, privacy. Hedge fund and analysts use private jet flight tracking data to gain an edge by predicting upcoming M&A deals before they are publicly announced (a fitting Succession plot line, if we’ve ever heard one). One of the main perks of travelling private through a subscription model rather than owning your own (or a fraction of a) PJ is the fact that you remain, well, private. Entirely untraceable on flight scanners. VistaJet and its fleet facilitate just that.

And what a fleet it is: feather down duvets, Egyptian cotton bed linen, cashmere blankets, tableware by French heritage brand Christofle on every flight; Moncler-designed crew uniforms and a specially made Le Labo scent diffusing through the cabin. There are in-air sleep programmes, in-flight facial treatments developed with Dr Barbara Sturm, and crew trained in child psychology (and as sommeliers, though hopefully not in the same session). On certain flights, the cabin can be pre-heated to accommodate exotic pets. One memorable passenger list included two elderly Great Danes, a cat, and a Sulcata tortoise, with the floor warmed to mimic the latter’s natural desert habitat.

Today we see more green juice on board than champagne

Mats Leander

It all sounds absurd until you realise that, like Lindbergh, these travellers are still crossing oceans with a very precise purpose. Unlike Lindbergh, they’re doing it in comfort, without frostbite or a pocket compass. And waiting for these modern travellers upon arrival are not the parades or paparazzi of yore, but performance metrics and boardrooms. Still, some things haven’t changed. When Lindbergh looked down at the earth from above the Atlantic, he described the view as “too beautiful, too wonderful, too distant for human eyes to see”. That’s something no class of cabin can commodify. The view from 40,000 feet still has the power to humble you, whether you’re sipping green juice or champagne.

The new pricing benchmarks are expected to help companies better manage their compliance with the UK’s SAF mandate. The assessments will allow industry participants to compare the cost of buying SAF certificates, blending physical bio-SAF produced from hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) feedstock, and paying buy-out costs if they do not meet their obligations.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said that as SAF mandates continue to increase, companies will need dependable pricing not only for the fuel but also for certificates. He said the agency has worked closely with industry stakeholders to create the new assessment, which is designed to bring greater transparency as the aviation sector adapts to stricter carbon-reduction rules.

The new benchmark will track certificate prices that qualify for meeting the UK SAF mandate and are based on SAF produced using HEFA feedstock. These certificates, which are tradeable, are issued when eligible SAF is supplied in the UK and are later used by obligated companies to fulfil their mandate requirements. The system allows firms that exceed their quota to sell surplus certificates to companies that need them.

Beginning in 2025, jet fuel suppliers in the UK must blend 2% SAF into domestic aviation fuel deliveries. The mandate will rise each year, reaching 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. As these targets grow, transparent prices for UK SAF certificates are expected to become increasingly important.

The new SAF certificate price adds to Argus’ existing assessments for tradeable biofuel tickets used for road transport mandates in the UK and several EU nations. The agency also provides a range of physical SAF prices in northwest Europe, including those for HEFA-based SAF and modelled production costs for electrolytic SAF (e-SAF).",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-12-02 10:57:12.844125

“Our Ops Sustainability programme is already delivering measurable efficiency gains and environmental improvements.
The company said this film “mimics the aerodynamic properties of shark skin” and helps to reduce drag – leading to lower fuel consumption and a CO2 emissions reduction of around 1 per cent per flight.
Alongside these fuel efficiency gains, the group is also focused on the increased use of alternative aviation fuels, including its “green fares” and other initiatives to encourage the further uptake of these fuels by corporate clients.","Lufthansa Group has set new targets for reducing CO2 emissions from its operations over the next few years.

The aviation giant, which also owns Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Swiss and Eurowings, said it had managed to “permanently avoid’ 170,000 tonnes of CO2 since 2022 through 90 separate projects.

Lufthansa said that it now aimed to avoid another 50,000 tonnes of CO2 annually by the end of 2028, which corresponds to a kerosene fuel “saving” of 15,200 metric tonnes.

Grazia Vittadini, chief technology officer of Lufthansa Group, said: “We embed sustainability where it has the most immediate impact - in the day-to-day operations of our airlines.

“Our Ops Sustainability programme is already delivering measurable efficiency gains and environmental improvements. At the same time, we are investing more than ever in highly fuel-efficient, state-of-the-art aircraft.”

The sustainability programme, which was launched three years ago, has created a wide variety of projects to reduce carbon emissions by improving fuel efficiency. These include single-engine taxiing, flight route optimisation, lighter onboard equipment, electric ground vehicles and using AI to improve inflight catering services.

The group said the next stage of this process would see the increased use of digital applications to make operations more efficient, including “more precise” decisions on the amount of fuel needed for a flight, as well as optimised taxiing and approach procedures.

Another initiative is Lufthansa’s AeroSHARK surface technology project, which has produced a special film that has been applied to the surface of more than 20 aircraft. The company said this film “mimics the aerodynamic properties of shark skin” and helps to reduce drag – leading to lower fuel consumption and a CO2 emissions reduction of around 1 per cent per flight.

In 2025, Thales and CEA launched a joint project called GIVERNY, aimed at exploring the resistance to attacks of two post-quantum algorithms: the HAWK signature scheme, which is closely related to the NIST FN-DSA (Digital Signature Standard), and the FAEST signature scheme, which is related to the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

Through joint development and cross-evaluation work, Thales and CEA cryptographers and cybersecurity experts analysed the robustness of FAEST and HAWK under real-world implementation scenarios comparable to those of future electronic products integrating post-quantum cryptography.

This collaboration between the two CESTIs recognized by ANSSI for their post-quantum cryptography expertise is unprecedented in France and marks a key step in preparing the industry for the transition to quantum-resistant systems.

The GIVERNY project results come at a time when ANSSI has recently announced that products placed on the market after 2030 must transition to post-quantum algorithms, with this requirement applying as early as 2027 for sensitive products seeking qualification.

Founded in 2020, Heirloom is accelerating the deployment of DAC technology that harnesses natural carbon mineralization to capture CO₂ directly from the atmosphere.","BRISBANE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Heirloom, America's leading Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology provider, today announced investments from the Development Bank of Japan Inc. (DBJ) and Chiyoda Corporation. These investments build on the $150 million Series B and a more recent investment from United.

The investments underscore growing interest in Heirloom’s DAC technology, specifically from Japanese investors. Heirloom’s Series B round included participation from Japan Airlines Co., Ltd., Mitsubishi Corporation, and Mitsui & Co., Ltd.

Heirloom’s growing strategic partnerships with Japanese investors position the company to engage with Japan’s emerging emissions trading system. The GX-ETS, currently in its voluntary phase, is expected to shift to mandatory compliance in 2026 and become Asia’s second-largest carbon market. Engineered removals such as DAC are eligible to generate verified credits that regulated Japanese corporations can use to meet part of their compliance obligations — balancing affordability with climate integrity.

Additionally, both investors add strategic value for Heirloom. Government-owned DBJ is Japan's major finance institution and plays a crucial role in supporting technologies aligned with Japan's Green Transformation (GX) initiatives and 2050 carbon neutrality goals. Its investment in Heirloom is its first in a DAC company – and among the earliest by a national financial institution in a DAC company – signaling that carbon removal is becoming core infrastructure for a decarbonized economy.

Chiyoda Corporation, one of Japan’s leading engineering and construction firms, brings extensive experience in CO₂ recovery, capture, and utilization systems. Heirloom will leverage Chiyoda’s world-class engineering expertise to accelerate the deployment of its DAC system around the world.

Heirloom's DAC technology offers versatile applications for captured CO₂, including permanent underground storage or utilization for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This flexibility aligns with Japan's comprehensive approach to decarbonization, which includes both emissions reduction and carbon removal strategies.

“These investments from DBJ and Chiyoda strengthen our technical and financial foundation to build large-scale DAC systems that serve many roles across decarbonization — from providing CO₂ for clean fuels to enabling permanent carbon removal. Their joint expertise within Japan’s energy and industrial landscape will help accelerate the use of cutting-edge carbon technology where it can have the greatest impact,” said Shashank Samala, co-founder and CEO of Heirloom.

Why we are consulting

Biomass plays an important role in our energy system and in meeting our decarbonisation goals, generating around 10% of the UK’s total energy supply across the power, domestic and non-domestic heat and transport sectors in 2024. The government only incentivises the use of biomass if it complies with relevant sustainability criteria as defined within existing support schemes and policies across multiple bioenergy sectors.

However, we are conscious of concerns around biomass sustainability and the need for levels of sustainability that are in line with latest scientific evidence or global best practice. For biomass to continue to play a role in supporting the government’s ambitions to be a clean energy superpower and accelerate towards net zero by 2050, confidence in the sustainability of biomass must be improved. It is essential that effective sustainability standards coupled with robust monitoring, reporting and verification regimes continue to underpin biomass use in the UK to ensure positive environmental, economic and social impacts, both domestically and internationally.

This consultation is seeking views on the development of a common biomass sustainability framework, which includes proposals for strengthening existing biomass sustainability criteria in line with latest evidence as well as improvements to current monitoring, reporting and verification practices, and sets out guiding principles for addressing non-compliance. It aims to provide a consistent view on biomass sustainability across all relevant bioenergy sectors.

Executive Summary

Context

Role of sustainable biomass in accelerating to net zero

The Prime Minister’s Plan for Change includes a key mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower, delivering clean power by 2030 and accelerating the UK’s trajectory to net zero. This includes building a diverse and resilient low carbon energy system that can bring energy security, as well as support the transition to net zero.

Biomass is defined as any material of biological origin, including wastes and residues from biological origin e.g. forestry residues, sawmill residues, food waste. Sustainable biomass is currently expected to play an important role in this mission. It is a low carbon alternative to fossil fuels and has many uses across the economy including for energy (heat, power, transport fuels), as an energy source for industrial processes or as a raw material used to make products (such as bio-based plastics and materials from foundational industries). It also has the potential to deliver greenhouse gas removals (GGRs) through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).

With robust safeguards in place, global institutions such as the IPCC, and the UK’s independent advisor, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) recognise that bioenergy can make a significant contribution to decarbonising economies and meeting net zero. In 2023, the UK’s total biomass demand was 193TWh, representing 10% of the country’s total energy demands. Looking ahead into mid-2030s, we expect demands to continue at this level to support our carbon budget 6 targets.

For the longer term, the CCC in its advice for the Seventh Carbon Budget (CB7) states that ‘Sustainable bioenergy plays an important role in the Balanced Pathway and, when combined with CCS, can provide a valuable source of CO2 removals’, while recognising that biomass feedstocks are a limited resource and must be prioritised in highest value applications.

BECCS could be applied in a number of sectors including electricity supply, industry, waste, and fuel supply in the longer term. Yet, the government recognises that in certain hard-to-decarbonise sectors, where deploying BECCS universally may not be feasible and alternatives are limited, biomass can continue to play a role.

To encourage the use of biomass where appropriate, the government has in place a number of financial incentive schemes and policies such as Contracts for Difference (CfD), Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Mandate and Green Gas Support Scheme (GGSS). Looking ahead, in May 2025 government commissioned an independent review of GGRs, to consider how options for GGRs, including large-scale Power Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS), can assist the UK in meeting our net zero targets, out to 2050. The findings were published on 23 October, and the government will now consider the recommendations and respond in due course.

Existing biomass sustainability criteria, enforcement and related policies

Existing government incentive schemes for biomass are already contingent on compliance with sustainability criteria. However, there is no single internationally accepted definition of ‘low carbon’ or ‘sustainable’ biomass. The government currently assesses the low carbon nature of biomass against sector specific sustainability criteria. Internationally, other countries that use biomass assess the low carbon nature of biomass against their own sustainability criteria.

Existing sustainability criteria are holistic, ensuring that biomass can be considered low carbon, and is sourced in way that meets wider environmental (e.g., biodiversity) and social requirements. Existing criteria sit within individual biomass policies across different sectors with varying levels of alignment between criteria.

As scientific understanding of biomass sustainability continues to evolve, we have an opportunity to refine our approach and ensure that our definition of sustainable biomass reflects the latest evidence – maximising carbon benefits from biomass use while supporting wider environmental and social objectives associated with sourcing and harvesting. In this way we can secure its role as a truly low carbon resource. Given the wide array of feedstocks and diverse energy applications, we recognise that sustainability considerations will need to be tailored to the unique characteristics of each feedstock and its supply chain context.

Globally, there is increasing momentum towards further developing and upholding robust sustainability monitoring, reporting and verification regimes. While the complexity of biomass supply chains and the specialist knowledge required present challenges, there are also greater efforts towards increased transparency. These efforts have the potential to improve public and industry confidence that biomass used in the UK is adhering to strong sustainability standards. The CCC has also called for stronger international governance and updated sustainability criteria to reflect the latest evidence. As such, in its report, Progress in reducing emissions - 2025 report to Parliament, the Committee included a recommendation to publish a common sustainability framework.

Sustainability of bioenergy feedstocks also needs to be considered in the context of other related sectors and policies such as the wider forestry sector policies and waste policies (e.g. the waste hierarchy) so that biomass is prioritised towards delivering the greatest benefits for the UK.

A common framework as proposed in this consultation therefore presents a strong opportunity to strengthen confidence in biomass use by applying robust, clear and consistent rules on sustainable biomass across our net zero programmes. This will maximise carbon benefits while safeguarding environmental and social outcomes across diverse biomass feedstocks and supply chains.

Other international sustainability standards

Biomass is a globally traded commodity, with the UK currently relying on both domestic and international biomass supply chains to meet its bioenergy demand, with around one third of biomass (by energy content) being imported for use across heat, electricity and transport fuels in 2024. It is therefore important that the global context around biomass sustainability is recognised, including consideration of standards established by other countries or regions such as EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED). As well as continuing to maintain high standards in the UK, there is a need to find the right degree of alignment with other standards, particularly those in the EU, to facilitate smooth international trading.

Summary of consultation content and proposals

The aim of this consultation is to seek views from stakeholders on the development of a common biomass sustainability framework, including on the scope of framework and the sustainability criteria that should be included. The framework would set minimum sustainability criteria to enable consistency between different biomass applications and ensure government only supports low carbon biomass to meet its ambition to accelerate towards net zero. The proposals in this consultation therefore build on existing criteria based on evidence around minimising environmental impacts and limiting carbon emissions from the biomass supply chain, as well as impacts/costs relating to deliverability and enforcement of these criteria.

The consultation proposes that the framework would initially apply to government incentive schemes supporting bioenergy and would be adopted by relevant government policies in the future. It may also be used as a voluntary framework by biomass users outside of the bioenergy subsidy regime to improve public confidence and trust in the sustainability of the biomass used.

The proposed framework would be delivered as a policy document following this consultation to support individual biomass schemes to develop and deliver a consistent set of sustainability criteria, without the need for additional legislation. The policy document could be incorporated directly into relevant legislation or contractual arrangements of the individual schemes. Due to the difference in the demographics of participants of incentive schemes, this consultation does not propose specific enforcement provisions, as these are most appropriately developed by individual incentive schemes in the respective legislation or contracts. This will avoid imposing inappropriate penalties or non-compliance by suggesting a standardised approach to enforcement. However, this consultation proposes a series of guiding enforcement principles to support of design or update of enforcement regimes within individual biomass policy incentives.

In the context of this consultation, biomass sustainability criteria are defined as the land criteria and greenhouse gas (GHG) criteria (Figure 1). The land criteria relate to requirements around wider environmental protections associated with the sourcing of biomass feedstocks from land, including those relating to maintaining forest carbon stocks. The GHG criteria set out the requirements around the supply chain emissions associated with the production and use of the biomass feedstock. As part of this consultation, we will also seek views on where improvements could be made under a common framework to the existing monitoring, reporting and verification requirements.

Figure 1 - Key aspects of Land and GHG Criteria

There are a number of detailed proposals in this consultation and the evidence we collect will be important in helping us develop the common framework. A summary of proposals set out in this consultation can be found in Table 1. These proposals have been developed in line with meeting the policy objectives of this framework (as set out below) to minimise environmental harm and carbon emissions from the biomass supply chain while taking into account key considerations around deliverability and costs to government and industry. We welcome views on these proposals throughout this consultation.

1. A Common Sustainability Framework

1.1 The case for intervention

Biomass covers a broad range of feedstock types of biological origin (as set out in chapter 2) that can be converted into multiple energy vectors and applications via various conversion routes and technologies. This is reflected in the UK policy landscape where there are multiple biomass incentive schemes across different areas depending on the specific policy objectives as shown in Table 1.1. Across these policies, there is currently no one UK definition of biomass sustainability. Much of the existing criteria are historically derived from the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED I and RED II ) and the UK’s Timber Regulations (UKTR) and Timber Procurement Policy (UK TPP). There is currently no government policy on biomass sustainability of this type applied to unsubsidised biomass use in the UK. While there are many similarities between existing criteria, there are also increasing levels of divergence between existing biomass incentive schemes, leading to potential market distortion from applying inconsistent criteria across various biomass applications. This is primarily the case currently in the bioenergy sectors (power, heat and transport fuels) due to the absence of an overarching framework. A common sustainability framework would enable a consistent government view on sustainable biomass. A lack of consistent overarching policy framework on biomass sustainability from government also risks future policies not updating their sustainability criteria in line with the latest evidence.

A common framework covering multiple biomass applications would look to include standard minimum requirements but allow sectors to set higher requirements and ambitions where relevant and achievable. The common framework would recognise areas where there should be consistency across sectors i.e. on key environmental parameters relating to the sourcing of the biomass feedstock under the land criteria, and where divergence may be needed. This recognises the diverse nature of biomass supply chains i.e. in the inclusion or exclusion of certain parameters relating to life cycle emissions accounting under the GHG criteria. The common framework in its first and future iterations could also expand the scope of existing criteria to cover emerging biomass feedstocks and uses within the net zero landscape, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).

1.2 Policy objectives

The aims of this common framework are to:

Develop consistent biomass sustainability criteria and ensure effective delivery across different biomass applications in line with latest evidence.

Ensure government only supports biomass that meets sustainability criteria to support its net zero objectives.

The policy objectives set out above will be achieved through the development of minimum sustainability criteria in line with evidence and taking into consideration a wider range of factors and key principles. Where there is an evidence gap, we are seeking views from stakeholders through this consultation to provide us with relevant evidence to support the development of this policy.

Overarching principles for developing sustainability criteria

The principles set out below have been considered in developing the proposals set out within this consultation.

Maximise carbon benefits from bioenergy use. Biomass can only be considered low carbon if it is sourced in line with certain conditions. These conditions vary depending on the feedstock, and type of land from which it is sourced. This is because the carbon risks vary between feedstocks if these are unsustainably sourced. For example, forest derived biomass if sourced unsustainably could lead to overall negative carbon impacts. Supply chain emissions (e.g. from the cultivation, processing and transportation of the biomass) should also be minimised. The common framework should therefore ensure that biomass that meets the sustainability criteria can be considered low carbon, according to the latest evidence.

Minimise wider environmental harm associated with bioenergy supply chains e.g. biodiversity and ecosystem services. The sourcing of biomass feedstocks can have negative wider environmental and social impacts if not managed carefully. For example, through land use change or poor land management/harvesting practices. It is therefore important that sourcing is undertaken with the aim of minimising these wider impacts.

Alignment with wider government objectives and policies for related sectors e.g. timber industry, waste management, air quality, energy security. Typically, biomass used for bioenergy is a co-product, residue or waste from other industries. For example, forest derived biomass is closely linked to commercial forestry (timber production) sector, where the biomass industry will take the lowest quality / cost residues and by-products from the timber harvest. Where wastes are used for bioenergy, it must be in line with the waste hierarchy which is a legal requirement in England and Wales. The waste hierarchy ranks waste management options according to what is best for the environment, prioritising the prevention of waste where possible. Where waste is created, it gives priority to preparing it for re-use, then recycling, then energy recovery, and lastly disposal (e.g. landfill). Biomass sustainability criteria should therefore work alongside policies and regulations in these related sectors.

Alignment with criteria used in other countries or regions e.g. EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED). Many countries, including the EU, have sustainability criteria for using biomass in electricity, heat, and transport. Some of these are similar to what the UK currently has in place, but there are also differences (Table 1.1). Because the UK relies on global supply chains for much of its biomass, it’s important that our criteria can work alongside other international criteria. If our requirements are too different, it could make importing and certifying biomass more costly or complicated. The goal is to create a balanced approach—one that allows the UK to keep pace with international best practice, while also ensuring our policies work well for our own needs. Where matching approaches used by other countries is suggested, it is because this could bring the greatest benefits to the UK overall.

Deliverability. The practical ability to implement and operate the criteria, including the feasibility of robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. This will depend on the availability and accessibility of data and evidence to demonstrate compliance.

Costs to government, businesses and consumers. Stricter sustainability criteria are expected to require additional evidence collection and assurance, with associated cost and resource implications for industry and administrators. In addition, stricter criteria could result in a reduction in the supply of biomass, leading to possible increases in the cost of some biomass feedstocks. Some of these additional industry costs could be passed onto consumers, depending on the specific biomass application.

1.3 Implementation and scope of the common framework

We are inviting feedback and views through this consultation on how this framework could be implemented. The framework could be delivered as a policy document or through a legislative route. A legislative pathway could provide for enforcement of the framework across the whole UK bioeconomy, i.e. beyond government subsidised bioenergy generation. However, a legislative common framework would take longer to put in place and the increased uncertainty caused by this delay may discourage investment in areas already subject to extensive sustainability requirements.

A policy document could be published next year. This would provide a clear direction of travel from government on future criteria for those sectors and industries looking to invest in the nearer term in government incentivised bioenergy decarbonisation routes. If the common framework was delivered via a policy document, it would be implemented via individual biomass incentive schemes amending their own legislation or relevant contracts. This would limit the reach of the common framework to bioenergy applications that are subject to government incentive schemes and policies but would not require the establishment of a new overarching regulatory system. Currently, the majority of biomass use across power, heat and transport applications is supported by government through various subsidy schemes and policies (Table 1.1). A policy document would also be more flexible and responsive to review and update in line with latest evidence which is an important consideration for developing technologies. We expect future bioenergy policies within different sectors to be regulated by way of its own legislation or by contract.

Therefore, our preferred option is to develop a policy document, and that this framework should initially cover any biomass feedstocks (sourced domestically or internationally) that are used for bioenergy, within the UK, that is subject to government incentive schemes and policies.

Future use of biomass in the UK is expected to evolve, including a move to greater unsubsidised use. The framework would be reviewed regularly to align with the evolving landscape including expanding its scope to the unsubsidised market as needed in the future. The legislative route could be explored as an option to enable this as part of the future review of the framework.

In the meantime, where relevant, this framework may be used as a voluntary framework by biomass users outside of the bioenergy subsidy regime, e.g. chemicals manufacturers, to improve public confidence and trust in the sustainability of the biomass used.

If delivered through a policy document, the initial scope of this framework would cover government incentive schemes for bioenergy to support the decarbonisation of power, heat, transport and industry including BECCS. This also includes policies that support the production of bio-based fuels such as biomethane and biomass-derived hydrogen which can have multiple decarbonisation applications. It would be expected that all relevant schemes will take steps to adopt the framework once published, noting it could take several years to fully adopt the framework if legislative changes are required. Where legislative schemes are updated to align with the common framework, the new criteria may not apply to existing participants in the scheme. It will not apply to participants under schemes that are closed to new participants. Existing terms on biomass sustainability would still apply to participants who are operating under contractual schemes, such as CfDs, because they have undertaken their investments on the basis of the applicable biomass sustainability terms and conditions within their signed contracts.

For existing schemes ending in the nearer term, it may not be feasible to adopt the framework before closure; there may be financial implications and costs to government and consumers that will need to be considered when implementing the framework.

For ongoing schemes which operate on a consignment basis, such as the RTFO and SAF Mandate, transition arrangements to the common framework will be set out when these schemes update their existing criteria.

Any future biomass policies launched after the common framework is published would be expected to align with the common framework. This overarching framework would continue to allow flexibility for the variable sectoral and technical needs of different biomass feedstocks and applications within the scope of this framework.

Implementation of this framework by individual policies in the future should consider options to avoid imposing unnecessary administrative burden on smaller operators. For example, appropriate exemptions from sustainability criteria could be introduced for small operators where compliance would be disproportionately burdensome and there is minimal risk of large-scale unsustainable biomass use.

1. Do you agree that the initial scope of the framework should be limited to bioenergy that is subject to government incentive schemes? If not, please explain why and provide evidence to support your response.

2. Do you agree that the common criteria should be delivered as a policy document and implemented through the relevant legislative or contractual frameworks of each individual biomass policy?

3. Should government consider a legislative route for implementing the common sustainability framework in the future, including expanding for non-subsidised uses? Please provide evidence to support your response.

Further details of how we expect the common framework to interact with existing and emerging biomass policies are described in the sub-sections below.

Power

Multiple sustainable biomass feedstocks can be used to generate electricity, playing a key role in the UK’s current electricity system, including through hundreds of small-scale generating stations. In 2024, around 14% of electricity generation came from biomass , and biomass may play an important role in future UK electricity generation via BECCS (see BECCS section below).

Currently, the majority of biomass use in the power sector is supported by government via subsidy schemes. These include schemes that are closed to new entrants, such as the Renewables Obligation (RO) and Feed in Tariff (FIT), as well as ongoing policies like the Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme. Most recently, the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), on the direction of the Secretary of State, signed a short-term Low-Carbon Dispatchable Contract for Difference (LCD CfD) with Drax on 5 November 2025. The new contract ensures Drax’s continued operation for four years from 2027 to 2031. Some power stations are also required to report emissions as part of the UK ETS (see section below).

Electricity support schemes such as RO and CfD include sustainability criteria as a condition for receiving support. These are based on RED I and the UK TPP/Timber Standard. For the forthcoming low-carbon dispatchable CfD for large-scale generation specifically, the sustainability criteria that will underpin the agreement are being further tightened. This includes increasing the proportion of woody biomass that must come from sustainable sources to 100%; reducing the allowable supply chain emissions and excluding material sourced from primary forests and old growth forests from receiving support payments.

Generators supported under existing schemes have invested in good faith based on current sustainability criteria. There is no plan to amend the sustainability criteria (to align with the common framework once finalised) for closed schemes, such as the RO, or CfDs already signed and entered into. Retrospective changes may affect investor confidence, increase costs for investors and/or bill payers, and in extreme cases, could impact fuel supplies and security of supply. Nevertheless, government keeps existing arrangements under review to ensure they remain fit for purpose taking account of the science and evidence base as it evolves.

Any future policies on biomass electricity developed after publication of the framework, including power BECCS, are expected to include sustainability criteria in line with this common framework. See further details under BECCS section.

Heat

Biomass feedstocks are utilised as a heat source to heat buildings as well as an energy source for industrial processes (as described in ‘Industrial use of Biomass’ section below). In 2024, 67% of renewable heat in the UK was generated using biomass (around 37 TWh) .

The primary form of Government support for biomass in heating to date has been through the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI), which is closed to new applicants. Ongoing support schemes include the Boiler Upgrade Scheme which offer grants of £5,000 to support the installation of biomass boilers up to 45 kW capacity in domestic and non-domestic buildings in rural areas off the gas grid. The Green Gas Support Scheme (GGSS) is another ongoing government incentive scheme supporting the production of biomethane for injection into the gas grid (see section below on ‘Biomethane Production’). Government also supports the use of biomass as the primary heat source in Heat Networks under one scheme funded by the Green Heat Network Fund (GHNF).

For most homes and buildings, the transition to clean heating will involve installing a heat pump, or connection to a heat network, as these are cost-effective, proven technologies. It is expected that biomass may continue to have a role in decarbonising certain properties such as some off gas grid homes and in Heat Networks either as heat supplied directly, or as recirculation of captured waste heat (i.e. from Biomass Combined Heat and Power (CHP)).

Government would require stronger evidence on their affordability for consumers, and the availability of sustainable feedstocks before taking a decision on whether to support the use of biomass derived renewable liquid heating fuels (RLHFs), like hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) for clean heating.

Schemes such as the RHI include biomass sustainability criteria requirements based on RED I and the UK TPP/Timber Standard. The Biomass Suppliers List (BSL) , which is a list of wood fuel that has proven to meet the sustainability criteria under RHI, is used by participants of RHI to show compliance with the criteria. As we progress towards the later years of the RHI, we would like to consider the future interaction between the common framework and the BSL. Any future policies to support the use of biomass to decarbonise heating is expected to align with the common framework for sustainability criteria. However, the framework is not intended to alter existing scheme requirements for participants.

Participants in the RHI or other heat sector schemes may be in scope of the UK ETS. Where participants are in scope, and where UK ETS sustainability criteria apply, they must demonstrate that they have met the UK ETS biomass sustainability criteria in order to be given credit. For further detail on the UK ETS see the section below.

4. What are your views on the role of the Biomass Suppliers List (BSL) post RHI and how government should frame the relationship between the common framework and BSL in relation to sustainability requirements?

Transport

Biomass feedstocks can be used to produce liquid and gaseous biofuels that, alongside other low carbon fuels and zero emission technologies, currently play an important role in the decarbonisation of the transport sector and will continue to do so as the UK transitions towards net zero 2050.

Since 2008, the RTFO has been the main government policy supporting the decarbonisation of fuels used in surface transport. Examples of these biofuels include biodiesel and bioethanol, typically blended into diesel and petrol respectively, while more recently we have seen increasing use of HVO (also known as renewable diesel) and biomethane .

Supported by the RTFO, biofuels made up 7.7% of surface transport fuel in 2024 and delivered 55 MtCO2e of GHG savings since its inception in 2008, which is around two thirds of transport’s GHG savings between 2008 and 2022. DfT recently published a Statutory Review of the RTFO, which reaffirmed the importance of low carbon fuels such as biofuels in surface transport decarbonisation and committed to consult on various aspects of the scheme, including options for increasing future targets.

Government has also been expanding its low carbon fuel policy framework beyond surface transport in support of wider transport decarbonisation efforts. In aviation, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Mandate came into force on 1 January 2025. Similar to the RTFO, this sets targets for fuel suppliers to ensure a proportion of their jet fuel is SAF (including SAF derived from biomass), starting at 2% in 2025, reaching 10% by 2030, and 22% by 2040. We are supporting SAF production in the UK by developing a Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM) to help de-risk domestic SAF production projects, thus creating both demand and supply side regulatory support from government for these fuels. We are also providing grant funding through the Advanced Fuels Fund to support first-of-a-kind SAF production plants, with £63m allocated across 17 UK projects for this financial year. The Spending Review 2025 committed to continue support for the production of SAF in the UK to 2029/30. Under the UK ETS, aircraft operators can submit emissions reduction claims for SAF which meet the eligibility criteria established in the RTFO. SAF is treated as producing zero emissions under the UK ETS. In the government response to the ‘Developing the UK Emissions Trading Scheme’ consultation, the UK ETS Authority committed to review the treatment of SAF under the UK ETS in light of the introduction of the UK SAF Mandate. The Authority will consult in due course.

Meanwhile the Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy (MDS) committed to consulting on the introduction of domestic regulations to drive uptake of low carbon fuels in maritime transport, including biofuels. This will sit alongside and complement action being taken through the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to deliver the IMO 2023 GHG Strategy . From 1 July 2026 domestic maritime voyages and in-port emissions involving vessels of 5,000 gross tonnage (GT) and above will be included in the UK ETS. The use of sustainable fuels including those derived from biomass will be incentivised through zero-rating from the start of the scheme. Further details on eligibility criteria for sustainable fuels will be set out in guidance in due course.

Policies such as RTFO and SAF Mandate include biomass sustainability criteria similar to RED II. Subject to the outcome of this consultation, DfT would look to update the RTFO and SAF Mandate in line with the common framework once published. For any future maritime policies, given the international nature of the policy area, the implementation of robust sustainability criteria in line with similar domestic and international policies and standards, will be essential. This will include consideration of the latest EU RED III criteria and the emerging work at the IMO on the implementation of LCA Guidelines, alongside the common framework criteria.

Biomethane Production

Biomethane is a biomass fuel produced from biogenic material such as food waste, manure and plants. These biogenic materials are broken down by microbes in the absence of oxygen in Anaerobic Digestion (AD) plants to produce biogas, which is then ‘upgraded’ by removing CO2 and other contaminants to produce biomethane. The resultant biomethane is chemically identical to fossil fuel gas and can be directly injected to the existing gas grid, representing 1% of total gas demand in 2024 .

Across a range of pathways, biomethane has an important role to play in the transition to net zero, decarbonising the gas supply, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and increasing our country’s energy security across a range of sectors. Currently, biomethane is primarily used to decarbonise heating (by means of gas grid injection), and in the longer term we expect it to be used flexibly across many different end-uses including industry, transport, and low carbon dispatchable power generation at gas-fired power plants. Government is assessing the strategic role of biomethane within the energy system to inform policy on a future framework for biomethane from 2028.

The government currently supports the production of biomethane which is injected into the gas grid through the Green Gas Support Scheme (GGSS) which closes to new applicants in March 2028. The GGSS includes biomass sustainability criteria covering land criteria (derived from RED I) and GHG criteria, derived from RED II. The scheme also requires at least 50% of all biomethane (by energy content) to be produced using wastes or residue feedstocks in view of the greater environmental benefits and carbon savings available relative to the use of crops. Given the GGSS scheme closure date and the already close alignment with the common framework proposals, we do not intend to amend existing GGSS sustainability requirements. This is because of the low risk of any distortions across biomass sectors and their sustainability practices which could inappropriately shift biomass feedstocks to different sectors.

Currently, biomethane producers may participate in both the GGSS and the RTFO scheme which offers support for biomethane use in transport, however producers are not able to claim for the same unit of biomethane under both schemes and each unit must comply with the respective scheme sustainability requirements. This is to offer flexibility for biomethane producers to participate in both schemes which recognises biomethanes value as a flexible fuel.

In February 2024, we issued the future policy framework for biomethane production: call for evidence (CfE) to inform post-GGSS policy development, assess the barriers to growth in the sector, and the options available to address them. We are considering the responses received from the CfE and are developing policy options on a future framework consultation we expect to publish in FY (financial year) 2025/26.

Any future biomethane policy will prioritise biomethane which is environmentally sustainable, in line with the common biomass sustainability framework recommendations, while also considering options for maximising carbon savings and supporting sustainable practices that contribute positively to the wider environment.

The UK ETS applies a zero emissions factor to combustion of biomethane where it is supplied directly to ETS installations. As outlined in the future policy framework for biomethane production call for evidence, the ETS Authority is considering whether the ETS could account for biomethane injected into the gas grid.

Hydrogen Production

Biogenic sources, such as biomass, biogas, and bio-based waste materials, can serve as feedstocks for hydrogen production through several pathways. Biomass gasification involves heating organic material in a controlled environment to produce syngas, which is then processed to extract hydrogen. Biogas reforming, on the other hand, utilises methane from anaerobic digestion of organic waste, converting it into hydrogen through steam reforming, similar to natural gas-based hydrogen production. Low carbon hydrogen may also be produced using biomass-derived electricity, for example using power BECCS to produce electrolytic hydrogen. The use of biomass-derived electricity would be classified as final bioenergy use and therefore the hydrogen product would be outside the scope of this biomass sustainability common framework. When combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS), these pathways using biogenic feedstocks can produce low or even negative emission hydrogen (See BECCS section below).

The Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (LCHS) sets the definition for what the Government considers to be ‘low carbon’ production of hydrogen, which includes biomass sustainability criteria (land criteria) as well as a strict GHG emissions methodology. It takes a technology agnostic approach, establishing a methodology for calculating GHG emissions from hydrogen derived from renewable, biomass and fossil sources and sets a maximum emissions threshold for hydrogen production. Compliance with the LCHS is a condition for accessing support through the Hydrogen Production Business Model. We expect to update the LCHS to align with the common framework, where appropriate.

Low carbon hydrogen, including biomass derived hydrogen is also eligible to receive support through the RTFO and SAF Mandate when used to support decarbonisation of transport. (see Transport section).

Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)

Certain applications of bioenergy can incorporate CCS at the point of use. CCS can also be incorporated at the biomass fuel production stage as described under the biomethane and Hydrogen sections above. BECCS can be a carbon-negative technology that removes CO₂ from the atmosphere while producing renewable energy. During the energy generation process, CO₂ emissions are captured using carbon capture technology, preventing them from being released into the atmosphere. The captured CO₂ is then compressed and transported for permanent storage in deep geological formations like saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields.

BECCS could be an important tool for achieving global net-zero targets, as it not only offsets emissions but also actively removes CO₂ from the atmosphere. Most 1.5C compliant climate modelling scenarios used for the IPCC 6th Assessment Report , consider BECCS essential for meeting long-term climate goals and mitigating the effects of climate change. Examples of BECCS include power BECCS, industrial BECCS (including industrial Energy from Waste (EfW) BECCS), Biomethane BECCS and hydrogen (H2) BECCS.

Specific BECCS pathways can also be considered greenhouse gas removal (GGR) operations if net negative emissions can be achieved based on the life cycle assessment. Where they do not, such as some industrial BECCS pathways, these would not be considered as GGR, but a decarbonisation pathway to support reduction in emissions within the industrial sector. The Government has committed to developing a GGR Standard which will be published in due course. The technology-specific GGR methodologies are currently being developed by BSI who were commissioned in September 2024. BSI has already published initial BECCS and DACCS quantification specifications in July 2025 after a BSI-led consultation with a range of stakeholders. Going forward, we have asked BSI to build on that work but to also align wherever possible and appropriate for the UK context, with the EU CRCF (Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming) directive and permanent carbon removal regulation The fleshed out detailed methodologies are expected to be delivered in 2027. The initial specifications will be further fleshed out into detailed methodologies. The primary purpose is to ensure that any carbon removal activities if supported by government in the future under schemes such as the GGR Business model, and Waste ICC Business model – for technologies such as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) or BECCS generate carbon credits that are robust, measurable, verifiable, and permanent.

The GGR Standard once developed will include biomass sustainability requirements and the intention is to align with this common framework, as relevant, to ensure that any biomass supported under relevant future BECCS policy incentive schemes, if launched, would only support the use of sustainable biomass. In May 2025 government commissioned an independent review of GGRs, to consider how options for GGRs, including large-scale Power Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS), can assist the UK in meeting our net zero targets, out to 2050. The findings were published on 23 October, and the government will now consider the recommendations and respond in due course.

For any future projects supported under the Industrial Carbon Capture (ICC) business model, which use biomass fuels or feedstocks, it is expected that they will be required to demonstrate compliance with the relevant UK ETS biomass criteria (see section below). This is because part of the subsidy payment under the ICC business model is designed to reflect the emitter’s counterfactual exposure to the UK ETS, i.e., the emissions which, if not captured, would otherwise have been subject to the carbon price.

Industrial uses of biomass

Sustainable biomass is a renewable low carbon source of energy (i.e. Bioenergy) and input material for industrial processes. For instance, it could be used as a low carbon fuel for industrial processes like cement manufacturing or as a feedstock to make products like bio-based chemicals (see section below on biomass for non-energy uses). Government recognises the role of biomass use in industry to meet net zero, particularly where there are limited alternatives to biomass to decarbonise industrial processes or products. This includes long term uses in combination with carbon capture to generate negative emissions (see section above on BECCS), and in the short and medium term as a transitional fuel, and non-energy uses in industry (see section below on Biomass for non-energy use).

The government is committed to developing a new plan for industrial decarbonisation where it will outline its approach for a competitive low carbon industrial base in the UK, ensuring growth opportunities are captured in tandem with emissions reductions. The government has set out further details on its plans to decarbonise industry in its Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan, published on 29 October. Future government policies to support the use of biomass in industry will be expected to align with the common framework for sustainability criteria.

UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS)

The UK ETS is an essential part of our approach to cutting emissions and driving green investment. It sets a limit on emissions, creating a carbon price for the power sector, heavy industry and aviation, incentivising investment in the clean technologies that will power and supply the economy of the future. The UK ETS is jointly run by the UK ETS Authority (‘the Authority’), made up of the UK Government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs for Northern Ireland (DAERA). Currently under the UK ETS, sustainability criteria are applied to bioliquids, in line with EU RED I.

Where ETS operators can demonstrate adherence to this sustainability criteria when combusting bioliquids, they can zero-rate these emissions. In July 2022, as part of the “Developing the UK Emissions Trading Scheme” consultation the Authority consulted on introducing sustainability criteria to solid and gaseous biomass fuels in scope of the UK ETS (power and energy intensive industries). In the response to this consultation, the Authority signalled that it aims to align the UK ETS sustainability criteria with those used in other UK biomass policy areas. The Authority identified aligning the UK ETS with the sustainability criteria in EU RED II would also harmonise with other UK policies, such as the RTFO. This was intended to ensure that there would be some familiarity amongst relevant UK industry with the criteria to be implemented. Currently, the Authority still intends to align the UK ETS biomass sustainability criteria to other UK policy areas. Therefore, the Authority will consider wider responses to this consultation in drawing up future policy proposals for updated biomass sustainability criteria for the UK ETS. To support this, responses to questions in this consultation, where they pertain to the UK ETS, will be shared with the Authority, which includes officials from the UK Government as well as those of the Devolved Governments (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) to support development of UK ETS policy on biomass sustainability.

Biomass for non-bioenergy uses

Biomass for non-energy uses, such as the production of chemicals, timber products and other materials, is currently not produced under government subsidy support, and therefore not in scope of this framework. Government recognises that the use of biomass as a sustainable feedstock is an area that is developing rapidly in certain areas, such as the chemicals sector and enabled by engineering biology and industrial biotechnology. However, further work is required to understand the complex supply chains and pathways associated with use of biomass within the non-energy sectors and determine appropriate sustainability requirements and its impacts on those sectors. This consultation is being used to gather initial views and evidence on how this framework could be expanded in the future to include these sectors (see questions under relevant individual chapters later in this consultation). Other traditional uses of biomass such as timber products and paper are also currently not in scope of this framework .

The sustainability requirements developed within this framework are subject to evolving evidence and will need to be updated regularly to remain in line with advancements. The scope of application of the framework should also be regularly reviewed to in line with evolving bioenergy use and prioritisation policies in the UK in line with the government’s wider objectives. However, these updates must be balanced with the need to provide stability and predictability for businesses, avoiding disruption from frequent or unpredictable policy changes. Therefore, on balance, it is proposed that the framework is reviewed and updated guidance published every five years. This should not prevent individual biomass policies from updating their schemes to reflect any emerging technologies or issues as relevant in between these updates.

5. Do you agree that the updated policy guidance document should be published every 5 years? Please provide evidence to support your response or an alternative proposal for review timelines.

2. Biomass Feedstock Categories & Definitions

For the purposes of this framework, a biomass feedstock is defined as any solid, liquid or gaseous material of biological origin, including the biodegradable fraction of products, wastes and residues from biological origin, which is consistent with other international definitions of biomass feedstock such as IPCC and EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) . This definition covers a broad range of potential biomass feedstock types in scope of the framework, with varying requirements on sustainability. Therefore, throughout this consultation we have used key biomass feedstock categories and definitions to clarify which criteria applies to which biomass feedstock group. This will enable biomass users/generators to understand what requirements they need to follow and report against to show compliance with the framework criteria, further details of which are set out in the MRV chapter. We have used a list of key feedstock categories, and their definitions as set out in Table 2.1. These are based on existing definitions and aim to avoid divergence with existing UK policies and frameworks. They are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and certain feedstock categories may be a subset of others. The following chapters will make clear what requirements apply to each feedstock categories.

Table 2.1: Key biomass feedstock categories and definitions

Feedstock category Definition Forest derived biomass Any biomass derived from the trees or shrubs in a forest. Sawmill/wood industry residues and wastes. Residues generated directly during the processing of wood at a sawmill or from the wood industry (does not include forestry residues).

Can include sawdust, small offcuts, wood shavings or bark. Biomass, including residues, from trees or shrubs from land that is not forest or agricultural land Wood materials sourced from urban areas, parks, gardens, and other land that is neither forest nor agriculture land. This includes tree trimmings, pruning waste, and other woody residues generated from urban forestry and landscape maintenance activities. Woody biomass Woody biomass is a term commonly used in some existing UK sustainability criteria. For the purposes of this consultation, woody biomass is organic material composed of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, such as biomass sourced from forests, woody energy crops, post-consumer waste wood, sawmill residues and forest-based industries’ residues and wastes. Energy crops Crops that consist of non-food cellulosic material or ligno-cellulosic material, except saw logs and veneer logs, which:

- are grown for the purpose of being used as fuel or energy

- are not a residue or a waste

- would not normally be used for food or feed

Includes both woody and non-woody crops, eg:

- short rotation coppice (SRC) (woody energy crop)

- miscanthus, reed canary grass, switchgrass (non-woody energy crops)

Based on RTFO Other crops Crops that do not fall under the definition of energy crops. This could include food / feed crops that are typically grown and harvested for the primary purpose of human or animal consumption. Short Rotation Forestry (SRF) Tree plantations that use fast-growing species. These trees are harvested on shorter rotations than conventional forestry, typically every 10-20 years.

Based on Forest Research definition Residues, including processing residues A substance that is not the end product sought directly from the process; the production of which is not a primary aim of the process; and in respect of which the process has not been deliberately modified in order to produce it.

Since some substances or materials that are produced in a production process (but are not the target product of the process, such as woodchips and sawdust at the sawmill) can have economic value, waste materials may well lose their waste characteristics (non-waste) and thus become processing residues.

Based on RED II/III Residues from agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, forestry Residues that are directly generated by agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, forestry. It does not include residues from related industries or residues from processing.

Residues from agriculture includes straw, husks, and other by-products from crop production.

Residues from forestry includes branch wood, diseased wood and storm salvage from natural disturbances, or treetops.

Based on RED II/III Wastes Any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard. This definition excludes substances that have been intentionally modified or contaminated for the purpose of transforming it into a waste.

Based on RED II/III (point (1) of Article 3 of Directive 2008/98/EC) Wastes from agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, forestry Wastes that are directly generated by agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, forestry. It does not include wastes from related industries or residues from processing.

Based on RED II/III Residual Municipal Solid Waste Municipal solid waste refers to non-recyclable household waste and that from other sources which is similar in nature and composition to household waste, including ‘household-like’ waste generated by businesses and collected by private contractors.

Municipal solid waste will have both a biogenic and fossil component and includes a mixture of materials such as waste food, paper, plastics, glass, metals and textiles.

Note that table 2.1 does not provide a comprehensive list of all biomass feedstocks and further guidance on fuel classification against these categories would need to be provided to operators participating in future biomass policies and schemes as they adopt this framework. We expect this to be provided as guidance by relevant authorities responsible for checking compliance with the framework under the relevant future biomass schemes/policies, as needed as per current practice within existing schemes. In particular, classifying something as a waste or residue is a complex area and requires further guidance to be provided by relevant authorities responsible for checking compliance with the framework.

6. Do you agree with the list of key feedstock categories and their definitions in scope of the common framework? Please provide evidence to support your response.

The following chapters set out the detailed policy proposals under the land criteria and GHG criteria for the common framework and include discussion on feedstocks in scope of each set of criteria. The final chapter sets out proposals on the associated monitoring, reporting and verification requirements to show compliance with the land and GHG criteria.

3. Land Criteria

3.1 The case for land criteria

For biomass use to be sustainable, it must be low carbon but also be compatible with wider environmental goals (such as protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services). Biomass feedstocks, if sourced unsustainably, can lead to negative environmental consequences through land use change, poor land management and overexploitation of land. To prevent this, biomass supported by existing UK incentive schemes and policies is required to comply with land criteria. The greenhouse gas emissions associated with the whole supply chain are addressed separately under the Greenhouse Gas Criteria in Chapter 4.

The existing land criteria put in place environmental protections and social requirements; ensure good forest management practices are followed; and areas of high carbon stock are protected. These criteria apply to the sourcing of biomass feedstocks (see Table 3.1 in ‘3.2 Land Criteria Structure & Scope’ section), regardless of whether it is sourced domestically or internationally. The requirements differ according to the type of the biomass feedstock and the impact it could have on different types of land (i.e. forest and agricultural) and soil, which would continue under the common framework.

Currently, the requirements vary by sector because each scheme independently developed its own requirements based on UK Timber Procurement Policy or on EU RED I and RED II. The common sustainability framework aims to align and strengthen these requirements, in line with principles set out in Chapter 1, to give clarity to the bioenergy market and ensure a high level of environmental and social integrity across all uses. This includes an assessment of potential biomass supply impacts, where evidence is available.

Summary tables are included at the top of the agricultural land criteria, soil criteria and forest criteria sections comparing the proposals to existing criteria for each section.

3.2 Land criteria structure & scope

Raw feedstocks (the natural materials such as those set out in chapter 2 to make biomass fuels) are sourced from many different land types and industries. Different protections are therefore needed depending on feedstock type. The land criteria requirements therefore consist of:

The agricultural land criteria [page 36 to 48]

Seeks to minimise the carbon and wider environmental impacts (e.g. biodiversity) of bioenergy feedstocks grown on agricultural land through qualitative measures such as preventing the sourcing of feedstocks from land that has been recently converted from certain ‘prohibited land categories’, namely areas of high biodiverse value and areas of high carbon stock. It also includes consideration of measures to prevent indirect land use change (ILUC) risks.

The soil carbon criteria [page 48 to 50]

Minimises potential impacts of the growing, cultivation and harvesting bioenergy feedstocks on soil health and soil carbon via measures such as requirement to have soil monitoring plans.

The forest criteria [pages 50 to 72]

Seeks to minimise carbon and wider environmental and social impacts of bioenergy feedstocks sourced from forests through requirements on sustainable forest management practices, including on forest carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The following sections of this chapter set out further detail on the proposed criteria under the common framework (and where they differ from existing UK and international criteria), including proposals on which feedstocks need to comply with which criteria as shown in table 3.1 below. We are inviting feedback and evidence on these proposals through this consultation. Note: further detail and questions on which feedstocks should comply with each section of the land criteria are set out under the relevant sections.

Table 3.1: Proposed land criteria requirements for each feedstock type under the common framework.

Feedstock category Proposed requirements Forest derived biomass, including residues from forestry or wastes from forestry. Forest criteria

Note: Sawmill residues currently do not have to meet forest criteria under some existing UK schemes (such as RTFO, SAF Mandate and LCHS) and EU RED III. Sawmill/ wood industry residues and wastes. Short Rotation Forestry (SRF) Residues from agriculture or wastes from agriculture Agricultural land criteria and soil carbon criteria Residues, including processing residues, which are not residues from agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, forestry or sawmill/wood industry Exempt from land criteria Wastes, which are not wastes from agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, forestry or sawmill/ wood industry Biomass, including residues, from trees or shrubs from land that is not forest or agricultural land Energy crops Agricultural land criteria. Seeking views on application of soil criteria

Note: Energy crops under existing UK schemes and EU RED III currently do not have to comply with soil criteria. ‘Other crops’ where whole plant is used Agricultural land criteria. Seeking views on application of soil criteria.

Note: These do not have comply with soil criteria under existing UK schemes and EU RED III. Any other feedstock, e.g. biomass from trees or shrubs on agricultural land that is not a forest (e.g. agroforestry) Agricultural land criteria.

3.3 Policy Proposals: agricultural land criteria

The case for agricultural land criteria

There are growing pressures on global land use both from the supply side (including as a consequence of climate change, e.g. desertification, sea level rise or impacts on yields) and from the demand side (population growth, resource use increase and land set aside for nature protection).

As demand for low carbon biomass energy increases, it places additional pressures on global land use to grow crops for bioenergy use, as well as for food. In 2023, biofuels accounted for 15% of global maize consumption and 17% of global vegetable oil consumption.

Increased demand for bioenergy feedstocks produced on agricultural land can therefore have implications on the level and volatility of agricultural prices. It can also result in additional land being converted to agriculture, if yield increases cannot keep up with increasing demand. Land use change can occur through Direct Land Use Change (DLUC) and Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC). DLUC relates to when an area of land is converted to cropland for bioenergy from another use, which may have positive or negative GHG impacts. ILUC relates to where non-agricultural land (e.g. forest) elsewhere is brought into agricultural production due to displacement of existing food and feed crops by biomass production, which will generally have negative GHG impacts.

Emissions resulting from land use change can outweigh the GHG savings achieved by switching to bioenergy, particularly if the conversion occurs to land with high carbon stock (such as forests, wetlands and peatland). When high carbon stock land is cleared for agricultural use, much of the carbon stored is released into the atmosphere. In addition, the capacity of the land to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere may also be compromised.

Land use change to cropland for bioenergy can also have negative impacts on other environmental goals, such as biodiversity, depending on site specific factors. For example, where a highly biodiverse area is converted to monoculture cropland.

The following sections sets out further details for each of the proposals shown in table 3.2 above, including key consultation questions as part of each proposal. We welcome views on these proposals.

Direct land use change (DLUC) – Prohibited land categories

In England, the principles of the Land Use Framework will include sustainability considerations regarding the conversion of other land uses, including food-producing agricultural land. The Land Use Framework will set out the principles, evidence, data and tools needed to help safeguard our most productive agricultural land and achieve our climate and nature targets.

This section covers proposals for prohibited land categories under the common framework, namely different types of land with high biodiverse value and high carbon stock.

Separately, the GHG criteria set out in chapter 4 of this consultation includes principles that seek to account for the carbon impacts of direct land use change (see section ‘Common parameters for calculating GHG life cycle emissions’).

The land criteria aim to provide protections against the use of land with high carbon stock and high biodiverse value for growing bioenergy crops. Existing criteria (both UK and international) include ‘prohibited land categories’ as a way to achieve this. These are land categories on which biomass feedstocks cannot be grown at all, as well as categories where the harvesting of biomass feedstocks must not change the status of the land.

In existing UK and international criteria, the land categories relate to the status that the land had in January 2008, which is derived from the original EU RED I. This prevents land which met the description of a ‘prohibited land category’ in January 2008, but since then has been converted to a different land category, from being utilised for bioenergy.

In some circumstances, and for certain protected land types (e.g. designated nature protection areas and non-natural grassland), the application of good land management practices means that material can be harvested from protected areas without damaging the integrity of the land. In these instances, the existing criteria include exclusions which allow feedstocks to be sourced from these land categories provided they can evidence that the pre-requisite good land management practices have been observed.

Building on existing criteria and including prohibited land categories in the common framework would ensure consistency across domestic and international requirements and reduce administrative burden. Retaining the reference date of January 2008 would also bring the same benefits in terms of international alignment and reducing administrative burden.

Therefore, we propose that the common sustainability framework continues to include prohibited land categories within the agricultural land criteria in line with latest EU criteria (RED III). The full list of specific land categories to be protected including up-to-date definitions are outlined below. This builds on existing criteria and includes proposals for the inclusion of new protected land categories within the common framework. We also propose retaining the reference date of January 2008 from existing UK and international criteria. The UK and Global Bioenergy Resource Model already excludes these land categories and so we do not expect these proposals to have a significant impact on future biomass availability.

7. Do you agree that the agricultural land criteria should continue to include prohibited land categories in line with existing criteria? Please provide evidence to support your response.

8. Do you agree that the baseline should be set in January 2008? Please provide evidence to support your answer or provide an alternative proposal for when the baseline should be set.

Prohibited Land Categories – Areas of high biodiverse value

Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth and is the building block of our ecosystems.

When areas of high biodiverse value are converted to agricultural use, the biodiversity and ecosystems can be harmed or destroyed. In line with the principle of minimising wider environmental harm, to protect these important land categories and prevent biodiversity loss, biomass should not be sourced from these areas.

However, we recognise that biomass can be cultivated within some important land types without damaging the land or ecosystems and can be harvested sustainably if the correct measures are taken. In some cases, cultivating and harvesting biomass can be essential for maintaining that land status.

Therefore, we propose that raw material cannot be obtained from land that had one of the following statuses in or after January 2008, irrespective of whether the land continues to have that status:

Primary forest, old growth forest, highly biodiverse forest, heathland and natural highly biodiverse grassland;

Non-natural highly biodiverse grassland, unless evidence is provided that the harvesting of the raw material is necessary to preserve its status as highly biodiverse grassland;

Areas designated for nature protection, unless evidence is provided that the production of that raw material did not interfere with those nature protection purposes.

Table 3.3 provides definitions for the protected land categories of high biodiverse value. These definitions align with the latest, up to date criteria developed by EU (RED III), allowing for consistency for suppliers operating across multiple jurisdictions. We propose that the common framework adopts these definitions.

Table 3.3: Definitions of land categories of high biodiverse value.

Land category Definition Proposed sourcing requirement Primary forest Woodland of native species, where there is no clearly visible indication of human activity and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed.

Based on RED II/RED III Sourcing not permitted Old growth forest As defined in the country where the forest is located. If a definition for ‘old growth forest’ is not available in the country in which the forest is located, then ‘old growth forest’ has the following meaning: a forest stand or area consisting of native tree species that have developed, predominantly through natural processes, structures and dynamics normally associated with late-seral developmental phases in primary or undisturbed forests of the same type, and in which any visible signs of former human activities are gradually disappearing or are too limited to significantly disturb natural processes.

Prohibited Land Categories – Areas of high carbon stock

Land with high carbon stocks is a natural carbon store and sink. When high carbon stock land is cleared for agricultural use, much of the carbon stored in the biomass is released into the atmosphere. In addition, the capacity of the land to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere may also be compromised or reduced. Therefore, when these land categories change to an alternative land use, emissions resulting from the land use change can outweigh the GHG savings achieved by the use of biomass.

In order to prevent unintended adverse carbon impacts from land use change, we propose that raw material cannot be obtained from land that had one of the following statuses in January 2008, and no longer has that status:

Wetlands and continuously forested areas;

Lightly forested area, unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after it was converted for the production of biofuels was such that there is no breach of the GHG emission saving thresholds (see chapter 4 for further details on GHG criteria).

We also propose that material cannot be sourced from land that was peatland in January 2008, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil.

Table 3.4 provides definitions for the protected land categories of high carbon stock. These definitions align with the latest, up to date international criteria (EU RED III), allowing for consistency for suppliers operating across multiple jurisdictions. We propose that the common framework adopts these definitions.

Table 3.4: Definitions of land categories of high carbon stock.

Land category Definition Proposed sourcing requirement Continuously forested area Land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of more than 30%, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ.

Based on RED II/RED III Sourcing not permitted. Lightly forested area Land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of between 10% and 30%, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ.

Based on RED II/RED III Sourcing not permitted, unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after it was converted for the production of biomass for energy was such that there is no breach of the GHG emission saving thresholds. Peatland Areas with soils containing organic material (peat substrate) of a cumulative thickness of at least 30 cm at a depth of down to 60 cm. The organic matter contains at least 20 mass percent of organic carbon in the fine soil.

Based on RED II/RED III Sourcing not permitted, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil. Wetland Land that is covered with, or saturated by, water permanently or for a significant part of the year.

Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC)

As demand for biomass feedstocks increases, there are additional pressures on global land use to grow crops for bioenergy use, as well as to maintain adequate food supply. Competition with food crops has the potential to pose a high ILUC risk where non-agricultural land (e.g. forest) elsewhere is brought into agricultural production due to displacement of existing food and feed crops by biomass production. Although ILUC is much more challenging to predict, measure and address, it is nonetheless potentially as important as Direct Land Use Change (DLUC) and can have a significant effect on the carbon impact of bioenergy.

This section explores possible policy measures under the land criteria that could be adopted to minimise the impacts of ILUC from biomass. The GHG criteria chapter (‘ILUC emissions within GHG criteria’ section) explores potential quantitative measures that could be adopted such as the use of ILUC factors that could be included within the GHG emissions calculations, noting that modelling to quantitatively predict ILUC implications comes with significant uncertainties.

Existing UK and international schemes have introduced policies which seek to limit competition between bioenergy and food which can help to limit the level and volatility of agricultural prices (due to bioenergy demand) and minimise ILUC risks. These include crop caps, phasing out of high ILUC risk feedstocks and other indirect measures such as incentivising the use of low ILUC risk feedstocks e.g. wastes. Government incentive schemes should continue to consider and address ILUC risk in their scheme designs, especially where risks are sector specific.

Current evidence suggests that crop-derived and oil-based feedstocks carry a much higher ILUC risk than forest derived feedstocks, which is why ILUC is considered as part of the Agricultural Land Criteria.

Crop cap

Bioenergy from crop-derived feedstocks can place bioenergy in direct competition with food requirements (although bioenergy can provide a market for cover crops that enhance soil health). In 2023, arable land used for bioenergy crops in the UK was 133 thousand hectares which equated to 2.2% of the total arable area.

The RTFO introduced a ‘crop cap’ in 2018 to restrict the maximum amount of biofuel from crop-derived feedstocks (except for dedicated energy crops) that can be rewarded under the RTFO. The cap decreases incrementally from 4% in 2018 to 2% in 2032. The EU also have a ‘crop cap’ in place for transport fuels set at a maximum of 7%.

The UK SAF mandate currently goes further. SAF produced from food, feed or energy crops is not eligible for support under the scheme.

Factors impacting the level at which a crop cap is set are sector specific; for example, the type and source of crop-derived feedstocks used in a particular sector, the availability of alternative feedstocks and scale of demand for those feedstocks. Therefore, a crop cap set at a cross-sector level may not be the best approach and it could be more appropriate for individual biomass policy schemes to conduct sector specific analysis to determine if a crop cap is required and at what level it should be set. The analysis could include the level of ILUC risk from crop derived feedstocks and the availability of alternative feedstocks.

Regardless of whether a crop cap is set at sector level or at cross-sector level, we will continue to monitor use of crops across all UK bioenergy industries, this could include the land area used for bioenergy crops and the implications this might have on food security and ILUC.

17. Should the crop cap be set at a sector level subject to sector specific ILUC risk assessments? If not, please suggest what level a cross-sector crop cap should be set at and provide evidence to support your response.

18. If crop caps are set at a sector level, what factors should be included in the sector-specific food competition and ILUC risk assessment? What should this assessment consist of? Please provide evidence to support your response.

19. What factors should be monitored at a cross-sector level to highlight emerging risks regarding food competition and ILUC risks from crop derived feedstocks?

High ILUC risk feedstocks

Some feedstocks have a higher risk of displacing agricultural crops or indirectly contributing to deforestation.

The EU has introduced restrictions on ‘high ILUC risk feedstocks’, gradually phasing out their use by 2030. The EU identifies high ILUC risk feedstocks based on criteria which determine whether there is significant expansion of their feedstock production areas into high carbon stock land. Feedstocks are periodically assessed against the criteria to ensure the feedstocks identified as high ILUC risk is up to date. Currently, the only feedstock identified as high ILUC risk by the EU, following this methodology, is palm oil.

The EU has also set out conditions for certifying a specific source of a high ILUC risk feedstock (i.e. palm oil) as low ILUC risk. Where a consignment of feedstock meets these conditions, it is exempt from the phase out.

The UK could introduce a similar phase out of high ILUC risk feedstocks for bioenergy uses. This could either be at a cross-sector level or individual sectors might choose to restrict specific feedstocks if they are particularly prevalent in that sector. However, further work is required to set out an appropriate methodology to identify high ILUC risk feedstocks and understand any unintended impacts that a phase out of these feedstocks might have, including assessing how any such policy could be implemented in line with international treaties (such as WTO compliance).

20. How could high ILUC risk feedstocks be identified? Please include what factors could be considered and provide evidence to support your response.

21. Should high ILUC risk feedstocks be phased out? If yes, please provide a timeframe and state if it should be at a cross-sector or individual sector level. Please provide evidence to support your response and explain how this could be done in compliance with international rules, e.g. WTO compliance.

Other indirect measures

Some UK support schemes seek to reduce ILUC risk by incentivising the use of low ILUC risk feedstocks, such as wastes. For example, the GGSS and LCHS require that a minimum of 50% of the total biogas yield is derived from waste or residue-based feedstocks and the RTFO awards twice the amount of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) per litre to biofuels derived from certain wastes and residues.

Whilst these measures are out of scope of the common framework, we are interested in other ways that ILUC risk might be reduced through the common framework.

22. Are there other approaches (beyond those suggested above) that should be considered to limit ILUC impacts of bioenergy feedstocks, in particular with regards to competition with food?

23. Are there any other issues (e.g. social or other environmental) that should be considered as part of the agricultural land criteria?

Feedstocks in scope of agricultural land criteria

As a default, we have proposed that all feedstocks, unless specifically identified as having to meet the forest criteria or as exempt (see table 3.1 in section ‘Land Criteria Structure & Scope’), should have to comply with the agricultural land criteria. This provides protection for high value land categories, regardless of the feedstock, and ensures that new feedstocks are captured by the sustainability criteria.

Dedicated energy crops are considered to automatically meet the land criteria in some existing UK support schemes (such as the RO and CfD), if they have been planted to meet requirements in supply-side incentive schemes (e.g. The Energy Crops Regulations 2000 – now revoked). This is to reduce barriers to energy crop production and avoid the need for unnecessary further certification.

However, energy crops also present similar risks to other agricultural crops with regards to land use change. Therefore, on balance, we feel it is proportionate to require energy crops to meet the agricultural land criteria. This aligns with the current approach taken by the RTFO, LCHS and international criteria (RED III).

Government recognises that some jurisdictions (including the UK) regulate certain woody energy crops, such as SRC, within their respective forestry regulatory regime, rather than as agriculture. Government would like to make clear that the inclusion of SRC within the agricultural land criteria (rather than the forest criteria) for support under energy schemes would not supersede the regulatory framework within the country/region of harvest. For example, SRC grown in the UK should meet all domestic regulations (under the forestry regulatory regime) and, if it is to be eligible for government support under the common framework, meet the agricultural land criteria.

24. Do you agree that, unless otherwise specified, all feedstocks should have to comply with the agricultural land criteria? If not, please explain why and provide evidence to support your response.

25. Should dedicated energy crops be required to meet the agricultural land criteria? If not, please explain why and provide evidence to support your response.

26. Do you have evidence regarding the impact of requiring energy crops to meet the agricultural land criteria? We are particularly interested in potential impacts on planting targets and spatial distribution of energy crops.

Compliance with the agricultural land criteria

The agricultural land criteria are broadly the same as existing sustainability criteria (the common framework aligns definitions and adds some prohibited land categories). Existing schemes have comprehensive guidance on demonstrating compliance with the agricultural land criteria.

Generally, this can be done via a recognised and benchmarked voluntary scheme or through bespoke evidence. Bespoke evidence can include aerial photographs or maps from trusted sources (e.g. government agencies). Further information on current evidencing requirements is included in monitoring and verification sections of the MRV chapter.

27. Should the types of evidence for demonstrating compliance with agricultural land criteria be kept aligned with existing criteria? If not, please outline what changes should be made.

28. Please highlight any specific cost implications to your business/sector in meeting the proposed agricultural land criteria. Please provide evidence to support your response.

3.4 Policy Proposals: soil criteria

The case for soil criteria

Soil carbon is key to maintaining overall soil quality, providing structure to the soil and a reservoir of nutrients, as well as other ecosystem services such as supporting microbial activity and water quality and retention. This is essential for sustaining plant/crop productivity. Soil carbon accounting is discussed as part of the GHG criteria (see ‘soil carbon accounting’ section under chapter 4).

Land management decisions, such as leaving agricultural residues on the land to decompose and crop rotation decisions, play a key role in maintaining soil quality and carbon services. Bioenergy demand should not contribute to land management decisions that have a detrimental impact on the site’s soil quality and soil carbon content.

Summary of Proposals

Table 3.5: key changes proposed in the common framework for the soil criteria compared to existing criteria.

RO / CfD / GGSS / RHI RTFO / SAF mandate / LCHS (RED II based) EU RED III Common Framework proposals Not included Requires soil management and monitoring plans. Aligns with RTFO. Aligns with RTFO and RED III.

Under the common framework, we propose that the land from which raw feedstock is sourced is subject to established soil monitoring and management plans to minimise the impact of the growing, harvesting and removal of biomass on the site’s soil quality and soil carbon. These monitoring and management plans could be administered by either the supplier of the biomass or the relevant national authority.

This approach already aligns with some existing UK policies (RTFO and LCHS sustainability criteria) and international best practice (EU RED III). The common framework will therefore expand the scope of this requirement to other biomass incentive schemes to enable greater alignment within the UK and international frameworks.

29. Do you agree that the land on which the raw feedstock was grown should be subject to soil monitoring and management plans? Please provide evidence to support your response.

30. Are there any additional aspects that should be included in the soil criteria? Please explain what these are, how they could be implemented and the rationale for inclusion.

Feedstocks in scope of the soil criteria

After a harvest, some agricultural residues are typically left on the land to decompose, or in some systems burnt in place. The decomposition of organic waste in-situ has the potential to deliver soil quality and carbon services.

However, as demand for feedstocks for bioenergy increases, agricultural residues that would have traditionally been left on land to decompose, are at risk of being removed.

As such, we propose that agricultural residues should comply with the soil cr",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-12-02 10:58:21.648762

The study, carried out by the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), identifies several feedstock options for SAF production. These include waste materials such as agricultural residues and municipal solid waste.

During the public presentation of the report on Monday, Cesar Velarde, the lead consultant from ICAO’s Office of Environment, said SAF development would bring multiple environmental benefits by supporting the circular economy and cutting emissions from aviation.

“This marks the beginning of a new path for the future of aviation by helping make air travel more sustainable, lowering reliance on traditional energy sources, and opening up opportunities in sectors such as agriculture, waste management and energy,” Velarde said.

The findings support ICAO’s global goals to reduce emissions through greater use of SAF. Several regions, including the European Union, India and Brazil, have already introduced mandatory SAF use. Velarde noted that Uganda’s aviation sector and other industries stand to gain significantly from SAF production.

The next phase will involve a business implementation study to identify a viable SAF project and attract industry partners and investors. According to Velarde, the feedstock options identified in the study could help cut emissions by 80% to 90% over the fuel’s lifecycle, contributing to the decarbonisation of air travel.

UCAA Deputy Director General Olive Birungi Lumonya stressed the need to meet global carbon reduction commitments, including the 5% target set for Africa. She said the feasibility report confirms Uganda’s ability to support SAF production, adding that the UCAA will now focus on business planning and moving toward actual implementation. She also mentioned that fuel companies such as Tri-star are ready to adjust their systems for SAF production.

The feasibility study marks an important milestone in Uganda’s broader efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and build a more sustainable aviation sector. The report also outlines steps the government is expected to take to support growth in the SAF industry.

Ronny Barongo, UCAA’s Director of Safety, Security and Economic Regulation, thanked ICAO and the UK government for their assistance with the study. He said Uganda remains committed to environmental protection and climate action, noting the country’s participation in the ICAO Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) since 2019.

“The release of the SAF feasibility report is timely and marks a major turning point,” he said.

Barongo reaffirmed UCAA’s commitment to advancing sustainability, encouraging innovation and ensuring Uganda keeps up with global progress in green aviation technology. He highlighted the need for coordinated action, supportive policies and long-term investment to make SAF a reality.

He added that Uganda is well positioned to become a regional leader in sustainable aviation and to contribute to international goals to reduce aviation emissions by 5% by 2030. The study provides a detailed review of Uganda’s capacity to produce and use SAF and will guide cooperation between government agencies, aviation partners and other stakeholders. It also examines the technical, economic and environmental factors that will determine the success of SAF projects in the country.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SAF-01.jpeg,N,,2025-12-02 10:58:30.103871

The Sixth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made it very clear that the natural carbon cycle on Earth has been shifted by human activity, especially over the past 200 years1. The resulting increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and the oceans have led to substantial changes in our climate and many ecosystems, threatening human lives, biodiversity, and entire economies. Actions need to be taken fast to stabilize the climate, ideally reverting to atmospheric CO2 levels found before the Industrial Revolution, all the while ensuring economic prosperity and humans’ quality of life are not stifled by the action. A multitude of efforts will be needed, including expanding the portfolio of viable energy sources to avoid more fossil carbon addition to the atmosphere. A holistic approach must be developed that balances many considerations to ensure environmental success, economic viability, and societal adoption. Natural processes alone can no longer balance the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and even if new additions are stopped eventually, it will take centuries and more for the Earth’s natural carbon cycle to reduce atmospheric CO2 to acceptable levels. In light of this, three major tasks are thus key to success, each of which will be connected to many challenges in its own right. First, net-zero carbon energy systems must be implemented. Second, human interventions are needed to remove some excess CO2 from the environment actively. Third, a net-zero carbon future requires developing new carbon sources to ensure continued and globally growing access to essential carbon-based products. As detailed below, the time needed for such a transition is substantial and will take us well into the next century, at a minimum.

Options for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), include nature-based methods to increase CO2 uptake and technological efforts on enhanced weathering. Additionally, some carbon-based products can be made from biomaterials. While all necessary, additional work is needed to achieve a stable net-zero carbon future ultimately. This work will include carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), as shown in Fig. 1.

CCUS is often treated as a single category of technologies, but carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) serve distinct, though partially overlapping, roles. There is a lot of confusion about what all these acronyms and the technologies behind them mean, what they do, and what their risks and benefits are. Glossaries that define the terms are not enough to bring clarity, and hence, with this perspective, we are addressing the need to contrast key approaches against each other. For example, we emphasize that the “U” points to the chemical conversion of CO2 to products. The use of CO2 as solvent, coolant, or to carbonate beverages is not considered CCU in this context. However, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is explicitly discussed as a frequent stand-in for CCU in the United States. Still, it is not included as CCU in most discussions worldwide since the CO2 is not chemically converted into something else. In fact, in an evolution of EOR, the CO2 is not recovered anymore but left underground, rendering EOR essentially as a variant of CCS2.

Broadly, public understanding and perception of what CCUS is and why it is needed are underdeveloped3,4,5,6,7,8. Attitudes towards using CO2-made products are quite positive9. Still, overall, the awareness of necessary deployments, especially the construction of new pipelines for CO2 transport, has been met with substantial opposition, which has even led to the cancellation of projects10.

This perspective aims to highlight what CCS and CCU do as complementary, not competing strategies, show why neither makes sense alone, and project how both will find their place in net-zero scenarios.

The case for CCS in a net zero future

CCS is not a peripheral option but a core requirement for achieving net-zero and eventually net-negative emissions. This is not a speculative view: it reflects the repeated conclusions of leading scientific and policy institutions including the IPCC, IEA, and IRENA1,11,12. Across a wide range of scenarios, these institutions have identified CCS as indispensable—not only because it provides a least-cost pathway to deep decarbonization in key sectors, but because without it, the feasibility of limiting warming to 1.5 °C–2 °C is placed in serious doubt. In effect, the choice is not between CCS and an alternative zero-carbon pathway, but between CCS and the likelihood of failing to mitigate climate change at all.

The imperative for CCS has become more acute with the growing consensus that carbon removal is essential—not just emissions avoidance. Delivering net-zero requires not only the elimination of nearly all greenhouse gas emissions, but also deploying large-scale CDR to offset residual emissions and begin drawing down historical stock. CCS underpins two of the most scalable and durable forms of CDR: Bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and Direct Air Capture with carbon storage (DACCS). Without these, the transition to a net-negative emissions economy—a requirement for climate stabilization later this century—is unlikely to be achieved.

Moreover, the structure of the global energy system reinforces the importance of CCS. Fossil fuels still supply over 80% of the world’s primary energy, and even the most ambitious mitigation scenarios from the IPCC project material quantities of unabated fossil fuel use in 2100. In this context, CCS is not a discretionary technology, but a structural feature of any serious decarbonization pathway. Its role is particularly pronounced in sectors where emissions are technically difficult or prohibitively expensive to eliminate through electrification or substitution—such as cement, steel, hydrogen production, and parts of the power sector.

Importantly, CCS is not a nascent technology. The core components—gas separation, compression, transport via pipeline or ship, and geologic storage—are all well-established and commercially deployed. Historically, the constraint has not been technological readiness but the absence of investable business models. This barrier is now being addressed through carbon pricing, contracts-for-difference, tax credits, and regulatory frameworks that de-risk CCS investments. Concurrently, technology innovation has significantly improved performance and reduced cost. Where CCS was once associated with substantial energy penalties, modern combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) integrated with advanced capture systems can achieve thermal efficiencies surpassing those of the current fleet without CCS.

Finally, CCS is inherently flexible. It can be retrofitted to existing facilities, preserving valuable industrial and energy infrastructure, and it can be integrated into new-build designs. This dual applicability supports near-term emissions reductions while enabling a longer-term structural shift to a low-carbon economy.

Tailwinds and headwinds for CCS

CCS is benefitting from increasingly strong tailwinds. Infrastructure and regulatory frameworks are maturing rapidly, with projects reaching final investment decision (FID) in jurisdictions, such as the UK, and comprehensive policy frameworks now taking shape in many parts of the world. These developments are enabling project bankability and accelerating deployment.

However, CCS is not without headwinds. It remains highly geography-dependent, requiring reliable access to suitable geologic storage formations. However, where available, underground storage capacity will unlikely be a limiting factor. Similarly, whilst it has been deployed in the past, its contemporary application to climate change mitigation implies deployment at a scale larger than what has been the case previously. Thus, mitigating this scale-up and performance risk will be key to unlocking financing and investment at the required scale. Finally, it is a capital-intensive technology. Abating emissions from a facility capturing on the order of one million tonnes of CO₂ per annum (Mtpa) entails investment costs in the billions, posing challenges to scalability absent sustained policy support and private-sector confidence13,14.

In sum, CCS is not merely a bridging technology—it is a permanent fixture in the portfolio of solutions required to achieve net zero and sustain a stable climate.

The case for CCU in a net zero future

Collectively, CCU technologies can provide carbon-based products that are essential to society while delivering CDR or avoidance of emissions, and revenue generation from sales. A comprehensive market analysis with growth projections for a wide range of CO2-based products shows that the magnitude of CO2 utilization in products is in the gigatonnes per year, offering revenues in the $trillions10,15. The abundance of carbon-based products in our daily lives offers rich opportunities for CCU16,17. For example, use in precast concrete and aggregate production alone provides significant potential for CDR, and the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could enable the avoidance of gigatonne-level primary emissions. CCU is included as an option for net-zero in the IPCC 2023 Synthesis Report to the Assessment Report 6, with some deployment by 2030, noting the comparably high cost of CO2 mitigation1.

In contrast to CCS, CCU is geographically more flexible since it is not bound by the availability of suitable geologic storage sites. The many potential use cases allow for diversified commercial deployments that can create additional economic opportunities for underserved regions worldwide. Additionally, the localized production of critical products, such as high-purity graphite and aviation fuels can satisfy national security needs.

Many CCU technologies require high energy inputs for the chemical conversion of the CO2, which raises questions about the opportunity costs of the best (current) use of renewable energy18,19. This creates incentives for additional installations for renewable energy production. With the potential of CCU production using intermittent excessive renewable energy, integrating CCU and renewable energy can create a more stable and economically viable future energy system.

There are important nuances for CCU regarding CDR performance or CO2 emissions avoidance. The lifetime of a CCU product, whether by its chemical nature or the use case, must be considered. Long-lived (Track 1) products, such as mineralized CO2 in aggregates and concrete, provide CDR performance if non-fossil CO2 is used, while shorter-lived (Track 2) products feature emissions avoidance, for example, with the production of SAF20. While the chemical nature of CO2 is the same, irrespective of its source, in terms of CDR or avoidance, it is critically important to make life cycle determinations based on the source of the CO2 to accurately reflect whether or not new CO2 is being added to the atmosphere or oceans21.

A strong argument for CCU to produce aggregates is the ability to mineralize gigatonnes of CO2 with waste materials, which thereby no longer have to be stored or disposed of in costly procedures, such as landfills, fly ash ponds, and mine tailings sites20,22. This, therefore, provides additional benefits beyond the CDR function. Conversely, the ability to produce SAF with CCU provides gigatonne-level avoidance performance if the CO2 that is used is of non-fossil origin15,23.

Tailwinds and headwinds for CCU

Research and commercial interest in and deployment of CCUs have increased significantly over the past decade24,25,26. Some CCU products are attractive over incumbents because they provide improved performance, e.g., CO2-cured concrete is stronger than regular concrete and thus allows construction with less material27. However, many CCU products are drop-in replacements, typically at prices higher than those for incumbents10.

However, it is not performance alone that creates market interest. The substantial growth in international SAF demand creates opportunities for CCU to help address that demand as bio-based supplies are limited. Buyers clubs, such as the First Movers Coalition help organize and relay that interest.

Cost of production and lack of availability due to limited production facilities are still huge barriers to the rapid market penetration of CCU products.

Supporting policies take a leading role in launching new technologies, as past examples amply confirm, e.g., with the beginning of subsidies for the oil and gas industry in the early 20th century or the solar photovoltaic industry in the late 20th century. The key is to have policy support available for sustained periods. CCU-supporting policies have seen a less stable framework and have limited investment in building production facilities.

Regardless, CCU will become essential in a net-zero future to provide carbon-based products, covering the gap between plant-based and recycled carbon products10,28.

Policy and system design implications

Voluntary and policy-based carbon markets have created a flurry of activities that are difficult to oversee. Tax credits, such as those deployed in the US, European mandates, or voluntary markets in the US and Asia, all seek to incentivize CCU and or/CCS10,29. But in particular, the accounting methods for carbon intensities and other life cycle aspects are inconsistent and thereby can create significant market uncertainty. This inconsistency is especially true over long time scales and the assessment of additionality and leakage, respectively30,31. Key controversies exist related to the permanence of CDR, especially when built on nature-based solutions, such as forests or croplands32. More consistent definitions and regulations in this context are needed to give sellers and buyers certainty and to avoid double-counting of credits or offsets21,33,34,35,36,37.

While there are examples of CO2-based products that are already economically competitive—some aggregates, methanol, and urea—usually purely economic forces in the absence of policy guidance or voluntary action would inhibit the deployment of CCU. That is even more true for CCS, which is a paid-for-service waste management system, similar to what was implemented a long time ago for garbage pickup and wastewater treatment. Voluntary or government-imposed mandates can create demand for CCS by defining a market that depends on subsidies, mandates, or voluntary-based payments. Low-embodied carbon construction requirements call for using lower carbon intensity materials, even if these come at a price premium. However, that, in turn, creates incentives to produce materials, such as mineralized CO2 aggregates and CO2-cured concrete.

Construction and aviation are key examples of large markets with changing demands that need to be supplied, offering stability for companies to launch CCU production if additional demand drivers and cost incentives are added via policy support.

Policy-supported SAF mandates create pressure to develop supplies, including CO2-based SAF. A dramatically reduced environmental burden becomes a driver in this context that can offer more people the benefits of flying. The cost of capturing CO2 adds significantly to the cost of CCU products, and thereby, there is an incentive to use CO2 from sources with higher CO2 concentrations, such as cement and ammonia factories. While this creates less desirable final products if those have short lifetimes due to the associated fossil carbon intensity, it is a viable path to help launch the CCU industry and, in so doing, derisk the deployment and operation of carbon capture technologies at scale. Additionally, the cost of capturing CO2 from air and water will decrease over time as demand for such CO2 increases and the technologies mature.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44296-025-00085-5/MediaObjects/44296_2025_85_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-12-02 10:58:43.619430

Covering light vehicles, heavy trucking, shipping, port operations, and aviation, the Sultanate is deploying a range of green technologies and policy frameworks aimed at reducing emissions while positioning itself as a regional leader in clean mobility and sustainable fuels.

In a recent panel discussion on Hydrogen Ecosystems at the Energy Executive Circle, Abdullah al Busaidy, Director General of the Oman Logistics Centre at the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology (MoTCIT), detailed Oman’s multi-modal transport decarbonisation strategy. The Ministry is spearheading the development of a national green transportation framework, incorporating policy formulation, investment incentives, and collaboration with both public and private sector stakeholders.

Al Busaidy explained, “When we started crafting the road map two years ago, the trajectory for light vehicles was clear — we have decisively moved towards electric vehicles.” He noted that for heavy transport, the strategy is still evolving, emphasizing the importance of private sector engagement to ensure that sustainable solutions are both commercially viable and practical for operators.

A key achievement of the Ministry is the creation and local production of co-combustion truck technology, enabling the retrofit of existing diesel fleets to operate on hydrogen as well. Trials conducted in Oman have demonstrated a 53% reduction in CO₂ emissions, marking a significant milestone that meets transition goals without increasing operating costs for logistics companies.

To further support heavy transport, the Ministry plans to establish green transport corridors, notably linking the ports of Suhar and Al Duqm with concession zones, facilitating hydrogen-ready logistics routes.

In maritime transport, Oman is exploring green bunkering options through the use of green methanol. This effort is underpinned by a collaboration between the Ministry and an international consortium comprising HIF EMEA, ACCIONA & Nordex Green Hydrogen, and Al Meera Investment. Their joint project aims to produce and supply green methanol for ships in Dhofar Governorate, strategically advancing Oman’s vision to develop the region as a major hub for green fuels and low-carbon bunkering in the Middle East.

The aviation sector is also undergoing transformation with the launch of Oman’s first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiative, developed in partnership with private sector firm Bauer Nimr.

Oman is nearing formal membership in the Heavy Transport Decarbonisation Alliance, reinforcing its commitment to international cooperation and exchange of best practices.

“Our targets are clear, our commitment firm, and challenges drive us to innovate,” Al Busaidy stated, highlighting localisation, collaboration, and innovation as the central pillars of the Ministry’s decarbonisation efforts.

The panel included prominent industry figures such as Jürgen Rechberger from AVL List GmbH, Raul Ochagavia of ACCIONA Nordex Green Hydrogen, Ahmed al Abri of Hydrom, Anton Geers from the Port of Antwerp-Bruges, and Mohsin al Jabri from the Oman Net Zero Centre.

The production technology exists, but barriers remain for large-scale deployment.

Central to overcoming these issues is the choice of production pathway. One of the most promising is the G2L™ process, which integrates Sasol’s Fischer- Tropsch synthesis with Topsoe’s electrified reverse water-gas shift (eREACT™), including light hydrocarbon recycle and product upgrade section. It is so promising, in fact, that it was recently chosen for Europe’s largest e-fuels research and demonstration plant, the Technology Platform Power-to- Liquid Fuels (TPP) of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).

The efficiency challenge

Producing liquid hydrocarbons from electricity and carbon dioxide is inherently energy intensive. Hydrogen production, via electrolysis, accounts for more than half of the total e-SAF cost, which makes energy efficiency the defining metric for economic viability.

Every megawatt of electricity and kilogram of hydrogen must be translated into the highest possible yield of certified kerosene. G2L™ addresses these issues through the use of eREACT, where electrically heated reactors replace combustion to supply the energy needed for syngas generation.

By eliminating hydrogen combustion, the process improves both hydrogen and electricity efficiency.

On a once-through basis, G2L™ performs comparably to other SAF pathways like the methanol-to-jet process.

However, when recycling integration is introduced, its advantages become clear – G2L™ emerges as the most efficient option, achieving the highest energy and hydrogen efficiency, and enabling the lowest cost of SAF without producing lowvalue heavy products like the methanol-to-jet process.

Efficiencies and savings can be manyfold

One of the defining features of G2L™ is the easy implementation of the recycling of light hydrocarbons such as naphtha back into the process.

In a standard oncethrough system, these coproducts are separated and sold, reducing kerosene yield and complicating offtake agreements for multiple products. With G2L™, light ends are reintegrated alongside fresh CO₂ and hydrogen, converting them into additional jet fuel.

This recycling loop increases kerosene yield to 100% of product output while maintaining more than 95% carbon efficiency.

It also cuts hydrogen and electricity demand, with naphtha recycling alone reducing electricity consumption by around 15% compared to once-through operation.

In a sector where electrolyser costs and power prices dominate economics, these savings are significant RNG as a SAF feedstock when using Topsoe’s syngas technologies RNG (or biomethane) is a purified form of biogas derived from organic waste sources such as agricultural residue, food waste, or wastewater treatment.

Upgraded to meet the quality standards of fossil natural gas, RNG is pipeline-compatible and can be used as a direct substitute for traditional natural gas. This means RNG has great potential to serve as a renewable feedstock for producing SAF due to its renewable origin and compatibility with existing infrastructure.

RNG can either be used locally on-site, primarily as a fuel or for power generation, or injected into natural gas distribution pipelines for broader regional export.

For SAF production, pipeline distribution is a more practical option.

Integration with electrolysis

The G2L™ concept further improves efficiency through integration with high-temperature electrolysis.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is highly exothermic, producing steam at temperatures suited to Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cells (SOEC). By feeding this waste heat into electrolysers, the system reduces the external electricity required for hydrogen production.

When SOEC integration is combined with naphtha recycling, electricity demand can fall by up to one third compared with conventional alkaline electrolysis. This integration is a practical method of aligning thermodynamics with cost reduction, turning unavoidable process heat into a valuable resource. Efficiency gains in G2L™ technology strengthen project economics by maximising kerosene yield and reducing hydrogen and electricity consumption.

G2L™ selected for the Technology Platform Powerto- Liquid Fuels (TPP)

The potential of G2L™ as a next-generation e-fuels pathway is underlined by its selection for DLRs Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels (TPP) in Leuna. Funded with €130 million from the German Federal Ministry of Transport, the TPP will be Europe’s largest PtL demonstration and research facility.

The TPP maps the entire value chain, from RED II-H2 and -CO2 to certified e-SAF, with a capacity of 2,500 t/a PtL. The e-fuels will be comprised mainly of kerosene, using renewable feedstocks such as biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen.

The core aims of the TPP are de-risking the PtL route, supporting industrial scaling, gathering PtL application experience, as well as optimising the PtL process and the fuel (Fuel Design), for example, reducing non-CO2- effects. For G2L™, this deployment represents not just validation in a research environment, but a steppingstone towards widespread commercialisation of PtL production.

The demonstration plant is currently under construction starting operation in Q4, 2027.

Powering forward

This year, Sasol and Topsoe signed a cooperation agreement with DLR and Griesemann (acting as EPC-contractor) to enable the construction, operation and R&D activities of DLR’s e-SAF research and demonstration plant at the Leuna Chemical Complex.

This step forward follows Topsoe and Sasol’s selection in 2024 to deliver G2L™ e-fuels technology for the TPP, integrated with Topsoe’s innovative eREACT™ technology and hydroprocessing technologies as well as with Sasol’s LTFT™ (low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch) technology.

Griesemann Gruppe is working alongside Topsoe and Sasol as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor.

Since 2022, more than 90 individual measures have helped to save a total of around 54,000 metric tonnes of kerosene, thereby permanently avoiding around 170,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions. This corresponds to the fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions of 640 round-trip flights on the Munich–New York route with an Airbus A350-900 aircraft. Now, further measures are being added: The company has set itself the goal of avoiding around 50,000 additional tonnes of CO₂ annually across the group by the end of 2028, among other things by using new digital tools and data-based decision models. This corresponds to an additional annual fuel saving of over 15,200 metric tonnes.

“We embed sustainability where it has the most immediate impact - in the day-to-day operations of our airlines. Our OPS Sustainability program is already delivering measurable efficiency gains and environmental improvements. At the same time, we are investing more than ever in highly fuel-efficient, state-of-the-art aircraft,” says Grazia Vittadini, Chief Technology Officer of Lufthansa Group.

Data-driven and practical approach for further operational efficiency

With the new phase of the program now underway, additional measures are being rolled out across the Group that pursue a data-driven and practical approach to increasing efficiency in flight operations. These include, for example, the use of digital applications that will enable even more precise decisions to be made in future about the amount of fuel required for a flight, based on historical consumption data. Measures such as optimized taxiing and approach procedures, more demand-oriented water loading, and more precise flight planning are also part of the program. Sustainability is also being systematically integrated into the entire training chain for employees on board and on the ground. The goal is to promote conscious decisions for more efficient flight operations on a daily basis.

Innovations such as the “AeroSHARK” surface technology developed by Lufthansa Technik in collaboration with BASF are also helping to make daily flight operations more sustainable. The innovative film has already been applied to the surfaces of more than 20 Lufthansa Group aircraft and mimics the aerodynamic properties of shark skin. It reduces drag, thereby lowering fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by around one percent—on every flight.

A significant partnership has been struck between DHL Express and Phillips 66, focusing on the supply and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) over a three-year span. This alliance aims to deliver more than 240,000 metric tonnes—roughly 83 million gallons—of SAF, marking one of the largest sustainable fuel deals involving a U.S. producer and the air cargo sector. What’s at stake here is a serious step forward in reducing the carbon footprint of air freight operations.

Big Numbers, Bigger Impact

240,000+ metric tonnes of SAF to be delivered over three years

Projected reduction of 737,000 metric tonnes in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel

Primary deliveries directed to major West Coast hubs like Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and San Francisco International Airport (SFO)

By switching to SAF, DHL expects to slash emissions significantly, reinforcing its sustainability credentials while setting a new standard for logistics providers. The use of SAF means burning cleaner, renewable fuel that has a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional jet fuel.

Where the Fuel Comes From: Phillips 66’s Renewable Energy Facility

Phillips 66’s Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California is at the heart of this green revolution. This facility is among the world’s largest renewable fuel producers and operates at a capacity of 150 million gallons per year of neat SAF—that is, fuel that isn’t diluted with fossil-based jet fuel. Having a robust, local producer means DHL can count on a steady, reliable supply chain for greener flights.

How It Works: The Book-and-Claim Approach

DHL is utilizing a “book-and-claim” system, which essentially allows it to offset its carbon emissions by purchasing sustainable fuel credits. This method helps the company manage its carbon footprint effectively, leveraging sustainable fuel use without the need for physically handling SAF in every jet. It’s a smart approach to scaling this green initiative across its network.

Voices from the Deal: Commitment and Leadership

Travis Cobb, Executive Vice President of Global Operations and Aviation at DHL Express, emphasized the milestone nature of this agreement: securing a dependable supply chain of SAF not only cuts emissions for DHL and its customers but also paves the way for other logistics and air cargo players in the U.S. to embrace sustainability at scale. This shows leadership that’s more than just talk—it’s action that sets the tone for the industry.

Brian Mandell, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Commercial at Phillips 66, reflected on the collaboration as evidence of a shared commitment towards market leadership in SAF. He underlined the importance of cross-industry collaboration to push the needle forward on sustainable aviation solutions.

The Broader Picture: A Push Toward Sustainability in Logistics

For DHL, this SAF deal fits snugly within a larger sustainability vision, which aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Since 2021, DHL has been actively engaging globally to secure sustainable fuel partnerships, setting a green tone across its Europe, America, and Asia-Pacific networks.

This initiative particularly bolsters DHL’s GoGreen Plus service, which lets customers cut their Scope 3 emissions by opting for freight transported with SAF. It’s not just good marketing—it reflects a genuine shift toward more responsible logistics, where sustainability isn’t an afterthought but baked into operational choices.

Why This Matters for Logistics and Freight Forwarding

Air cargo plays a critical role in global supply chains, moving goods swiftly but traditionally at a high environmental cost. Integration of SAF into logistics operations signals a new era where freight and courier services can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions without compromising speed or reliability. It also underscores the evolving priorities in haulage and freight forwarding, with companies needing to balance performance and planet-friendly practices.

Experience vs. Reviews: Why Trying SAF Is the Real Test

While this announcement is packed with promising figures and ambitious targets, there’s no substitute for real-world experience.

Uganda's combination of biomass availability, waste management needs and strategic infrastructure provides a strong foundation for the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). This was revealed in a feasibility study report presented on December 1, 2025, to different stakeholders in a meeting held at Imperial Golf View Hotel in Entebbe municipality.

The feasibility study was conducted under the guiding rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) with support from the United Kingdom's department for transport.

""With quantified technical potential exceeding 300-850 million litres per year, certified pathways and airport readiness, Uganda is positioned to progress from feasibility to first-generation production within this decade. A robust policy framework, blended finance support and coordinated leadership will enable Uganda to become a regional SAF pioneer, advancing energy security, economic diversification and climate-aligned growth in East Africa,"" the report reads.

Background

In 2024, the United Kingdom made a voluntary financial contribution to ICAO to fund at least three feasibility studies on sustainable aviation fuels for states, including Uganda. The study assessed the potential for producing and utilising sustainable drop-in SAF in Uganda, ensuring alignment with the environmental and socio-economic sustainability criteria in ICAO's carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation.

While releasing the study report on Monday, Cesar Verlarde, representing the ICAO director of Air Transport Bureau, noted that Uganda has the potential and the capacity to produce sustainable aviation fuels mainly based on the use of waste.

""Once we identify that a certain state (country) has the potential and stock in the future to produce SAF, we proceed with another step known as business development study that goes from potential to real identification of a business case that would make a SAF production plant viable in the country,"" Verlarde said.

He further noted that some ICAO member states, like several European countries, India and Brazil, among others, are already establishing mandatory use of small amounts of SAF in growing proportions throughout the years.

According to the study, Uganda generates significant quantities of sugarcane, maize, cassava, among other agricultural residues, while its rapidly growing urban centre produces an increasing volume of municipal solid waste.

""With the aviation sector expanding through Entebbe International Airport and the new domestic routes, the opportunity to decarbonise air transport and strengthen national energy security is substantial,"" UCAA spokesperson Vianney Luggya said.

He stated that the study evaluates the technical and economic feasibility of SAF production in Uganda, identifies key enabling factors and provides a roadmap for implementation aligned with ICAO's regulations and Uganda's Vision 2040.

Embrace the opportunity

Irene Atto, who represented Ronny Barongo, the director for safety, security and economic regulations, expressed UCAA's commitment to champion sustainability within the sector, fostering innovation and ensuring that Uganda keeps pace with global advancements in green aviation technologies.

""Together, we need to embrace this opportunity to position Uganda as a regional leader in sustainable aviation, to support national climate objectives and to achieve a collective global goal of reducing international aviation's carbon emissions by 5% in 2030 through the use of SAF, lower carbon aviation fuels and other cleaner energies,"" Atto said.

Olive Birungi Lumonya, the UCAA deputy director general assured that Uganda will proceed to the next phase of the business plan.

According to Lumonya, Uganda recognises that achieving ICAO’s long-term aspirational goals requires a comprehensive approach, including advancements in aircraft technology, operational improvements for air navigation and aerodromes, plus the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.

Quoting the study, the UCAA deputy director general said Uganda is actively participating in global efforts towards the progressive and collective decarbonisation of air transport, as well as transitioning to cleaner aviation energy sources, in order to adapt aviation operations to the growing risks posed by climate change.

""The mandates for using SAF blends are already being implemented in Europe and other regions of the world; even our national carrier operating in the UK is required to uplift SAF-blended fuel on its return route from London. At UCAA, we believe that fast-tracking the production and deployment of our own SAF will not only reduce costs for our national carriers but also contribute to environmental sustainability and create economic opportunities for the business community,"" Lumonya said.

She further stated that the ministry of energy and mineral development, as well as the Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC), are expected to play a pivotal role in steering the national SAF and cleaner aviation energy programme, while UCAA will continue to serve in an advisory capacity.

Other agencies consulted during the feasibility study include, the agriculture ministry, the National Environment Management Authority, the Ministry of Works and Transport, the Electricity Regulatory Authority and the Uganda Investment Authority.

In June 2022, ICAO launched a programme geared towards assistance, capacity building and training for sustainable aviation fuels in order to aid developing states in their transition to cleaner energy for aviation. Later, the 41st ICAO assembly adopted a long-term global aspiration for international civil aviation; collectively targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 as a contribution to global climate action.",https://newvision-media.s3.amazonaws.com/cms/5528e640-50de-4039-b39e-8acd770c1166.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 01:56:48.677783

It’s wonderful to be back on the Gold Coast again.

I begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land the Yugambeh people. I pay my respects to their Elders, past and present and I extend this respect to all First Nations people joining us today.

I also acknowledge:

• Kym Meys, Chair of the Australian Airports Association

• Simon Westaway, CEO of the Australian Airports Association

• Amelia Evans, CEO of Queensland Airports Limited

• And all distinguished guests here today

We are now heading into the busiest aviation period of the year. Australia’s airports, large and small, are about to enable many family reunions, holiday adventures, tourism visits, and end-of-year work travel.

So, before anything else, I want to say thank you. Thank you to the people who keep this critical sector running. From the airport operators, ground handlers, security teams, air traffic controllers, airline workers, and all the professionals represented by the Australian Airports Association. Your efforts ensure that Australians can travel safely, efficiently, and confidently. Not just during the holidays, but all year round.

Our Government has an unashamedly ambitious Infrastructure agenda. Ambitious but achievable. And it’s all about connection.

Connecting cities and regions, connecting business, connecting Australia to the rest of the world…connecting communities. And at the centre, are our airports, and the aviation sector.

When the Government released our Aviation White Paper, we made clear our commitment to creating a sector that is resilient, competitive, sustainable and puts the travelling public at its centre. Over the past year, we’ve taken major steps towards delivering on those commitments, and many of those steps have been taken hand in hand with the people in this room.

Today I want to talk through the progress we’ve made, the work underway, and the partnership we need to shape the aviation sector Australians deserve.

But I acknowledge it hasn’t always been easy in recent years. I want to take this opportunity to thank those of you from airports which Rex services. As you know, we’ve been working hard with the administrators to keep Rex in the air, especially for our regional communities.

In November, the Government outlined the financing arrangements to support by Air T’s proposal to the administrators as part of its bid to acquire Rex. We’ve said that we will restructure Rex’s existing debt to the Australian Government. This ensures regional communities across Australia remain connected, but there are very clear expectations and commitments that go with this investment. These commitments will help to maintain essential regional aviation connections while also improving governance for the organisation.

Importantly, the Government will retain its security over all Rex’s aircraft to protect the taxpayer’s contribution. Last month, we also announced the establishment of a new $5 million program for local governments with regional and remote airports that supported Rex through the voluntary administration process. I have met with Air T directors and I look forward to their entry into the Australian aviation ecosystem. I am sure you will all make them welcome.

Airports are not just critical infrastructure, you are economic enablers, emergency services bases, lifelines for medical care, and anchors for regional development. Whether its runway resurfacing, new lighting, or terminal upgrades, we have, as a government, been investing in you.

Earlier this year, I announced $24.9 million of funding across 45 successful projects under the Regional Airports Program. In October, 42 successful projects receiving just under $25 million were announced under the Remote Airstrip Upgrade Program. These projects were spread across the country, from Streaky Bay on the west coast of South Australia to the Forsyth Airstrip managed by Etheridge Shire Council in Queensland—where the funding will help with the installation of animal exclusion fencing.

This year we have delivered the new runway upgrade at Hobart Airport, the new international terminal at Newcastle Airport, runway upgrades at Whyalla Airport, and redevelopment work has continued on the Launceston RFDS facilities.

And as planning minister, I have approved the Melbourne Airport Third Runway, new hangars at Bankstown and Canberra Airports, Airfield upgrades and an expansion to the Woolworths Distribution Centre at Perth Airport, an Aeromedical Base at Brisbane Airport and most recently a new commercial kitchen at Hobart Airport, among others.

And we have built a whole new airport in Western Sydney, supported by a $5.3 billion investment from the Australian Government. This airport is no longer a concept or a proposal. It’s real.

And I confess, standing on site, watching the first 737 jet land at the end of October gave me goosebumps. And an enormous sense of pride.

The Western Sydney International Airport will be a catalyst for growth with opportunities stretching far beyond the city and indeed the region. While we’re starting carefully, with a gradual ramp-up, this airport will accommodate 10 million passengers by 2033, providing a major boost to international travel and trade.

We’re now changing gear from construction to operations. And we’re on track for the first freight flights to depart by the middle of next year, with passenger services to follow later in 2026.

The terminal is already complete with testing and commissioning well underway. And of course, safety, remains the number one priority. Emergency services response capacity is being reviewed as is the baggage and freight handling systems.

We all know the impact airports can have on surrounding communities. Considerable effort has gone into understanding and reducing potential community impacts. These efforts will continue up to and beyond airport opening. Over $500 million has been injected into the local economy, with contracts awarded to 360 Western Sydney businesses and the potential for major long-term employment opportunities in the region.

There is still much to be done but I want to recognise the efforts of those here today who have been part of this Western Sydney International Airport story along the way. It’s a remarkable project and will once again place Australia on the world stage for excellence and innovation in aviation.

Beyond our borders, we’ve also focused our efforts on strengthening our international market partnerships.

We now have 110 bilateral air services arrangements in place, with the successful negotiation of updated and new air service agreements with over ten countries in the past two years. As an island nation, these agreements facilitate international travel to and from Australia with large tourism and trade markets.

In September 2025, we were able to agree an updated bilateral air services arrangement with the Philippines, that will double the available passenger capacity to 70 services per week by October 2026. From next year, we will be able to welcome an unrestricted capacity for passenger services from Malaysia and Canada. This is on top of recent capacity increases with Hong Kong, the first increase in more than two decades, as well as with Chile and Türkiye, and new agreements with Latvia, Mongolia and Rwanda.

We’re creating room now to allow for the future growth in demand. It’s a measured approach to allow time for adequate planning. But the benefits will be worth it.

As we grow our reach in new and existing markets, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, the potential for tourism and trade is substantial. And as we expand our connections with the world through the bilaterals, we’re building a bigger front door through the Western Sydney International Airport.

Which brings me to the experience of the individual traveller.

Your experience from the minute you arrive at the airport—good, bad or otherwise, really matters. It not only impacts the person with the boarding pass but also the brand perception of that airport, and the broader aviation industry.

Currently, there are no national standards to determine what remedies passengers are entitled to receive in the event of delays or worse, cancellation. It’s why we’re introducing new aviation consumer protections, including an Aviation Consumer Ombuds Scheme.

Public consultation on a new aviation consumer protection framework and an updated Aviation Consumer Protections Charter concluded in October. And we will be legislating the new scheme next year.

Together, these initiatives will help us progress the design and implementation of aviation consumer protections. And it will ensure airlines and airports abide by the new minimum standards because everyone will know exactly what the expectations are.

Let me tell you, my office receives regular feedback from people who are frustrated about not knowing who or how to follow up after their plane has been delayed or luggage damaged. This is important work—lifting the standards of passenger experience in Australia. But it’s also about getting the right balance. We don’t want to see the price of airline tickets skyrocket, especially given the size of the market here. And it underpins why public and industry consultation matters.

It’s not only good for travellers but also for airports giving you clarity and consistently around expectations which has been missing. Which is why I am so pleased to see so much of this conference program dedicated to exploring the passenger experience, community connectiveness and co-designing with targeted groups.

Which brings me to accessibility. And the air travelling experience for all Australians. As you know, we’re creating new aviation-specific disability standards. It’s another key area identified in the Aviation White Paper. The standards will set out responsibilities for airports and airlines.

This is critical in making sure that services are coordinated to support the journey of passengers with disability.

Because this cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach, we implemented a co-design process with people with disability to develop the standards.

This work has been guided by an Aviation Accessibility Steering Committee, workshops with people with disability and four guiding principles for addressing barriers to air travel for people with disability.

They are:

• Including people with disability directly in the design of any policy, procedure or infrastructure that impacts their travel experience.

• Being consistent so that passengers with disability know what they can expect at each airport and from each airline on every journey.

• Being transparent by providing clear information on the support available for passengers who require assistance, and how passengers can expect this service to be delivered.

• And finally, ensuring regular, high-quality training for all staff, the value of which cannot be underestimated, and which will help to create a culture of accessibility

I want to thank all those who have been supporting the co-design process to date. Many in the aviation industry have met with co-design partners, attended co-design workshops to provide technical input, provided information about airport and airline policies and procedures, and hosted airport walkthroughs or workshops. A consultation paper will be released in the coming months with draft options for the new standards. I will welcome your continuing input to these draft standards.

I also want to address one of the most transformative long-term priorities: developing a sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia. Our work with the aviation industry towards net zero is ramping up. In September 2025, we announced a $1.1 billion investment into the Cleaner Fuels Program to support the production of low carbon liquid fuels or LCLFs in Australia. This will ensure we have strong supply chains for the more sustainable fuels that can power our aircraft going forward.

LCLF production will directly support the Net Zero Plan, helping to decarbonise hard-to-electrify transport modes such as long-haul aviation. Consultation is currently underway on the design of the Cleaner Fuels Program, with the Policy Design and Engagement paper released on 13 November. Submissions are open until 19 December 2025, and I encourage you all to review the paper and provide us with your feedback.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic the aviation sector has had its fair share of challenges. But there is now a real sense of optimism, especially as we start to bring the initiatives from the Aviation White Paper to reality.

So, what does 2026 hold for Australia’s airports?

• New legislated consumer protections

• An aviation consumer ombuds scheme

• New disability standards for air travel

And of course, a new international airport in Western Sydney.

So, thank you for all that you do in ensuring the unique role that our airports play in the aviation industry is well positioned to thrive for many decades ahead. You are also part of Australia’s broader transport and infrastructure ecosystem. It’s an intricate, complex, growing network that keeps Australia, and Australians, moving and connected—safely.

I know this is a big week with your national conference and the Women in Airports Forum. What a great way to finish the year—by celebrating all your achievements. And good luck to those of you in contention for a 2025 National Airport Industry Award tomorrow night. I hear the standard of entries this year has been outstanding.

The future for Australia’s aviation industry looks bright. I look forward to continuing to work with you over the coming year. Together, we will take the initiatives of the Aviation White Paper and make our airports, and air travel stronger, safer and more accessible for everyone. Because the air is now the universal highway.

Thank you.",https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/themes/custom/ministerinfrastructure/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-02 01:57:07.382538

Doha

Qatar has announced five new research projects aimed at accelerating the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as the country steps up efforts to curb emissions from one of the world’s fastest growing industries.

The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MECC) revealed the projects during a scientific symposium on Monday.

The initiative brings together the ministry, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Airways and the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) in what officials describe as a national model for research-driven climate action.

Assistant Undersecretary for Climate Change Affairs, Ahamed Mohammed Al Sada, said the ministry is prioritising scientific research and innovation as essential tools to address global environmental challenges.

He noted that the new projects demonstrate the strength of collaboration between government agencies, academia and the aviation sector.

“This partnership unites academic expertise, regulatory capabilities and operational experience,” he said, adding that it will help Qatar pioneer technologies that reduce carbon emissions and support national leadership in sustainable aviation.

The projects, he added, align with Qatar’s 2024-2030 climate strategy and its commitments under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) CORSIA framework.

Dr Mohammed Saif Al Kuwari, environmental and engineering adviser to the ministry, highlighted the aviation sector’s crucial economic role and the urgent need to lower its climate footprint.

Research suggests that sustainable aviation fuels could cut carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel, he said.

Multisector cooperation, he added, is essential to making these fuels commercially viable.

From a regulatory perspective, QCAA Acting President, Mohammed bin Faleh Al Hajri, said the global aviation industry is undergoing a rapid transformation as countries work toward decarbonisation.

Qatar Airways, he noted, is a key partner in testing cleaner fuels and new technologies within its operations.

Al Hajri emphasised that low-carbon fuels can act as a practical bridge toward fully sustainable aviation fuels, helping build the infrastructure and expertise required for long-term adoption.

He also called for clearer international standards under ICAO to encourage investment, research and market development.

The five research projects span a range of priorities, including producing SAF from local resources, evaluating long-term environmental and economic impacts, and exploring how sustainable fuels can be integrated into Qatar’s aviation infrastructure.

Officials say the findings will help guide policymakers and strengthen the country’s role in the global transition to low-emissions aviation.

The initiative, they said, reflects Qatar’s broader plan to build a low-carbon economy while maintaining growth - and to position the country as a regional and international leader in environmental innovation.",https://www.qatar-tribune.com/watanqatartribune/uploads/images/2025/12/02/322537.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 21:56:10.196555

The coordination made by the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA), the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, and Qatar Airways announced the partnership between academic research, regulatory oversight, and real-world airline operations which will make climate-driven change possible through collaboration.

The move is as much about safeguarding the planet as it is about preserving Qatar’s growing reputation as a world-class travel destination: cleaner flights, lower emissions, and a strengthened aviation hub all count as wins for travellers and the environment alike.

What the New Projects Cover

The five research streams span important areas:

Producing SAF from local resources, helping reduce dependence on imported jet fuel.

Evaluating the long-term environmental and economic impacts of SAF adoption.

Examining how sustainable fuels can be integrated into Qatar’s aviation infrastructure, from fuel supply chains to airport refuelling systems.

According to officials, these efforts align with Qatar’s broader 2024–2030 climate strategy and its obligations under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and its global carbon offsetting and reduction framework, known as CORSIA.

An adviser to the environment ministry reportedly said that SAF, when compared with conventional jet fuel, could cut carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent.

Regulatory and Industry Coordination: Why QCAA’s Role Matters

From the regulatory vantage point, QCAA’s involvement, especially under the acting leadership of its president, is crucial. The authority, in coordination with Qatar Airways, serves as a bridge between research outcomes and their operational application in real-world flights.

QCAA has previously reaffirmed Qatar’s commitment to ICAO’s roadmap for alternative aviation fuels, advocating for accelerated deployment of SAF and lower-carbon fuels while calling for a unified global SAF registry to enhance regulatory transparency.

By doing so, the authority aims not only to meet global standards but also to make SAF usage economically viable for airlines, a key step if sustainable flying is to become mainstream rather than niche.

What It Means for Travellers and Qatar as a Destination

For travellers, this could translate into more environmentally friendly flights to and from Doha, helping reduce the carbon footprint associated with long-haul air travel. As the projects mature and SAF becomes more widely adopted, tourists flying into Qatar, whether for business, leisure or events may benefit from cleaner, greener travel options.

For Qatar itself, these initiatives reinforce the country’s ambitions to be a regional leader in sustainable aviation. They help future-proof its aviation hub status by aligning with growing global demand for low-carbon travel, which may attract environmentally conscious travellers.

Furthermore, building local SAF supply and infrastructure could lead to a more self-sufficient aviation ecosystem, less reliant on imported fuel, more aligned with climate goals, and more resilient in times of global fuel supply uncertainty.

Challenges Ahead And Why This Strategy Matters

While the SAF promise is compelling up to 80 percent reductions in lifecycle carbon emissions as quoted, the path to widespread adoption faces hurdles. SAF production must be scaled up; supply chains must be adapted for SAF distribution at airports; regulatory frameworks, both local and international, must evolve to support widespread SAF integration.

Moreover, economics play a key role. As noted by QCAA in its previous policy discussions, efforts to adopt sustainable or lower-carbon fuels must avoid placing undue financial burden on airlines.

But by investing in research now, covering local feedstock, environmental impact, infrastructure integration, Qatar is seeking to address these challenges proactively. The hope is that this foundation will ease future adoption hurdles, lower costs, and encourage both airline and traveller buy-in.

What This Means for the Future of Aviation in Qatar

The launch of these five research projects signals a turning point. By integrating academic study, regulatory oversight, airline operations and environmental policy, Qatar is staking a claim to lead in sustainable aviation, not just regionally, but globally.

If successful, the outcomes could reshape commercial aviation in Qatar. Domestic and international flights could increasingly run on SAF or low-carbon fuels, significantly reducing carbon emissions without compromising the extensive global connectivity that defines the country’s aviation ambitions.

For travellers and the global tourism industry, this could also mark a shift: choosing Qatar as a hub or destination may increasingly be viewed as a greener, more responsible choice.

A New Chapter for Green Travel from Doha

The new SAF research projects of Qatar interlace ambition, science, regulation, and operational expertise thus converting the utopian dream of green aviation into a realistic and practical roadmap. By beginning at the research level and elevating it upward, the country shows its readiness not only to speak but also to effectuate long-term change.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/An-aeroplane-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 19:56:54.211883

The arrival of Alléo Energy in Brazil, as announced by FSP this Monday (01), marks an important move in the expansion of the use of sustainable aviation fuel (FAS) in the country. The initiative reinforces the growing global attention focused on reducing emissions from the aviation sector and adds to the efforts of Brazilian companies and regulatory policies that are already paving the way for the aviation energy transition.

What changes with the entry of the American company Alléo Energy into Brazil?

Alléo Energy — american company specializing in renewable energy solutions — is bringing a new SAF to the country. The information comes at a time when Brazil is seeking to expand its participation in the global market for sustainable fuels and meet international requirements for mitigating emissions.

The arrival of SAF by Alléo Energy adds to other recent developments in the sector, such as the import carried out by Vibra Energia and the tests conducted by Petrobras. The presence of more suppliers in the national market may have direct effects on supply, price competitiveness, and the acceleration of the adoption of this type of fuel by Brazilian airlines.

SAF is cited as one of the main alternatives for reducing emissions in air transport, as it can decrease the carbon footprint of flights without requiring changes to aircraft or fuel supply systems.

Understand how Alléo Energy will operate in the Brazilian market.

The company develops clean energy production units capable of transforming wood waste, crops grown for energy generation, and urban waste into various renewable fuels. In addition to SAF (synthetic anaerobic fuel), the company can also produce green diesel for road transport—meeting ASTM D975 standards—green hydrogen on a large scale, and biochar.

In Brazil, its operations will be represented by OnFresh. The future plants installed in the country should use cellulosic materials, industrial process byproducts, and municipal waste to manufacture these fuels, which, according to the company, can be produced at the lowest cost achieved so far.

According to Fernando Ochman, business director at OnFresh, the technical team is able to adapt each plant to the production needs of the companies, allowing them to choose which fuels they want to generate and even the proportion of each.

Recently, Alléo developed a method that produces more than 100 kilograms of green hydrogen for every ton of cellulosic waste used. This patented system generates hydrogen with a negative carbon balance—meaning that, in addition to not releasing CO₂, it also removes particles from the atmosphere.

Current scenario of sustainable aviation fuel in Brazil

Regulatory advances and decarbonization targets

In recent years, Brazil has been structuring policies and guidelines to produce and use sustainable aviation fuelThis aligns with international goals that seek to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The federal government, through sectoral initiatives, is already projecting commercial-scale production starting in 2027.

Furthermore, the country is discussing tax incentive models, environmental certifications, and productive partnerships, which aim to make SAF competitive with traditional aviation kerosene.

Studies show that Brazil has the potential to become a leader in global production, due to its abundance of biomass, agricultural waste, and consolidated expertise in biofuels — especially ethanol and biodiesel.

Supply and demand forecasts for the coming years

Reports from industry institutions indicate that national demand for SAF could reach between 3,2 and 9,1 billion liters by 2037...varying according to the technological roadmap and the pace of adoption by airlines. However, the current volume available meets just over a quarter of this estimated demand, highlighting a significant gap between need and supply.

Today, only a limited number of airports offer the fuel. Vibra Energia, for example, began selling SAF at Galeão Airport in Rio de Janeiro in 2025, using an internationally authorized blend of up to 10% renewable fuel with 90% fossil kerosene.

Despite these advances, experts say that the presence of new suppliers is essential to expand availability, reduce costs, and stimulate market growth.

Why is Alléo Energy's arrival in Brazil strategic for the aviation sector?

Expanding supply and increasing competitiveness.

With the entry of Alléo Energy, Brazil now has another source of SAFThis reduces dependence on occasional imports and isolated initiatives by domestic companies. This expansion of the supplier base can stimulate competitiveness and enable more affordable prices.

Furthermore, the arrival of a new american company This reinforces the internationalization of the sustainable fuels market in Brazil, opening doors for future partnerships with airlines and logistics operators.

Direct support for the decarbonization of the aviation sector.

Sustainable fuel (SF) can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, depending on the raw materials and production process used. While the exact percentages vary according to technological routes, the global consensus is that sustainable fuel is one of the most viable short-term solutions to bring civil aviation closer to its targets. decarbonisation.

The arrival of SAF by Alléo Energy reinforces this movement and could accelerate the incorporation of renewable fuels in domestic and international flights in Brazil.

Airline valuation and consumer benefits

For airlines, adopting SAF represents a competitive advantage and improves public perception, as it demonstrates environmental commitment. For passengers, although there is no immediate direct impact on ticket prices, the action is part of a trend that can make aviation more sustainable and efficient.

Future paths and opportunities for sustainable aviation with Alléo Energy.

With the advancement of decarbonisation and the entry of new suppliers of sustainable aviation fuelBrazil is strategically positioned on the global stage. Alléo Energy's move not only expands the supply of SAF (Sustainable Agricultural Production), but also reinforces the country's international relevance in this market.

The trend is that, in the coming years, national production will grow, supported by investments in technology, research, and regulation. If this materializes, Brazil could become an exporter of agroforestry systems, integrating international production chains and consolidating its regional leadership.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SAF-.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:56:17.963938

Boom Supersonic Boom Supersonic currently dominates the developing commercial supersonic market.
Its primary goal is to collect data to change current regulations that ban commercial supersonic flight over land.","The National Football League (NFL) is keeping close tabs on the development of new boomless supersonic commercial Aviation technology. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is experimenting with new designs that will nearly eliminate the sonic boom sound effect that accompanies every aircraft flying beyond the speed of sound.

At the same time, a number of private companies are also pursuing the development of airliners that will leverage the information gathered by the NASA experiments. The NFL relies heavily on commercial air charters like those provided by American Airlines during its travel season. Beyond the many domestic games, the NFL has seen progress in its European expansion with promising future potential.

A supersonic transport (SST) like the Concorde, configured as a commercial passenger airline, would be extremely valuable to the NFL as it pursues more regular international games overseas. Cutting flight times would reduce fatigue and improve recovery for players, who often travel with large parties of around 200 people.

Why Does The NFL Want SSTs?

The league has hosted regular-season games in London, Frankfurt, and Madrid to build its overseas fanbase and is exploring the possibility of placing a permanent team or division in Europe. Faster travel would ease the heavy logistical burdens for teams playing frequent transatlantic games.

Today, the NFL makes its travel season work with subsonic commercial aviation by using charter flights for teams and their large traveling party. The league makes its schedule with accommodation for the fatigue that occurs from cross-country and international travel. The time-consuming process of moving people and equipment with every travel stop also needs to be factored in.

The NFL strategically plans road games to minimize travel impact on players. They prioritize player comfort to maximize performance on the field. Teams select seating based on the needs of their players, and their charter providers offer custom catering to accommodate all dietary needs. While effective, this process remains slow and cumbersome compared to future supersonic options, especially considering international expansion efforts.

Boom Supersonic actively promotes how supersonic travel with its SST, the Overture, could benefit international sports leagues like the NFL by enabling faster, more efficient global travel. Boom is moving forward with the Overture's development, with ground and flight testing already underway and a goal of carrying passengers by 2029.

The League’s Strategy

American Airlines, one of the NFL’s biggest charter operators, is strongly interested in the Boom SST and has already placed a significant order. In August 2022, American announced an agreement to purchase 20 Overture aircraft, with an option for 40 more, following United Airlines' initial order for 15 jets with the option for 35 more.

Despite both airlines' interest in the Overture, the plane's capacity of 60 to 80 passengers is a logistical challenge for the NFL. A single Overture aircraft could not move an entire team in one flight. The team would require multiple Overtures or split the traveling party between a supersonic jet for first-string players and a conventional subsonic jet for others, as well as cargo.

Many NFL teams charter widebody aircraft, such as Boeing 767s or 777s, from major commercial airlines like United, Delta, and American. These planes can accommodate the traveling party, including players, coaches, medical staff, and other personnel. Some players are even given larger business or first-class seats due to their size.

The NFL's interest is more about monitoring the technology's feasibility for long-term international expansion, rather than immediate adoption. Likely near-term usage might include team owners or top executives using the aircraft for faster business travel related to international operations or league meetings.

The Long View

The real benefit aligns with the NFL's goal of permanent international expansion. Faster travel windows could allow for more flexible scheduling of international games without requiring extended stays abroad or disproportionate bye weeks, integrating European games more smoothly into the regular season structure.

Andrew Beaton of the Wall Street Journal remarked in a report published a few days ago that the NFL has been “been keeping a close eye on the momentum behind commercial supersonic flights” although it has no firm plans to put permanent teams in Europe yet.

Minimizing travel time directly addresses major concerns regarding player welfare, fatigue, and competitive fairness. For domestic games, teams typically travel the day before a game, holding final walk-throughs and meetings in the hotel. On top of player and staff travel, international games involve meticulously detailed logistics for transporting tons of equipment, which must be cleared through customs.

The NFL is currently in a monitoring phase, watching how airlines like United and American utilize the aircraft and if future designs could scale up in capacity, or if regulations regarding overland sonic booms change, which would open up more domestic route possibilities. The Overture is hoped to demonstrate that a commercial market for supersonic travel exists. Its success would de-risk future, larger aircraft programs.

The rollout of the Overture is aiming to drive investment in airport infrastructure that will support the growth of supersonic travel. This includes noise abatement procedures and fueling operations for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which would be necessary for any scaled-up supersonic service.

Supersonic travel is expensive, and although the Overture is designed for SAF, the limited supply and high cost of SAF could constrain scaled-up operations. Any future, larger supersonic airliner would be an entirely new design, requiring its own extensive development, testing, and certification process. This would take many years and occur well after the Overture's planned 2029 entry into service.

The Overture

The Boom Overture is a supersonic airliner under development that will use purpose-built Symphony engines to achieve a cruise speed of Mach 1.7 and carry 60 to 80 passengers, primarily on transoceanic routes. Airlines most interested in the Boom Overture are United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines, which have placed a combined total of 130 orders and pre-orders.

The Overture is designed to accommodate 60 to 80 passengers in an all-business-class configuration. The primary commercial usage will focus on transoceanic routes such as New York to London, cutting flight time to about 3.5 hours, as well as Seattle to Tokyo. The Overture is aimed at premium, high-end passengers, with fares expected to be comparable to current business-class prices.

It is designed to cruise at Mach 1.7 (around 1,122 mph or 1,806 km/h) over water and Mach 0.94 subsonically. Overture will be optimized to fly at a cruising altitude of up to 60,000 feet with a maximum range of 4,250 nautical miles (7,870 km). The engines are engineered for sustained supersonic flight without the use of afterburners, a differentiator from Concorde's design, which improves fuel efficiency.

Boom’s Overture will be powered by four newly developed Symphony engines, which are twin-spool, medium-bypass turbofans. Each engine is designed to produce approximately 40,000 pounds-force (180 kN) of thrust at takeoff. The Symphony engine is designed to be compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Boom Supersonic

Boom Supersonic currently dominates the developing commercial supersonic market. Other supersonic and hypersonic transport planes in development include business jets from Spike Aerospace and projects for military/government use that may lead to future commercial airliners, primarily from Hermeus and Lockheed Martin.

The Hermeus Halcyon is aiming for hypersonic speeds (Mach 5+) under military contracts for uncrewed demonstrators, with a commercial passenger aircraft as a long-term goal. Spike Aerospace is developing a private business jet for 12-18 passengers known as the S-512, aiming for Mach 1.6. Exosonic was focused on a passenger concept, but now primarily develops supersonic UAVs for military training exercises.

Most players in the supersonic and hypersonic development space have significant ties to the defense industry. Boom Supersonic has been awarded grants and contracts by the US Air Force's AFWERX program in partnership with Northrop Grumman to develop a special mission variant.

The Department of Defense plans to explore military and government executive transport configurations for the Overture. The Symphony engine design partner, Florida Turbine Technologies (FTT), is a subsidiary of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions.

NASA And The X-59

The NASA X-59 is a research aircraft built by Lockheed Martin Skunk Works for the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) program. Its primary goal is to collect data to change current regulations that ban commercial supersonic flight over land. NASA will fly the X-59 over select US communities to gather data on public responses to the quieter sonic boom. This data will be compiled and delivered to regulators like the Federal Aviation Administration and the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The X-59 is designed to reduce the typical loud sonic ""boom"" to a gentle sonic ""thump"" on the ground, or possibly no sound at all. The program data, once released, aims to allow for new rules that open up overland routes for all future commercial supersonic aircraft, like the Boom Overture, dramatically expanding the SST market.

If the Overture proves successful, a scaled-up service could emerge in the 2030s or beyond, using larger, next-generation supersonic transports. In the future, airlines with fleets of larger supersonic transports could accommodate entire team charters for staff and essential equipment. A larger, commercial supersonic market could also lead to more frequent and accessible supersonic flights for executives and fans, solidifying the overseas league's connection to the NFL's domestic operations.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/supersonice.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-01 14:56:22.279784

Two more Argentine provinces have signed agreements with the federal government to advance plans to eliminate the export tax on conventional crude oil.

Neuquén and Santa Cruz have joined trailblazer Chubut.

As part of the agreements, the federal government will adjust taxation rules, while the provinces will review their local royalty and canon payment schemes. In turn, companies have committed to maintaining production, among other actions.

The initiative is designed to encourage upstream investment in conventional oil fields. Currently, most investment is concentrated in unconventional assets in the Vaca Muerta formation.

Among risks associated with reduced conventionals outlay is an eventual domestic shortfall of production of heavy crude, needed as feedstock for refineries.

In terms of oil, Neuquén, Chubut and Santa Cruz are Argentina's top-three producing jurisdictions, accouting for almost 90% of output.

In No. 1 jurisdiction Neuquén, most investment is targeted at Vaca Muerta. In September, 96% of Neuquén output was shale, according to information from the federal energy department.

Chile hydrogen

Chile's hydrogen association, H2 Chile, has presented a list of policy priorities it would like the next administration to adopt.

The 2026-30 list encompasses actions on project permitting, legal certainty, territorial planning, regulation, electricity pricing, financing and incentives, infrastructure, and demand stimulation.

More than 80 projects have been announced publicly, and several pilot and demonstration initiatives are operational.

Around US$40.0bn in projects are currently under environmental review.

So far, two large-scale projects have received licenses: the US$825mn Cabo Negro e-fuels project in Magallanes region, and the US$423mn hydrogen production project in Calama district, Antofagasta region.

Authorities are also updating Chile’s national green hydrogen strategy.

Key challenges for developers include reducing production costs and securing offtake agreements.

Former energy minister Juan Carlos Jobet, a key figure in Chile's hydrogen drive, recently said hydrogen will ""have a space,"" citing applications in heavy transport and fertilizer production.

He urged the country to preserve political consensus on hydrogen development.

Production costs have fallen more slowly than expected and green hydrogen must still compete with cheaper fossil fuel alternatives.

Both presidential candidates – conservative José Antonio Kast and communist Jeannette Jara – reference green hydrogen in their campaign programs.

Hydrogen development in the north could potentially help address electricity oversupply and drive investment in new power generation capacity.

Chile's next government is due to take office in March. According to recent polls, Kast is likely to win the December 14 runoff election.

The US Treasury and IRS released the final, critical guidance for the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) tax credit, providing the regulatory certainty required by project developers and financiers. This action immediately de-risks the capital stack for new SAF production facilities by establishing the definitive methodology for calculating the fuel’s carbon intensity score. This clarity directly impacts the agricultural supply chain by validating the use of bio-oils and specific farming practices, enabling the shift from planning to construction. The most important data point demonstrating this impact is the maximum credit of $1.75 per gallon, which is now a bankable figure for financial models.

Context

The core question for industrial professionals was whether the US government would translate ambitious policy goals into a stable, bankable mechanism for the SAF tax credit. Analysts wondered if the regulatory framework would be clear enough to prevent billions in capital from stalling, as a lack of a certified carbon accounting model was the primary barrier to Final Investment Decisions (FIDs).

Analysis

This project acceleration is a direct result of targeted government policy instruments making low-carbon fuel production economically viable. The cause is the formal adoption of the 40BSAF-GREET 2024 model, which is the certified carbon accounting tool. This model provides the necessary legal and financial certainty for long-term contracts.

Manufacturers are expected to react by aggressively accelerating Final Investment Decisions on new Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) plants. Think of the GREET model like the “certified scale” at a commodity exchange; without a certified scale, no one will buy or sell the product because its value cannot be legally verified.

Outlook

This development implies that the SAF industry is shifting from policy risk to execution risk. The single most important thing to watch next is the acceleration of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) on new, large-scale SAF production facilities over the next twelve months. A surge in FIDs will confirm that the regulatory clarity has successfully unlocked the private capital pipeline.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Green-Hard-Hat-Symbolizing-Sustainable-Construction-Ecological-Integration-and-Urban-Development.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 16:57:30.908678

Market Factors - Growth, Barriers, and Opportunity Analysis

Forward-Thinking Regulatory Innovation to Transform the SAF Market

Policy incentives from governments and supranational bodies are catalyzing investment in renewable aviation fuels. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides a SAF tax credit of US$1.25/gallon plus additional credits for lifecycle GHG reduction, which can cause a marked acceleration of SAF production projects.

Similarly, the European Union (EU)’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate requires fuel suppliers to blend increasing amounts of SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and scaling to 70% by 2050. At the global level, the CORSIA program of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is imposing global emissions monitoring and supporting international adoption.

These measures are lowering entry barriers, spurring multibillion-dollar investments in new bio-refineries, and encouraging partnerships between airlines, refiners, and feedstock suppliers. They are also driving rapid market scale-up by guaranteeing long-term demand and facilitating financial close for large-scale projects.

Feedstock Logistics and Supply Chain Instability Pose Critical Cost Barriers

The SAF market confronts significant near-term risks from constrained feedstock supply and complex logistics. Used cooking oil (UCO) and tallow represent the leading feedstock, but geographic unevenness and regulatory hurdles, such as the EU’s RED II anti-fraud frameworks, have created uncertainty for sourcing and certification.

Biofuel producers face volatile pricing, while alternative feedstock sources such as lignocellulosic biomass face slow commercial maturity and high conversion costs. Transport infrastructure limitations, especially cold chain and bulk storage for low-volume feedstock, raise CAPEX and OPEX burdens.

Supply chain risks are further amplified by the limited availability of dedicated bio-refining facilities, often resulting in bottlenecks and sub-scale production runs. These systemic barriers require strategic feedstock diversification and robust traceability frameworks.

PtL and e-Fuels to Unlock Scale and Carbon Mitigation Possibilities

The rapid maturation of power-to-liquids (PtL) technology offers a transformative growth opportunity. PtL enables the production of e-kerosene from captured CO2 and renewable electricity, addressing both feedstock scarcity and carbon emissions. This technology is making notable headway in the renewable aviation fuel market, catalyzed by falling renewable energy costs and expanding hydrogen availability.

The EU is providing heavy funding for PtL innovation through the Horizon Europe initiative, with the first commercial e-fuel plants in Germany and Norway slated to come online by 2026. Airlines aiming for net-zero status are partnering with fuel innovators, providing offtake agreements and joint development capital. PtL’s scalability, grid interconnection, and carbon reduction profile position it as the next major driver of SAF adoption and investment prioritization.

LONDON, Dec. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Global energy and commodity price reporting agency Argus has launched the world's first assessed price for UK sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates, expanding its coverage of the northwest European SAF market.

The new prices will help market participants optimise their compliance with the UK SAF mandate by enabling them to compare the cost of purchasing SAF certificates, blending physical bio-SAF — produced from hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) feedstock, and paying 'buy-out' costs in case of non-compliance.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: ""As SAF mandates ramp up, companies will increasingly need reliable prices not just for the fuel itself but also for certificates. We have worked closely with the industry to develop this new price and we are confident that it will bring much-needed transparency as participants across the aviation value chain work to comply with tightening carbon-cutting mandates.""

The new assessment will track the price of certificates acceptable for meeting the UK SAF Mandate and based on manufacture using a relevant HEFA feedstock.

These tradeable certificates are generated by supplying eligible SAF in the UK and are then redeemed by obligated parties to comply with the mandate's rules. The mandate allows companies which exceed their own quota to sell their excess certificates to others needing to comply.

From 2025, the UK requires jet fuel suppliers to blend 2pc SAF into their domestic aviation fuel deliveries to curb emissions. The mandate increases year by year, rising to 10pc by 2030 and to 22pc by 2040. Transparent pricing for the UK certificates market will therefore become increasingly valuable.

This first UK SAF certificate price complements Argus' existing suite of assessments for tradeable biofuel tickets for road transport mandates in the UK and in several EU countries. Argus also provides a range of physical SAF prices in northwest Europe, including SAF produced using the HEFA pathway and the first-ever modelled production costs for electrolytic SAF (e-SAF).

These unexpected software changes were dealt with swifter than anticipated, and most Airbus fleets are now returning to normal operations.

An Unprecedented Disruption

This was one of the broadest emergency recalls in the European plane maker’s history, prompting huge concerns around travel disruption during the Thanksgiving weekend.

The CEO of Saudi budget carrier Flyadeal, Steven Greenway shared on the matter:

“The thing hit us about 9pm (Jeddah time) and I was back in here about 9:30. I was actually quite surprised how quickly we got through it: there are always complexities.”

Due to this disruption, various airlines were affected, struggling to gauge the impact due to the general alert lacking the affected jets’ serial numbers. Engineers began working on individual jets, and Airbus initially estimated that three hours of work would be required per plane.

Nonetheless, whilst at least one major airline faced delays, many completed the updates without cancelling any flights, such as UK’s easyJet and Wizz Air.

New Updates From Airbus

Currently, there are fewer than 100 jets still requiring work, which involves reverting to an earlier version of software that handles the nose angle. However, it seems some of the older A320 jets require more than a simple software reset, and a new computer entirely will need to be installed.

CEO Guillaume Fuary has publicly apologised on the incident, as industry executives discuss the changes that have been made in the industry’s playbook after the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. During that crisis, the company was heavily criticised in its handling of fatal crashes after a software design error. Now, this sudden recall is the first time that Airbus has dealt with global safety attention on such a scale.

Ronn Torossian, chairman of New York-based 5W Public Relations, spoke on the matter:

“Is Airbus acting with the Boeing MAX crisis in mind? Absolutely – every company in the aviation sector is. Boeing paid the reputational price for hesitation and opacity. Airbus clearly wants to show… a willingness to say, ‘We could have done better’.”

Amongst the European airlines biddings, the Lufthansa Group has submitted a formal request expressing its interest, confirming earlier expectations that the German aviation group would join the race. Lufthansa said it aims to form a long-term partnership with TAP should its bid move ahead. In a recent statement, CEO Carsten Spohr said the airline group “welcomes the Portuguese government’s privatization process,”adding that Lufthansa intends to strengthen Portugal’s global connectivity and protect Portuguese identity.

IAG, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, has also joined the list of bidders, signaling its intent to expand its presence on southern European routes where TAP plays a strategic role. Another major contender is Air France-KLM, which has shown repeated interest in strengthening its footprint on Atlantic routes.

TAP Privatization Decision

Parpública, the state holding company overseeing the sale, now has 20 days to review all submitted expressions of interest and prepare a detailed report evaluating whether candidates meet the participation requirements, according to the official process.

While TAP remains a key player in transatlantic travel, the airline ranked last in Europe for flight punctuality in October 2025. The report, published by OAG, measures delays and cancellations and considers a flight late if it arrives more than 15 minutes after its scheduled time. Despite the low punctuality score, TAP’s cancellation rate was among the lowest, highlighting a noticeable contrast between delays and overall operational reliability.

As the TAP privatization 2025 process advances, the coming months will determine which European airline group gains a strategic foothold in Portugal’s aviation landscape.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/marc-najera-BuypDMP4FPI-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:56:34.731144

Thankfully, technological advances have helped keep airline emissions in check. Even with a long flight, air travel doesn’t have to wreak havoc on the planet’s health. Read on to look at what intercontinental travel routes reveal about sustainable emissions tech.

Cutting Emissions with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

As airlines aim to cut emissions, sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as a key solution. Its low carbon footprint and limited air pollution contributions make it an appealing alternative to jet fuel. Best of all, airplanes won’t have to make big adjustments to use it. Unfortunately, though, SAF’s limited production means there’s not a lot of it to go around. And for intercontinental flights, it’s especially hard to meet fueling demands. Given the advantages offered by SAF for travel, however, it seems likely production will soon increase.

Investing in Better Long-Range Aircraft

With the advent of better long-range jets, it’s possible to use less fuel during intercontinental flights. The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 are among the leading aircraft thanks to their lightweight builds and more efficient engines. These airplanes are an ideal choice for longer intercontinental flights due to their lower carbon footprint. Passengers won’t see any differences during their flight aside from the knowledge that their environmental impact is lower.

Considering the Impact of Contrails

Contrails, which look like clouds that airplanes draw in the sky, can contribute to warming in the atmosphere. The best way to intervene in this problem is to reduce the presence of contrails. Thanks to AI, it’s possible for flight crews to analyze weather and wind, and adjust their routes in response. Airplanes won’t need to burn lots of extra fuel to make these adjustments, either.

Passengers can look for Sydney–Mumbai flight deals, for instance, without feeling concerned about their environmental impact. And passengers can take matters into their own hands to look at factors like contrails. Emissions tools, like the ICAO calculator, allow passengers to visualize the climate impact of their travels more easily. They can weigh environmental impact considerations like the routes and airplanes before booking a flight.

Building Better Flight Paths

Airplanes aren’t the only key to better emissions solutions in the airline industry. Flight paths can make a difference, as well. And, increasingly, airplanes are turning to tech to ensure smooth shifts from one altitude to another. Continuous Climb Operations (CCO) and Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) enable better transitions that consume less fuel and make intercontinental flights more efficient. Ultimately, though, air traffic controllers and pilots must work together carefully to allow these altitude shifts to happen in crowded skies.

Planning a More Sustainable Flight

Intercontinental flights let passengers explore new spaces and connect with the places and people they love. But for sustainably-minded passengers, emissions matter. Passengers should look for newer planes, AI-enhanced emissions calculators, and SAF before booking flights. By gaining knowledge about the latest sustainability practices, passengers can make more informed travel choices.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 10:57:57.835019

Nils Heuer, director of sales at Deutsche Aircraft, said he saw many manufacturers of small aircraft in Canada and Europe go out of business since the early 2000s.
“Many airlines don’t have access to aircraft that can replace their ageing fleets, and therefore we, as Deutsche Aircraft, said it’s time,” said Heuer.
While Heuer said Deutsche Aircraft doesn’t publicly discuss pricing, Chris Reynolds – president of Yellowknife-based Air Tindi – said new aircraft in general can cost a pretty penny.
“If you look at the most optimum way to run an airline and a fleet of aircraft, it’s to modernize your fleet.","Small aircraft keep people in the NWT connected to each other and the rest of Canada, but some planes in the territory have been running for 40 years – and others for much longer.

Though many of those planes have been well maintained, having had so many parts replaced, they might as well be considered new.

A German company, Deutsche Aircraft, is zeroing in on a market with relatively few competitors, launching what it calls a next-generation turboprop that can take off and land on short, unpaved runways, designed specifically for the unique and harsh conditions of Canada’s North and the NWT.

Nils Heuer, director of sales at Deutsche Aircraft, said he saw many manufacturers of small aircraft in Canada and Europe go out of business since the early 2000s.

“Many airlines don’t have access to aircraft that can replace their ageing fleets, and therefore we, as Deutsche Aircraft, said it’s time,” said Heuer.

“The market urgently needs a new aircraft … that comes with 21st-century technology to replace the ageing fleets that are getting less and less reliable.”

Heuer and his team presented their new aircraft, the D328eco, at the Canadian Aviation Conference and Tradeshow in Montreal last month.

The plane includes features like a gravel kit that prevents small stones from getting kicked up into the propeller, advanced weather radar, and engines built in Canada by Pratt & Whitney, Heuer said.

It can be configured to carry passengers and cargo or used as a medevac.

Heuer said conversations with members of organizations like the Air Transport Association of Canada and the Northern Air Transport Association helped inform the design.

“It’s really one-on-one conversations about their requirements, their daily challenges, what works well with their current fleets. What would they like to improve?” he said.

The plane is being marketed as a more sustainable and more efficient option for regional airlines, since it is compatible with sustainable aviation fuel.

Heuer said the company is aiming to make the D328eco compatible with all types of sustainable aviation fuel, including ones made from products like used cooking oils, as well as power-to-liquid fuels that use renewable energy (like solar or wind) to create synthetic aviation fuel.

He said while interest in those forms of fuels is building more slowly in Canada than Europe, he saw enthusiasm at the conference in Montreal.

“I expect it will become more and more [of a] topic over the next years here in Canada and also in other parts of the world,” said Heuer.

Flight testing for the D328eco will begin in 2026, Heuer said, and the manufacturer will have to meet requirements outlined by Transport Canada such withstanding the extreme cold of the Arctic and subarctic.

Feasible to upgrade?

While Heuer said Deutsche Aircraft doesn’t publicly discuss pricing, Chris Reynolds – president of Yellowknife-based Air Tindi – said new aircraft in general can cost a pretty penny.

“If you look at the most optimum way to run an airline and a fleet of aircraft, it’s to modernize your fleet. Have as most efficient as possible and fly as much as possible,” said Reynolds.

However, in a place like the NWT, airlines are tasked with covering a large geographic area with a relatively small population, he explained.

“[It’s] a massive challenge to try and fly as many hours as possible to pay off an aircraft that costs tens of millions of dollars,” said Reynolds.

He said aircraft used by bigger national airlines might fly 3,000 to 4,000 hours every year.

“Our aircraft probably only have 1,000 to 1,500 hours a year of utilization, which makes it almost uneconomical to constantly be able to modernize your fleet. The economics just don’t make sense,” said Reynolds.

He said northern-based companies tend to have a more rugged, older fleet, though that doesn’t mean they are any less maintained.

“It’s an incredible amount of maintenance that goes into them,” he said. “But it does cost you, because they’re not as efficient as possible.”

He said this largely applies to scheduled flights, though sometimes longer-term contracts present companies with the opportunity to invest in more efficient aircraft.

Representatives from multiple other northern airlines could not be reached for this article or declined an interview request.

Air Tindi’s fleet is mainly made up of planes made by De Havilland, a Canadian manufacturer that makes the Twin Otters, Dash 7s and Dash 8s that Air Tindi flies.

The Dash 7s, Reynolds said, aren’t replaceable with what’s available on the market currently.

“They land on the shortest, the most ugly runways,” said Reynolds.

“If there were new aircraft out there that were as capable, we would replace them, but there’s none. So we’ve invested in a multitude of parts and different things like that, to just keep them going as long as we can.

“And we’re proud to do that. They’re very exceptionally well-made, tough airplanes.”",https://i0.wp.com/cabinradio.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SMFOCHUK_GMAS_03_CABIN_RADIO.jpg?fit=960%2C639&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-01 10:58:02.535232

A pair of studies published in a recent issue of the journal Science could have major implications for improving processes in which syngas is converted into fuels and olefins.
The first study took aim at the high amounts of byproduct CO2 generated with current iron catalysts for F-T synthesis.
Coupling these two processes enables in-situ conversion of water generated during the STO process into hydrogen through the WGS reaction.
This lessens the incorporation of hydrogen from water and improves hydrogen atom economy (HAE; the proportion of reactant hydrogen that ends up in the hydrocarbon product).","The production of commercially important hydrocarbons from synthesis gas (syngas; mixtures of H2 and CO) using the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process is a key strategy for making fuels and chemicals from a range of non-petroleum feedstocks. But F-T processes are relatively expensive and generate substantial amounts of carbon dioxide.

A pair of studies published in a recent issue of the journal Science could have major implications for improving processes in which syngas is converted into fuels and olefins. Both papers offer viable strategies for maximizing the incorporation of hydrogen and carbon atoms from syngas into hydrocarbon compounds, potentially opening pathways to more efficient and less polluting liquid-fuel manufacturing.

The first study took aim at the high amounts of byproduct CO2 generated with current iron catalysts for F-T synthesis. Researchers led by Ding Ma at Peking University (Beijing, China) found that introducing a small amount of halogen-containing compounds into the feed gas could suppress CO2 formation. Specifically, co-feeding 20 parts per million of methyl bromide over an iron carbide catalyst decreased the amount of CO2 formed in the F-T process from around 30% to less than 1%.

The team describes how bromine atoms can bind to the iron active sites, thus blocking the water molecules’ access to the catalyst sites and preventing the reactions that lead to CO2 formation. “This strategy provides a simple, scalable and broadly applicable route for carbon-efficient syngas conversion,” the researchers write.

In another study, researchers from Tsinghua University (Beijing) found that an iron-carbide-magnetite nanoparticle catalyst (specifically, a sodium-promoted FeCx@Fe3O4 core-shell nanoparticle catalyst with iron carbides at the core and magnetite on the surface) could couple the water-gas shift (WGS) and syngas-to-olefins (STO) reactions in situ.

The Airbus A350 is increasingly becoming a flagship for airlines all across the globe, and this airline is not different.","SWISS International Air Lines has big plans for its long-haul fleet, with the carrier set to make several major upgrades to its fleet. This includes new aircraft and a new onboard product. The newest aircraft set to join the fleet will be the Airbus A350-900, which SWISS has selected to serve as the next flagship widebody of its long-haul fleet as part of a larger modernization effort. The product itself is SWISS Senses, a full long-haul cabin and service concept set to lift comfort across the board in every cabin

All the while, this concept will give the airline a more competitive premium proposition that will allow it to compete against European rivals. The two moves, the introduction of the A350 and the launch of these new cabins, are set to come hand-in-hand, with a new interior from day one. The airline itself is already using the aircraft on flagship routes such as Zurich to Boston, a service that showcases all the possibilities this new cabin concept brings to the table.

Over the next five years, the A350 fleet will continue to grow steadily, while SWISS will also start spreading its products across long-haul types. The plan is going to come in phases, with the standard new product arriving on A350s first, before retrofits see the cabin come to A330s and, eventually, Boeing 777-300ERs closer to the end of the decade. Once the 2030s come around, the carrier hopes to be well-prepared to cater to the needs of premium travelers for the upcoming decade.

The Airbus A350-900 Will Be SWISS's New Long-Haul Flagship

The biggest headline update being made by SWISS is the airline's shift to the A350-900, with Airbus recently confirming delivery of the first A350 as part of an order for 10 aircraft. For SWISS, this number matters, as it's large enough to make the aircraft a true long-haul workhorse and not just some jet deployed on a few specific routes. It gives the airline the flexibility it needs to deploy the type on rotations all across North America while keeping maintenance costs under control.

The delivery arc for this fleet will stretch across five years, with the bulk of the impact held towards the back half of the decade. SWISS expects the first aircraft to enter the network immediately, then it will gradually scale its A350 service network as more airframes arrive. SWISS has framed the A350 story as a cornerstone of the airline's overall fleet modernization. Airbus also highlights the aircraft's efficiency and a passenger-friendly cabin as part of the model's overall market appeal.

On the airline side, the strategy is extremely clear as the A350 offers SWISS the opportunity to renew capacity while anchoring premium long-haul services around a more modern platform that can support its newest cabins. It will serve as the launch platform for the airline's long-haul next-generation premium cabins, and the potential this aircraft offers is clearly immeasurable, especially on the highest-potential nonstop services.

SWISS Senses Cabins Will Offer A Real Upgrade

The A350 is the new metal that is joining the fleet, but the introduction of SWISS Senses cabins will be the major change. These cabins offer a redesigned long-haul cabin concept that SWISS positions as a product that blends the traditional Swiss design with modern functionality. The centerpiece is a newly developed cabin that debuts on the Airbus A350 and is extended to the A330 and the Boeing 777 fleets.

This look leans into a subdued palette, and the inclusion of higher-end materials and a lighting strategy helps ease jet lag across the board for all passengers. The hardware details in these new cabins are designed with passenger needs in mind. In first class, SWISS continues to highlight that it will be introducing lockable sliding doors, higher walls, personal wardrobe space, wireless charging, and strong Bluetooth connectivity.

The airline will also introduce large 4K OLED entertainment screens. In business class, the concept will be broadened into multiple different types of seats while maintaining all-aisle direct access, updated controls, larger screens, and additional available storage.

Premium economy and economy passengers will also be able to enjoy larger entertainment screens, improved connectivity, revised ergonomics, and more, with SWISS aiming to optimize seat design that enables increased pitch in economy-class cabins. SWISS is not just treating this as a boutique refresh to its cabins, but, rather, a fleet-wide long-haul standard.

A Comprehensive Five-Year Rollout

SWISS is taking a deliberately staged approach to its gradual fleet expansion. The airline is attempting to balance modest growth while capturing near-term opportunities. First, the A350s arrive already fitted with SWISS Senses cabins, which will allow the airline to market a next-generation experience immediately on its highest-yielding long-haul routes. This is already happening, with the A350 entering service on a showcase service from Zurich (ZRH) to Boston Logan International Airport (BOS).

Up next is a wave of A330 retrofits, which external reporting indicates is due to start from the middle of 2026. This is a practical move, as the A330s are a large part of SWISS's long-haul backbone. Updating these jets quickly expands the customer touchpoints for the new product, especially when it comes to business travelers who care less about aircraft type and more about maintaining a consistent passenger experience.

Lastly, there will be the complete refurbishment of the airline's Boeing 777-300ER fleet. SWISS will be undertaking a major upgrade to its 777 fleet with new first and business suites, although most reporting suggests that this process will not begin until at least 2029. This pushes the 777 towards the end of the next five-year window. By 2030, the airline is looking to continue growing A350 capacity with its retrofit programs all well underway, which will all help the airline improve long-term profitability.

Impacts On Fuel Economics & The Airline's Sustainability Strategy

Widebody fleet decisions are, at the end of the day, financial decisions for a major airline. SWISS's timing reflects the airline's reality as a long-haul carrier. It needs aircraft that can deliver efficiency gains while supporting the needs of its global network. Airbus positions the A350 as a step-change in terms of fuel burn and operating economics in comparison to older generations. SWISS's selection of the Airbus A350-900 aligns with a broader fleet modernization narrative.

Here, efficiency supports both overall cost control and sustainability goals. The A350 is already capable of operating with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, with longer-term ambitions to raise that certification level as fuel supply chains continue to evolve. For SWISS, these are advantages that matter because premium product upgrades on their own do not compensate for structurally higher unit costs seen on older aircraft.

The Airbus A350 gives SWISS a more modern platform to operate premium cabins, helping the carrier defend its margins, and its retrofit strategy highlights a longer-term vision. Its staged nature showcases SWISS's interest in avoiding grounding too much capacity at once, something essential for a network carrier that is looking to balance seasonality and bank structures. It is looking to continue building out its premium footprint while delivering the products that customers want and will pay high fares for.

What Does This Say About SWISS's Premium Strategy?

The SWISS story is certainly important in itself, but the bigger point is the message that the airline is sending to the market and to competitors. The carrier is highlighting that premium traffic is its specialty and that the carrier is investing accordingly. SWISS Senses is routinely framed as the airline's most important long-haul product investment, and one that the carrier believes is helping pull it ahead of some competitors.

The details of these cabin modifications lean increasingly on the upscale side, with private first-class suites and business seating options clearly catering to the modern high-end traveler. Critically, SWISS is trying to avoid a common premium pitfall, with a fantastic seat on one aircraft type and a previous-generation experience on another.

The airline plans on pretty much resolving this problem by the end of the decade. There is also something to be said about the airline's decision to reinvest in first-class cabins. The carrier's decision to keep building premium cabins highlights that it remains focused on serving not just premium travelers, but ultra-high-spending clientele.

The Bottom Line

SWISS's long-haul product refresh over the next five years is a coordinated twin-track upgrade plan. The airline's new Airbus A350s and SWISS Senses cabin concept will join forces to elevate the airline's product offerings. The Airbus A350 is increasingly becoming a flagship for airlines all across the globe, and this airline is not different. The airline's ability to deploy premium metal on high-yield routes will become a key point of attraction for investors.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/senses.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-30 22:56:50.189620

The company hopes its corn-based ethanol can power cleaner jet fuel and keep the industry afloat as the world shifts away from fossil fuels. Supporters hail SAF as the next frontier of green energy, but skeptics question whether it is truly sustainable or merely a repackaging of traditional ethanol. Turning corn into jet fuel may sound like climate progress, yet it maintains the same industrial system, one still tied to carbon, land, and water costs.

The global push for SAF gained momentum after the 2015 Paris Agreement, when world leaders committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Soon after, both the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) issued their own pledges, acknowledging aviation’s growing contribution to climate change. In 2024, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker renewed this momentum at the SAF Conference in Rosemont, announcing plans to to make Illinois a hub for sustainable fuel development. With its strong agricultural base and expanding climate incentives, including a $1.50 per gallon tax credit and CEJA provisions, which include the phase out of carbon emissions from energy and transit, Illinois appears well-positioned to take a leading role in net zero aviation.

Despite this optimism, we should be cautious about buying into the hype. Achieving net zero aviation remains a distant goal. The IATA projects that SAF must supply 65 percent of jet fuel by 2050, yet current production covers less than one percent of global demand. U.S. agencies aim to replace all domestic jet fuel with SAFs by 2050, but in 2024 output barely reached 30 million gallons, far short of the three billion gallons needed by 2030. Closing that gap would require orders of magnitude more feedstock and infrastructure than currently exists.

Most SAFs are made from fats and oils through the HEFA process, often using food-grade feedstocks such as corn and soy. This raises concerns about deforestation, competition with food production, and limited carbon reduction benefits. Even optimistic analyses acknowledge that crop-based SAF offers modest emissions reductions–if any–once land-use change and fertilizer use are factored in. And because aviation demand continues to rise, SAF doesn’t so much eliminate emissions as attempt to slow their growth.

Scaling SAF production to the levels envisioned by the aviation industry appears impractical. Meeting these targets would require a massive expansion of corn and soy cultivation, far beyond what current farmland can support without displacing food crops. Advocates suggest this could occur on marginal land, but such land is scarce, and determining what qualifies as marginal is far from straightforward. In the United States, more than 75 percent of available farmland is already dedicated to food, feed, and exports, while much of the remainder consists of grasslands, wetlands, and forests that store carbon and support biodiversity. Converting these areas would undermine the very sustainability SAF proponents claim to advance.

Policy and politics further complicate the SAF hype. The Inflation Reduction Act created a tax credit to promote SAF, starting at $1.25 per gallon for fuels cutting emissions by at least 50 percent. Initially, only SAFs meeting strict ICAO standards qualified, excluding high-emission corn ethanol. However, after lobbying by ethanol producers, the government adopted the GREET model, which downplays land-use emissions, allowing corn- and soy-based fuels to qualify. The Biden administration even funded adjustments to make this possible. Governor Pritzker’s participation in the 2024 SAF Conference, which was actually organized by IL Corn Growers Association, highlights how policy, politics, and powerful farm interests now shape the SAF public narrative.

All of this raises a fundamental question: Is SAF a climate strategy, or simply a new market for the same old system? The facts point toward the latter. SAF, as currently envisioned, relies heavily on commodity crops that already strain soils, waterways, and rural economies. Scaling corn- or soy-based aviation fuel would increase fertilizer use, accelerate erosion, and place even more pressure on marginal lands—all while delivering minimal climate benefit.

Illinois has an opportunity to lead, but leadership doesn’t mean chasing every “green” market offered by the industries we already subsidize. True climate leadership would focus on reducing aviation demand, accelerating efficiency, and developing SAF pathways that do not depend on vast quantities of food-grade crops. It would also mean investing in agricultural diversification, soil restoration, perennial crops, and regional food supply chains—strategies that strengthen rural communities rather than tying them to another volatile commodity cycle.

SAF may have a role to play in aviation’s future. But treating corn and soy as the backbone of that future is neither sustainable nor realistic. The state should resist the temptation to replicate the ethanol era at 30,000 feet. A cleaner aviation system—and a healthier agricultural system—will require innovation, not a rebranded version of the status quo.",https://prairierivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SAF-Blog-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 23:56:15.706736

Singapore’s green fuel levy decoded

Here’s a quick look at who’s affected by the green fuel levy in Singapore, the amount to be paid, and more:

The amount paid will depend on the travel class and the distance travelled.

Economy and premium economy travellers will pay SGD 1 for flights to Southeast Asia.

Those travelling to Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea in an economy cabin will have to pay SGD 2.80, whereas those travelling in a premium cabin will have to pay SGD 11.20.

Passengers in an economy cabin, travelling to Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand, will have to pay SGD 2.80, whereas those in a premium cabin will have to pay SGD 25.60 for the same destinations.

Those in an economy cabin will have to pay SGD 10.40, whereas those in a premium cabin will have to pay SGD 41.60 for a flight to the Americas.

Passengers who are merely transiting through Singapore will not be charged.

For passengers travelling on flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

Cargo flights will also have to pay the levy, which will be charged on a per-kg basis.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel can be made from a variety of sources, including used cooking oil, municipal waste, or directly from captured carbon.

The collected funds will go into a reserve that will be used for the centralised purchase of SAF. According to a report on Channel News Asia, the airline that collects the levy must display the charges as a distinct line item on the air ticket being sold.

This cooperation focuses on identifying natural hydrogen production zones, establishing logistics corridors, and creating dedicated storage and processing infrastructure.
Despite this focus on white hydrogen, SOHAR remains committed to advancing green hydrogen initiatives.
Additionally, SOHAR has partnered with a Swiss consortium to explore establishing a green hydrogen corridor between Oman and Switzerland.","MUSCAT, NOV 30 — The recent discovery of naturally occurring hydrogen, also known as native or white hydrogen, in Suhar has bolstered prospects for its development as a key resource in advancing the decarbonisation objectives of SOHAR Port and Freezone, a senior official from the maritime hub stated.

Emile Hoogsteden, CEO of SOHAR, emphasized the port’s ongoing partnership with Swiss natural hydrogen specialist HYNAT SA to explore subsurface hydrogen reserves in the area. Unlike conventional hydrogen, white hydrogen is geologically formed and naturally present within the Earth’s crust, presenting an opportunity for direct extraction from underground reservoirs as a clean, low-carbon energy source.

“Reserves in this region have been confirmed,” Hoogsteden said. “The next step involves extraction testing to evaluate feasibility and energy yield. Should this prove viable, it could supply a direct, low-carbon fuel source to industries within SOHAR,” he added during an interview with The Energy Year, a UK-based business intelligence platform.

In July, SOHAR signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HYNAT SA aimed at developing a comprehensive natural hydrogen value chain in Oman. This cooperation focuses on identifying natural hydrogen production zones, establishing logistics corridors, and creating dedicated storage and processing infrastructure. Earlier in February, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals had also signed an MoU granting HYNAT the rights to conduct feasibility studies.

Despite this focus on white hydrogen, SOHAR remains committed to advancing green hydrogen initiatives. Hoogsteden stated, “We are also pursuing green hydrogen development at SOHAR to further strengthen its position as a green manufacturing hub.”

Dr. Abdullah al Abri, Vice President — Sustainability at SOHAR, highlighted the port’s strong existing hydrogen demand, driven by its refinery, petrochemical, and DRI-based steel industries. He described SOHAR as a natural national hub for green hydrogen production. The strategic approach involves starting with small pilot projects to build expertise and confidence. Currently, an investment proposal is being finalized to install 80–100 MW of grid-connected electrolysers, providing a continuous hydrogen supply to port industries and mitigating the intermittency challenges associated with standalone renewable sources.

On The Energy Talks platform, Dr. Al Abri explained that this strategy minimizes investment risk by leveraging the existing grid, which is already about 11% renewable and expected to reach 30% by 2030. This setup allows for the use of renewable energy certificates and guarantees a reliable, uninterrupted hydrogen supply to end users.

Additionally, SOHAR has partnered with a Swiss consortium to explore establishing a green hydrogen corridor between Oman and Switzerland. This collaboration builds on a 2023 intergovernmental framework agreement to develop a joint implementation road map and related projects, reflecting both nations’ shared carbon neutrality goals.

Dr. Al Abri underscored hydrogen’s strategic significance for SOHAR. The port currently supports various industries and LNG bunkering operations, with plans to advance methanation as the next phase. As biofuel industries expand, their biogenic CO₂ emissions could be utilized to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other green fuels. This pathway aligns closely with SOHAR’s long-term decarbonisation strategy, in which hydrogen plays a central role.

Last week in Singapore business, the Ministry of Health is set to revamp Integrated Shield Plan riders from April 2026. Full-deductible coverage will be removed, and the annual co-payment cap will increase to at least $6,000, with premiums expected to fall by around 30%.

Economists expect Singapore’s economic growth to moderate in 2026 after a strong 2025 driven by AI-related demand, electronics exports, and a robust construction pipeline. The gross domestic product growth is forecast at 2.1–3%, with potential headwinds including slowing exports and ongoing trade risks such as US tariffs.

The economy is anticipated to normalise rather than face a sharp slowdown, supported by continued activity in finance, construction, and digital services.

Inflation is also projected to rise to around 1.5% in 2026, reflecting domestic cost adjustments and policy measures including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel levy, higher carbon taxes, and rising electricity tariffs. Core inflation is expected to mirror this pace, though offsets such as lower childcare fee caps may help moderate overall price pressures.

The housing market will also see change, as the supply of HDB flats reaching their minimum occupation period (MOP) is set to more than double from 2026. Newer flats may command higher rents, widening estate-level disparities, whilst rising numbers of Employment Pass and work-pass holders are expected to support demand for smaller units and room rentals.

Overall rental growth is forecast to remain moderate at 1% to 3%.

With operators projecting subdued revenue and profit growth alongside rising supply and softer trading metrics, Singapore’s hotel market is also set for a weaker 2025.

Meanwhile, the rollout of robotaxis in Singapore remains a long-term prospect. Widespread adoption is unlikely within the next five years due to public trust issues, regulatory hurdles, technical limitations, and unresolved liability concerns.

Early deployments are expected in controlled environments such as university campuses, industrial parks, and last-mile shuttle routes, with longer-term opportunities in autonomous software, system development, and complementary transport services.

Supporting small businesses, CIMB Singapore has launched the CIMB Founders Card, offering sole proprietors and entrepreneurs easier access to working-capital funding.

The card provides flexible documentation, extended interest-free periods of up to 114 days, and business-friendly perks such as airport lounge access, travel insurance, and discounts on co-working spaces. Early users report that it helps manage seasonal expenses, inventory, and growth initiatives.

Applicable Policy and Categorization. AIIB’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), will apply to this Project. ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) is applicable for assessment of environmental and social (ES) impacts of Project activities. ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) may be triggered for access road works and the development of an associated high voltage distribution line (DL) that will be implemented prior to operations, but ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not expected to apply to this Project as neither the biorefinery nor pipelines are located in or near Indigenous Peoples’ land. The Project has been determined as Category A in accordance with the ESF. This assignation has been made considering the sensitive social context with low income communities present in proximity to the biorefinery and pipeline route; construction on contaminated land and elevated health risks to workers during construction; elevated reputational risks around feedstock supply chain including for Soybean Oil (SBO) and Used Cooking Oil (UCO); and the nature and scale of the biorefinery process and associated emissions and health, safety and emergency risks, alone and in-combination with the existing refinery complex and pipelines.

Environmental and Social Instruments. The Client has developed a suite of ES assessments and management plans for the biorefinery and pipelines under Brazilian legislation that are largely consistent with AIIB’s ESF. The pipelines and minor works at the port facility are addressed through the Environmental Impact Analysis Report: Application for Alteration License (LA) - Expansion of operations at the Madre de Deus Terminal (Transpetro, April 2025). The biorefinery works are covered by the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): Renewable Fuels Production Plant, volumes 1-4 (Acelen, September 2025). A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has also been prepared for conformity with ESS1 and other key instruments are available including a quantitative risk assessment and health impact assessment and management plan for works on contaminated land. Additional assessment and management instruments are committed by the Client or in development to address outstanding gaps against the ESF. These include finalization of a critical habitat assessment (CHA) and ES management instruments for the TL. The Client is developing an Integrated Management System (IMS) for construction and operation based on an existing fully developed IMS for the Mataripe Refinery. This is considered compliant with ESS1 in relation to Environmental and Social Management Systems (ESMS) and the Client has strong institutional capacity to develop, implement and monitor management system performance.

Environmental Aspects. The HEFA facility will be implemented on brownfield land that will be decontaminated. The Client is identifying and managing risks in accordance with good international industry practice (GIIP). The HEFA plant will utilize contracted Soybean Oil (SBO), Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and is capable of processing other vegetable oils and tallow as feedstock. Soybean production has been linked to deforestation in Brazil. The importance of managing feedstock risks is recognized by the Client and reflected in a suite of mitigations. Biodiversity risks have been considered and impacts on critical habitat are not presently anticipated. The HEFA plant and pipelines are located within areas of natural (although heavily anthropized) habitat and will result in the loss of ~1,500 trees. The Client is committed to achieving no net loss in accordance with ESS1. Assessment of biodiversity risk associated with the high voltage distribution line is committed. During operation, the HEFA plant will emit pollutants including carbon oxides nitrogen (NOX and NO2) and sulfur oxides (SOX and SO2) from across three stacks. Pollution abatement technologies are included in the design, and the Client is committed to achieving GIIP for emissions to air as per the World Bank Group EHS Guidelines for Oleochemical Manufacturing. The change in local air quality as a result of biorefinery emissions in combination with emissions from the existing refinery are small and not significant for human health. Additional potential environmental risks from HEFA plant construction and operations include water consumption and water discharge, energy consumption, waste management, noise emissions, hazardous materials management and risks of pollution incidents. The Client has developed outline management plans aligned with GIIP for managing these risks that will be further elaborated as the project approaches construction and then operations.

Social and Gender Aspects. The Project is expected to deliver substantial social benefits, including employment generation, local economic development, contributions to Brazil’s energy transition, and the enhancement of technical expertise in the production of SAF and RD. There is no need for land acquisition and no legacy issues related to land acquisition or resettlement for the biorefinery or the associated pipeline, which will be constructed within an existing RoW. It is possible that small areas of land may be required for access roads and the DL but this is not yet confirmed. A Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) consistent with ESS 2 is committed in case this issue is realized. The Project will not be implemented on Indigenous Peoples’ lands. Other relevant social risks include community health and safety impacts from construction activities, potential tensions related to security personnel, risks of sexual harassment and exploitation (SH&E), and the influx of non-local workers. Safeguards to mitigate these risks in relation to labor rights, gender-based violence, and worker protection are included for in Brazilian law or otherwise committed by the Client. In addition, the Project presents opportunities to advance gender equality in line with Brazil’s National Policy for Women and Bahia State’s policies on gender inclusion and equity. Gender-related risks include heightened risks of GBV, sexual harassment, and exploitation, particularly linked to the potential influx of non-local workers. The Client is committed to further assessing GBV risks and adopting GIIP for managing all gender issues.

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions. The Project will involve typical construction-related OHS risks for workers, including collisions with moving machinery and vehicles, hazards associated with non-iodizing radiation, hazardous chemicals, electric shocks, working at height, confined spaces, hot works, mechanical and load-handling risks, and exposure to noise, dust, heat and vapors etc. These risks will be addressed through a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Program included in the Client’s Integrated Management System. In addition, Brazil has federal and state labor legislation, including requirements under the “Consolidação das Leis do Trabalho” (CLT) and “Normas Regulamentadoras” (NRs), which establish mandatory protections for workers health, safety, and fair labor conditions. In Bahia, these requirements are reinforced through the “Agenda Bahia do Trabalho Decente”, which promotes compliance with labor rights, gender equality, and safe working environments.

Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure. An SEP has been prepared and meaningful consultations on the Project were carried out in eight directly impacted communities as part of the national permitting process. In line with the SEP, stakeholder engagement will continue throughout the Project cycle to ensure transparent communication and responsiveness to community concerns. In accordance with Brazilian law, the environmental assessment and management documentation prepared to obtain the permits for the biorefinery and pipelines were published on the website of the Environment and Water Resources Institute (“Instituto do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Hídricos” -INEMA) as part of the consultation process. The pipeline LA, biorefinery EIA and a non-technical summary (in English and Portuguese), and the Project SEP were subsequently disclosed on the Acelen Renewables’ website on 29 November 2025 at: https://www.acelenrenovaveis.com.br/biorrefinaria-adicionais/.

Airlines took a hit during the pandemic, as did so many global industries. But in 2024, annual air travel returned to pre-pandemic levels and according to Bain & Company’s July 2025 report Air Travel Forecast to 2040: Geopolitics and the Carbon Challenge, the long-term outlook for air travel is expected to remain stable. The management consultancy expects global revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) to reach 14.8 trillion by 2040 or 178 percent of 2019 volume. This demand will be driven by both mature and emerging markets. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) February 2025 report Air Passenger Demand Forecasting: The Future of Global Air Travel (2024 to 2044) expects demand to be driven by both mature markets like Europe where the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of annual passenger traffic is expected to be 2.5 percent and emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific where CAGR is slated to hit 5.1 percent through 2043.

But there are headwinds as far as the industry’s ability to scale up and meet this increased demand. The first issue is aircraft supply, which isn’t keeping up with demand due to issues with aerospace supply chains and skilled labor shortages. McKinsey & Company points out in its February 2025 report How Severe Is the Aircraft Shortage and What Happens Next? that airlines are keeping older aircraft in service longer.

The other pressing issue? Sustainability.

Mandated Sustainability

“It’s not just an environmental imperative, it’s actually an economic survival strategy,” said Pedro de la Fuente, IATA’s senior manager, sustainability, The Americas. “From an industry standpoint, we need to ensure that we reduce lifecycle emissions in a way that will help aviation maintain a license to operate as we see more governments tightening climate regulations.”

Governments around the globe began implementing regulations following the signing of the Paris Agreement at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Nearly 200 countries signed a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), outlining their plans to reduce carbon emissions in order to reach the agreement's goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels so emissions can reach net zero by 2050. This has since led to various net zero coalitions such as the UN-backed Race to Zero, which has been signed by thousands of companies, cities and educational institutions.

Alternative Aircraft

One way of addressing sustainability issues and the scarcity of new aircraft is by looking to electric, hydrogen-powered and hybrid aircraft. While these technologies are still in development and show some promise, de la Fuente noted that they also face an uncertain future due to scalability and adoption. “We don’t have the capacity today to charge an aircraft at a speed that allows for a quick turnaround flight, nor do we have the capacity to supply green hydrogen in our airport fuel supply,” he said.

Nevertheless, these alternatively-powered aircraft are expected to have a place in the broader aviation landscape. Medical supply delivery, passenger transport and natural disaster response in remote locations can all benefit from the efficiency of global Advanced Air Mobility, which the World Economic Forum makes a case for in its 2024 whitepaper Advanced Air Mobility: Shaping the Future of Aviation. This new air transportation system deploys automated aircraft including drones and Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) air taxis that are electric and sustainable. They also have the ability to shuttle passengers between urban and suburban locations as well as potentially offer more regional transit.

Aviation’s Reduction Efforts

After the Paris Agreement took effect, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) launched the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2016. Now voluntary, this program will become mandatory for all international airlines in 2027. Intended to control carbon emissions from international flights as demand increases, CORSIA requires airlines to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or carbon offset credits. This is no small commitment.

The carbon emissions produced by the aviation industry have garnered particular attention. In September, World Travel & Tourism Council President Gloria Guevara said that transport accounts for 40 percent of the travel industry’s emissions. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), carbon emissions from aviation grew faster than rail, road or shipping between 2000 and 2019. By 2023, the IEA put aviation-produced carbon emissions at 90 percent of their pre-Covid peak.

The Carbon Offset Market

One approach to reaching net zero is the purchase of carbon offset credits or certificates. Organizations like Sustainable Travel International (STI) give both businesses, individuals and even destinations the ability to do this. The organization’s website features a calculator that can be used to measure the total carbon footprint of any given trip, including corporate travel, or business operation such as an event and then purchase an equivalent number of credits to mitigate that footprint. Credits go towards a variety of projects that ultimately provide a balance to the amount of carbon we produce. This includes reforestation, marshland and mangrove preservation, clean energy production and new climate technology.

STI’s CEO Paloma Zapata encourages travel for the experience to connect with other people and experience different cultures. She also adds “it’s important for people to be aware of the transition away from fossil fuels and to support it so that in the future, it’s not ‘sustainable travel,’ but simply how we travel.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Among the new climate tech that credits can support is sustainable aviation fuel or SAF. Unlike fossil-derived fuel, SAF is comprised of renewable or even waste products such as cooking oil, agricultural waste or captured carbon dioxide combined with hydrogen produced by solar or wind-generated electricity. SAF is purposefully designed for today’s commercial aircraft, but both expensive and limited in availability. According to the IATA roadmap, sustainable aviation fuel can represent up to 65% of the emissions reductions that the industry can achieve by 2050. “The scalability of where we are today in 2025 is mainly driven by SAF and addressing any residual emissions with carbon offsets to compensate,” said de la Fuente.

Scaling SAF production requires a greater volume of the materials used to produce it as well as greater development of and investment in the advanced technologies needed to scale up. Governmental support can accelerate SAF production at scale, but political involvement is largely limited to emissions regulations and in some cases, imposing relatively new taxes on a business’ carbon emissions.

To counter this, the aviation industry has turned to SAF certificates. Somewhat similar to purchasing carbon offset credits, SAF certificates directly and exclusively fund SAF production and the technologies and materials needed to produce it at scale. The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) is a prominent organization selling SAF certificates. “We’re focused on keeping the investment in the value chain, so SAF certificate investment goes directly to SAF production facilities and more importantly, it promotes technology change,” says Andre de Fontaine, managing director at the Center for Green Market Activation, which serves as SABA’s Secretariat. “Investment in SAF certificates creates a new revenue stream for these fuel producers to scale production.”

A Challenging Regulatory Environment

While SAF certificates are certainly beneficial, they simply aren’t enough. Some airlines give travelers the option to purchase a higher cost “green fare,” which is effectively the purchase of a SAF certificate with their ticket. But at this year’s IATA general meeting in New Delhi, CEO of Airline-FedEx and FedEx International told an audience that Americans are too cost-conscious to pay an additional cost while Europeans are more likely to make the investment.

The good news is that IATA expects SAF production to double to two million tons in 2025. That accounts for 0.7 percent of total aviation fuel demand. With EU and UK mandates taking effect at the start of 2025, the majority of that production will go to Europe. Those mandates have also led to a spike in Europe’s SAF costs.

What’s more, Bain & Company’s December 2024 analysis Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Supply Race Is On found that European production is expected to hit a 20 percent shortfall of mandate requirements by 2030. On top of that, the EU prohibits SAF production that relies on certain feedstocks such as corn, soybeans, cooking oil and animal fats because this may cause land use and food production to compete with SAF production. Without one of the most developed means of SAF production, the industry will have to quickly ramp up development of alternative feedstocks and latent technologies. The alternative is to import feedstock. As any importation generates carbon emissions, this would negate the purpose of SAF mandates. Although the UNFCCC only requires reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from domestic production, not imports. So on paper, importing SAF materials could potentially show a net positive.

“Coordination at the regulatory level globally would be helpful,” said de Fontaine. “Different regulatory jurisdictions have different views of what is sustainable and the EU has taken an aggressive view on keeping SAF focused on waste residues and avoiding associated feedstocks, which is creating some confusion among investors in SAF production. Different requirements in different jurisdictions is fragmenting the market a bit.”

At the aforementioned IATA conference, Pieter Elbers, CEO of India’s largest airline IndiGo, pointed out that SAF isn’t available in the country and he doesn’t see the point in importing. Instead, he looks to other means of driving sustainability, including maintaining a newer fleet and turning to electric ground operations.

In addition to those options, airlines globally are also looking to improve sustainability efforts by recycling plastics used onboard, composting food waste, improving flight planning and optimizing routing.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/Custom_Content/Sales/Thought_Leadership/AdobeStock_desk_468763206.jpeg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-11-30 16:56:11.582330

Eight OPEC+ countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, recently held a virtual meeting. They discussed global market conditions and future strategies. These nations had previously announced voluntary production adjustments in April and November 2023.

The group confirmed their decision to halt production increases for January through March 2026 due to seasonal factors. They emphasised that the 1.65 million barrels per day could be reinstated partially or fully based on market developments. This approach allows for flexibility in response to changing conditions.

In their commitment to market stability, the countries stressed the importance of a cautious strategy. They plan to continue pausing or reversing voluntary production adjustments as needed. This includes the 2.2 million barrels per day adjustment announced in November 2023.

The eight countries reiterated their dedication to achieving full compliance with the Declaration of Cooperation. This includes adhering to additional voluntary production adjustments monitored by the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC). They also aim to compensate for any excess production since January 2024.

Monthly meetings will be held by these nations to evaluate market conditions, compliance levels, and compensation efforts. This ongoing assessment ensures they remain aligned with their collective goals.

The collaborative efforts of these OPEC+ members highlight their commitment to maintaining market balance while adapting to evolving circumstances. Their strategic decisions are crucial for stabilising oil markets globally.

The recent discovery of naturally occurring hydrogen — also known as native or white hydrogen — in the Wilayat of Suhar has strengthened expectations around its potential development and use in advancing the decarbonisation goals of SOHAR Port and Freezone, according to a senior official of the maritime hub.

Emile Hoogsteden, CEO of SOHAR, highlighted the port’s ongoing collaboration with Swiss natural hydrogen specialist HYNAT SA in exploring subsurface hydrogen in the region. Natural or white hydrogen is geologically generated and found naturally in the Earth’s crust, offering the prospect of direct production from underground reservoirs as a clean, low-carbon energy source.

“Reserves in the area are confirmed and the next stage is extraction testing to assess feasibility and energy potential” Hoogsteden said. “If viable, it would provide a direct, low-carbon fuel source for Sohar’s industries”, he added in an interview with The Energy Year, a UK-based business intelligence platform.

In July, SOHAR signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HYNAT SA to advance the development of a full natural hydrogen value chain in Oman. The collaboration focuses on identifying and assessing natural hydrogen production zones, developing logistics corridors and creating dedicated storage and processing infrastructure. Earlier in February, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals had also signed an MoU granting HYNAT rights to carry out feasibility studies.

This interest in white hydrogen does not diminish SOHAR’s commitment to green hydrogen. “We are also looking to develop green hydrogen in SOHAR and further strengthen SOHAR’s position as a green manufacturing hub”, Hoogsteden noted.

According to Dr Abdullah al Abri, Vice President — Sustainability, SOHAR already hosts strong hydrogen demand from its refinery, petrochemical and DRI-based steel industries, positioning the port as a natural national hub for green hydrogen production. He said the strategy is to begin with small pilot projects to build experience and confidence, including an investment case now being finalised to install 80–100 MW of grid-connected electrolysers that can supply continuous hydrogen to port industries and avoid the intermittency associated with standalone renewables.

Speaking on The Energy Talks platform, Dr Al Abri explained that this approach de-risks investment, noting that renewables are capital-intensive and often require storage. Connecting electrolysers to a grid that is already about 11% renewable — and expected to reach 30% by 2030 — provides flexibility, enables the use of renewable energy certificates and ensures reliable, uninterrupted hydrogen supply to end users.

He added that SOHAR has also established a partnership with a Swiss consortium to explore a green corridor between Oman and Switzerland, with both countries sharing carbon-neutrality goals and building on a 2023 intergovernmental framework agreement to develop an implementation road map and associated projects.

According to Dr Al Abri, hydrogen is a strategic commodity for SOHAR. The port already supports a range of industries and LNG bunkering, with methanation identified as the next step. As biofuel industries develop, their biogenic CO₂ streams can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other green fuels — a pathway closely aligned with SOHAR’s long-term decarbonisation agenda, in which hydrogen remains a central pillar.",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/11/30/thumbs/600x600/3208228.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 12:56:35.910136

The National Automotive and Vehicles Academy (NAVA) has partnered with CEER, Saudi Arabia's first homegrown electric vehicle brand, to introduce an Intermediate Diploma Program in Automotive Manufacturing Technology. This collaboration was formalised during the ""Generation Future Day"" at the 21st General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in Riyadh, under the auspices of Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Bandar Alkhorayef.

This initiative aims to bolster Saudi Arabia's automotive sector by training 300 local trainees over the coming years. The program is designed to enhance national capabilities in electric vehicle manufacturing, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030's objectives to develop competitive national industries. By focusing on industrial localisation and productivity, it seeks to prepare a new generation of Saudi talent ready to lead the sector.

Mohammed Al-Suhaim, Managing Director of NAVA Academy, highlighted that this agreement extends the academy’s commitment to supporting national industrial transformation. He stated: ""At NAVA, we are proud to be an active partner in developing the electric vehicle sector in the Kingdom. Our role goes beyond delivering training programs; it extends to empowering Saudi youth to join high-quality jobs within leading national companies like CEER, which enhances the presence of national talents in modern industries.""

CEER's Chief Executive James DeLuca emphasised their dedication to nurturing local talent as a catalyst for innovation and growth. He remarked: ""As part of our role in igniting the Kingdom’s automotive industry, we believe that developing national talent is a key driver of innovation and growth. As a founding partner of NAVA, we are committed to equipping Saudi technicians with the knowledge and skills needed to lead the future of the automotive sector in the Kingdom.""

This strategic partnership not only supports industrial goals but also contributes significantly towards achieving Saudi Vision 2030. By focusing on training and qualifying local talent, it aims to create a skilled workforce capable of advancing modern industries within Saudi Arabia. The collaboration between NAVA and CEER is expected to play a crucial role in shaping the future of automotive manufacturing technology in the region.

The agreement reflects a broader effort to enhance national productivity by fostering skills development among young Saudis. It underscores a commitment to building a robust foundation for sustainable growth within the automotive sector while ensuring that local talents are well-prepared for emerging opportunities.

This initiative marks an important step towards realising Saudi Arabia's ambitions for its automotive industry. By equipping trainees with essential skills and knowledge, it lays the groundwork for future leaders who will drive innovation and progress within this vital sector.

Och om många skulle efterfråga hållbart flygbränsle, så skulle detta helt enkelt inte räcka till.","Även om alla pågående och planerade projekt för hållbart flygbränsle genomförs, så skulle resultatet bara motsvara 5 procent av allt flygbränsle i världen år 2030. Allt som kallas hållbart är det inte heller: vissa nya bränslen kan ge lika stora klimatutsläpp som fossila bränslen.

Miljöorganisationer har länge ifrågasatt flygbranschens visioner av ett fortsatt men hållbart flygande. Men nu görs detta även på grundval av en ekonomisk analys. Carbon Tracker, som gett ut en rapport om frågan, är en finansiell tankesmedja som hjälper företag och investerare på vägen mot ett mindre fossilberoende.

Slam, avfall och sockerrör

Hållbart flygbränsle, kallat SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), är flytande bränslen tillverkade med olika tekniker och utifrån olika råvaror. Råvarorna kan vara skogs- och jordbruksrester, avloppsslam och avfall, men även energigrödor och matgrödor som sockerrör och majs.

Den stora fördelen med dessa bränslen är att de är så lika vanligt jetbränsle: det är bara att fylla på dem i flygplanet. Den stora nackdelen är att just denna likhet ger bränslena samma utsläpp som jetbränslet när de förbränns. En eventuell klimatvinst måste därför komma från själva råvaran.

Enligt Carbon Trackers rapport finns det en rad hinder för utvecklingen av hållbart flygbränsle. Några handlar om regler och ekonomi. Somliga delar av världen, som EU, har regler som kräver en viss inblandning av SAF, men andra har det inte. Flygbranschen arbetar allmänt sett med en kort tidshorisont, men detta är ett område som kräver långsiktiga satsningar. SAF-projekt är också ofta komplicerade och dyra, vilket kan avskräcka investerare.

Begränsade mängder

Flygresenärer kan idag välja ett tillägg som ger en viss del hållbart flygbränsle i en resa. Men det kostar lite mer, och alla gör det inte – som Mattias Goldmann nyligen påpekade i en fristående krönika i Supermiljöbloggen, så gjordes det inte ens av de svenskar som deltog i COP-mötet i Brasilien. Och om många skulle efterfråga hållbart flygbränsle, så skulle detta helt enkelt inte räcka till.

De mest lätthanterliga rest-råvarorna till sådant bränsle, som överbliven frityrolja, finns nämligen inte alls i tillräckliga mängder. Jord- och skogsbruksrester finns det mer av, men dessa måste först samlas in från stora arealer och transporteras långa sträckor, vilket blir dyrt. Kommunalt avfall består av många olika ämnen och kan behöva försorteras eller förbehandlas. Och att odla råvaror särskilt för att bli bränslen ger stora utsläpp.

Vissa alternativa bränslen, särskilt de som bygger på mat- eller fodergrödor, ger nästan lika stora klimatutsläpp som fossila bränslen eller till och med mer, heter det i rapporten.

Många andra intressenter

Både branschen och politikerna måste också ta hänsyn till andra möjliga användningar av råvarorna. Skogs- och jordbruksrester kan till exempel också användas i värmeverk. Avloppsslam kan bli gödning, och överbliven matolja kan gå till plast- och kosmetikaindustrin. Här behövs en noggrann analys som kan visa var respektive råvara gör bäst klimatnytta.

Enligt Carbon Tracker lär kortare sträckor ganska snart kunna flygas på batterier eller vätebaserade bränsleceller. Då bör de begränsade mängderna av hållbart flygbränsle sparas till längre sträckor. Möjligen kan så kallade elektrobränslen, syntetiskt framställda bränslen med vätgas och koldioxid som bas, komma in i framtiden. Men andra åtgärder måste också till, menar man: en större bränsleeffektivitet, bättre trafikledning och policybeslut som kan minska efterfrågan på flygresor.",https://supermiljobloggen.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/airbus-8607152-1280-600x422.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 12:56:41.349293

According to a KAUST press release, the collaboration comes at a critical time for the aviation industry.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, airlines are required to use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050—targets that remain out of reach with today’s fuel technologies. Meanwhile, global SAF demand is expected to surge from 2 million metric tons in 2025 to 10 million in 2030 and 75 million by 2040, SPA reported.

Professors Mani Sarathy, Thibault Guiberti, Aamir Farooq, and Hong Im will lead the research, which will focus on the chemical properties, reaction pathways, and combustion behavior of the provided fuels. The new data on fuel behavior, emissions characteristics, and performance metrics will build a comprehensive database that will develop models for the creation of future SAF formulations of higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.

“This partnership allows us to combine world-class experimental facilities with advanced artificial intelligence to fundamentally reimagine how sustainable aviation fuels are designed,” said Sarathy. “Using the new data generated, our models will help identify efficient, cleaner, and more scalable fuel formulations that can support the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals.”

The release also highlighted that globally, the aviation industry is increasingly turning to create predictive models for fuel behavior from partial datasets, reducing development cycles from years to months. Beyond fuel design, the project will help bridge critical knowledge gaps that currently slow SAF adoption worldwide, from understanding emissions behavior to assessing how fuels perform across a range of operating environments. By answering these fundamental questions, the partnership will enable industry and regulators to make faster, more informed decisions about future SAF deployment.

Apsco CEO Dr. Azzam Qari stated, “This collaboration with KAUST marks an important milestone for Apsco and for the future of sustainable aviation in the Kingdom. As the global aviation sector moves rapidly toward lower-carbon solutions, investing in local research and national capabilities in SAF is no longer optional; it is strategic. Through this agreement, our role goes beyond supplying fuel for testing; we are helping build the scientific and technical foundation that can enable Saudi-developed SAF technologies in the years ahead.”

Moreover, as Saudi Arabia expands its aviation network and explores domestic SAF production opportunities, the ability to test and validate fuel properties within the Kingdom scientifically becomes increasingly essential. Building local research infrastructure accelerates certification, supports national sustainability targets, and strengthens the country’s position in the future global aviation fuel market. With research facilities already in place, KAUST will provide the scientific foundation needed to accelerate domestic SAF research in the Kingdom, supporting the goals of the Saudi Aviation Strategy to advance low-carbon, next generation energy technologies.

Saudi Arabia achieved a new international milestone by ranking among the top performers in the Global intellectual property perception survey 2025 (WIPO Pulse), issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which surveyed 35,500 participants from 74 countries to assess public awareness of intellectual property and its economic and social impact.

The Kingdom ranked among the highest globally in awareness of the role of intellectual property in supporting the economy, with national awareness of its impact on economic growth and innovation reaching approximately 80%, placing it at the top of this global indicator, according to SPA.

Saudi Arabia also recorded notable growth in youth and women’s awareness of intellectual property rights, making it a leading contributor to raising the average performance of countries in the Asia-Pacific region in this area.

This advanced performance reflects the efforts of the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property to enhance public awareness of and respect for intellectual property rights, as well as to expand national initiatives aimed at improving compliance and reducing violations.

British finance minister Rachel Reeves on Sunday denied she misled the public over official forecasts ahead of this month's budget, saying she had been honest about the need to build up a bigger fiscal buffer.

In a speech on November 4, Reeves appeared to lay the groundwork to break the Labour Party's promise to voters before the 2024 election and raise income tax rates, citing a ""weaker than previously thought"" productivity performance.

In a letter published on Friday, the head of Britain's budget watchdog said it had also provided the government with forecasts showing that its productivity downgrade was offset by increases in real wages and inflation - which Reeves did not mention.

The letter added to questions about the government's communications ahead of Wednesday's budget. November saw big swings in the British government bond market as investors grappled with shifts in tone from the government over the prospect of tax increases.

Its publication prompted the opposition Conservative Party to demand that Reeves resign for misleading the public about the economic situation ahead of her November 26 budget.

According to Reuters, Reeves told the BBC that she intended to stay as finance minister for a long time.

""I have been underestimated all the way through my life,"" Reeves said. ""I'm proud of my budget this week.""

The confidential forecasts provided to Reeves by the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog before her November 4 speech showed she would meet her fiscal rules by a margin of 4.2 billion pounds, not including any budget measures or the reversal of welfare cuts earlier in the year.

On Sunday, Reeves told Sky News that boosting that buffer - which would have been very thin by historical standards - was her main concern, which required her to deliver a tough message to the public.

""The just over 4 billion pounds surplus was not enough,"" Reeves said. ""The headroom would not have been enough, and it would not give the Bank of England space to continue cutting interest rates.""

When the budget was announced on Wednesday, Reeves had more than doubled her headroom against the fiscal rules to 21.7 billion pounds from 9.9 billion pounds in her previous fiscal plan.",https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2025-11/1289703_0.png.webp,N,,2025-11-30 13:57:30.597958

African finance ministers attending the 2025 Africa Investment Forum (AIF) have called for a decisive shift from highlighting potential opportunities to delivering execution-ready, investment-grade projects.

Their message was clear: the continent’s transformation must be driven by private capital, not aid.

Speaking during the Ministerial Dialogue on Accelerating Private Investment Through Conducive Enabling Environments, ministers from Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mauritania, Morocco and Zambia outlined the reforms required to strengthen investor confidence, improve regulatory frameworks and build resilient business environments capable of attracting long-term funding.

Côte d’Ivoire’s Minister of Economic Planning and Development, Nialé Kaba, said Africa’s biggest obstacle remains project readiness.

“Africa’s problem is that opportunities and projects are not mature,” she said. She highlighted Côte d’Ivoire’s progress, including simplified investment codes and single-window systems that have helped lift private investment from 12% of GDP in 2020 to 20% today.

Zambia’s Minister of Finance and National Planning Situmbeko Musokotwane said the country is emerging from its debt crisis, supported by an improved credit rating.

Over the past three years, Zambia has secured nearly $2 billion in public-private partnerships and attracted more than $7 billion in new mining investment. He noted that streamlining project approvals to under 45 days has helped unlock billions in private energy investments.

Musokotwane also spotlighted the privately financed Lobito Corridor, set to become Africa’s first east-west transcontinental rail link, which will connect Zambia and the DRC to Angola’s Atlantic ports.

Morocco’s Economy and Finance Minister Nadia Fettah stressed that investors are no longer looking for potential, but for “ready projects delivered with speed and strong execution capacity.”

She urged African governments to maintain a year-round pipeline of regional projects and argued that pooling resources across borders is essential for large-scale developments in rail, aviation and data infrastructure.

Mauritania’s Minister of Economic Affairs and Development, Abdullah Suleiman Sheikh Sidiya, said Africa is increasingly seen as an investment destination rather than an aid-dependent continent.

“Africa is becoming a sought-after destination—not only for cooperation but increasingly for investment,” he said.

Guinea’s Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Ismael Nabe, underscored the role of strong project preparation in lowering investment risk. He highlighted Guinea’s UK-Export Finance-backed Administrative City as a model of replicable development, inspired by similar projects in Benin.

Nabe described the Africa Investment Forum as a “compass” for guiding co-financing and innovation. Successful initiatives in one country, he said, can be adapted across the region through blended finance tools and partnerships with institutions such as the African Development Bank Group and Middle Eastern sovereign funds.

Segundo o anúncio da Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), as passagens vendidas a partir de 1º de abril de 2026, para voos que partem de Singapura a partir de 1º de outubro de 2026, já terão incorporada a taxa.

Detalhes da medida

A taxa varia conforme destino e classe da viagem. Por exemplo, para voos dentro do Sudeste Asiático, cobrança de SGD 1 (≈ US$ 0,77) em classe econômica; para rotas longas (como às Américas) pode atingir SGD 10,40 ou mais para econômica, e valores maiores para as classes premium.

O valor arrecadado será destinado à compra centralizada de SAF, produzido a partir de óleos residuais ou biomassa, garantindo uma mistura mínima de 1% de SAF a partir de 2026, e avançando para entre 3% e 5% até 2030, conforme disponibilidade e preço do mercado.

Em paralelo, a meta da CAAS prevê que o uso obrigatório de SAF nos voos de partida de Singapura seja implementado já em 2026.

O custo da nova taxa climática para os viajantes partindo de Singapura será modesto – mas simbólico. Ela cria um mecanismo de compartilhamento de despesas entre setor aéreo, passageiros e combustíveis sustentáveis.

Embora a aviação responda por cerca de 1,2% das emissões globais de gases de efeito estufa, seu desafio de descarbonização é elevado: o SAF segue com produção limitada (em torno de 0,3% do combustível em 2023) e custo maior que o querosene fóssil tradicional.

Eventuais desafios e observações

A produção de SAF ainda está restrita: garantir mix mínimo e escala será um gargalo para que a meta de 1% em 2026 seja factível.

A comunicação ao passageiro precisa ser transparente para evitar percepções de “taxa surpresa”.

O impacto competitivo da medida será limitado em termos de preço ao consumidor, mas pode crescer se o mix de SAF precisar ser ampliado significativamente.

Com a nova taxa climática sobre passagens, Singapura buscar atuar junto à aviação de maneira mais verde. A introdução da cobrança a partir de 2026 e a obrigatoriedade do SAF representam um modelo inovador para o setor aéreo. Acompanhar como será implementada e se outras regiões seguirão será crucial para o futuro da aviação sustentável.

The growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has driven innovation in alternative fuel technologies, with synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) emerging as a viable candidate as it offers a reduction in environmental footprint compared to conventional fossil fuels. In this study, the feasibility of biomass-derived SPK was explored, utilizing corn stover as the process feedstock. The designed process integrates key thermochemical processes such as gasification, Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, and hydrocracking, to convert corn stover into SPK. The process was simulated in commercial software Aspen Plus V12, where its material and energy flows were analyzed. Moreover, the Anderson-Schulz Flory distribution model was used to determine the FT product distribution. The simulation results show a 75 % molar conversion of carbon monoxide and a biomass-to-SPK conversion of 6 % was achieved. The sustainability of the developed process was assessed through its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, with syngas cleaning reducing emissions by 30.70 %, resulting in a carbon footprint of 0.58 kg CO2/kg syngas. The remaining CO2 in the FT fuel underwent flashing and adsorption, enabling 63.27 % recovery for reuse in steam and power plants. Subsequently, the total capital investment, including working and fixed capitals, were estimated. The FT-SPK pathway was proven to be costly due to the energy-intensive processes. However, a positive ROI and a payback period within 5 y were achieved. The product selling prices were also ascertained alongside a breakeven analysis to ensure that the manufacturing operation remains economically viable.",https://www.cetjournal.it/public/journals/1/favicon_en_US.png,N,,2025-11-30 13:57:35.769514

The meeting of OPEC+, which pumps half of the world's oil, comes during a fresh US effort to broker a Russia-Ukraine peace deal, which could add to oil supply if sanctions on Russia are eased. Ministers have started a series of online meetings, two sources said.

If the peace deal fails, Russia could see its supply curbed further by sanctions. OPEC+ groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia.

OVER 3 MLN BPD OF OUTPUT CUTS STILL IN PLACE

Brent crude closed on Friday near $63 a barrel, down 15% this year.

OPEC+ has paused oil output hikes for the first quarter of 2026 after releasing some 2.9 million barrels per day into the market since April 2025.

The group still has about 3.24 million bpd of output cuts in place, representing around 3% of global demand, and the Sunday meeting did not alter those.

OPEC said the group had approved a mechanism to assess members' maximum production capacity to be used for setting output quotas from 2027.

Saudi Arabia achieved a new international milestone by ranking among the top performers in the Global intellectual property perception survey 2025 (WIPO Pulse), issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which surveyed 35,500 participants from 74 countries to assess public awareness of intellectual property and its economic and social impact.

The Kingdom ranked among the highest globally in awareness of the role of intellectual property in supporting the economy, with national awareness of its impact on economic growth and innovation reaching approximately 80%, placing it at the top of this global indicator, according to SPA.

Saudi Arabia also recorded notable growth in youth and women’s awareness of intellectual property rights, making it a leading contributor to raising the average performance of countries in the Asia-Pacific region in this area.

This advanced performance reflects the efforts of the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property to enhance public awareness of and respect for intellectual property rights, as well as to expand national initiatives aimed at improving compliance and reducing violations.

These measures have helped strengthen consumer confidence in original products and underscore the societal value of intellectual property rights.

British finance minister Rachel Reeves on Sunday denied she misled the public over official forecasts ahead of this month's budget, saying she had been honest about the need to build up a bigger fiscal buffer.

In a speech on November 4, Reeves appeared to lay the groundwork to break the Labour Party's promise to voters before the 2024 election and raise income tax rates, citing a ""weaker than previously thought"" productivity performance.

In a letter published on Friday, the head of Britain's budget watchdog said it had also provided the government with forecasts showing that its productivity downgrade was offset by increases in real wages and inflation - which Reeves did not mention.

The letter added to questions about the government's communications ahead of Wednesday's budget. November saw big swings in the British government bond market as investors grappled with shifts in tone from the government over the prospect of tax increases.

Its publication prompted the opposition Conservative Party to demand that Reeves resign for misleading the public about the economic situation ahead of her November 26 budget.

According to Reuters, Reeves told the BBC that she intended to stay as finance minister for a long time.

""I have been underestimated all the way through my life,"" Reeves said. ""I'm proud of my budget this week.""

The confidential forecasts provided to Reeves by the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog before her November 4 speech showed she would meet her fiscal rules by a margin of 4.2 billion pounds, not including any budget measures or the reversal of welfare cuts earlier in the year.

On Sunday, Reeves told Sky News that boosting that buffer - which would have been very thin by historical standards - was her main concern, which required her to deliver a tough message to the public.

""The just over 4 billion pounds surplus was not enough,"" Reeves said. ""The headroom would not have been enough, and it would not give the Bank of England space to continue cutting interest rates.""

When the budget was announced on Wednesday, Reeves had more than doubled her headroom against the fiscal rules to 21.7 billion pounds from 9.9 billion pounds in her previous fiscal plan.",https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2025-11/1289466_0.png.webp,N,,2025-11-30 12:57:12.144500

For the first time, he no longer relies on grid electricity, and year-round farming has become possible.
Young people, once determined to flee the village, are beginning to see farming as a viable livelihood rather than a last resort.
He had saved what little he could from long shifts, fully prepared to attempt the clandestine route through Djibouti.
“Now I see young people making something of themselves here, if they can get land.","In a quiet village just outside the bustling town of Batu—where Dutch-owned flower farms dominate the landscape—23-year-old Alemu Baba has chosen a path that many of his peers have long abandoned: he has become a farmer.

While most young men from his community embark on perilous journeys toward Yemen and Libya, gambling their lives for a chance to reach Europe or the Gulf, Alemu returned home. After months working as a construction laborer in Bishoftu for a wage he says “barely covered daily expenses,” he faced a future that, in his words, “looked completely empty.”

“I didn’t see a way forward in the city, and people my age thought farming had no future,” he said. “But now I’m earning enough to support my family, and I’m even planning to expand into bee farming.”

Alemu is part of a growing cohort of young people finding new promise in agriculture, aided by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), a Seoul-based organization working to modernize farming in low-income communities. Over the past two years, the Institute has introduced training and technology to roughly 400 farmers in the region, helping them shift from subsistence production to sustainable, market-oriented agriculture. The effort—funded by the Italian government under a project titled Fostering Food Security to Prevent Conflict and Ensure Stability—includes access to vermicompost, climate-smart tools, and support to help farmers become food secure and profitable.

Among the beneficiaries is Alemu’s father, 50-year-old Baba Morki, a lifelong farmer in AbjataKebele of Adami Tulu JidoKombolchaWoreda. He has witnessed not only his own transformation but that of his neighbors.

Baba has been part of the program from the start, receiving training in entrepreneurship, organic market linkages, and the use of solar-powered irrigation systems—three of which now irrigate a combined 130 hectares in an area once defined by chronic water shortages. For the first time, he no longer relies on grid electricity, and year-round farming has become possible.

“In the past, if the weather failed us, we sold livestock just to survive,” he said. “It kept us poor and without hope.”

Today, Baba says, the change is visible everywhere. Herds are growing. Income is more stable. Young people, once determined to flee the village, are beginning to see farming as a viable livelihood rather than a last resort.

“Before, our work was seasonal and labor intensive. Now we farm continuously, earn more, and finally dream bigger for our children,” he said. “They no longer need to leave home to build a future.”

Both Baba and his son have earned enough from their fields to build modern homes—an unlikely outcome just a few years ago.

GGGI, which began operations in Ethiopia in 2010, aims to help the country build a climate-resilient green economy by 2030 and reduce its reliance on emergency food aid. More than 10 million Ethiopians currently require humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.

The shift toward sustainable agriculture is also reshaping young people’s aspirations beyond the farms themselves. In Batu, 21-year-old waiter and tourism graduate Brook Teshome recalls planning his own journey abroad. He had saved what little he could from long shifts, fully prepared to attempt the clandestine route through Djibouti.

But watching farmers—including his older brother—reap the benefits of the new practices has changed his thinking.

“I used to believe the only way to succeed was to leave,” he said. “Now I see young people making something of themselves here, if they can get land. I’m even considering becoming a farmer instead of working for someone else.”

A similar transformation is underway in Bulbula, where farmer AmanGemeda has expanded his operations with the help of solar irrigation and vermicompost on land that now sits alongside the new Batu–Hawassa freeway.

Aman says that many people are seeing farming in a different light.“My experience is showing others that farming can be different—that we’re not defined by the shortages and hunger that once shaped our lives,” Aman said.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Reporter-Ethiopia.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:56:49.785182

King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) has entered into a material transfer agreement with the Arabian Petroleum Supply Company (Apsco). This partnership will see Apsco supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to KAUST for research on advanced low-emission fuels. The collaboration is timely, as the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to adopt cleaner fuel technologies.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, airlines must use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, which will rise to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. Current fuel technologies are insufficient to meet these targets. Global demand for SAF is projected to grow significantly, from 2 million metric tons in 2025 to 10 million in 2030 and reaching 75 million by 2040.

The research at KAUST will be led by Professors Mani Sarathy, Thibault Guiberti, Aamir Farooq, and Hong Im. Their work will concentrate on understanding the chemical properties, reaction pathways, and combustion behavior of the supplied fuels. This research aims to develop a comprehensive database that will aid in creating future SAF formulations with higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.

""This partnership allows us to combine world-class experimental facilities with advanced artificial intelligence to fundamentally reimagine how sustainable aviation fuels are designed,"" said Sarathy. ""Using the new data generated, our models will help identify efficient, cleaner, and more scalable fuel formulations that can support the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals.""

The aviation industry worldwide is increasingly using predictive models for fuel behavior based on partial datasets. This approach reduces development cycles from years to months. The project aims not only at designing better fuels but also at addressing knowledge gaps that hinder SAF adoption globally. By understanding emissions behavior and assessing performance across various environments, the partnership seeks to enable faster decision-making regarding SAF deployment.

Apsco CEO Dr. Azzam Qari remarked, ""This collaboration with KAUST marks an important milestone for Apsco and for the future of sustainable aviation in the Kingdom. As the global aviation sector moves rapidly toward lower-carbon solutions, investing in local research and national capabilities in SAF is no longer optional; it is strategic.""

Strategic Importance for Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia's expanding aviation network and exploration of domestic SAF production opportunities make scientific testing of fuel properties within the Kingdom increasingly vital. Developing local research infrastructure accelerates certification processes, supports national sustainability goals, and strengthens Saudi Arabia's position in the future global aviation fuel market.

KAUST's existing research facilities provide a solid foundation for advancing domestic SAF research in line with the Saudi Aviation Strategy's objectives of promoting low-carbon energy technologies. This initiative is crucial as Saudi Arabia aims to enhance its role in sustainable aviation fuel development globally.

Airlines worked through the night after global regulators told them to remedy the problem before resuming flights.

Airlines that said they had completed or nearly finished all their software updates on Saturday included American Airlines, United Airlines, Air India, Delta Air Lines, Hungary’s Wizz Air, Mexico's Volaris, Air Arabia, Saudi Arabia's Flyadeal, and Taiwan's carriers. Many reported no impact on operations.

The overnight effort by airlines appeared to help head off the worst-case scenario and capped the number of flight delays in Asia and Europe. In the United States, which will face high demand after the Thanksgiving holiday period, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that impacted U.S. carriers ""have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work.""

He posted on X that travellers ""SHOULD NOT expect any major disruptions,"" although one U.S. airline, JetBlue, later said it cancelled dozens of flights that had been scheduled for Sunday.

Asia-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie said the update was ""not as chaotic as some people might think,"" although ""it does create some short-term headaches for operations.""

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised to airlines and passengers after the surprise recall of 6,000 planes, or more than half of the global A320-family fleet, which recently overtook the Boeing 737 as the industry's most-delivered model.

""I want to sincerely apologise to our airline customers and passengers who are impacted now,"" Faury posted on LinkedIn.

Friday's alert followed an unintended loss of altitude on an October 30 JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, which injured 10 passengers, according to France's BEA accident agency, which is probing the incident.

AIRBUS RECALL LUCKY TIMING FOR SOME AIRLINES

The alert landed at a time of day when many European airlines and Asian airlines are winding down their schedules, leaving time for repairs. In the United States, however, it came during the day ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel weekend.

U.S. carrier JetBlue said it cancelled about 70 flights that were scheduled for Sunday, with more cancellations possible. JetBlue expects to finish software updates for 120 planes by Sunday morning, but said fixes for about 30 aircraft would still be ""in progress"" at that point.

About 140 jets in the company's fleet of A320, A321 and A220 aircraft did not need the fix, the company said.

American Airlines, the world's largest A320 operator, said 209 of its 480 jets needed the fix, below initial estimates, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday. United Airlines told Reuters on Saturday that all its aircraft had been updated.

AirAsia, one of the world's largest A320 customers, said it aimed to complete fixes in 48 hours. India's aviation regulator said on Saturday that carriers IndiGo INGL.NS and Air India were expected to complete the process on Saturday. ANA Holdings 9202.T cancelled 95 flights on Saturday, affecting 13,500 travellers.

Taiwan's low-cost airline Tigerair said eight flights would be delayed on Sunday due to the software issue.

Airlines must revert to a previous version of software in a computer that helps determine the nose angle of the affected jets and in some cases must also change the hardware itself, mainly on older planes in service. The fix must be completed before the planes can fly again with passengers, a process needing two to three hours per jet.

Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320 model. Those include some of the largest and busiest low-cost carriers.

Tracker data from Cirium and FlightAware showed most global airports operating with good-to-moderate levels of delays.

By Saturday, Airbus was telling airlines that repairs to some of the A320 jets affected may be less burdensome than first thought, industry sources said, with fewer than the original estimate of 1,000 needing the time-consuming hardware changes.

There were also unresolved questions about the impact of solar flare radiation blamed for the JetBlue incident, which is being treated by French investigators as an ""incident,"" the lowest of three categories of potential safety emergency.

""Any operational challenges that come at short notice and affecting a large part of your operation is tough to deal with,"" said UK-based aviation consultant John Strickland.

Recent Developments In Aviation Fuel Market Trends, Segmentation & Forecast 2034

Recent activity in the aviation fuel sector has been shaped strongly by new long-term supply agreements and strategic fuel-trade partnerships. One of the most significant developments came when Unipec, the trading arm of Sinopec, finalized a multi-year agreement to supply Lufthansa with around 60,000 metric tons of jet fuel per year, reinforcing stable jet-fuel availability across key airports in Germany and Belgium. This deal also reflects an expansion of Unipec’s broader aviation-fuel footprint, as the company has been supplying millions of tons of jet fuel annually across Europe and North Africa. At the same time, major airlines such as KLM have deepened cooperation with fuel traders to secure consistent access to both conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), highlighting the continued need for diversified supply channels.

Investments in sustainable aviation fuel production have accelerated sharply, with multiple energy companies and aircraft manufacturers backing large-scale commercial SAF projects. One of the largest commitments came from Ecopetrol, Colombia’s national oil company, which approved US $500-700 million for constructing a new SAF production plant integrated into its Barrancabermeja refinery. The plant is being designed to produce roughly 6,000 barrels per day once operational — a milestone that would position Colombia as a key regional supplier. Parallel to this, Airbus expanded its role beyond aircraft manufacturing by co-founding a dedicated financing alliance for SAF projects and investing directly in LanzaJet to scale its Alcohol-to-Jet production pathway. These investments illustrate how the aviation ecosystem is moving from pilot projects to industrial-scale SAF capacity backed by major energy and aerospace stakeholders.

Regulatory and operational developments have also transformed the aviation fuel landscape across major regions. In the European Union, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation entered key implementation phases in 2025, with mandated SAF blending requirements beginning at 2% for all EU airports and preparing for higher obligations in the coming years. This regulatory pressure has already driven airports and fuel suppliers to adjust logistics, certification, and blending infrastructure. Meanwhile, in India, Boeing partnered with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited to advance a domestic SAF ecosystem, working on certification pathways, feedstock optimization, and nationwide supply-chain planning. Boeing additionally highlighted India’s potential to produce up to 8-10 million metric tons of SAF annually due to its agricultural-residue base, indicating that new producer nations are emerging beyond the traditional jet-fuel hubs. Collectively, these developments show a global shift in how aviation fuel is produced, regulated, and supplied — with SAF integration now embedded in national strategies, airline procurement models, and manufacturer-led innovation programs.

Com cerca de 115 milhões de habitantes, as Filipinas figuram entre os maiores mercados consumidores do Sudeste Asiático e importaram quase US$ 1,5 bilhão em produtos agropecuários do Brasil entre janeiro e outubro de 2025.

Na Guatemala, o Brasil obteve autorização fitossanitária para exportar arroz beneficiado (sem casca). O país centro-americano, com população de cerca de 18 milhões de pessoas, importou mais de US$ 192 milhões em produtos do agronegócio brasileiro no mesmo período de 2025, com os cereais entre os principais itens adquiridos.

A Nicarágua também ampliou o acesso de produtos brasileiros ao aprovar a importação de sementes de milheto, crotalária e nabo, insumos estratégicos para a agricultura tropical. Essas sementes contribuem para o aumento da produtividade, a melhoria do solo e a redução da dependência de fertilizantes minerais. Entre janeiro e outubro de 2025, a Nicarágua importou aproximadamente US$ 55 milhões em produtos agropecuários do Brasil.

Com os novos anúncios, o agronegócio brasileiro alcança 496 aberturas de mercado desde o início de 2023, reforçando a estratégia de diversificação de destinos e de inclusão de produtos de maior valor agregado no comércio internacional.

Fluor Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Fluor shareholder, you need to trust in the company’s ability to secure and deliver large-scale infrastructure and industrial projects, while actively managing project risks and maintaining healthy cash flow. The recently announced State Highway 6 expansion in Texas underscores the strength of Fluor’s backlog, but it does not directly alter the most important short-term catalyst, cash generation from ongoing project execution, or diminish the biggest risk, which remains project delays and cost overruns that can impact margins and liquidity.

Among recent announcements, Fluor’s contract win for Project Speedbird, focusing on sustainable aviation fuel production in England, stands out as the most relevant to the SH-6 news since both demonstrate momentum in capturing diverse, high-value contracts. These awards reinforce the catalyst of growing Fluor’s backlog in critical infrastructure and industrial markets, although the timing and profitability of project delivery stay central to near-term investor focus.

However, with Fluor’s ongoing challenges around project delays and cost controls, investors should also be aware that...

Fluor's outlook anticipates $19.6 billion in revenue and $511.6 million in earnings by 2028. This scenario assumes a yearly revenue growth rate of 6.2% alongside a significant decrease in earnings of $3.6 billion from the current $4.1 billion.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Eight fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from US$44.65 to US$65.50 per share. While community opinions vary widely, keep an eye on the risk of project delays and rising costs, which could weigh on short-term profitability and are key factors for anyone tracking Fluor’s performance.

The story of the United States corn ethanol industry is a story about a sector that grew rapidly under a very specific set of policy, technology and market conditions. It filled a gap when gasoline demand was rising, when climate policy focused on incremental change, and when EVs were still a niche. It became a major part of the Midwestern political economy. It shaped land use patterns. It supported thousands of farmers and dozens of rural communities built around steady demand for transport fuel. That world is shifting and the signals point toward a twenty year horizon that looks very different from the previous twenty, with very significant implications for the Midwest’s economies and likely politics.

Corn ethanol grew from a small program focused on oxygenates into a national industry producing over 16 billion gallons annually, about 48 million metric tons. The Renewable Fuel Standard created guaranteed demand by requiring refiners to blend increasing amounts of ethanol into gasoline. Direct subsidies through the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit helped expand capacity. By the late 2000s the industry had become large enough to hold political weight in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Nebraska. Ethanol plants became anchor employers. Farmers gained a new buyer that consumed nearly 40% of the national corn crop. The system became predictable and self reinforcing. All gasoline sold in the country now has about 10% ethanol added, with some higher blends available in some places. Once direct subsidies expired, the mandate and a large fleet of internal combustion vehicles kept the industry stable. That stability is now being tested by structural changes in transportation and energy.

The first challenge appears in the gasoline market itself. EIA data from 2015 through 2019 shows finished motor gasoline stabilizing at roughly 140 billion gallons a year. The post pandemic rebound never reached that range again. By 2024 gasoline demand had slipped below pre pandemic levels even though the population was larger than in 2019. The shift is not a statistical quirk. Efficiency gains, hybrid penetration and improved powertrain design are pushing gasoline demand down. Even modest EV adoption affects fuel consumption more than most people expect because each EV replaces an entire household’s gasoline demand, not a small slice of it. Hybrid and work from home models that are common after COVID also inhibit demand. Gasoline peaks are rarely jagged events. They plateau and then begin slow but durable declines. Ethanol demand sits inside that shrinking pool. Rising blend rates cannot compensate if the base declines year after year.

E15, a blend of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, creates a small lift for producers, but there is no serious national move toward E30 or higher mid level blends. The political energy behind E15 has come from arguments about supply expansion and consumer cost, not carbon intensity or long term strategy. E30 requires different infrastructure and testing. It requires automakers to warrant engines for higher blends. It requires retail investments that stations are reluctant to make without guarantees. None of that is materializing. States like California and New York now permit E15, but these decisions were framed as cost and supply flexibilities rather than a new energy direction. Ethanol sits in these states as an accepted part of the gasoline era, not a central element of long term climate policy. In markets that matter most for future trends the direction is clear. The strategic focus is electrification.

California and New York are often treated as outliers in national conversations. They are not outliers. They are lead indicators in vehicle transition. California’s advanced clean cars policy will push new car sales toward 100% zero emission by 2035. New York has adopted the same path. These are affluent states with large populations and lots of cars. Higher ethanol blends in these states amount to small adjustments on the margins of a system that is already pivoting toward EVs. As EV shares rise in coastal states, gasoline consumption falls in absolute terms. Even if some drivers hold on to older vehicles for longer, the weight of new sales changes the slope of long term demand. These states represent enough vehicles that their choices influence national averages. Ethanol fits into their near term fuel mix, but it is not shaping their long term direction.

Export markets, something that grew in recent years, see similar headwinds. In the past few years US ethanol exporters have enjoyed strong demand from Canada, the UK and parts of Southeast Asia. These markets are shifting. Canada is tightening its clean fuel regulations and increasing its EV penetration. The UK and EU have sustainability criteria that limit long term expansion of food based biofuels. India is building a domestic ethanol industry using sugarcane and grain feedstocks. Brazil is expanding corn ethanol capacity of its own. OECD and FAO analyses project that most future global ethanol growth will be met domestically rather than through imports. They also project that total global ethanol trade will remain only a small fraction of production. Export contraction is more likely than export growth, and the rest of the world is moving faster to EVs and now, with Trump’s tariffs, moving away from dependency on US imports.

The ethanol to jet pathway appeared to be the most promising new outlet, but it depends heavily on regulatory certainty. Alcohol to jet fuel can meet ASTM standards and blend seamlessly with petroleum jet. Airlines are interested in any supply that can help them meet long term climate pledges. The economics are fragile. Production costs remain higher than petroleum jet. Carbon intensity scoring determines eligibility for tax credits, and it requires both farming changes and capture and sequestration of CO2 from fermenters to achieve sufficiently low intensity. Those credits require stable policy. The removal of the sustainable aviation fuel bonus credit at the end of 2025 under Trump omnibus bill shifted the economics significantly. The reduction from a potential $1.75 a gallon credit to a $1.00 credit cut the margin for most proposed projects. Developers now face a shorter policy horizon, more uncertainty and capital markets that are increasingly sensitive to policy volatility. Some high profile projects have already stalled or been rescoped. Ethanol to jet remains a possible growth area but it is not a firm foundation for the entire industry.

In other work on aviation I have projected that global passenger and cargo demand will not keep rising on historic 4% annual curves, but will flatten as China’s growth slows, remote work persists and population peaks. In that scenario fossil kerosene peaks around 2030 below 2019 levels and then declines over the rest of the century as batteries and biofuels take over most of the energy demand for flights. Electric flight will be cheaper, 1,000 km hybrid electric turboprop ranges mostly on batteries viable, while international flights with sustainable aviation fuels will be more expensive. While the USA has the highest passenger kilometers per resident the world by a hefty margin, 60% to 70% are in the range to be electrified, and ticket price differential will favor those flights with more traffic. Globally, high speed rail is removing passengers from airplane seats, and global population growth is already slowing, with the flight heavy west seeing aging demographics.

All of these factors will reduce the demand for liquid fuels for aviation. Biokerosenes including ethanol to jet bridge the remaining long haul missions across existing airframes. The result is a long tail of liquid fuel use concentrated almost entirely in intercontinental aviation by 2100, with short haul and regional services fully electrified and many small airports revived as electric regional mobility hubs.

I have also argued that personal transportation in the United States is uniquely hard to decarbonize compared to Europe or China because of structural choices made after World War II. Cheap oil, racialized planning and deliberate dispersion policies pushed people into very low density suburbs and weakened passenger rail so thoroughly that Americans now rely on very large cars and frequent domestic flights for basic mobility. Cars and light trucks account for well over half of US transport emissions and road vehicles of all sizes contribute more than 80% of the sector total, yet the country still lags peers on EV adoption and transit investment.

That combination of extreme sprawl, large vehicles, weak rail and entrenched highway infrastructure means the United States has to push harder on both electrification and urban form just to get to the starting line that other rich countries are already standing on. It also means that in the United States, liquid fuels for cars and aviation stay in the picture longer than they would in a denser, rail oriented system, which is one more reason to expect corn ethanol and other biofuels to face a long, messy transition instead of a clean break. But it doesn’t mean that electrification won’t eat internal combustion fuel demand for lunch, it just means it will be a more leisurely meal.

Marine fuels are sometimes presented as a major opportunity, but here too the outlook is not for growth and ethanol is not the molecule of choice. Starting with demand, 40% of all shipping tonnage is of fossil fuels, and that is in structural decline. Another 15% is raw iron ore, usually steaming to the same ports coal is headed to. That too is in structural decline with renewable electricity based derusting of iron ore to make iron much more viable nearer to coal mines, increasing the value while reducing the tonnage of exports. Global steel demand is also in decline, as China has finished the massive infrastructure boom and is entering a lower maintenance cycle as the developed world did in the second half of the 20th Century. Other countries have access to cheap software and mass timber that significantly reduces steel demand in new buildings, and aren’t going to be building the massive factors, heavy industry and ports that China did. Structurally, 55% of total shipping tonnage is in decline.

Further, electrification is coming for shipping as well. 700 unit container ships with swappable containerized batteries are servicing 1,000 km routes on the Yangtze in China. 2,100 passenger fully electric ferries are on order and being tested in the water already. Hybridization of ocean going ships is almost inevitable as the economics of dirt cheap batteries, clean and inexpensive electrons, and much more costly biofuels radically alter current assumptions. The combination results in much less shipping fuel in the future than today. It’s not a growth market looking in desperation for ethanol.

US corn ethanol rhetoric points to large shipping companies experimenting with multi fuel blends that include ethanol. The global shipping sector will use enormous amounts of fuel even with declines and small blend shares imply large potential ethanol volumes. The caveat is that shipping is already moving toward biomethanol and electrification. Those energy carriers offer better energy density or simpler handling and are aligned with long term zero carbon strategies. Trials that include ethanol are exploratory. There is no regulatory anchor for ethanol in shipping comparable to the mandates in road transport in the early 2000s. There is also a competitive disadvantage. Sugarcane ethanol from more tropical regions has a lower carbon intensity than US corn ethanol and fits more comfortably within international carbon accounting. Marine fuels might absorb some gallons, but they do not plausibly absorb the multi billion gallon gap created by declining road fuel use.

Chemical feedstocks are a real but limited opportunity. Ethanol can serve as a platform for ethylene, acetic acid and other industrial chemicals. Some companies in Brazil already operate this way at commercial scale. These markets value carbon intensity, traceability and stable supply. They do not require the volumes that road transport does. Even optimistic scenarios for ethanol based chemicals only absorb one or two billion gallons. The gap between that figure and current fuel use is too large to bridge.

A useful way to think about the next twenty years is through scenario analysis. In a reference case based on current federal policy and modest EV adoption, ethanol production holds roughly flat. Blend rates climb slightly. Exports remain steady. SAF adds a small amount of extra demand. The industry looks a lot like today with slightly more pressure at the margins. In a moderate case, EV adoption accelerates in line with global patterns. Gasoline demand falls 30% to 40%. Blend rates rise toward E15 but go no further. Exports plateau. SAF struggles with policy instability. Ethanol production falls 20% to 35%. In a high transition case, EVs scale quickly across the United States, coastal states accelerate their mandates and global automotive supply chains deliver lower cost EVs faster than expected. Export markets build domestic production. SAF policy remains unstable. Ethanol production falls on the order of 40% to 50%. None of these numbers are precise forecasts, but they describe reasonable envelopes for planning.

The regional economic effects of even a moderate contraction will be significant. Ethanol plants anchor many rural communities. They form part of the basis that supports grain handlers, trucking firms and equipment dealers. A reduction in ethanol demand reduces local corn prices and affects land values. Farmers will shift into other crops or adjust rotations but that takes time. Some ethanol plants will diversify into higher value co products like protein concentrates or biochemicals. Others will close or consolidate. The transition will not be even across the Midwest. Plants with access to low carbon electricity, carbon capture pathways or diversified product streams will adapt more readily. Plants with high operating costs or limited access to low carbon inputs will struggle.

Most of the communities built around corn-ethanol plants are not affluent today. They are generally stable, middle-income rural towns whose economies depend on agriculture, a few industrial anchors and a small service base. Ethanol plants raise local incomes relative to purely farming counties because they add processing jobs, support a network of trucking, maintenance and engineering firms and strengthen corn prices within a 30 to 60 mile radius. That effect improves household earnings and local tax revenue, but it does not turn these areas into high-income regions. Many of the counties with the heaviest ethanol concentration still have below-average median household incomes compared to national figures, lower population growth and limited economic diversification. Ethanol plants provide stability rather than affluence, which is why the prospect of long-term demand decline matters so much. If the primary industrial buyer in an already thin local economy begins to shrink, the communities around it have little buffer and fewer alternative employers to absorb the shift. The combination has the potential to mean a further rural hollowing out and depopulation.

There is a credible, long-run possibility that declining corn ethanol demand could open the door to large scale rewilding in parts of the Midwest, but it would occur unevenly without strong federal and state guidance, and only under certain economic conditions. A significant share of the land used for continuous corn today is not prime cropland. Much of it sits on marginal soils, areas prone to erosion, floodplains, former prairie that was brought under cultivation during the ethanol boom, or regions where profitability depends on high fertilizer inputs and steady local buyers. When an ethanol plant closes or reduces intake by half, the weakest ground becomes hard to justify financially. Farmers faced with lower local corn prices, higher transport costs to reach distant markets, and lower returns per acre often transition marginal parcels first. That transition can take the form of reduced tillage, grassland restoration, enrollment in conservation programs or leasing land to wildlife agencies or private conservation groups. Federal conservation programs already have waiting lists in many states, and a sustained decline in corn demand would increase interest in enrolling acres that no longer generate reliable profits.

Rewilding does not mean a full return to tallgrass prairie across entire counties. It usually begins with patches of land taken out of annual row cropping and converted to mixed grasses, wetlands or riparian buffers. Over time, these areas provide habitat, improve water quality and reduce nutrient runoff. In regions with chronic flood risks or groundwater stress, reverting portions of corn acreage to natural cover can also ease public infrastructure costs. Some landowners will see value in carbon markets if those markets become more credible. Others will partner with conservation organizations that combine ecological restoration with recreational or grazing leases. There will still be strong agricultural production on the best land, but the overall mosaic shifts. A sustained 40% to 50% decline in ethanol demand over twenty years would gradually release millions of acres from strict commodity production pressure, and a portion of those acres would flow into rewilding because it becomes the most rational economic choice for land that cannot compete well in a post ethanol landscape.

There are viable paths forward for many producers. Some will invest in carbon capture to lower their fuel’s measured carbon intensity. Some will pursue biorefinery strategies that treat ethanol as one output in a broader product mix. Others will explore partnerships in chemicals, specialty proteins or green ammonia. The industry that emerges will be leaner and more varied than the one that grew under the Renewable Fuel Standard. The skill sets, infrastructure and experience inside these companies are valuable in new energy and materials markets. The question is how fast they can pivot.

The large scale conditions that supported corn ethanol for two decades are changing. The global automotive industry is electrifying. Regulatory frameworks in major importing countries are turning toward zero emission vehicles and low carbon fuels with strict sustainability criteria. Domestic gasoline demand is softening in ways that will continue and likely accelerate. The policy foundation for ethanol to jet remains unstable. These factors add up to a long term environment where a contraction of the US corn ethanol sector is more plausible than continued growth. A decline of 20% to 50% is a reasonable planning range depending on how quickly EVs scale and how successfully producers diversify. The next twenty years will test the industry’s ability to adapt to a world where road fuels are no longer the primary engine of energy demand.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-29-2025-10_29_06-AM-800x445.png,N,,2025-11-29 19:56:11.037126

The European Union has committed a €3 billion investment package to accelerate the commercial scale-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This public capital directly addresses the high initial cost and infrastructure gap, de-risking the Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for new production facilities, especially those using the Power-to-Liquid (e-fuels) pathway. This intervention secures the long-term supply chain for aviation, with the most important data point being that the funding is explicitly designed to help meet the binding 70% SAF blending mandate by 2050.

Context

The core question for the aviation and energy sectors has been whether the industry can meet its aggressive fuel mandates without a massive public capital infusion to bridge the cost and production gap. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation created a clear demand signal, but the high capital expenditure for new plants and the cost premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel had stalled the necessary private investment to scale production. Informed professionals were waiting for a mechanism to convert policy risk into commercial certainty.

Analysis

This development is a direct policy-to-market intervention. The cause is the binding ReFuelEU mandate, which created a future demand that the current supply chain cannot meet. The effect is the €3 billion funding, which acts as the necessary mechanism to build that supply.

Manufacturers are now expected to accelerate Final Investment Decisions on new SAF plants, particularly those focused on advanced biofuels and synthetic e-fuels. Think of this funding like a down payment on a new factory, immediately improving the risk-return profile for private investors.

Outlook

This development implies a major acceleration in the industrial build-out of synthetic fuel capacity. The simple thing to watch for next is the announcement of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for large-scale SAF production facilities, especially those focused on the synthetic e-fuel pathway. A sustained flow of FIDs and new, long-term offtake agreements between airlines and SAF producers will confirm that the public capital has successfully de-risked the market and that the industrial transition is now in motion.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sustainable-Urban-Mobility-Public-Transit-Decarbonization-Green-Infrastructure-Ecological-Transition-Hydrological-Cycle.jpeg,N,,2025-11-30 04:56:31.328628

De Boeing 747-200, registratie N787RR, vliegt al sinds 2005 bij Rolls Royce. Het iconische toestel diende als testvliegtuig voor motoren. Zo konden er verschillende nieuwe testmotoren in het vliegtuig worden geïnstalleerd, en daarmee werden prestatiegegevens verzameld. Eén testvlucht leverde gemiddeld zo’n twintig gigabite aan data op. Daarnaast werd het vliegende testplatform ingezet om allerlei nieuwe technologische snufjes te testen.

In 2021 werd er een bijzondere vlucht uitgevoerd met een Trent 1000-motor. Deze motor draaide volledig op duurzame brandstof (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Uit data van deze testvlucht bleek dat de motor niet anders fungeerde dan de andere drie RB211-motoren die onder de Boeing 747 hingen. Het was de opmaat naar de eerste transatlantische vlucht van Virgin Atlantic die volledig op duurzame brandstof vloog. De Dreamliner waagde de oversteek van Londen Heathrow naar New York JFK met Trent 1000-motoren. Daarmee werd Rolls Royce de eerste fabrikant van wie alle motoren compatibel zijn met honderd procent SAF.

De Queen of the Skies van Rolls Royce vloog haar laatste testvlucht in juli 2025. Deze testvlucht ondersteunde de Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) motordemonstrator. Hiermee werd een belangrijke bijdrage geleverd aan de ontwikkeling van meer efficiënte en duurzame motoren.
