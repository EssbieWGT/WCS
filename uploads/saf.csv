Corteva Inc. and bp have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to form a joint venture (JV) focused on producing biofuel feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The JV plans to scale production to deliver one million metric tons per year of SAF feedstocks by the mid-2030s.

Corteva will contract with farmers in North America, South America, and Europe to grow proprietary mustard seed, sunflower, and canola feedstocks suited for SAF production.

The collaboration aligns with global SAF mandates, such as the EU requirement for 20% SAF content in aviation fuel by 2035, rising to 70% by 2050.

Definitive agreements are expected to be finalized in 2025, with operations targeted to begin later that year.

Addressing Growing Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Corteva and bp announced their shared intent to form a joint venture aimed at producing biofuel feedstocks to meet increasing global demand for SAF. With aviation sector decarbonization becoming a focus of government mandates and incentives, the proposed JV aims to contribute to achieving these sustainability goals.

The EU, for example, has mandated a minimum of 20% SAF content in aviation fuel by 2035, with the target rising to 70% by 2050. Similar incentives are emerging globally, creating opportunities for scaling SAF feedstock production.

Leveraging Agricultural and Energy Expertise

Under the collaboration, Corteva plans to work with farmers across the Americas and Europe to grow proprietary crops such as mustard seed, sunflower, and canola. These crops are designed to meet sustainability criteria under EU RED III standards and qualify for U.S. low-carbon intensity policy incentives. The initiative also introduces new cropping systems to generate revenue for farmers while supporting sustainable practices.

Brook Cunningham, Corteva’s Chief Strategy Officer, commented: “This partnership shows that agriculture can play a vital role in addressing global decarbonization goals. By leveraging Corteva’s technology, scale, and grower relationships, we look forward to supporting the European airline industry while offering farmers new income streams.”

bp will contribute its expertise in refining and trading to optimize the supply chain for SAF production.

Emma Delaney, bp’s executive vice president for customers & products, stated: “We see significant potential in partnering with Corteva. Together, we are positioned to create value by combining Corteva’s agricultural innovations with bp’s refining capabilities.”

Path to Commercialization

The JV envisions progressively scaling up feedstock production, with the goal of delivering one million metric tons annually of biofuel feedstocks by the mid-2030s. This feedstock will support SAF production at bp’s facilities, with plans to finalize agreements by 2025 and begin operations later that year.

By Amber Bryan

In 2023, each paying passenger flying on planes around the world emitted 84.4 grams of CO₂ per kilometre. A study, however, co-led by the University of Oxford, has found three ways of mitigating such emissions and potentially reducing them by up to 75 per cent. These include operating only the most fuel-efficient aircraft, removing premium-class seating to carry more passengers, and raising passenger loads to 95 per cent. In addition, the study shows that an immediate reduction of 11 per cent could be achieved simply by using the most efficient aircraft.

The Boeing 787-9, used for long-haul flights, and the Airbus A321neo, used for short and medium-haul flights, are the most carbon-effective planes. Replacing all aircraft with these would result in fuel savings of 25–28 per cent, according to the study.

Business and first-class seating are five times more CO2-intensive than economy class. By increasing passenger capacity to maximum for the most efficient aircraft, emissions would further reduce by 22-57 per cent. The average aircraft passenger occupancy in 2023 was 79 per cent. By increasing this to 95 per cent, emissions would reduce by 16 per cent.

The study was published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment and involved analysing more than 27 million commercial flights in 2023, covering 26,000 city pairs and nearly 3.5 billion passengers. Some routes were found to be producing nearly 900 grams of CO2 per kilometre for each passenger – which is almost 30 times higher than the most efficient (around 30 grams of CO₂ per kilometre).

The study was based on data from Airline Data, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and the International Air Transport Association. The regions with the most inefficient flights were Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, Central Asia, and North America. However, the most effective regions were Brazil, India and Southeast Asia.

The researchers suggest efficiency improvements could be promoted using marketing tools, similar to those used for household appliances and vehicles. For example, emissions ratings, adjusted landing fees and carbon intensity caps.

Lead author and Professor at Linnaeus University, Stefan Gössling, said: ‘Efficiency-based policies have a great potential to curb aviation emissions, and can be in airlines’ own economic interest. But the reality is that many airlines continue to fly with old aircraft, low passenger occupancies, and growing proportions of premium-class seating.’

Co-author and Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Dr Milan Klöwer said: ‘While economically and practically unfeasible to replace all older aircraft short term, this analysis shows the potential more efficient aircraft have in comparison to other efficiency gains. Realistically, this would be a long-term transition – one that could be promoted by policies that reward efficiency, so that the most efficient aircraft are favoured whenever replacement decisions are made.’

How to choose low-carbon flights

While airlines themselves may not make the changes needed to reduce global aviation emissions, there are some things that passengers can be conscious of to reduce their own carbon footprint when flying.

Different models of aircraft determine engine type and fuel efficiency. Age is also a factor, as newer models have better fuel economy. The carbon footprint of a flight is worked out per person. This means the more people on a flight, the more people share that flight’s total carbon footprint.

The route taken can also make a difference. Direct flights rather than layovers reduce carbon emissions, as take-off and landing use much more fuel than cruising at altitude – as well as the fact that the route will take longer if it stops off. Also, ensuring the airline you’re flying with is using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is another way to choose a low-carbon flight.

Greenland holds vast but hard-to-access mineral and fossil-fuel riches, driving renewed US interest and Donald Trump’s threats to annex the Danish territory, which Denmark warns could spell the end of the NATO alliance. The island, roughly the size of the Democratic Republic of Congo, contains “critical” and rare-earth minerals needed for the national security of certain countries and the energy transition, with global demand for such resources expected to quadruple by 2040.

Yet only about 20% of Greenland is ice‑free. There are no intercity roads, and for every 100 mineral exploration projects, only one may become a mine, making development slow, risky, and capital‑intensive. Past mines left heavy metal pollution still detectable 50 years later, fueling public skepticism.

As the sector grapples with contributing 2.5% of global CO2 emissions—with 80% originating from long-haul flights—the search for viable alternatives to conventional jet fuel has intensified.

Alternative Aviation Technology Challenges

The promise of electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft has captured headlines and imagination, yet both technologies face fundamental barriers that limit their near-term viability for commercial aviation. Electric aircraft confront the harsh reality of battery energy density constraints. Current lithium-ion technology achieves approximately 200 to 250 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), with expectations to plateau at around 300 Wh/kg due to fundamental chemistry limitations, compared to 12,000 Wh/kg for jet fuel. However, studies have identified that electric aviation would require 400 Wh/kg for general aviation applications and 750 Wh/kg for commercial regional air service, representing a two- to three-fold improvement that remains beyond current capabilities. While electric aircraft may serve a role on short-haul regional routes, their energy density limitations constrain their applicability to the majority of commercial aviation.

The infrastructure implications are equally daunting. Electric aviation would necessitate comprehensive airport charging systems, overhauls of electrical grid capacity, and aircraft redesign. To date, not a single commercial electric aircraft deployment has occurred in scheduled passenger service, underscoring the technological and economic hurdles that remain.

Hydrogen propulsion presents similar challenges. While hydrogen offers impressive energy density by weight, its storage requirements create significant design constraints. Liquid hydrogen must be maintained at -253 degrees Celsius, requiring specialized cryogenic storage systems that fundamentally alter aircraft architecture. The safety considerations, airport infrastructure modifications and lengthy recertification processes have proven so challenging that even Airbus recently scaled back its hydrogen aircraft program timeline.

These realities underscore that electric and hydrogen technologies will require significant technological breakthroughs before their full potential can be realized, highlighting the aviation industry’s need for immediate solutions to achieve its decarbonization goals.

SAF: The Drop-In Solution

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers a direct path to decarbonization by working within existing systems rather than requiring wholesale transformation. Produced from renewable feedstocks—including alcohols, used cooking oil, animal fats, municipal solid waste, agricultural residues and even captured CO2—SAF can blend with conventional jet fuel without modifying aircraft engines or airport infrastructure.

This compatibility is critical. Airlines operate on thin margins, and aircraft lifecycles span decades. A fuel that integrates with existing fleets enables immediate deployment without the massive capital investments required by alternative technologies.

The market has responded. Global SAF production is projected to reach 6.1 billion to 8.2 billion gallons annually by 2030, according to RMI’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Outlook, up from about 350 million gallons in 2024—underscoring both industry commitment and scalability.

Today’s Leading Pathway

The dominant SAF production technology today is hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), which converts fats, oils and greases into jet fuel through hydrogen treatment. Its appeal lies in compatibility with existing refinery infrastructure, allowing producers to leverage current equipment with modifications.

However, HEFA faces constraints that limit long-term scalability; chief among them is feedstock availability. The U.S. produces about 23 million tons of suitable feedstock annually, with soybean oil accounting for 57% of supply. Used cooking oil is limited by collection logistics, while animal fats are geographically concentrated in states such as Nebraska, Texas and Iowa, increasing transportation costs and carbon intensity.

Competition from the renewable diesel market further complicates HEFA economics, as incentives often favor diesel production and intensify feedstock competition. Maximizing SAF yields also generates substantial naphtha byproducts—up to 25% of total output—which can become a low-value burden for facilities located far from petrochemical markets.

These factors create a complex optimization challenge. HEFA produces only paraffinic components, while conventional jet fuel requires 8% to 25% aromatics for proper engine performance. As a result, HEFA SAF must be blended with fossil jet fuel, limiting its carbon reduction potential. Producers must balance feedstock costs, blending requirements and infrastructure proximity while navigating agricultural commodity volatility.

Innovation in SAF Production

The industry’s response to HEFA’s challenges has been to diversify production pathways and optimize existing processes. Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts solid waste after gasification into syngas into synthetic fuels, offers access to more abundant feedstocks but at higher capital and operating costs. Alcohol-to-jet pathways provide another alternative, though current processes remain energy-intensive and expensive.

Current ASTM standards limit most SAF pathways to 50% blending with conventional jet fuel. Still, the industry is moving toward higher blend ratios and eventually 100% drop-in synthetic fuels. Achieving this goal requires addressing the aromatic component gap in HEFA SAF production, making economical sources of these molecules crucial for future fuel specifications.

One particularly promising area involves upgrading the naphtha byproducts from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes into aromatic components of SAF that are otherwise missing from these outputs. Rather than treating these naphtha materials as low-value byproducts, emerging add-on technologies can convert them into high-value aromatics. For example, Universal Fuel Technologies has developed a chemical processing technology that complements HEFA and FT by converting their naphtha byproducts into high-quality aromatic components essential for jet fuel.

The challenge of upgrading naphtha byproducts stems from two key factors: the chemical properties of paraffinic molecules, which make them difficult to convert into aromatics, and the small quantities produced at individual HEFA facilities, which preclude economies of scale. These chemical and economic dual constraints explain why few technologies have emerged to convert this low-value stream into higher-value products. However, this approach not only improves the economics of existing SAF production, but also addresses a critical technical requirement for future 100% SAF blends.

Economic Viability Through Integration

The future of SAF production likely depends on integrated approaches that maximize resource utilization and minimize waste. Rather than viewing each production pathway in isolation, the industry must consider how different technologies can complement each other.

The flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions becomes crucial as well. Feedstock availability and pricing fluctuate in response to agricultural cycles, regulatory changes, and competing demand. Production facilities that can adjust their operations—switching between different feedstocks or product slates based on market conditions—will have significant competitive advantages.

Scaling for Impact

Meeting aviation’s decarbonization goals requires SAF production to scale from hundreds of millions of gallons annually to tens of billions of gallons per year. This expansion demands not only technological improvements but also supply chain development, policy support and effective financing mechanisms. The industry must also develop production technologies that can compete economically with conventional jet fuel while maintaining the performance characteristics that aviation demands. This requires continued innovation in processing technologies, feedstock development and systems integration. In many cases, investors may be reluctant to fund HEFA and FT plants where the naphtha byproduct stream cannot be effectively monetized. Technologies that solve this byproduct utilization challenge become critical enablers, potentially transforming otherwise uneconomical projects into viable investments and accelerating the deployment of SAF production capacity.

An Immediate Path to Sustainable Aviation

While electric and hydrogen aircraft may eventually transform aviation, SAF offers the most viable path to immediate emissions reduction. Unlike alternative propulsion technologies that require fundamental changes to aircraft design and infrastructure, SAF works within existing systems while delivering measurable environmental benefits.

The industry’s commitment to sustainability is clear, yet progress depends on solutions that can be deployed at scale. SAF provides that bridge, linking today’s fossil fuel reliance with a fully sustainable aviation future. By advancing production technologies that address current economic and technical barriers, the industry can accelerate SAF adoption while moving toward the goal of 100% SAF.

The facility is owned and run by its long-time partner Sekisui Chemical Co. Ltd. and has demonstrated the feasibility of converting mixed waste into ethanol at a near-commercial scale, reports The Globe And Mail.

The pilot plant, built at one-tenth of a full commercial size, can produce about 400 tonnes of ethanol each year. It remained in operation for nearly four years after mechanical completion in April 2022. During this time, the plant showed that LanzaTech’s fermentation technology can reliably handle mixed, non-recyclable waste that would otherwise be sent to landfills or incinerators. The ability to manage uneven and changing waste streams is seen as important for supporting circular use of carbon resources across different regions.

The project was funded through investments by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, a public-private investment fund overseen by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Financial support was also provided by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.

According to the company, the plant met all its guaranteed performance targets and sustained ethanol production above guaranteed levels for more than 14 consecutive days after reaching stable operations. This marked the most productive fermentation period achieved at the site so far, even while operating with challenging gas conditions.

The facility processed synthesis gas made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in varying proportions that are generally difficult for many technologies to handle. Despite this, ethanol output remained steady, highlighting the flexibility and strength of the fermentation process.

Gasification is a commonly used method for treating solid waste, and LanzaTech has previously combined its fermentation system with established gasifier technologies. The Kuji project also involved work with a new gasifier design, providing further proof that the fermentation process can perform reliably even when gas quality varies.

LanzaTech chief executive Jennifer Holmgren said the results reflected strong cooperation between the company, Sekisui Chemical, and local and national authorities. She said the project confirmed that the technology works well beyond the laboratory stage and can be scaled up, while also acknowledging the support of the Japanese government for sustainable technology initiatives.

The company said it will continue to focus on waste-to-energy projects that support a circular economy and supply key inputs for sustainable aviation fuel and other low-carbon chemicals.

Achieved ethanol yields exceeding guaranteed performance for over 14 consecutive days at steady state

Successfully operated on complex syngas streams with CO + H₂ contents as low as 40%

Demonstrated robust waste-to-ethanol process under varying feedstock conditions

SKOKIE, Ill., Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA), a leader in industrial carbon recycling, has announced successful operational results at the municipal solid waste (MSW) to ethanol pilot plant in Kuji City, Iwate, Japan owned and operated by longstanding partner, SEKISUI CHEMICAL CO., LTD. (TSE: 4204) (SEKISUI). This 1/10th commercial scale facility, with the capacity to produce approximately 400 tons of ethanol per year, operated for nearly four years following mechanical completion in April 2022. Throughout this period, the plant demonstrated that LanzaTech’s gas fermentation platform can reliably process highly inhomogeneous, unsorted mixed non-recyclable waste streams—materials that would otherwise be destined for landfill or incineration. The demonstrated ability to manage challenging and variable waste sources is especially significant, as it shows that the technology can adapt to diverse regional waste profiles and support the development of a global circular carbon economy.

The waste-to-ethanol plant was funded with investment by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, a private-public fund overseen by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). It also received funding from the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.

The plant achieved its guaranteed performance, sustaining specific ethanol yields above guaranteed values for over 14 consecutive days after reaching steady state - making this the most productive fermentation campaign at the site to date. Notably, the ethanol yield was maintained above guaranteed performance despite operating on particularly challenging gas mixtures. The plant processed syngas (a blend of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) with a combined CO + H₂ content ranging from 40% to 55%, and an H₂:CO ratio between 1.1 and 1.4, a balance that can be especially demanding for other catalytic technologies. To put this in context, achieving high performance under these conditions is akin to running a marathon at high altitude; it demonstrates both the adaptability and resilience of the LanzaTech process.

Gasification is a widely used and established technology for processing solid waste streams, with LanzaTech having successfully integrated its fermentation platform with several proven, traditional gasifier systems. The project at Kuji provided an opportunity to collaborate on a novel gasifier design, underscoring both the value of ongoing innovation in waste conversion technologies and the adaptability of LanzaTech’s fermentation process. Even with varied feed gas conditions, the process not only remained robust but also met key performance targets, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of LanzaTech’s platform.

“We are immensely proud of what we’ve achieved together at our Japan demonstration facility,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “Our sincere thanks go to our partner Sekisui Chemical and the prefecture of Iwate and the city of Kuji for their outstanding collaboration and support. The results at Kuji once again demonstrate the scalability and technical viability of our fermentation platform. We are also grateful to the Government of Japan for its continued support and investment in sustainable technologies. We look forward to building on this progress and expanding sustainable fuels and chemicals in Japan and beyond.”

LanzaTech remains committed to advancing waste-to-energy solutions that are essential for a circular economy and that create valuable feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel and other chemicals. By turning challenging waste streams into critical resources, projects like this help enable low-carbon industries and accelerate the global transition to more sustainable fuels.

The EU Innovation Fund has selected 61 projects for funding

The EU Innovation Fund was established to advance innovative energy projects that could reshape the global energy industry as the need to diversify energy output across the world intensifies. Towards the end of last year, the Innovation Fund identified 61 projects across Europe that will receive funding.

Five Finnish projects were selected as part of the 61 approved applications. Finland has become a progressive nation thanks to its ambitions to increase renewable biofuel production through several projects being led by market-leading companies in Europe.

Renewable biofuel and diesel play an important role in decarbonizing the global energy market

Over the past few years, it has become abundantly clear to the world that we need to decarbonize the energy market to meet clean energy and emission targets. While the world still needs oil and gas, one method of decarbonization may be to increase biofuel and renewable diesel production.

Neste has now opted to expand its already impressive standing in the European energy market by establishing a co-processing facility for biofuels and renewable diesel at its Porvoo oil refinery in Finland. The company is a market leader in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, and has now received the backing of the EU Innovation Fund for its refinery project in Finland.

“Switching to renewable diesel is a cost-effective and straightforward process aiming to enhance sustainability. This fuel is fully compatible with existing diesel storage tanks, fueling equipment and vehicles eliminating the need for expensive new infrastructure.” – Advanced BioFuels USA

Neste aims to develop an entirely new co-processing technology in Finland

The company has some lofty ambitions for the Finnish project. Neste aims to establish an entirely new co-processing technology at its Porvoo oil refinery in Finland. SCOOP will make use of crude tall oil to produce vast amounts of sustainable biofuels as well as renewable diesel for the regional market.

Thanks to the significant funding allocation from the EU Innovation Fund, the project is now seen as strategically important for the European continent and may pave the way forward for other nations to follow suit and develop new, innovative projects that will deliver vast amounts of energy while not placing the climate in peril.

Crude tall oil is a residue created at mills from the use of pine wood, which mostly goes to waste. Neste aims to develop an all-new technology to process said residue and use it to create biofuels and renewable diesel, which will help Neste’s customers reduce their carbon footprint.

As several energy-rich nations aim to increase petrochemical production over the coming years, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the market is in a constant state of evolution as nations and companies aim to meet clean energy and emission reduction targets by the end of the decade.

Neste is fostering a new era of decarbonization for the industry

The need to diversify the energy market is only matched by the challenge it faces in securing funding for innovative projects that will reshape the global industry. With geopolitical tensions rearing their ugly heads across the world at the moment, nations will need to invest heavily in diversifying their energy portfolios to meet clean energy and emission targets over the coming years.

Read on to assess the state of the airline industry in 15 numbers.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) anticipates improved airline profitability for 2025 and resilience in the face of continued global economic and political shifts. However, its projections represent a fall in net profits on its previous released numbers, but margins are expected to increase.

In an update to its 2025 airline industry financial outlook, released at its AGM in New Delhi, India, IATA predicted industry net profits of USD36.0 billion, improved from the USD32.4 billion earned in 2024. This is slightly down on the previously projected USD36.6 billion (Dec-2024).

The projected net profit margin at 3.7% is an improvement from the 3.4% earned in 2024 and up 0.1pp on the previously projected 3.6%. Return on invested capital at 6.7%, is also an improvement from the 6.6% earned in 2024, but largely unchanged from previous projections.

Operating profits at USD66.0 billion, are also an improvement from an estimated USD61.9 billion in 2024, but down from the previously projected USD67.5 billion.

The standout projection though is that the industry will not exceed the anticipated USD1 trillion revenues, albeit will still hit record annual levels. Total revenues are projected to reach USD979 billion (+1.3% on 2024). Total expenses will hit USD913 billion (+1.0% on 2024, but below the previously projected USD940 billion).

Total traveller numbers will also reach a record high but will again miss a key milestone. An anticipated 4% rise over 2024 will bring annual passenger traffic to 4.99 billion for 2025, a revision from the 5.22 billion projection from the end of 2024.

Total air cargo volumes will follow the same trend reaching 69 million tonnes, up 0.6% on 2024, but below the previously projected 72.5 million tonnes.

2024 was a historic year for the aviation industry, as global passenger traffic finally achieved a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels, supported by continued strong travel demand.

This strong demand coupled with restricted capacity drove higher load factors and impacted consumers in the form of higher airfares.

Airlines benefited from lower fuel prices, but non-fuel costs generally increased across the board.

These market dynamics are expected to help keep airline operating profits at historically high levels.

Supply chain issues remained a major restriction on industry growth throughout the year, headlined by aircraft delivery delays and significant additional engine maintenance requirements.

Airlines were particularly impacted by being unable to introduce new aircraft as planned, limiting their growth potential, increasing the average fleet age, hampering efforts to improve efficiency and cut emissions, and driving greater demand and costs for maintenance and aircraft leasing.

Service providers to airlines were among the major beneficiaries of the supply chain problems, with many lessors and MRO providers reporting high demand and record financial performance.

As 2023 begins, CAPA presents a snapshot of the global airline industry in 15 numbers.

Based on a presentation given at CAPA's World Aviation Summit in Gibraltar in Dec-2022, with updated numbers as appropriate, this graphic report summarises a range of key aviation metrics.

It paints a picture of an industry recovering from a period when it faced the most serious challenges ever encountered.

In the three years 2020-2022 the world's airlines lost 80% of the industry's all-time accumulated profit of all previous years.

Yet, capacity and traffic have made significant steps towards recovering 2019 levels, and there has been no net reduction in the number of airlines over the past three years.

Unlike hydrogen or ammonia, which require massive new infrastructure and safety overhauls, sustainable biofuels can decarbonize the existing global fleet immediately.
The Global Biofuels Alliance, strengthened by our new Global Biofuel Champion Fellowship to nurture young scientists, stands at the forefront of this shift.
The Global South has proven that biofuels are a sophisticated, high-tech, and socially inclusive pathway to Net Zero.","In the race to decarbonize the global economy, the world often finds itself paralyzed by a search for perfection. We wait for battery technologies that do not yet exist at scale, or for green hydrogen infrastructure that is decades away from ubiquity. But last month at COP30, amidst the backdrop of the Amazon, a different narrative emerged—one grounded not in future miracles, but in immediate, scalable reality.

The message from Belem is clear: We cannot afford to wait. And we don’t have to.

Brazil, leveraging its presidency of the climate talks, introduced the “Belem 4X Pledge,” a bold commitment to quadruple the global use of sustainable fuels by 2035. While nations debate the politics of pledges, the GBA is already building the technical scaffold to make ambitions, targets, pledges, and commitments a reality. We see biofuels not as a “bridge technology,” but as a destination—a critical, permanent pillar of a just energy transition.

For too long, the debate on bioenergy has been stifled by the “food versus fuel” myth. Critics argue that growing crops for energy threatens global food security. However, data shared at our high-level roundtables dismantles this zero-sum thinking. In Brazil, fifty years of ethanol production have coincided with record food output. Modern biofuel production is circular; the by-products of corn ethanol, such as distillers’ grains, serve as high-protein animal feed, actually supporting food systems rather than competing with them.

The urgency of this shift is most visible in the sectors we call “hard-to-abate.” Consider shipping and aviation. While electric vehicles are transforming road transport, batteries cannot fly a jumbo jet across the Atlantic or power a container ship across the Pacific. Here, biofuels are the only commercially viable, drop-in solution available today.

The maritime sector is already pivoting. Data presented at COP30 reveals that 50 percent of new ship orders are now capable of using alternative fuels. Unlike hydrogen or ammonia, which require massive new infrastructure and safety overhauls, sustainable biofuels can decarbonize the existing global fleet immediately.

Yet, barriers remain. As noted in the GBA’s new whitepaper released at the summit, “Green Fuels for Blue Skies,” Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) currently costs three to four times more than conventional jet fuel. Airlines cannot bridge this gap alone. We need harmonized global policies—blending mandates, book-and-claim systems, and tax incentives—to drive costs down and production up. We also need to harmonize sustainability standards so that a litre of SAF produced in the Global South is recognized and valued the same way in Europe or Asia.

Perhaps most importantly, the bioenergy revolution is a matter of equity. The energy transition cannot just be about Teslas in California; it must be about clean cooking in Kenya. Today, 2.4 billion people still breathe toxic smoke from cooking with wood and charcoal. Bioethanol offers a clean, localized solution that improves health and empowers women. Initiatives like the KOKO Networks in Kenya demonstrate that when we treat biofuels as a tool for development, we can solve the climate crisis and the energy poverty crisis simultaneously.

The Global Biofuels Alliance, strengthened by our new Global Biofuel Champion Fellowship to nurture young scientists, stands at the forefront of this shift. We are moving from diplomatic pledges to implementation.

The Global South has proven that biofuels are a sophisticated, high-tech, and socially inclusive pathway to Net Zero. The technology is ready. The feedstock is available. The only missing ingredient is the political will to standardize our markets and finance the scale-up.

We have the tools to clean our skies and oceans today. Let us not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/default-article-banner.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 22:56:23.714866

For companies managing large shipping networks, indirect greenhouse-gas emissions—particularly those classified as GHG Protocol’s Scope 3—represent both the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity. Scope 3 encompasses all indirect emissions (i.e., emissions that aren’t directly produced by the company of origin but are produced by other organizations in their supply chain) that result from the beginning of the corporate value chain to the end, from transportation to distribution and the final use of sold products.

As a global company serving over 220 countries, DHL relies on an extensive network outside of our own organization, which makes tracking and minimizing Scope 3 shipping emissions an imperative part of our sustainability initiative. Regardless of scale, however, tracking is important for businesses of every size.

Why Scope 3 matters for your shipping network

While Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (purchased energy) are important, for logistics providers and shippers alike, Scope 3 frequently comprises the majority of the carbon footprint — up to 80-90%.

For a shipping network, Scope 3 includes:

Emissions from upstream activities (e.g., procurement of packaging materials, inbound transport).

Emissions from downstream distribution (e.g., onward transport, customer delivery, returns).

Emissions embedded in third-party logistics providers or carrier services.

Tracking Scope 3 is vital because:

It enables you to identify the biggest lever for decarbonization in your supply chain and network.

It allows you to respond to regulatory and customer demand for transparency. 66% of respondents say that they consider sustainability when making a purchase, so responsible carbon reporting is increasingly important.

It gives you a data-driven foundation for setting reduction targets, differentiating on green credentials and building competitive advantage.

Step-by-step: How to track Scope 3 emissions across your shipping network

How do you get started with measuring Scope 3 emissions and implementing a supply chain decarbonization plan? Let’s break it down into four actionable steps.

Step 1: Measure your footprint and set targets

Inventory all emissions sources across your network (inbound, outbound, warehousing, returns).

Use standard frameworks such as the GHG Protocol to classify and quantify Scope 3. AI for emissions tracking in logistics is also an increasingly useful tool.

Where exact data is unavailable, use estimation methods or benchmarking to fill gaps (e.g., carrier vehicles, air vs. sea freight, packaging).

Establish measurable reduction targets for your network (e.g., “reduce downstream delivery emissions by 20% by 2030”).

Step 2: Secure resources & stakeholder buy-in

Engage your carriers, logistics partners and internal departments (procurement, operations, sustainability) to align on data sharing.

Invest in analytics tools, dashboards and data capture systems that enable visibility across network nodes (transport modes, carriers, packaging).

Ensure budget and governance are in place — tracking emissions across a complex network requires dedicated effort.

Step 3: Implement tracking systems and reduction strategies

Map the shipping network: origin-to-destination flows, transport modes, intermediaries, packaging types, returns flows.

For each segment, capture data such as distance, mode (road, rail, sea, air), load factor, fuel type, packaging weight and material.

Use carriers and providers who disclose their fuel usage, electrification status or use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) if airfreight. For example, our GoGreen Plus shipping option uses SAF and helps reduce shipping emissions.

Build a dashboard that aggregates all this data, segments it by upstream vs downstream, by carrier, by mode, by packaging, and tracks your baseline vs target.

Don’t forget reverse logistics: returns increase emissions. DHL advises reducing returns and using parcel-lockers or optimized return flows.

Leverage trends and innovations: route optimization, green packaging, EV fleets and other sustainable freight solutions, etc.

Step 4: Monitor progress, review & communicate

Regularly benchmark performance and track trend lines.

Review which carriers, modes, packaging types or regions are under-performing? Where are the greatest reduction opportunities?

Use the measurements to inform procurement: select partners based on sustainability credentials (e.g., green packaging, EV fleets, SAF adoption). Provide transparent communication to customers, stakeholders, regulators. Shipping and logistics emissions reporting is an increasingly important part of fortifying brand image and building trust

Why choosing the right logistics partner matters

Your choice of logistics provider is not just about cost and speed. It’s also about emissions transparency, sustainable transport modes, carrier data access and packaging innovation. DHL has strategies and toolkits in place to help you actively and effectively reduce your company’s carbon footprint, including Scope 3 emissions.

For example, our GoGreen Plus shipping option uses Sustainable Aviation Fuel, allowing you to increase the impact of your sustainability initiatives in a way that works for your journey. GoGreen Plus also makes tracking your emissions reductions easy by providing a detailed emissions report and a CO2e reduction certificate.

Because so many moving parts and partners are involved, tracking Scope 3 emissions across a shipping network is complex, but it’s also where the largest sustainability gains lie. For B2B logistics operations, the opportunity to measure, manage and reduce these emissions translates into cost savings, risk mitigation, brand value and competitive advantage.

By integrating your shipping network’s data with a partner that shares your sustainability ambition, tracking and reducing Scope 3 becomes far more attainable.

At DHL, we believe that with the right tools, partner alignment, and data-driven strategy, your organization can turn what seems like an indirect, intangible challenge into a measurable, manageable pathway to a greener future.

Caption The gasification furnace in Chiba (Provided by JFE Engineering Corp.)","CHIBA--JFE Engineering Corp. started a pilot operation on what it says is the world’s only furnace that can turn household waste into synthetic gas for use in creating plastics and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The small gasification furnace was built within the premises of JFE Steel Corp.’s East Japan Works in Chiba city.

The furnace injects oxygen into household and industrial waste, and uses the waste’s own heat to drive a reaction that produces synthetic gas composed mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

The resulting gas can be used as a raw material for plastics and SAF, the company said.

This technology is called “chemical recycling,” in which waste is chemically decomposed and returned it to its molecular-level raw state.

It differs from “material recycling,” which physically reverts plastic bottles back into raw material.

Chemical recycling also requires significantly less energy and releases far fewer carbon dioxide than “thermal recycling,” which burns waste to generate heat energy.

In the trial operation that began in December, JFE’s goal is to stably produce synthetic gas and establish a chemical recycling technology that can be economically self-sustaining.

“By redefining the concept of waste, this technology will push green innovation in the manufacturing industry to a new stage,” Susumu Ayukawa, a director of JFE Engineering, said.

The trial operation will continue until June 2026. The waste used will be accepted mainly from Chiba city.

The facility has the capacity to process up to 20 tons of waste per day. A large-scale verification test capable of processing 150 tons daily is planned for fiscal 2029.

In Japan, municipal incineration plants are aging and final disposal sites are in short supply while demand for recycling continues to grow.

JFE Engineering is in discussions with chemical manufacturers to start a chemical recycling business by the end of fiscal 2030.

Successfully operated on complex syngas streams with CO + H ₂ contents as low as 40%

Demonstrated robust waste-to-ethanol process under varying feedstock conditions

SKOKIE, Ill., Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA), a leader in industrial carbon recycling, has announced successful operational results at the municipal solid waste (MSW) to ethanol pilot plant in Kuji City, Iwate, Japan owned and operated by longstanding partner, SEKISUI CHEMICAL CO., LTD. (TSE: 4204) (SEKISUI). This 1/10th commercial scale facility, with the capacity to produce approximately 400 tons of ethanol per year, operated for nearly four years following mechanical completion in April 2022. Throughout this period, the plant demonstrated that LanzaTech’s gas fermentation platform can reliably process highly inhomogeneous, unsorted mixed non-recyclable waste streams—materials that would otherwise be destined for landfill or incineration. The demonstrated ability to manage challenging and variable waste sources is especially significant, as it shows that the technology can adapt to diverse regional waste profiles and support the development of a global circular carbon economy.

The waste-to-ethanol plant was funded with investment by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, a private-public fund overseen by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). It also received funding from the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.

The plant achieved its guaranteed performance, sustaining specific ethanol yields above guaranteed values for over 14 consecutive days after reaching steady state - making this the most productive fermentation campaign at the site to date. Notably, the ethanol yield was maintained above guaranteed performance despite operating on particularly challenging gas mixtures. The plant processed syngas (a blend of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) with a combined CO + H ₂ content ranging from 40% to 55%, and an H ₂ :CO ratio between 1.1 and 1.4, a balance that can be especially demanding for other catalytic technologies. To put this in context, achieving high performance under these conditions is akin to running a marathon at high altitude; it demonstrates both the adaptability and resilience of the LanzaTech process.

Gasification is a widely used and established technology for processing solid waste streams, with LanzaTech having successfully integrated its fermentation platform with several proven, traditional gasifier systems. The project at Kuji provided an opportunity to collaborate on a novel gasifier design, underscoring both the value of ongoing innovation in waste conversion technologies and the adaptability of LanzaTech’s fermentation process. Even with varied feed gas conditions, the process not only remained robust but also met key performance targets, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of LanzaTech’s platform.

“We are immensely proud of what we’ve achieved together at our Japan demonstration facility,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “Our sincere thanks go to our partner Sekisui Chemical and the prefecture of Iwate and the city of Kuji for their outstanding collaboration and support. The results at Kuji once again demonstrate the scalability and technical viability of our fermentation platform. We are also grateful to the Government of Japan for its continued support and investment in sustainable technologies. We look forward to building on this progress and expanding sustainable fuels and chemicals in Japan and beyond.”

LanzaTech remains committed to advancing waste-to-energy solutions that are essential for a circular economy and that create valuable feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel and other chemicals. By turning challenging waste streams into critical resources, projects like this help enable low-carbon industries and accelerate the global transition to more sustainable fuels.

SAF, which the aviation industry predicts could reduce emissions by up to 70%, only accounts for 0.8% of jet fuel.
“In the future, we do know we won’t have enough SAF to make a real dent in emissions from air transport,” he said.
The Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321neo burn up to 25% less fuel than older models, reducing both emissions and operating costs.
That’s due to more inefficient aircraft, air traffic control issues, and planes that are less than 90% full.","Airlines could immediately cut carbon emissions by as much as 50% by taking just three steps: eliminating premium seating, flying newer aircraft, and maximizing seat occupancy, according to a new study that analyzed more than 27 million flights.

Thinking in these terms is an important shift from reliance on sustainable aviation fuel, according to Stefan Gössling, professor of Tourism Research at Linnaeus University, who led the study.

SAF, which the aviation industry predicts could reduce emissions by up to 70%, only accounts for 0.8% of jet fuel. Projections are that there won’t be enough for airlines to meet their 2050 net-zero goal.

Gössling said that achieving the reductions his study identified would lower passenger comfort but could mean that the SAF available could make a difference.

“In the future, we do know we won’t have enough SAF to make a real dent in emissions from air transport,” he said. “If air transport fuel demand doubles, following these three points, it makes it far more likely we can move closer towards using SAF in the future.”

Are Airlines Flying Inefficiently?

The Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321neo burn up to 25% less fuel than older models, reducing both emissions and operating costs. But the growth in flight numbers means the sector’s total emissions keep rising.

One source of inefficiency: Premium seating configurations. Removing them would reduce the amount of emissions per passenger.

“That means we can transport more people on the same flight, meaning we can go to the same destinations with the same amount of people,” Gössling said.

But airlines are increasingly retrofitting cabins with more premium seats in order to meet rising demand. They have seen a surge in demand for premium tickets from leisure travelers in the past five years, and it’s a trend that shows no sign of slowing down.

For example, United Airlines executives said during an earnings call in 2025 that premium cabin revenues were increasing by 5.6% year-over-year, and that the airline planned to invest more in premium capacity in the coming years.

U.S. Flights Lag Behind Global Efficiency

The research found that the United States, which accounts for a quarter of all aviation emissions, operated flights that were 14% more polluting than the global average.

That’s due to more inefficient aircraft, air traffic control issues, and planes that are less than 90% full.

Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall, according to the study: They were almost 50% worse than airports like Abu Dhabi and Madrid.

China, the second biggest aviation polluter, had flight efficiencies slightly above the global average. The UK, the world’s third biggest air travel polluter, was slightly below average.

Industry Response

IATA, which represents most airlines and has set the sector’s decarbonization goals, said progress toward its climate goals will come from deploying SAF and using carbon credits. It added that backlogs of new aircraft have resulted in carriers using older, less efficient planes.

“Airlines have a strong self-interest to reduce fuel burn and maximize load factors, the latter is now at a record 84%,” Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist, told Skift.

“However, supply-chain failures have caused an aircraft order backlog of over 5,000 planes, stalling habitual annual fuel-efficiency gains. Real progress lies in building new energy markets, as the world did regarding wind and solar.”

The In-Air Coffeehouse flight departed from the far end of the international terminal at Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson International Airport following a pre-party that included far more excitement than I’m used to at 9 AM on a Tuesday. We heard the revelry as we approached the gate, which had been tricked out with a makeshift Starbucks coffee bar and deep-green flora evoking the mood of Costa Rica’s tropical environs. Mimosas flowed freely among the 150 or so travelers gathered for the charter flight.

The new experiential perk also coincided with Delta’s 100th anniversary. But back in the terminal, the present took precedence, as did the future. Primarily, what it means to be a part of an airline loyalty program, and what it could mean in the future.

I’d never been on a charter flight before this one. Full disclosure, my travel media career allowed me to bypass the actual sweepstakes, but I still felt like quite the winner as I observed the layman travelers sitting lumpily at the adjacent gate, looking jealously at the early morning shenanigans happening at ours.

The plane itself was a standard Boeing 737 modified for the occasion with faux leather accents and seatback nametags made of burlap coffee sacks. It felt as much like a coffeehouse as economy class could, with the added bonus of empty middle seats. En route, a Starbucks barista led us through a guided tasting of two blends from Hacienda Alsacia, the coffee farm we’d visit in Costa Rica. The mood was revelrous – I’ve never heard such clapping and whooping on a flight. We cheered after the coffee tasting, and again when it was announced that affogatos would be served after lunch. There were multiple rounds of applause for the stewardesses, and even a few claps when the pilot announced the time change as we pulled into the gate in San Jose (something certainly not stirred by the free Imperial beers on board).

Sustainable coffee at Hacienda Alsacia

The next morning, we boarded a bus for Hacienda Alsacia. The farm is in the hills outside of San Jose, overlooking the Central Valley region where some 70 percent of Costa Rica’s 5 million residents live. As we toured the beautiful farm, guides explaining sustainable farming and “safeguarding the future of coffee,” I found myself looking for evidence of corporate greenwashing. Or at least a sense that we were being duped by a giant corporation that buys 3 percent of the world’s coffee from growing regions around the world, yet somehow manages to keep it tasting the same every time.

The farm exists for research and development – nothing grown here is exported out of Costa Rica. The goal is to create coffee plants that are resistant to both climate change and disease, and that use less water and energy. Studies have found that coffee farms will need to move to higher elevations as regions warm, and the threat of diseases like leaf rust (also made worse by climate change) are ever-present and devastating.

Hacienda Alsacia grows a plant resistant to climate change, and blends it with a plant resistant to disease for a durable hybrid. More than 800,000 coffee trees are on the farm, and each of the guests with Delta planted one more on the trip. My wife Alisha was particularly interested in this project as the owner of a boutique heirloom seed company in Colorado. How can sustainable farming practices in Central America be translated to growers in Asia, in the United States, or in the Southern Hemisphere?

It’s easy to blame big corporations for negatively impacting local businesses and communities, and in many cases that finger pointing is justified. When a Starbucks first opened in the small mountain town where I attended college, an angry mob of over-caffeinated locals threw bricks through the windows and publicly vowed never to support the big guy threatening local coffee shops. I didn’t participate in the window smashing, though I agreed with some of the sentiment. I figured that continuing to patronize local cafes was a strong enough vote. Two decades of added wisdom have since taught me that holding big companies to account also means recognizing when they do something right.

Hacienda Alsacia is, from what I gathered during our short time in Costa Rica, a prime example. During a guided tasting of three house blends, we learned about how the R&D farm’s research is open-sourced to growers around the world through the Starbucks Costa Rica Farmer Support Center, one of 10 in coffee growing regions around the globe. It serves as a database of knowledge about how to grow coffee for the future. According to LinkedIn, between 501 and 1,000 people work at Hacienda Alsacia, from farmers to customer service staff, making it a mid-sized employer in the region. As the company’s first wholly-owned coffee farm, the site is a model for other large international coffee companies to follow.

Experiencing a new side of Starbucks

Anyone can visit Hacienda Alsacia and enjoy the unique coffees grown and roasted onsite, and can even watch the roasting happen live while they sip. Our return flight to Atlanta was a regular commercial flight, and I sat next to an American expat who lived in San Jose. He told me when family or friends visit him from back home, he asks if they want to “stop and get a Starbucks” on the way in from the airport, only to detour 40 minutes into the hills to Hacienda Alsacia to treat them to a Starbucks they’ve never tasted, complete with epic mountain views.

At Hacienda Alsacia’s onsite coffeeshop, looking over a waterfall spilling into a canyon below, I spoke with Joshua Kaehler, Delta’s managing director of Loyalty Partnerships, about whether experiences like the In-Air Coffeehouse are going to be more common. I told him I felt that Delta, or really any major airline willing to do so, has a strong opportunity to add memorable moments to the otherwise anxiety-inducing experience of air travel. In the view of this travel editor, knowing something as simple as a good cup of coffee and decent free Wi-Fi await onboard is more than enough to earn my business.

“I think our goal is to figure out what do customers want from brands they care about,” Kaelher says. “We’ve seen really good success so far when we do collaborations on the experiences side with brands that customers know.”

He noted that this means not just more in-air collaborations with Starbucks, but also with services travelers use regularly, such as Uber. These collaborations can help make a full-service experience for Delta flyers that rewards them for choosing Delta and its partners. He emphasized the airline’s focus on establishing itself as the premium American airline, and that it has to maintain that trust with flyers in order to up the ante on experiences. Delta is frequently cited as the most on-time US airline, and has built an image as “premium” for an experience and ticketing process that is more streamlined than budget airlines, though customers pay for that convenience. Some studies have found Delta to be 20 to 40 percent more expensive than these budget carriers.

​​”We wouldn’t have the right to do this if we didn’t run a reliable, careful airline,” Kaelher says. “We’ve spent the last two decades building that and then you sort of can stack these memorable experiences on top of that. It comes back to delivering the core business really well, consistently, and then you have the right to speak about everything else.”

If the goal is for frequent fliers to have a reason to be loyal Delta customers, then these efforts, as well as perks like the In-Air Coffeehouse, represent a different way of thinking about the mass-market flying experience. Travelers have loads of options for the carrier they choose to fly with these days. Few of them inspire or live up to the aspirations of airlines like PanAm and TWA during the Jet Age when flying was an experience rather than a necessity. Today’s reality is more defined by shrinking legroom, angry passengers, confusing pricing and flier rights, and the feeling that hurtling through the sky in a metal tube is just another way to get where you’re going.

Travel inspiration is lacking. The perks for being part of an airline loyalty program are primarily reserved for people who fly a number of miles that seems unheard of to the average person. Something like Group Drop flips that and gives reason to be inspired by a loyalty program for once. Those of us of the Millennial and younger generations missed the “golden era” of flying, and its high time a legacy carrier like Delta brought it back. May the believers among us continue to gather round the proverbial coffee bar at 30,000 feet, toasting our cappuccinos to a new era of journeys, joe, and ample legroom.",https://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2026/01/inair-coffeehouse-gate-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 22:56:33.156186

The company confirmed that construction activities for the low-carbon ammonia plant are now underway, reinforcing its commitment to advancing cleaner energy solutions on a global scale.

The groundbreaking ceremony for the Wabash Low-Carbon Ammonia Project took place on January 5 and was held at the Hay Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. The event brought together approximately 70 attendees, including senior government representatives, industry leaders, and key stakeholders involved in the project. Among the distinguished participants were Kim Yoon-duk, Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Republic of Korea; Hong Namkoong, President and Chief Executive Officer of SAMSUNG E&A; James P. Danly, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy; and Simon Greenshields, Chairman of the Board of Wabash Valley Resources.

The project will be constructed in Terre Haute, Indiana, and is designed as an environmentally responsible ammonia production facility. Once operational, the plant will have the capacity to produce approximately 500,000 metric tons of ammonia annually. In addition, it will incorporate advanced carbon capture technologies capable of capturing up to 1.67 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to the decarbonization of industrial ammonia production.

This initiative is recognized as a nationally significant project and is supported through funding and collaboration from the U.S. Department of Energy, Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, and the Ministry of Climate, Energy, and Environment. In October of the previous year, SAMSUNG E&A signed an Engineering, Procurement, and Fabrication (EPF) contract with Wabash Valley Resources valued at approximately KRW 680 billion, or around USD 475 million. The company is currently executing the project with a targeted completion date set for 2029.

To ensure the project’s success, SAMSUNG E&A plans to apply its extensive experience in ammonia plant development alongside its proprietary and differentiated technologies. These include digital transformation tools, artificial intelligence, automation systems, and modular construction techniques. The company is also working closely with its client and its technology partner, Honeywell UOP, to deliver a high-efficiency and reliable low-carbon ammonia facility.

Beyond this project, SAMSUNG E&A has been actively expanding its capabilities in future-oriented energy technologies. The company continues to invest in and develop core and diversified energy solutions, including ammonia, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), liquefied natural gas (LNG), carbon capture, and hydrogen. These efforts have recently translated into a series of successful contract awards, such as a Malaysian SAF plant, a biodegradable plastics facility in the UAE, eco-friendly LNG basic design work in Indonesia, a conceptual LNG design project in North America, and a SAF basic design project in the United States.

Commenting on the project, CEO Hong Namkoong stated that the company is pleased to participate in a meaningful collaboration between Korea and the United States.

The Regulatory Push Toward Advanced SAF Today, most SAF is produced via HEFA.
Opportunities in Advanced SAF SAF offers a chance to turn residual waste streams into high-value products.
Technology Risk Advanced SAF technologies are still in their infancy.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely heralded as aviation’s most immediate lever for decarbonisation. Yet its ability to deliver meaningful lifecycle emissions reductions hinges on the successful development and deployment of second and third-generation advanced technologies. Increasing demand and rising blend targets under applicable SAF mandates mean that suppliers cannot rely on first-generation methods – such as blending fossil-based jet fuel with hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from waste oils – to meet the future scale and sustainability demands of modern aviation.

The transition to advanced technologies will often require first-of-a-kind (FOAK) plants integrating multiple advanced processes. These projects are inherently high-risk: technology performance is uncertain, supply chains are delicate, and traditional EPC contracting models may not be appropriate. For stakeholders, this means an increased chance of ending up in a claims process involving delay, performance guarantees, or interface challenges. Anticipating risks through robust contractual frameworks and risk-sharing mechanisms will be critical to delivering SAF infrastructure successfully.

Why SAF matters

Aviation faces the same decarbonisation challenge as the resources and waste management sector and other heavy industries. Global air traffic is forecast to grow from 4.5 billion passengers in 20191 to 12.4 billion by 2050,2 intensifying scrutiny on aviation’s carbon footprint. In 2023, aviation contributed 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions; growing faster than rail, road, or shipping.3 This trend is likely to continue as demand for travel rises.

Battery-electric and hydrogen aircrafts remain commercially unviable in the near term. Conversely, SAF, a “drop-in” replacement for conventional jet fuel, is readily available and offers an average of 70% lifecycle emissions reductions4 when fully replacing kerosene, depending on feedstock and process.

The Regulatory Push Toward Advanced SAF

Today, most SAF is produced via HEFA. These are essentially waste oils and fats like used cooking oil, which can be blended with traditional jet fuel to create aviation-grade fuel. However, HEFA is limited and mostly imported from Asia.

To reduce dependence on first-generation SAF, regulators in the UK and Europe are steering the industry towards advanced production pathways. Both the UK’s SAF Mandate and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation recently came into force and set a clear signal: that the future lies beyond HEFA. Two key routes dominate the pipeline:

Second-generation SAF: Fuels from waste and residues such as municipal solid waste or forestry residues. These feedstocks are familiar to the resources and waste management sector, but competition from energy recovery and biomass markets could limit availability.

Third-generation SAF (Power-to-liquid (PtL)): Synthetic fuels made using renewable electricity or low-carbon power to convert power into liquid hydrocarbons. These processes are energy-intensive and may compete for scarce renewable power.

Under the UK SAF Mandate, suppliers must blend 2% SAF into jet fuel by 2025, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.5 From 2027, suppliers will not be able to rely on HEFA alone to meet compliance, and by 2040 HEFA’s share will be capped at approximately 40% of SAF used in the UK.6

The EU has taken a different approach, focusing on PtL. It has set ambitious PtL targets: 0.7% of jet fuel by 2030, rising to 35% by 2050.7 For operators or suppliers straddling both jurisdictions, the message is clear, start planning for a future built on these advanced SAF technologies.

Opportunities in Advanced SAF

SAF offers a chance to turn residual waste streams into high-value products. Municipal solid waste, forestry residues, and industrial offcuts can become SAF feedstock, diverting waste from landfill and creating new revenue streams. In the UK, these opportunities should continue to grow under the UK’s proposed Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM), which intends to operate like a CfD-style scheme guaranteeing a strike price for SAF, funded by a levy on jet fuel suppliers. The RCM framework is set out in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which is currently under review in the House of Lords. While the RCM could reduce revenue risk and help projects reach Final Investment Decision (FID) in the near future, its political durability and strike price adequacy remain uncertain.

The UK Government’s support is also significant. Earlier this year, the UK’s Advanced Fuels Fund awarded £63 million to 17 developers, following £135 million in earlier rounds. These pioneering projects use technologies such as gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, ethanol-to-jet, and PtL through electrolysis. Continued government grants and subsidies will likely assist the rate upon which these technologies can get up to scale.

Challenges and Risks in SAF Deployment

The majority of second and third-generation technologies are not yet proven at scale. Scaling these technologies will require complex, integrated and often FOAK plants combining chemical processing, power generation, and even carbon capture. These remain at pilot or early commercial stage and so the commercial viability and timelines of constructing plants of this nature are far from guaranteed.

Stakeholders involved in funding, designing, and constructing these plants should consider the following risks.

Technology Risk

Advanced SAF technologies are still in their infancy. Performance guarantees will be hard to secure, and lenders will demand strong risk mitigation. Employers and funders will seek to push liability down the chain, but contractors will invariably resist without clear risk-sharing mechanisms such as caps on liability and contract exclusions. Negotiating realistic performance guarantees and liquidated damages regimes at contract formation will be essential.

Supply Chain Issues

Critical plant components such as electrolysers, Fischer-Tropsch reactors, and carbon capture units are in short supply. Delays in procurement in one subsystem could have significant knock-on effects on project completion. Early procurement and contractual clarity on who bears procurement risk will be vital.

Integration Complexity

SAF plants combine multiple processes. Managing interfaces will require detailed FEED, clear commissioning regimes, and strong contractual integration. Traditional EPC models (i.e. where the EPC contractor holds sole responsibility) may not be feasible.

Certification and Compliance

SAF must meet strict aviation standards (e.g., ASTM D7566). Contracts should align performance testing and certification requirements across all packages. For second generation technologies using municipal solid waste, feedstock variability (as existing EfW plant operators will be all too familiar with) adds further complexity and will necessitate clear definitions of fuel envelopes and sampling protocols.

Fraud Risk

As demand increases for waste feedstocks required for the production of second-generation SAF, the risk of fraud also increases. SAF producers need to ensure that they have robust due diligence processes in place to verify the source and sustainability credentials of waste feedstocks.

Environmental and Policy Uncertainty

SAF production is energy-intensive and may compete for land, water, or renewable electricity. Policy support mechanisms such as the RCM could shift with political cycles, affecting investor confidence.

General Construction Risks

As with all major engineering projects, risks associated with unforeseeable delays, specification changes, payment disputes, and supply chain issues are invariably part of the construction phase. Contracts should address these risks at the outset and include resilient dispute resolution mechanisms (such as tiered dispute resolution) to address both routine and complex disputes.

Reputational Risk and Risk of Misleading Investors

The regulatory framework that applies to the production, supply and use of SAF (and other biofuels) is complex and the obligations under applicable SAF mandates may not be understood easily by consumers and investors. The advertising and promotion of SAF may give rise to legal risks under consumer protection laws and financial regulations.8

Conclusion

The SAF transition is not just an energy shift; it is a complex infrastructure challenge. Delivering second and third-generation technologies at scale will require rigorous planning, innovative contracting, and realistic risk allocation. These projects will test traditional delivery models, supply chains and technology performance.

Success demands realism: second and third-generation SAF technologies are not a silver bullet. Their future depends on overcoming cost, technology, and policy uncertainties. Those who anticipate these risks early and craft resilient contractual frameworks will be best placed to navigate any turbulence ahead.

The Harmonised Master List (HML) categorises infrastructure into five main groups, allowing it to access long-term credit at concessional rates, easier access to external commercial borrowings (ECB), besides availing funding from insurance or pension funds.

“We’d like to really move away, or at least distribute those assets, so that we can actually innovate and move more towards sustainable financing that includes commercial electric vehicles, bio CNG, sustainable aviation fuel, critical minerals, green steel and green cement, among others,” he said.

Need for bigger role of states, ULBs

Calling for a need to broad-base infrastructure project funding flows to also include states and urban local bodies (ULBs) in a major way, Srivastava said fiscal incentives are needed to prompt states and ULBs for investing aggressively in infrastructure financing.

“We would expect some kind of, say, incentive push for new products which are Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) friendly so as not to constrain their balance sheets,” he said.

According to him, this can be done by routing them through the ₹1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund, pushing the subordinated debt product, a mezzanine structure that considers some of the risks involved or through bridge financing.

Segmental Analysis

By Output Type, Which Product Aligns with the Most Pressive Decarbonization Needs?

Synthetic fuels, including e-kerosene and e-diesel, lead the output segment with a 54% share. This dominance is due to their direct applicability in decarbonizing long-haul transportation sectors where battery electrification faces significant technical hurdles.

The ability to produce drop-in fuels that can leverage existing global distribution infrastructure and end-use engines creates a compelling, near-term market pull. The focus on fuels over other chemicals underscores the market’s primary driver: creating a scalable alternative to fossil-based liquid fuels for aviation and maritime industries.

By Plant Scale, What Characterizes the Current State of Market Development?

The demo/pilot plant scale holds a commanding 61% market share, indicative of the industry's early-stage technological and commercial validation phase. This segment encompasses first-of-a-kind integrated facilities that demonstrate the technical viability and initial economics of coupling DAC with fuel synthesis like Fischer-Tropsch or methanol-to-jet processes.

High capital intensity, evolving process designs, and the need to de-risk integrated operations before scaling define this segment, which is heavily reliant on government grants and strategic corporate investment.

By Buyer Type, Which Entity is Making the Most Forward-Looking Strategic Investments?

Energy companies are the leading buyer type, accounting for 48% of the market. Major oil and gas firms and integrated energy players are investing in CO2-to-fuels DAC as a strategic hedge and a pathway to diversify into sustainable fuel production.

Their involvement provides not just capital but crucial expertise in large-scale project management, fuel logistics, and market distribution. This buyer segment is primarily funding pilot projects and offtake agreements to secure a position in the future low-carbon fuel value chain and meet corporate net-zero Scope 3 emissions targets.

What are the Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, and Trends in the Industrial CO2-to-Fuels Direct Air Capture Market?

The market is driven by stringent global and regional policies mandating sustainable aviation fuel blends and creating carbon credit mechanisms, such as the US Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Q tax credit enhancements and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation.

The urgent need to decarbonize hard-to-abate transport sectors creates a powerful demand signal for non-biological, scalable liquid fuels. A primary restraint is the extremely high current levelized cost of fuel production, stemming from massive energy inputs for both capture and conversion and high capital expenditure for first-of-a-kind plants.

Energy efficiency and the availability of abundant, low-cost renewable power are fundamental limiting factors. This presents a monumental opportunity for technological innovation across the chain, from lower-energy sorbent materials for capture to more efficient thermochemical or electrochemical conversion pathways.

Key trends include the formation of vertical consortiums linking DAC providers, renewable energy developers, and fuel synthesizer companies; the strategic sourcing of government grants and offtake agreements to finance pioneer plants; and a focus on locating initial facilities in regions with superior renewable resources and favorable policy frameworks to improve early economics.

,,2026-01-07 11:31:43+00:00,the Guardian,Revealed: how aviation emissions could be halved without cutting journeys - The Guardian,"Damian Carrington, www.theguardian.com",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/07/aviation-emissions-halved-flights-efficiently-study,"Airports in India, Brazil and south-east Asia were dominated by less polluting flights.
Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall, almost 50% worse than the airports running the most efficient flights, such as Abu Dhabi and Madrid.
Finally, regulation could ban the most polluting aircraft, as has already happened in places for the noisiest planes.
However, supply-chain failures have caused an aircraft order backlog of over 5,000 planes.” She said real progress in cutting aviation emissions lay in deploying SAF, Corsia, and modernising air routes.
Globally, flying is dominated by rich passengers, with just 1% of the world’s population responsible for 50% of aviation emissions.","Climate-heating emissions from aviation could be slashed in half – without reducing passenger journeys – by getting rid of premium seats, ensuring flights are near full and using the most efficient aircraft, according to analysis.

These efficiency measures could be far more effective in tackling the fast-growing carbon footprint of flying than pledges to use “sustainable” fuels or controversial carbon offsets, the researchers said. They believe their study, which analysed more than 27m commercial flights out of approximately 35m in 2023, is the first to assess the variation in operational efficiency of flights across the globe.

The amount of carbon dioxide per kilometre flown has been falling as aircraft become gradually more fuel efficient. However, the growth in the number of flights has far outstripped this, meaning the emissions helping to fuel the climate crisis are rising. Aviation’s carbon dioxide emissions could double or even triple by 2050, according to experts.

The new analysis found that more polluting flights were common from airports in the US and Australia, particularly smaller ones, as well as in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Airports in India, Brazil and south-east Asia were dominated by less polluting flights.

Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall, almost 50% worse than the airports running the most efficient flights, such as Abu Dhabi and Madrid.

The UN’s aviation body, Icao, is relying on an “unambitious and problematic” offsetting scheme, called Corsia, to cut emissions. But it has yet to require any airline to use a carbon credit. Icao was recently accused of having been captured by the industry. The EU has set a 2030 target for airlines to use 6% sustainable aviation fuel, made from waste cooking oil or produced using electricity, but the supply of these fuels is limited and expensive.

“We are currently stuck with a global situation where there is no hope that aviation will reduce its emissions,” said Prof Stefan Gössling, at Linnaeus University in Sweden and who led the research. In contrast, he said all-economy-seat planes, 95% flight occupancy and using today’s most efficient aircraft could cut fuel use and therefore emissions by 50-75%. “That is huge,” he said, adding that it would also mean far less sustainable fuel would be needed to make flying near emissions free in the future.

“I always thought air transport was already very efficient, and that is also what airlines like to tell people,” Gössling said. “But, in reality, it’s very inefficient because of the three factors: using old aircraft, transporting people [in premium seats] with lots of space, and often having aircraft that are not really fully loaded.” In 2023, the average “load factor” – seat occupancy – was almost 80%.

The study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, examined the efficiency of flights between 26,000 pairs of cities, based on the CO2 emitted per kilometre per passenger. The analysis involved 3.5 billion passengers who flew a combined distance of 6.8tn km, equivalent to 145 return journeys to the sun. The flights caused 577m tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the annual emissions of Germany.

The research found that the US, which is responsible for a quarter of all aviation emissions, had flights that were 14% more polluting than the global average. China, the second biggest aviation polluter, had flight efficiencies slightly above the global average, while the UK, the world’s third biggest aviation polluter, had efficiencies slightly below the average of 84.4g of CO2 per passenger kilometre.

The emissions on specific routes varied enormously. The most efficient route was from Milan, Italy, to Incheon airport near Seoul, South Korea (31.6g CO2/pkm). Modern, full planes with fewer premium seats are largely the reason for more efficient flights. The least efficient route was in Papua New Guinea, with the second worst from Ironwood airport to Minneapolis/St Paul in the US (805g CO2/pkm).

“While airlines often claim that fuel savings are in their own economic interest, the reality is that many airlines continue to fly with old aircraft, low load factors, or growing shares of premium-class seating,” the researchers said.

Gössling said replacing premium seats with denser economy seating was probably the most important factor. Overall, first and business class passengers are responsible for more than three times the emissions of economy passengers, he said, and up to 13 times more in the most spacious premium cabins.

Policies to implement greater efficiency could include softer options, such as requiring airlines to disclose an efficiency rating for each route, Gössling said: “Just as with white appliances, you wouldn’t want to fly with an airline that is rated F.”

Market-based policies could involve airports charging higher landing fees for more polluting aircraft, which also worsen the air quality of local communities, he said. Finally, regulation could ban the most polluting aircraft, as has already happened in places for the noisiest planes.

The potential improvements in efficiency set out in the study, such as replacing older, more polluting planes, would involve costs, and the aviation industry already runs on low profit margins. But Gössling argued the aviation industry had got stuck in a business model that focuses on growing passenger numbers to increase profit.

Instead, he said, it could run fewer, fuller flights with higher ticket prices. He said many flights were only taken because they were so cheap: “We know that a lot of air transport demand is induced. If you increase the cost, people would just choose a different type of holiday.”

Marie Owens Thomsen, the senior vice-president of sustainability at the International Air Transport Association, the trade association for the world’s airlines, said: “Airlines have a strong self-interest to reduce fuel burn and maximise load factors. However, supply-chain failures have caused an aircraft order backlog of over 5,000 planes.” She said real progress in cutting aviation emissions lay in deploying SAF, Corsia, and modernising air routes.

Globally, flying is dominated by rich passengers, with just 1% of the world’s population responsible for 50% of aviation emissions. Only about 10% of people fly at all each year and only 4% fly abroad. Even in richer nations such as the US and Germany, only about a half and a third of people respectively take flights.

A spokesperson for ICAO said its analysis determined that operational improvements could deliver 4-11% of the carbon emission reductions needed to reach net zero, with cleaner fuel delivering over half, and innovative technologies the rest. ICAO is encouraging accelerated action by its 193 member states, he said, and welcomed all research providing new insights.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b06434f03a5607fc4c5b5ce77edee1419819e1f9/657_441_3381_2704/master/3381.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0da4372d62353e64c3a7f2014b14e4c0",N,,2026-01-07 07:57:35.612360

INDIANAPOLIS and LONDON, Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Corteva Inc. (NYSE: CTVA) and bp (NYSE: BP, LSE: BP.L) today announced the launch of Etlas, their new 50:50 joint venture that will produce oil from crops – including canola, mustard and sunflower – for use in the production of biofuels like sustainable (or synthetic) aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (RD). Etlas will harness both Corteva's century-long expertise in seed technology to develop crops ideally suited to produce SAF and RD as well as bp's expertise in refining and marketing fuel for the commercial transportation market.

Etlas aims to produce one million metric tonnes of feedstock per year by the mid-2030s, which could produce over 800 thousand tonnes of biofuel. Initial supply is scheduled to begin in 2027 for use in co-processing at refineries as well as at dedicated biofuels plants.

Leading industry estimates have global demand for SAF growing to as much as 10 million tonnes by 20301 -- from about 1 million tonnes in 2024, while global demand for RD could rise to as much as 35 million tonnes by 20302 from approximately 17 million tonnes in 2024. Etlas is designed to provide a reliable, scalable supply of feedstock to help meet this expected demand.

The feedstock Etlas uses will be harvested from crops that are grown on existing cropland, between main food cropping seasons. Such intermediate crops can help improve soil health while providing farmers with a new revenue stream. As they use existing cropland during times when it has previously been unproductive like a fallow or cover period, they also do not lead to additional demand for land.

Judd O'Connor, executive vice president of Corteva's seed business unit added: ""By helping found Etlas, Corteva continues to deliver on two critical parts of our mission: to help fuel the world and to support farmers. Agriculture is part of the solution, and we are excited to see Etlas come to life.""

Philipp Schoelzel, senior vice president, biofuels growth, bp added: ""This capital light joint venture creates optionality in our biofuels value chain, strengthening our position and helping deliver attractive returns. We're excited to collaborate with Corteva to deliver what our customers want.""

Ignacio Conti, Global Business Development Director at Corteva will be the new Etlas Chief Executive Officer and Gaurav Sonar, vice president, Novel Feedstocks at bp will become its Chair of the Board of Directors.

""As the aviation industry looks for reliable, sustainable and cost-competitive sources of SAF, it is clear farmers have a critical role to play,"" said Etlas CEO, Ignacio Conti. ""Etlas brings together global leaders in agriculture innovation and energy production to harness this demand by leveraging technological expertise and trusted relationships with farmers around the world to help scale production and boost supply while offering farmers new revenue streams.""

The mean CO2 intensity (g CO2 per RPK) is then derived by dividing an airport’s CO2 emissions by its RPK.
For these, fuel consumption per RPK can be calculated for each aircraft based on fuel use, emissions, and RPK.","Emissions and efficiency

Data is analysed for 27,451,887 flights (take-offs), operated between 26,156 bi-directional city pairs in 2023. Flights transported a total of 3,554,769,475 passengers over a total flown distance of 43,314,099,618 km (equivalent to 145 return journeys to the sun), or equalling 6,813,991,167,300 RPK (about 0.7 light years), causing emissions of 577,968,750 t CO2.

Fig. 1 illustrates the relevance of the 20 highest emitting countries. The United States is responsible for 25% of global emissions (144.6 Mt), with an average weighted efficiency per RPK that is 14.3% higher than the weighted global average. The second largest emitting country, China, follows with 49.7 Mt CO2, and an average weighted efficiency of 88.6 g CO2 per RPK. Together, the 20 countries account for 74.9% (433 Mt CO2) of global emissions from air passenger transport. Emissions on individual city pairs vary between a low of 31.6 g CO2 per RPK (Milan, Italy to Incheon/Seoul, South Korea) and a high of 888.3 g CO2 per RPK (Kavieng to Tokua Lakunai, within Papua New Guinea). The global average is 84.4 g CO2 per RPK.

The global variation in efficiencies can also be illustrated by airports, and for the busiest routes (Fig. 2). Results show that inefficient flights dominate in Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and Central Asia. They are also common in North America (particularly smaller airports, less busy flights), East Asia, and Western South America. In Europe, Norway is particularly inefficient. Efficient flights dominate in Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as on routes with high traveller volumes. Other regions, including Europe, have both more and less efficient routes.

Larger airports have a higher efficiency averaged across arriving and departing flights (Fig. 3a). The standard deviation of flight CO2 intensities increases for larger airports too (Fig. 3b) as they serve more flights. This is statistically supported by rank correlations of (a) −0.57, (b) 0.54, and total CO₂ emissions are largely determined by RPK (Pearson: 0.98). Large variation in CO₂ intensity reflects on regional differences (Fig. 2).

Figure 4 further illustrates differences between the least and most efficient airports and airlines in the world. Average emissions between the least/most efficient airports and airlines (emissions of 0.1 Mt CO2 or more in 2023) can be more than a factor two. For example, airline LATAM (Chile) caused average emissions of 69.1 g CO2 per RPK, while Air Algerie (Algeria) emitted 115.0 g CO2 per RPK; airport Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) caused 67.5 g CO2 per RPK and Atlanta 103.0 g CO2 per RPK. There is also evidence that larger airlines are more efficient (Fig. 5a), and that passenger load factors influence efficiency (Fig. 5b).

Efficiency improvement potentials

These findings point to the importance of aircraft models, layouts, and load factors. These are analyzed to determine the theoretical maximum efficiency in the air transport system. Observed aircraft model efficiency varies considerably (Fig. 6). The most efficient models include Boeing 787–900 (55.4 g CO2 per RPK), 787–800 (59.8 CO2 per RPK), and Boeing 787–1000 (60.1 CO2 per RPK), followed by Airbus A320 neo (61.4 g CO2 per RPK), Airbus A321neo (64.1 CO2 per RPK), and Airbus A350 (76.2 g CO2 per RPK). If all aircraft were replaced with the Boeing 787-9 (long-haul) and the Airbus A321neo (short and medium-haul), this would result in fuel savings of −25% to −28% depending on respective market share (Fig. 7).

In regard to layouts, IATA21 suggests that business and first class seats are up to 5 times more CO₂-intense than economy class seats. Premium class seating is more common in wide-bodied aircraft and on long-haul flights, as well as among specific airlines including American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Swiss International Air Lines30. An all-economy class configuration would consequently reduce emissions. Here, results suggest that increasing passenger numbers to the maximum seating configuration for the most efficient aircraft (Airbus 350 and Boeing 787) would further reduce emissions by 21.5% to 56.7%, assuming no changes in the load factor.

In 2023, average passenger load factors were 78.9% for flown kilometers, with a range from 20.1% to 100% between individual flights. Increasing this load factor to 95% would further reduce emissions by 16.1%. Overall, emissions in 2023 could have been 54.5% to 76.0% lower, though a modest fuel penalty would have to be considered (see Methods). This suggests that transporting the same number of passengers over the same distances would be possible with less than half the current fuel consumption, if airlines only operated the most efficient aircraft models, switched to an all-economy layout, and increased the load factor to 95% (Fig. 7).

While this is the hypothetical maximum, analysis for 13,666 city pairs (52.2% of all city pairs) that are served by more than one airline or aircraft configuration suggests that operating these city pairs by the most efficient configuration currently in use would reduce emissions by 10.7%. This represents the already demonstrated efficiency gain in the air transport system, with airlines operating under their economic constraints.

Further analysis confirms that CO2 intensity strongly depends on passenger load factors and flight distance (Fig. 8). A least-squares linear regression with load factor and distance as predictors shows that a full flight (load factor 100%) covering 10,000 km emits, on average, 57 g CO2 per RPK. This almost doubles to 109 g CO2 per RPK for a half full flight (load factor 0.5) or increases to 83 g CO2 per RPK for a reduced flight distance of 1000 km at full capacity. However, there is considerable variation around this average (Fig. 8) likely highlighting the importance of aircraft models. Neglecting possible changes in passenger load, if every flight’s intensity was capped at this average (the medium cap model), increasing efficiency for approximately the lower half of flights would save 8.6% in emissions (or 50 Mt CO₂). A low cap model, allowing average intensities (from the medium cap model) and up to 33% higher, would only affect the most inefficient flights, consequently saving only 1.1% of emissions. A high cap model, however, which requires every flight to be at least 33% more efficient than the average (of the medium cap model), effectively requiring the highest industry standards, would save 34.6% of emissions or 200 Mt CO₂. These scenarios are more realistic compared to those discussed around Fig. 7 as they acknowledge constraints many airlines face when operating.

Efficiency model

The comparison of commercial passenger air transport efficiencies requires a comparable indicator. CO2 intensity, i.e. Emissions per revenue passenger kilometer (g CO2 per RPK) can be calculated for aircraft, airports, and city pairs. This indicator is directly proportional to fuel use per revenue passenger kilometer (kg fuel per RPK). It is influenced by many factors, including the aircraft design (airframe, engine type, winglets), operational aspects (distance, speed, flight route, flight altitude, weather, detours, holding patterns, green flying techniques), as well as on-the-ground conditions (taxiing, ground power supply). Energy use per passenger also depends on aircraft layout (seat numbers), load factors, and co-loaded cargo. Data is limited to aircraft with 30 seats and more, i.e., private aircraft and business jets are not part of the analysis. Data allows us to calculate average load factors for each city pair, from which global load factors and fuel use can be derived.

To factor these aspects into the calculation of emissions per RPK, an efficiency model is used that considers distance, aircraft type, and payload (passenger and cargo weight). 2023 data for the efficiency model is derived from:

1)

T100I (AirlineData): flight-specific load factors for flights to and from the USA and Canada, annual means.

2)

ICAO TFS (Traffic by Flight Stage): similar to T100I with global coverage, though not for all airlines.

3)

IATA WATS (World Air Transport Statistics): annually averaged, airline-specific load factors (i.e., not disaggregated by city pair or aircraft type), further split into international and domestic services, for about 219 airlines.

4)

FlightGlobal: similar to IATA WATS, with airline-level data (annual mean load factors) for 178 airlines.

Data consequently has three levels of granularity for load factors:

Level 1: Airline average over one year (52% of all flights).

Level 2: Airline–city pair average over one year (12.4%).

Level 3: Airline–aircraft–city pair average over one year (15.2%).

T100I and ICAO TFS provide level 3 data. From these, level 2 and level 1 averages can be derived by averaging revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) and available seat kilometers (ASK) across aircraft serving a given city pair (level 2) and additionally across all city pairs (level 1, ICAO TFS only). By contrast, IATA WATS and FlightGlobal only provide level 1 data.

For each individual flight, the highest level of load factor is sought, following a fallback cascade across the data sources. When IATA WATS is established as the best data source, the corresponding value for either domestic or international flights is used. As a last fallback, a global load factor over all airlines is calculated for three distance categories: short-haul (≤1500 km), medium-haul (1501−3500 km) and long haul (>3500 km). This load factor is used when no other load factor (level 1–3) can be found.

The induced error can be calculated for using global means instead of level 3 values. When bootstrapping 100,000 samples, the per-flight absolute error mean is 0.0406, and the median is 0.0145. The bootstrapped 95% CI for the absolute error mean is [0.0389, 0.0423]. This corresponds to a relative error of 5.38% with a 95% CI of [5.15%, 5.62%]. Notably, this error affects 20.4% of the load factor, as a higher-level granularity for load factors is available for 79.6% of flights.

Total fuel use is a function of total load and aircraft-specific performance data. Seat-classes are weighted by multiplying average per-passenger emissions with a seat-class factor based on IATA’s cabin class method21. This method considers the number of seats per class in a given aircraft configuration. The formula for this calculation is provided in (Eq. (1)); the passenger share of fuel use in (Eq. (2)), also involving data from Flight Global, which provides passenger data. Fuel use is transformed into CO₂ in (Eq. (3)).

More specifically, fuel consumption is calculated for each individual flight, accounting for the specific aircraft model, cabin layout, and passenger/cargo load factors. Fuel consumption is derived from a physical aircraft performance model, which calculates fuel consumption for a given aircraft model, considering flight distance and takeoff weight. The total fuel consumption of the flight is then broken down into fuel use per passenger and converted to CO2 emissions per passenger. All subsequent analyses are based on these individual-flight emission characteristics, allowing for more nuanced results than calculations based on airline-average or city pair-average load factors or performance data.

Allocation of total fuel burn of a given flight to individual passengers and subsequent conversion to CO2 emissions follows these steps:

(a) Calculation of fuel use for payload in ton kilometres (tkm)

$${fuel\; per\; tkm}=({total}\, {fuel})/({flight}\, {distance}\times {payload})$$

(1)

(b) Calculation of fuel per passenger (pax)

$${{{\rm{fuel}}}}\, {{{\rm{per}}}}\, {{{\rm{pax}}}} = \; {{{\rm{fuel}}}}\, {{{\rm{per}}}}\, {{{\rm{tkm}}}}\times {{{\rm{distance}}}}\times 100\, {{\rm{kg}}} \\ \times {{{\rm{freight}}}}\, {{{\rm{correction}}}}\, {{{\rm{freight}}}}\, {{{\rm{correction}}}}=\frac{{m}_{{{\rm{pax}}}}+0.5\times {m}_{{{\rm{cargo}}}}}{{m}_{{{\rm{pax}}}}+{m}_{{{\rm{cargo}}}}}$$

(2)

Here, passenger emissions and 50% of the emissions from freight transport are allocated to passengers, assuming a passenger (including baggage) weighs 100 kg39.

(c) Calculation of CO₂ per Passenger (pax)

$${{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2} \; {{{\rm{per}}}}\; {{{\rm{pax}}}}={{{\rm{fuel}}}}\; {{{\rm{per}}}}\; {{{\rm{pax}}}}\times 3.16$$

(3)

The resulting per-passenger emission intensity enables comparisons of flight efficiency. Figure 8 illustrates the inherent dependence of emission intensity on flight distance, with longer flights generally exhibiting lower emission intensities. This is because takeoff and ascent to cruising altitude - the most fuel-intensive phase of a flight - account for a larger proportion of total fuel burn on short-haul routes.

These data are used to assess all flights; where no data for a specific flight is available, global mean values are used for three distance classes (short-/medium-/long-haul). Flight distances are based on great circle distances, which are converted to flown distances by using ICAO’s correction factor: +50 km for flights up to 550 km, + 100 km for flights between 550 and 5500 km, and +125 km for flights >5500 km40. Data is available for 26,155 city pairs and 61,607 ‘flights’, with one flight being defined as a unique combination of departure airport, arrival airport, airline, and aircraft type. Non-operational code-sharing flights have been removed from the dataset; only the airline carrying out the flight is considered. A weakness of the dataset is that it includes mostly scheduled flights.

Validation checks

The dataset comprises 27,451,887 flights in 2023, carrying a total of 3,554,769,475 passengers over a distance of 6,813,991,167,301 RPK, and causing emissions of 577,968,750 t CO2. This is less than the 35.3 million flights, 4.319 billion passengers, 8232 billion RPK, and the 530 Mt CO₂ reported through the CORSIA Central Registry (said to cover 99% of total 2023 emissions on scheduled services reported for 2023 by ICAO41)42,43. Our data consequently covers 83% of RPK and 82% of passengers in comparison to ICAO data. A potential explanation is that there are data gaps related to the reporting of charter operators.

Consistency analysis of our database shows that the number of seats in aircraft is always higher than the number of passengers. Airline load factor comparison with three airlines, Ryanair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines, for which data is publicly available, also suggests that variation is within 10%. For example, in 2023, Ryanair reported a 93% load factor, whilst the model suggests 93.6%; Lufthansa reported 82%, whilst the dataset is 78.9%; and American Airlines reported 83.5%, whilst the model suggests 81%. It is difficult to validate emission intensities for airlines due to variable operating conditions and inconsistent reporting standards. Annual reports may not include RPK numbers, refer to financial years rather than calendar years, combine data on operational fuel use for cargo and passengers, combine different accounting scopes, deduct sustainable aviation fuel emission “savings”, or calculate CO₂e rather than CO₂. Airlines also have subsidiaries that may have been included/excluded in the accounting. However, the communication teams of all airlines mentioned in this article (LATAM, Ryanair, EasyJet, Qatar Airways, Emirates, China Southern, British Airways, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air Algérie) were provided with the data sources used in our analysis, as well as the airline-specific emission efficiencies (g CO2 per RPK) calculated, and were asked to comment. LATAM responded by saying that it does not wish to comment. EasyJet provided a link to their own calculations, suggesting slightly lower emission efficiencies (66.64 g CO2 per RPK) than calculated using our model (74.2 CO2 per RPK).

Emission attribution

Emissions are assessed at different scales of analysis, for airports, airlines, or countries. For airports, emissions are calculated by aggregating half the emissions from all incoming and outgoing flights. This ensures that half of the emissions for each city pair are attributed to the respective departure and arrival airports. The approach addresses that fuel use can vary between incoming and outgoing flights due to differences in flight paths or weather. Airline emissions consider all emissions from flights operated by an airline, with intensities calculated by dividing the total amount of CO2 by the number of RPK. Country emissions are calculated by aggregating emissions from all airports within national borders.

Efficiency calculations

The efficiency of air transport is calculated for aircraft, airlines, airports, city pairs, and countries, using the same indicator (g CO2 per RPK). Airport emissions are calculated for 3218 airports by summing up the CO2 for all departures and arrivals from/at each airport, and dividing the value by two to assign half the emissions from every flight to this airport. In an identical approach, half of all RPKs for every departure and arrival are calculated. The mean CO2 intensity (g CO2 per RPK) is then derived by dividing an airport’s CO2 emissions by its RPK. Aircraft comparisons are based on city pairs, for which data is available for all aspects of the flight. For these, fuel consumption per RPK can be calculated for each aircraft based on fuel use, emissions, and RPK. On this basis, aircraft can be ranked by observed efficiency.

Optimum efficiencies on city pairs can be calculated for all routes served by more than one flight configuration (13,666 out of 26,156 city pairs, or 52.2%). Avoided CO₂ can be determined by dividing the most efficient average (g CO2 per RPK) by the average efficiency on the city pair, multiplied with CO₂ emissions on this city pair. Values can then be aggregated for all city pairs, and total emission be compared to current emissions in the system. This can be expressed as (Eq. (4)):

Ebest = Best (minimum) efficiency for a given route (e.g., fuel per tkm)

Ei = Efficiency of airline i on the same route

CO2i = Current CO₂ emissions of airline i

CO2best,i = CO₂ emissions at best efficiency for airline i

Then, the formula for CO₂ emissions at the best efficiency is:

$${{{\rm{C}}}}{{{\rm{O}}}}_{2,{{{\rm{best}}}},{{{\rm{i}}}}}=\left(\frac{{E}_{{{\rm{best}}}}}{{E}_{i}}\right)\times {{\rm{C}}}{{{\rm{O}}}}_{2,{{\rm{i}}}}$$

(4)

If there are multiple airlines on a city‑pair, the total emissions improvement can be calculated as (Eq. (5)):

$${{{\rm{Total}}}}\, {{{\rm{CO}}}}_{2}\, {{{\rm{reduction}}}}=1-\frac{\sum {{{\rm{r}}}}{{CO}}_{2,{{{\rm{best}}}},{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{\sum {{{\rm{r}}}}{{CO}}_{2,{{{\rm{i}}}}}}$$

(5)

Assuming that only the most efficient aircraft were operated on all city pairs served by more than one carrier, emissions would be 10.66% lower than current emissions (517 Mt CO₂, rather than 578 Mt CO₂). This is the lower theoretical threshold for emission reductions based on observed operational efficiency.

Theoretical maximum efficiency. There are three ways to increase the efficiency of air transport: using only the most efficient aircraft, switching to one flight class (economy); and increasing load factors. The maximum efficiency for the year 2023 can be calculated in three steps.

Step 1: Global fleet of most efficient aircraft models. The effect of replacing the entire 2023 fleet with the two most efficient models - the Boeing 787-9 (55.4 g CO₂ per RPK) and the Airbus A321neo (61.4 g CO₂ per RPK) would lead to emission reductions in the range of 26.6% (all Airbus) to 33.7% (all Boeing), compared to the current fleet average of 83.6 g CO₂ per RPK, with (Eq. (6)):

Iavg = average CO₂ intensity (gCO₂ per RPK)

Iopt = CO₂ intensity of the Boeing 787‑9 (gCO₂ per RPK)

S = relative savings

$$S=1-\frac{{I}_{{{\rm{opt}}}}}{{I}_{{{\rm{avg}}}}}$$

(6)

Step 2: Economy class only configuration. To determine the difference between an air transport system consisting only very efficient aircraft models, we calculate frequency weighted averages for average seat numbers in economy, business, and first class for the five configurations of the most efficient aircraft models (A350-1000; A350-900; Boeing 787-1000; Boeing 787-800; and Boeing 787-900). As Table 1 illustrates, first class seating is uncommon in these aircraft, partially explaining their efficiency.

The difference in space use between all-economy vs. business and first class aircraft layout can be calculated using current economy to business to first ratios, with each first class seat equalling 5 economy seats, and every business class seat 4 economy class seats21. The percentage increase in seat numbers can be calculated based on data from Official Airline Guide (OAG) and FleetsAnalyzer (FA) for models A350 and B787, which represent the range of most efficient aircraft. In contrast to FA, OAG does not distinguish economy and economy-premium class; this might explain some of the difference in observed maximum seat numbers. OAG data refers to the 2023 flight schedule that lists the actual cabin layout for every flight; FA data considers actual aircraft configurations in fleets of various airlines (2023 data).

Table 1 shows the observed maximum seat number for the different models for both databases, and the average seat numbers for each model. The theoretical maximum number of seats can be calculated based on the following formula (Eq. (7)):

$${S}_{\max }={S}_{{{\rm{eco}}}}+1.5\cdot {S}_{{{\rm{prem.eco}}}}+4\cdot {S}_{{{\rm{bus}}}}+5\cdot {S}_{{{\rm{first}}}}$$

(7)

where S is the number of seats per class, and the factors are the IATA seat class factors, and economy (eco), premium-economy (prem.eco), business (bus) and first (first).

The increase in seat numbers in an all-economy layout is then determined based on an “assumed maximum”, representing either the calculated theoretical maximum seat number or the certified maximum seat number (whichever is lower). Certified maximums refer to type certification that are based on emergency evacuation demands13. This means that the number of seats in the Airbus A350-1000 is capped at 440, and at 420 seats for Boeing 787-1000 and 787-900.

Results suggest that an all-economy layout would allow airlines to carry 26% to 57% more passengers, which is equivalent to the theoretical reduction in fuel use of an all-economy layout.

Step 3: 95% load factor. Limiting capacity growth in global air transport will lead to higher load factors. In particular low-cost carriers have reported load factors of up to 94%44. Here we assume a hypothetical maximum load factor of 95% that would reflect on an air transport system with considerably reduced capacity25. Given the current load factor of 78.9%, aircraft could carry 16.1% more passengers if available capacity was utilized at 95%.

Fuel penalty. Calculations in Step 2 and 3 do not consider that optimization for efficiency will incur a fuel penalty due to the additional weight carried. Analysis for the two aircraft models characterizing the range of layout gains, i.e., A350-1000 and Boeing 787-800 (26.1–56.7% more seats), suggests that this fuel penalty is small. This is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the A350-1000: depending on distance, fuel consumption increases by 5.8% to 13.9%, implying a small fuel-penalty even in comparison of a near-empty (20% load factor) to a close to full (80% load factor) aircraft. We conclude that increasing seat numbers or load factor will marginally increase fuel use. The potential reduction in fuel consumption in an optimized air transport system is thus in the range of −55% to −75%, not considering the fuel penalty.

CO2 intensity cap model

A CO2 intensity cap model illustrates how much emissions from global aviation would fall if flights were required to operate at a mandated maximum CO2 intensity. However, considering such a cap as constant is largely unrealistic as it is strongly dependent on flight distance and load factors. Ignoring changes to load factors or flight distance, we isolate the variation independent of those. Other scenarios investigate increasing load factors (in exchange for fewer aircraft, see above).

The CO2 intensity c is therefore modelled as a function of load factor l and flight distance d, linear in both predictors (Eq. (8)):

$$c\,=\,\frac{a}{l\,+\,{l}_{0}}\,+\,\frac{b}{d\,+\,{d}_{0}}$$

(8)

Inverse proportionality is assumed as increasing load decreases the intensity, so does a longer flight (larger aircraft, less resistance at higher altitude, smaller contribution of fuel-intensive takeoff). This model is fit via least-squares, estimating the constants to (rounded) a = 54 g CO2 per RPK, b = 35,000 g CO2 per pax, d0 = 180 km. The offset in load factor l0 is manually set to 0.01 to prevent intensities going to infinity for very low load factors which is not well constrained with the data given how few flights operate that empty. This model is considered to be the medium cap model representing an average intensity. The low clow and high cap model chigh are defined as clow = 4c/3, chigh = 2c/3, representing 33.3% lower/higher efficiency, respectively. Theoretically, for very long flight distances fuel consumption increases due to the additional weight of large amounts of fuel. This motivates to add a term proportional to distance d, which however, does not yield a positive proportionality constant, contradicting this theory with data. In that sense, higher intensities for very long flight distances are not supported with the data here.

Limitations

Findings are characterized by the following limitations: Our data comprises only a share of global commercial passenger air transport (83% of RPK and 82% of passengers in comparison to ICAO42,43). It is unclear how the difference affects the representativeness of our findings for commercial passenger air transport. We also acknowledge that ICAO’s distance correction is crude, as the ratio of actual flight distance to great-circle distance depends on multiple factors such as weather, airspace restrictions, or airport congestion. Load factors are calculated based on three levels of granularity, and a fallback option that is the global average. Analysis suggests that the error affects in particular small, remote, or politically isolated territories (Nauru, St. Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna, Bhutan, or Greenland), countries where reporting is more limited (China, Russian Federation, India), or specific airlines and airline subsidiaries (e.g., Sichuan Airlines, TUI Airways Ltd., Interglobe Aviation Ltd.). Last, our proposed strategies to increase efficiencies in global aviation will in practice be met with various economic and political challenges. Airlines operate within economic constraints and a business environment shaped by subsidies, limited ambition for climate change mitigation, and expectations of continued growth. Efforts to enhance air transport efficiency will have to be addressed within this multifaceted context.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-03069-4/MediaObjects/43247_2025_3069_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2026-01-07 07:57:45.759056

While 2025 was defined by the rollout of binding mandates in Europe, 2026 is shaping up as a test of the industry's ability to scale supply amid divergent policy frameworks and intensifying competition for feedstocks.

The targeted takeoff is hitting a tangible ceiling of a feedstock bottleneck that threatens to ground 2030 ambitions.

With binding obligations now clashing against a supply chain still dependent on limited waste oil pools, 2026 becomes a stress test for the sector's ability to convert policy targets into physical gallons.

Mandates create market

Singapore, with other emerging Asia mandates and ReFuelEU requirement (2025-2029), lock in cross-continental demand, reinforced by the UK's carbon-intensity framework that will continue anchoring non-negotiable demand signals.

Market participants interviewed by Platts, part of S&P Global Energy, expect global SAF production and consumption to remain broadly balanced in 2026, with no material supply-demand mismatches and prices to stabilize, barring major feedstock disruptions.

""Assuming no new legislation is introduced, there should not be a significant gap between SAF uplift and production in 2026. Prices should remain at current levels or trend lower over the year,"" an Asia-based biofuels trader said.

Global SAF consumption is projected at 2.47 million metric tons for 2026, closely matched by production of approximately 2.54 million mt, according to S&P Global Energy Horizons.

However, supply responses are increasingly from Asia.

""APAC [Asia-Pacific] is pivoting from feedstock exporter to SAF producer,"" said LT Leong, president at NGen Energy. ""2026 marks infrastructure catch-up to meet mandate-driven demand, with smaller 50,000-120,000 mt refineries popping in Southeast Asia for 2028-2029 startup.""

Financial realism

The market isn't just dealing with physical fuel, but with the credit risks associated with high transition costs.

Aviation finance intelligence firm Ishka mentioned that financial stakeholders have factored SAF costs into their credit models.

""Lessors and lenders factor SAF-related cost burdens into assessments,"" Ishka said, adding that for European carriers, ""Lower ATF prices in 2025 have absorbed ETS and SAF compliance cost increases,"" though this cushion might vanish as mandates tighten and carbon allowance phase-outs accelerate.

Feedstock, HEFA stifle as Asia exports emerge

China's 1.2 million mt export whitelist positions Asia-Pacific as the critical swing supplier for 2026, with Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia ramping hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids capacity. However, feedstock constraints threaten to bottleneck these mega-refineries despite projects coming online through 2026-2028.

Combined UCO from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand cannot sustain a single 620,000 mt like Phoenix mega-refinery, LT said. ""This constraint pushes toward smaller 50,000-120,000 mt facilities securing adequate feedstock per month locally without overextending. Start small and manageable.""

With over 80% announced SAF projects relying on HEFA while supply covers near-term mandates, constraints on aforementioned feedstocks suggest that progress toward 2030 ambitions require rapid diversification.

Thailand and Malaysia's HEFA capacity ramp-up will further boost Asia SAF supply in 2026, aiding EU compliance while intensifying UCO competition.

Asian UCO and PFAD hit three-year highs in 2025, fueled by regional (Indonesia-China) export restriction. Regional tensions over feedstock definitions persist, as Europe restricts POME which Asian producers consider essential resources.

Policy-induced pause

The US SAF market is facing a set of contrasting headwinds.

Supply in 2026 is forecast at 11,600 b/d against demand of 11,800 b/d, down from 13,900 b/d in 2025, according to S&P Global Energy analysts reflecting no federal mandate, RFS feedstock competition, and 45Z credit restrictions under ""One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.""

The July 2025 legislation limits eligible feedstocks to North American sources, removes the $1.75/gal advanced credit, and excludes ILUC from carbon scoring.

The production is projected to rebound to 16,200 b/d in 2027 on a $1/gal incentive for fuels achieving 50% GHG reduction, supported by the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, according to S&P Global Energy's analyst.

EU antidumping duties have stifled transatlantic trade. US Customs recorded zero SAF exports in November 2025; however, policy clarity and new capacity are expected to restore flows by 2027.

Data centers compete for renewable energy, constraining SAF inputs. IATA projects SAF at just 0.8% of 2026 fuel consumption (2.4 million mt) with a $4.5 billion incremental cost, exposing policy fragmentation.

Bridging green premium via Scope 3 and registries

The ""Green Premium"" with SAF prices three to five times higher than jet fuel remains aviation's most formidable barrier. In 2025, IATA estimated the industry absorbed $3.6 billion in SAF premiums.

While mandates drive volume, airline appetite for long-term price exposure is cooling, as average offtake durations have plummeted from 3.7 years in 2023 to just 2.2 years in 2025, Ishka said as carriers pivot toward short-term compliance over long-term hedging in a volatile market.

For European carriers, SAF costs are increasingly assessed within a broader environmental cost stack, often overshadowed by rising EU ETS expenses. ""For many European airlines, EU ETS costs now exceed SAF costs, so they are viewed as a combined environmental cost,"" Ishka said.

""Airlines will reevaluate 10% SAF by 2030 commitments as production falls short,"" said Willie Walsh, director general of IATA.

Corporate Scope 3 targets fuel SAF certificate demand through book-and-claim systems, enabling a London flight to claim decarbonization from Los Angeles-pumped SAF.

Companies offset travel emissions by purchasing certificates, subsidizing the green premium.

The market migrates from bilateral deals to centralized registries, bridging price gaps where policy incentives falter.

IATA's SAF Registry, operated by CADO, tracks global transactions and signaled a critical shift toward centralized tracking and standardization, aiming to prevent double-counting while building investor confidence.

Fragmentation between CORSIA and regional initiatives raises costs and curtails emissions reductions; airlines remain committed to net zero, but policymakers must harmonize global energy transition frameworks, said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA SVP Sustainability and Chief Economist.

Though challenges around credibility, double-counting, and regulatory recognition persist.

SAF enters 2026 at a maturation crossroads: balanced fundamentals provide stability, but feedstock constraints demand the urgent deployment of ATJ, FT, and e-SAF, capable of sustainable scaling beyond 2030. Coordinated policy, corporate commitments, and infrastructure investment must unlock diverse feedstock streams, including residues, CO2, and hydrogen.

Regulatory and investment decisions made this year will determine whether SAF's takeoff trajectory continues or stalls at current cruise altitude, market participants said.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-07 07:57:50.778645

In 2025, the company advanced several key levers of its sustainability strategy, from scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to electrifying last‑mile delivery and building solar‑powered infrastructure. These achievements mark meaningful progress toward DHL’s goal of net‑zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and reinforce its role in building more sustainable, efficient, and resilient global trade. Here are five milestones that defined this progress.=

Advancing sustainable aviation: Largest SAF agreement in the U.S.

Air freight remains the most carbon-intensive mode of transport per ton-kilometre, and DHL has been a pioneer in adopting SAF since 2021. In 2025, DHL signed one of its largest-ever SAF agreements with Phillips 66: over 240,000 metric tons (approximately 314 million liters) of SAF over three years. This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e – about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL’s West Coast operations.

Cutting emissions at sea: Partnership with CMA CGM

Ocean freight moves most global goods, making sustainable marine fuel (SMF) critical for reducing emissions. DHL and CMA CGM partnered to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO₂e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions). That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport.

Hydrogen on the horizon: First pilot in the Middle East

Hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonising long-haul logistics, providing a longer range than electric trucks. DHL has been actively testing hydrogen trucks in Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific, and will now introduce them in the Middle East. Last year, DHL signed an MoU with Hyperview in Saudi Arabia to pilot hydrogen-powered trucks. The project aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 and includes a feasibility study for hydrogen infrastructure, reinforcing DHL’s commitment to reducing logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions in emerging markets.

Fully electric delivery across Germany

DHL aims to electrify 66% of its last-mile fleet – the final step of getting a shipment to the end customer – by 2030, with Germany leading the charge. In 2025, the company announced one of its largest electric‑vehicle purchases: 2,400 new Ford electric vans for its Post & Parcel Germany division, the majority of which have already been delivered and are in operation. This milestone means that one-third of all German postcodes will benefit from zero-GHG-emission last-mile delivery, powered by a fleet of more than 35,000 electric vehicles, including e-trikes, e-vans, and e-bikes.",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/favicon.png,N,,2026-01-07 04:57:06.124781

The Department for Transport stressed that the consultation does not propose any immediate changes to the SAF Mandate.","The U.K. Department for Transport has indicated it may be reconsidering its position on the use of crop-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), opening the door for possible changes to the country’s SAF Mandate in the future. In late 2025, the department launched a public consultation process to gather evidence on whether fuels made from crops should be allowed under the mandate, reports Biodiesel Magazine.

On December 22, the department invited comments on SAF produced from crops, including energy crops, cover crops, and food and feed crops. The call for evidence is linked to the U.K.’s main SAF policy measures, which include the SAF Mandate that came into force in 2025, the Advanced Fuels Fund that supports early-stage SAF projects, and a revenue certainty scheme aimed at reducing financial risk for developers.

In announcing the consultation, the Department for Transport said the SAF Mandate provides long-term certainty by creating a legal framework that guarantees demand for SAF in the U.K. This, it said, helps businesses plan investments, build supply chains and make confident commercial decisions. The government added that any future changes to the mandate would only be considered if there is a strong justification and if such changes do not undermine policy stability or investor confidence.

The government said the SAF sector is expanding rapidly, and policy will need to ensure that the mandate delivers real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while keeping costs manageable for consumers. It also said the mandate must align with the U.K.’s wider climate targets, work effectively with other low-carbon fuel schemes, support domestic production and adapt to technological progress.

As part of this process, the government is seeking evidence on the availability and cost of crop-based SAF feedstocks, the impact of such fuels on U.K. industries, and potential sustainability risks. It is also asking how regulation could address or reduce those risks.

Under the current SAF Mandate, fuel suppliers must meet two obligations: a main SAF requirement and a separate requirement for power-to-liquid fuels. The main obligation started at 2% of total fossil jet fuel supplied in 2025 and is set to rise to 9.5% by 2030 and 18.5% by 2040. The power-to-liquid requirement begins at 0.2% in 2028 and increases to 3.5% by 2040.

The mandate also places limits on the use of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). HEFA fuels can meet the full obligation in 2025 and 2026, but their share will be capped at 71% in 2030 and reduced further to 35% by 2040.

At present, the SAF Mandate only allows fuels made from sustainable wastes and residues, recycled carbon sources such as non-recyclable plastics, or power-to-liquid fuels produced using low-carbon energy. SAF made from crops, including food, feed, energy and cover crops, is currently excluded.

All SAF used under the mandate must deliver at least a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Additional sustainability rules apply to certain feedstocks, covering issues such as biodiversity protection, land use, soil carbon and waste management.

While the exclusion of crop-based SAF remains in place, the government said it is open to reviewing new or updated evidence. The current call for evidence is intended to assess the possible benefits, risks and trade-offs of using crops for SAF production.

The Department for Transport stressed that the consultation does not propose any immediate changes to the SAF Mandate. It said that if the evidence supports a review of feedstock rules, any changes would be subject to a formal consultation and would require amendments to existing legislation.

The consultation mainly focuses on energy crops, cover crops and food and feed crops, but the government has also invited comments on other types of crops not clearly covered by these categories.

The call for evidence opened on December 22, 2025, and will remain open until March 16, 2026. Further details are available on the Department for Transport’s website.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-1.png,N,,2026-01-07 07:58:05.799002

(Tank Terminals) Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) has commissioned a demonstration plant for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at its Visakh Refinery, marking a significant milestone in India’s clean aviation journey. The facility will manufacture SAF by co-processing used cooking oil (UCO) in the refinery’s Full Conversion Hydrocracker Unit, making use of existing infrastructure.

Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday that the initiative moves India closer to achieving its SAF blending goals of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030. He noted that the project reflects the country’s steady progress towards cleaner and more sustainable aviation fuels under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

According to HPCL’s roadmap, following CORSIA certification, the Visakh Refinery is expected to produce around 10 thousand metric tonnes (TMT) of SAF annually from January 2027. The production will contribute to India’s efforts to decarbonise the aviation sector while advancing a circular, waste-to-wealth economy.

The initiative is expected to enhance India’s energy self-reliance, align domestic fuel production with global CORSIA standards, and support the country’s Net-Zero emissions commitments.

Or, at least, it was one of the best arguments until about 2009. Since then, at least for developed economies, the reverse has been true: higher growth is now associated with reduced carbon emissions. For a Labour government that is “obsessed” with growth, but has also set itself strict climate targets, this is surely welcome news.

To address a potential objection head-on, the reductions in emissions among advanced economies are not because of “outsourcing” carbon-intensive production to poorer countries. The graphs below include “consumption-based” emissions, shown by the light greyline in each, which have also fallen relatively consistently, even as GDP per capita has increased.

The general story is a hill-shaped curve: as poor countries industrialise and move away from agrarian economies, GDP emissions per capita rise rapidly. But as developed economies grow, per capita emissions begin to fall again. We can track this pathway for several countries at different stages of the journey. China and India’s per capita emissions continue to rise, but their trajectories do not look so different to those of Britain, France and Germany 100-150 years ago.

Why do richer countries experience this reduction in emissions? There are several reasons, but the underlying story is that richer states can invest their wealth in decarbonisation. They can afford to move away from fossil fuels towards greener alternatives, such as wind and solar, and electrify more of the economy. This decarbonisation is not necessarily altruistic: many greener technologies, from nuclear to high-speed rail, are more efficient in the long run, but require more upfront investment. Green technologies are also often better for air quality and public health, and can reduce geopolitical dependence on the Middle East (for oil) and Russia (for gas). Advanced economies also tend to have better regulations, including clean air laws; incentives to encourage decarbonisation (like emissions trading) and discourage waste; better management of demand; more recycling; and more efficient transport and appliances.

A similar story holds at a household level. In any economy, as a poor family becomes richer, their carbon emissions tend to increase: they may buy a second car or heat a larger home, fly more, and eat things like carbon-intensive steak. But as medium-income households become richer, their emissions can plateau and even fall. They might insulate their homes or buy energy-efficient appliances, reducing energy consumption. They may move away from fossil fuels altogether by switching to electric cars, heat pumps and solar panels –which are largely the preserve of wealthier consumers, at least in western countries. In fact, in Britain, wealthier households are more likely to take the train and cycle, and rely less on cars to get around.

Globally, the most notable trend towards decarbonisation has been in electricity generation. In this respect, the UK is a leader: coal use for electricity has fallen to zero, and gas is gradually being replaced by wind and solar. Even if Ed Miliband does not hit his goal of clean power by 2030, UK electricity use is already mostly from non-fossil fuel sources. The main challenge now is moving more consumption onto the grid – switching from petrol to electric cars, and gas boilers to heat pumps. Perhaps counterintuitively, increased electricity demand at the right times (i.e. not during winter peaks) can reduce the cost of electricity per unit, since it means that there is more revenue to cover large transmission and other fixed costs. The cost of renewables, at the margin and at the right times, is small: we should make the most of this.

Germany and the US, while more reliant on fossil fuels, have seen similar reductions. China, despite investing heavily in renewables, is still dependent on coal, as is India, which has a more typical ‘energy mix’ for an industrialising country. France, which made a savvy early bet on nuclear, has had a close to carbon-free grid for decades. The point here is not to shame emerging economies: they are following the exact same fossil use path as the UK, US and most of Europe during our periods of industrialisation. Indeed, wealthy western countries are far more to blame for the climate crisis than non-western emerging or middle-income countries. The point is that for wealthy countries like the UK, growth is not only negatively correlated with carbon emissions, but may be actively helpful for decarbonisation. It would be a mistake to claim that the solution for climate change is for wealthy, western countries to grow less, as is advocated by some ‘degrowths’, and indeed many more mainstream progressives.

To make this more concrete, consider the biggest barriers to reducing emissions in Britain. Two of the biggest sources are domestic transport – i.e. petrol cars – and “buildings and product uses,” which mainly refers togas-based heating of buildings. In both cases, we already have the technology to go green. Electric cars not only exist, but are in many ways a superior product to petrol cars – they’re quieter, accelerate quicker and, in the long run, can cost less to run. Similarly, heat pumps could entirely replace gas boilers, with the bonus that they can provide air cooling in the summer as well as heating in the winter.

But in both cases, the biggest barrier to EV and heat pump adoption in Britain is cost. Households struggle to cover the upfront cost of buying an electric car or heat pump, even though running costs for both can be low. The British state does not have enough fiscal headroom to subsidise EVs and heat pumps, or invest in the infrastructure for charging points across the country. With a couple of exceptions, the countries with the highest EV adoption in Europe tend to be the wealthiest: places like Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland have far higher adoption than Italy, Spain and Greece. Likewise, it is the wealthiest households that are most able to pay for a heat pump, or install solar panels on their homes.

Wealthier countries with greater state capacity can also invest in greener infrastructure across the board. Investment might be in production (subsidising nuclear or wind farms, for instance); grid connections and transmission; adoption of technologies such as EVs and heat pumps; or better demand management (i.e., using insulation, batteries, smart meters and incentives to balance the grid).

Growth can also change our lifestyles in ways that reduce emissions. Investing in bicycle lanes, trains, trams and metros can transform our cities by reducing car dependence. The housing policies which are best for growth – such as residential annexes, street votes, and resident-led estate renewal – tend to be good for reducing emissions too, because they focus on densifying urban areas, which encourages walking and public transport over car use. Densification tends to mean more homes taking up less land, using less energy, and connecting workers to higher productivity jobs and delivering a high-quality of life. Sprawl is the enemy of both growth and conservation.

Then there are more speculative, innovative ways in which growth can help the green transition. As an economy grows, so does the amount spent on research into green technologies. A breakthrough in nuclear fusion, sustainable aviation fuel or next generation geothermal energy could be transformative for helping countries go green – and speed up the transition in developing economies, too. New research could even reduce the carbon impact of agriculture if we find better alternatives to meat.

All this means that there need be no conflict between tackling climate change and the pro-growth, “build baby build” agenda that has been embraced and espoused by this government – so long as we build in the right ways. This should be good news for everyone – eco-warriors and ‘yimbys’ alike. But taking advantage of this alignment of interests will require change from both sides of the debate.

Those of us who care about growth should stop framing it as being in conflict with environmental objectives. Environmentalists, for their part, should welcome higher GDP, and focus their efforts on ensuring this GDP is “spent” on decarbonisation. In particular, environmental groups should welcome several pro-growth planning reforms, such as those that encourage densification, which reduces urban sprawl and increases average home efficiency. They should also support making it easier to build renewable energy, nuclear, grid connections, transmission and public transport – the infrastructure of modern, green economies.

It will always be tempting for politicians to have a fight. Sometimes, it’s helpful to have an enemy –whether it’s “builders versus blockers”, or the bats and newts that increased costs for HS2. But true leadership means identifying win-wins: policies that can command broad, durable support. When it comes to growth and climate action, a free lunch is on the table: we just need to grasp it.

The agency is gathering stakeholder input that could provide a pathway to open the country’s SAF Mandate program to crop-based biofuels.

The U.K. Department for Transport on Dec. 22 opened a call for evidence seeking public comments on crop-derived SAF, including SAF produced from energy crops, cover crops, and food and feed crops.

The comment period is related to the U.K.’s primary SAF initiatives, which include a SAF Mandate that came into effect in 2025; the Advanced Fuels Fund, which provides support for first-of-a-kind SAF projects; and a revenue certainty scheme designed to help de-risk “SAF projects.

“The SAF Mandate provides certainty to industry by setting a legal framework that establishes the demand for SAF in the U.K.,” the U.K. Department for Transport said in a document announcing the public comment period. “This certainty facilitates an environment in which commercial decisions can be made confidently, supply chains are developed, and investment is attracted into the sector. Government is committed to maintaining that certainty and confidence and will not propose changes unless a) there is a strong rationale and b) such changes can be made that are consistent with wider government objectives, in a way that maintains policy stability and investor confidence.”

According to the U.K. government, the SAF industry is undergoing rapid expansion. As the SAF market developments, the government will need to ensure the SAF Mandate delivers genuine greenhouse gas (GHG) savings while minimizing cost impacts for consumers; aligns with the U.K.’s overall process toward future carbon budgets; interacts effectively with other low carbon fuel support mechanisms; facilitate the development of domestic production; and keeps up with technical developments while proving the certainty needed to create an attractive investment environment.

The effort to gather public input on the use of crops in SAF production is part of the government’s effort to meet those goals, focusing on “feedstock availability and cost of crop-derived SAF production, the impacts of crop-derived SAF production on U.K. industry, and sustainability risks and how regulation may be able to mitigate against these.”

The U.K.’s SAF Mandate is divided into two main parts—the main obligation and a power-to-liquids obligation. For 2025, the main obligation was set at 2% of total fossil jet fuel supplied. The mandate increases annually to 9.5% in 2030 and 18.5% in 2040. The power-to-liquid obligation begins at 0.2% in 2028 and expands to 3.5% in 2040.

The mandate also includes a cap on the amount of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) that can be used to meet the main obligation. HEFA can bs used to meet 100% of the obligation in 2025 and 2026, falling to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

The U.K.’s SAF Mandate includes strict sustainability criteria, requiring that eligible SAF meet made from sustainable biogenic wastes or residues, such as used cooking oil or rood waste; recycled carbon fuels, such as unrecyclable plastics; or be power-to-liquid fuels made using low carbon energy, such as renewable energy or nuclear power. Currently, SAF produced from crops cannot participate in the mandate. The exclusion includes food, feed, energy or cover crops.

All SAF used to meet the mandate must achieve a 40% GHG reduction. Specific sustainable criteria also apply to certain types of feedstocks, including criteria related to biodiversity, carbon stocks, protected lands, soil carbon, and sustainable waste management.

While crop-based SAF is currently unable to participate in the U.K.’s SAF Mandate, the government is signaling it may be softening its stance on that exclusion by providing stakeholders who have new or improved evidence on crop feedstocks an opportunity to formally submit it to the U.K. Department for Transport. The call for evidence focuses on the potential benefits, risk and trade-offs of using crops in SAF production.

“This call for evidence does not propose any changes to the SAF Mandate,” the government stressed. “In light of the responses to this call for evidence, should there be a case to review the feedstock eligibility criteria, it would be subject to consultation and any changes would require amendments to legislation.

The call for evidence focuses primarily on the energy crops, cover crops and food and feed crops, but the government also indicated it is welcoming comments on crops the respondent does not consider to be covered by those categories.

The call for evidence launched Dec. 22, 2025. Comments can be filed with the U.K. government through March 16.

Welcome to Helicopter Investor’s news round up of stories you may have missed over the festive period. Featuring in our news list are manufacturers, operators and dealers.

Starting with manufacturers, state-owned Indian aerospace and defence company Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) confirmed at the end of last year the maiden flight of its updated Dhruv ‘New Gen’ (NG) helicopter.

Designed and manufactured by HAL, the 5.5t Dhruv NG is a light twin-engine, multi-role helicopter engineered for Indian terrain. Powered by two Shakti 1H1C engines, the helicopter includes a civil-certified glass cockpit (compliant to AS4 requirements), modern avionics and a range of safety features.

The company’s chief MD D K Sunil said: “Dhruv ‘New Gen’ helicopter is the cornerstone of HAL’s civil expansion. The Dhruv Mk 1 Civil platform has already clocked over 24,000 hours and has been specifically upgraded to meet the rigorous demands of the global civil aviation market, marking a milestone in India’s indigenous rotary-wing capability.”

Airbus Helicopters revealed an order for 100 helicopters from the Spanish Ministry of Defence. From that total, and in addition to military deployments, 13 H135 helicopters will be used for light utility missions. A further 50 H145M assets will be used for light utility and disaster relief. Six super-medium H175Ms will be tasked with governmental missions, including the transport of authorities.

The manufacturer also revealed how it is working with French operator SAF (Service Aérien Français) Hélicoptères to promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using book and claim. The partners are promoting the use of SAF with the deployment of two H145 helicopters for emergency medical services (EMS) missions in Catalonia, Spain.

“Under the terms of our service contract with the Catalan Department of Health’s Emergency Medical Services, we provide two H145 helicopters along with the pilots, technical aircrew, line maintenance and training,” explains SAF Hélicoptères co-director, Jean-Louis Camus. “These two helicopters support two hospital bases, which in turn supply the medical teams.”

Bell Textron announced the delivery of a second Bell 505 to the Fort Worth Police Department. Bell’s partnership with the city of Fort Worth dates back almost 75 years. “All of us at Bell value our long-standing relationships with the city of Fort Worth and the Fort Worth Police Department, and we are proud to be a partner in supporting the city’s public safety initiatives and advancing the department’s impact with this added capability,” said Danny Maldonado, chief commercial officer and incoming Bell CEO. “Nearly 75 years after Bell’s move to Fort Worth, this city remains home for us, and we look forward to seeing this new aircraft serve the citizens of Fort Worth.”

Leonardo Helicopters successfully completed the maiden flight of its Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor (NGCTR) technology demonstrator at the company’s Cascina Costa facility in northern Italy towards the end of last month.

Based the manufacturer’s AW609 tiltrotor, the new aircraft is planned as a airborne laboratory rather than the forerunner of a production aircraft.

Logistics firm B&H Worldwide revealed its role in transporting two new Airbus H145 rescue helicopters to New Zealand. The aircraft will supporting the fleet renewal programme of the Canterbury West Coast Air Rescue Trust and GCH Aviation.

When fully commissioned, the helicopters will support emergency medical, accident response, inter-hospital transfer and search-and-rescue missions across the Canterbury, West Coast, Nelson and Marlborough regions, where rescue helicopters respond to more than 1,700 missions each year.

Christine Prince, CEO, Canterbury West Coast Air Rescue Trust, said: “Bringing these helicopters into service has been an enormous undertaking, but our communities deserve a world-class rescue helicopter service. These new aircraft will significantly enhance the care and support we can provide to people in their most critical moments.”

Rotortrade, the helicopter dealer, MRO and finance firm revealed its plan to open a new maintenance, sales and services hub in Riyadh named the Rotortrade Helipark. The facility will span 6,000sqm over three floors, with multiple helipads, sales display areas, a premium hospitality zone and a fully integrated service centre for Airbus and Leonardo services.

“The Rotortrade Helipark represents our long-term commitment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the wider GCC [Gulf Co-operation Council] region,” said Philippe Lubrano, founder and CEO of Rotortrade. “It is more than just a facility – it is a destination. Clients will be able to explore our aircraft, enjoy premium hospitality, and access comprehensive end-to-end services under one roof. This project reflects our ambition to establish Rotortrade as the world’s leading global helicopter dealership and provides a unique value proposition not seen anywhere else in the rotorcraft industry.”

AerCap, the aviation leasing company and owner of Milestone, confirmed this week it had signed 122 lease agreements during the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2025. This included 22 agreements for helicopters and 36 for engines. (The balance was accounted for by wide- and narrow-body jets).

Hyderabad, India, Jan. 06, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to Mordor Intelligence, the renewable diesel market is valued to rise from USD 33.91 billion in 2025 to USD 50.26 billion by 2030, expanding at a CAGR of 8.19%. Once viewed as a niche biofuel, renewable diesel is now emerging as a practical replacement for conventional diesel, especially in long-haul transport, marine operations, and backup power systems due to its drop-in usability.

Policy incentives such as California’s LCFS and Europe’s RED III continue to support profitability, while low-cost refinery upgrades are speeding up capacity growth. Demand from sustainable aviation fuel production and large data-center generators is further strengthening market resilience, even as electrification advances in parallel.

Emerging Trends and Developments

Backup Power for Digital Infrastructure Gains Traction

Data centers are emerging as a new demand segment as operators seek cleaner options for backup generation. Renewable diesel is being used in large-scale generators with minimal impact on reliability, helping operators meet environmental commitments. This diversification beyond transportation adds resilience and higher-value opportunities to the overall market.

Seamless Use Across Existing Diesel Systems

Renewable diesel closely resembles conventional diesel, allowing it to move through current pipelines, storage, and engines without modifications or blending limits. This makes adoption simple for fleet operators, who can avoid infrastructure upgrades while maintaining reliable performance, even in cold climates. Its sulfur-free nature also helps marine operators comply with emission norms without additional equipment, strengthening its position against fuels that require entirely new distribution networks.

Rising Use in Heavy-Duty Transport

For sectors where electrification remains challenging, renewable diesel offers an immediate pathway to lower emissions without sacrificing range or performance. Trucking, construction, and off-road fleets are increasingly adopting it as a practical solution, benefiting smoother operations and reduced maintenance concerns while progressing toward sustainability goals.

Regional Overview

North America continues to lead in revenue share, supported by long-standing low-carbon fuel incentives, ample agricultural inputs, and fast uptake among heavy-duty fleet operators. At the same time, aggressive capacity additions have sparked discussions around potential oversupply, encouraging producers to explore export routes. Competition for limited waste-based feedstocks between the United States and Canada remains a key vulnerability for the region.

Europe stands out as the fastest-moving market, powered by stricter transport decarbonization rules and rising sustainable aviation fuel mandates. Several countries are expanding advanced biorefineries that integrate with existing industrial hubs to improve efficiency. While alternative feedstocks from forestry residues help ease pressure, the region is increasingly reliant on imports, prompting closer scrutiny of supply traceability.

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Alto Ingredients ALTO has experienced a sustained decline in sales over the past several years, primarily due to lower average sales prices per gallon and reduced volumes of essential ingredients sold. Weak oil and gasoline prices have put pressure on ethanol pricing, while lower alcohol production and reduced corn prices have led to fewer tons of essential ingredients being marketed.

As a commodity-linked business, ALTO’s revenues remain highly sensitive to ethanol price movements, corn input costs and demand from fuel blenders and industrial end markets. Sales declines have been evident across all major segments, including the Pekin Campus, Marketing and Distribution, and Western Production operations.

Alto has idled or exited underperforming facilities and low-margin contracts to preserve liquidity and stabilize profitability, resulting in revenue contraction.

Despite ongoing top-line pressure, Alto’s turnaround strategy is encouraging. It has expanded beyond commodity ethanol into higher-value specialty alcohols and essential ingredients serving pharmaceutical, personal care, food, and industrial markets. This is intended to reduce earnings volatility and lessen dependence on fuel ethanol pricing. Alto is expanding carbon dioxide capture and utilization at its Pekin and Columbia facilities, building on the Carbonic acquisition. Monetizing fermentation-derived CO2 provides an incremental, higher-margin revenue stream aligned with sustainability initiatives.

Alto continues to streamline its cost structure, exit unprofitable activities and prioritize capital investments with near-term visibility. Although sales are expected to decline in 2025, a turnaround is expected this year.

What About Its Peers?

Green Plains Inc. GPRE has experienced uneven sales due to fluctuating ethanol prices, shifting fuel demand and commodity volatility. Green Plains is reshaping its business mix toward higher-margin protein and renewable ingredients, which has weighed on short-term sales but is expected to improve stability. Green Plains aims to reduce exposure to ethanol cyclicality through diversification.

Gevo, Inc. GEVO continues to generate modest sales as it advances renewable fuel and sustainable aviation fuel projects. Gevo’s revenues remain limited by development timelines and delayed offtake ramp-ups, reflecting its early-stage model. Nonetheless, Gevo expects sales growth as projects reach commercialization.

ALTO’s Price Performance

Alto Ingredients has gained 45.4% in a year, outperforming the industry, sector as well as the Zacks S&P 500 composite.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released updated estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, highlighting challenges in scaling the industry. In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024. Growth is projected to slow in 2026, reaching 2.4 million tonnes. Despite this increase, SAF will account for only 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8 per cent in 2026. At current prices, the SAF premium will add approximately USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

The downward revision from earlier forecasts reflects insufficient policy support to fully utilise installed SAF capacities. SAF costs exceed conventional jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption. In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have raised profit margins so that airlines pay up to five times the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation. In the UK, SAF mandates have also triggered price spikes, forcing airlines to absorb significant costs. In total, airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 million tonnes of SAF available in 2025.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognise that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The shortfall in SAF supply will force many airlines to review their 2030 SAF commitments. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2026-01-07 06:12:34.755443

“It was up to him to make sure (the medical school) got started and started well,” she said.
WSU and the only other remaining Pac-12 member, Oregon State University, recruited seven new members to join conference athletic play in the 2026-27 season.
That brought Elizabeth Cantwell, formerly of Utah State University, to Pullman.
She’s excited to watch and cheer on WSU, and the Tri-Cities campus, only this time from the sidelines.","For the first time in more than 20 years, Lura Powell doesn’t have an official meeting to attend.

The retired federal civil servant and former director of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has served on various boards and commissions since moving to the Tri-Cities to join PNNL.

“It’s been constant,” said Powell, who wrapped up her last major commitment when her nearly 12-year tenure on the Washington State University Board of Regents came to an end this past fall.

“I just felt when my term was up, I was going to leave.”

Her time as a regent was never without excitement. From helping to establish WSU’s medical school in Spokane to helping to hire two new university presidents, Powell said she’s seen a lot change in the WSU system and at the Tri-Cities campus specifically, with more likely to come.

“I am very encouraged and bullish about the future of our campus here,” said Powell, who was named the 2023 Tri-Citian of the Year.

Powell hails from Maryland and worked in the federal government before moving west.

She was director of the Advanced Technology Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce, where she oversaw a high-risk technology investment portfolio.

She also chaired the Biotechnology Research Committee of the National Science and Technology Council, which coordinated biotechnology research across the federal government.

Wanting a change, she accepted the PNNL position in Richland, which is operated by Battelle on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy. She oversaw the region’s largest employer from 2000-03.

After PNNL, she wasn’t idle long. Former Gov. Christine Gregoire named her the first chair of the state’s Life Sciences Discovery Fund Authority in 2006. That was followed by her leading the state’s redistricting commission in 2011 to redraw Washington’s legislative and congressional districts to match the latest census data.

Then, in 2014, former Gov. Jay Inslee appointed Powell as a WSU regent, replacing another prominent Tri-Citian, attorney Fran Forgette.

Then-WSU President Elson S. Floyd didn’t waste any time in tapping Powell for a crucial initiative for the university system.

“I was driving back from regent training when President Floyd called and asked me to be on a commission to discuss medical education in Spokane,” Powell said.

Floyd had been pushing to establish a medical school for WSU as the state faced a doctor shortage, with the University of Washington the only university with a medical school in the state at the time.

Powell and the other regents determined WSU was in a solid position to operate its own medical school, helping to convince the state Legislature to amend the state law in 2015 to allow its formation. Only months later, Floyd died of complications of colon cancer.

“It was a heavy lift to get that medical school, and he just gave it his all,” Powell said.

Powell and her fellow regents also led the committee to search for the late Floyd’s replacement, bringing on then-President Kirk Schulz from Kansas State University.

“It was up to him to make sure (the medical school) got started and started well,” she said. “The results have been fantastic with graduates by and large staying in state,” though, she added, launching such the program put a financial strain on the university.

Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit, creating new challenges for enrollment, retention and funding.

Once the pandemic was largely in the rear view, WSU’s athletic conference, the Pac-12, imploded in 2022 and 2023, putting the university, Schulz and the regents on the defensive. WSU and the only other remaining Pac-12 member, Oregon State University, recruited seven new members to join conference athletic play in the 2026-27 season.

“It’s been challenging but wow what an interesting time,” Powell said. “I never had a chance to be bored.”

Kirk retired in early 2025 and Powell once again was part of the search for WSU’s next president. That brought Elizabeth Cantwell, formerly of Utah State University, to Pullman. Powell praised Cantwell’s deep experience working with national labs, strong communication and organizational skills. All of that is needed right now as the university wrestles with the politicization of higher education and research funding at the national level.

“We have the right person at the right time,” she said.

And while the regents’ top priorities are serving the WSU system as a whole, Powell acknowledged she had the Tri-Cities campus in mind throughout her tenure.

“I took opportunities to educate others about all the things the Tri-Cities is doing,” she said. “And I will say, that under Chancellor (Sandra) Haynes, that campus has just blossomed.”

WSU Tri-Cities has seen enrollment growth the other campuses have not, and it has become a focal point of efforts around energy research such as nuclear and sustainable aviation fuel.

“I think this is our time,” she said.

Powell is hopeful her regent replacement will be another Tri-Citian, but she’s ready to look ahead and happy to have more time to focus on her family and other projects, noting the volume of email she receives has gone down significantly.

She’s excited to watch and cheer on WSU, and the Tri-Cities campus, only this time from the sidelines.

“I wouldn’t have traded it for anything. It was a wonderful experience,” Powell said.",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/2025/12/17/Laura-Powell.jpg?height=635&t=1767378815&width=1200,N,,2026-01-06 17:56:56.281823

The future of agricultural mechanization: Planning, innovation, and financing

The agricultural machinery sector faces a landscape with strong growth potential, driven by the expansion of cultivated areas and an outdated fleet. However, this potential is constrained by high credit costs, international volatility, and reliance on public resources.

In 2024, the sector’s revenue reached BRL 62 billion. The projection for 2025 is BRL 68 billion, representing a 10% increase. Despite this, financing totaled BRL 27.6 billion, with only 36% benefiting from subsidized interest rates, well below the historical average of 60%.

Within this context, the capital markets have taken a leading role. Instruments such as Rural Product Notes (“CPR”), Agribusiness Receivables Certificates (“CRA”), Agribusiness Credit Bills (“LCA”), and Investment Funds in Agribusiness Production Chains (“FIAGRO”) grew by more than 300% between 2022 and 2024, offering an almost unlimited source of funding. The future points to hybrid models, combining subsidized credit and private financing, creating the conditions for innovation and modernization.

To secure the future of agricultural mechanization, the goal is clear: strategic planning must look beyond the next harvest and focus on the coming decades, accelerating the transition to new financing models and guaranteeing global competitiveness.

Third EcoInvest auction offers agribusiness opportunities

At the close of 2025, the third EcoInvest auction was held – a government program that combines public and private capital to boost sustainable projects. This edition mapped approximately 15 segments, with an emphasis on agribusiness chains, such as biofuel production (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel, biogas and biomethane, bioinputs, and biofertilizers).

Financial institutions interested in participating can submit proposals by January 07, 2026.

The major innovation in this edition is EcoInvest’s entry into equity investments, in addition to traditional debt instruments. The goal is to structure investment funds similar to private equity, with allocations distributed over a five-year period. These funds must include at least 15% foreign investors and allocate 20% to early-stage companies (venture capital companies). If this percentage cannot be met, resources may be directed to institutions such as Embrapii and Scientific, Technological, and Innovation Institutions (“ICTs”).

The model establishes that the Brazilian National Treasury will transfer resources to banks at an annual interest rate of 1%. Half of the subsidized amount will remain in the banks’ treasury. These institutions must use part of the spread (the difference between the cost of borrowed funds and their yield) to purchase foreign exchange derivatives, thus offering protection to foreign investors against the appreciation of the Brazilian real over five years. The other half will be allocated to EcoInvest investment funds at an annual cost of 5%, either through proprietary asset managers or partner companies.

These resources will be injected into the fund (either via loans or quota subscription), but will not be used to finance operations. Instead, they must remain invested, and any excess return will serve as a support to attract additional capital. The idea is to establish a first-loss mechanism that mitigates portfolio risk in high-risk projects.

Through this structure, EcoInvest aims to attract private capital and reduce risk, providing opportunities for large sector aggregators and encouraging innovation in agribusiness and environmentally sustainable projects.

BNDES estimates BRL 73.7 billion in sustainable investments following public call on climate

The Brazilian Development Bank (“BNDES”) announced that its public call for climate mitigation initiatives has the potential to attract BRL 73.7 billion in sustainable investments, having received 45 proposals from investment funds.

The initiative seeks to combine public and private resources to accelerate the energy transition and reduce carbon emissions, aligning Brazil with global decarbonization and sustainable development goals.

The proposals request BRL 21 billion in financial support from BNDES and cover initiatives in energy transition, green agriculture, climate infrastructure, reforestation, industrial process decarbonization, and forest conservation. The public call aims to identify projects with high potential for positive environmental impact and economic feasibility, creating a robust pipeline to attract domestic and international investors.

According to BNDES’ chair, the strategy involves structuring five to six funds in which BNDES Participações (“BNDESPAR”) would contribute up to 25% of the funds’ total capital, attracting the remaining resources from the market. “We aim to invest approximately BRL 5 billion and leverage an additional BRL 15 billion from the private sector. The response exceeded expectations: 45 proposals totaling BRL 73.7 billion demonstrate Brazil’s innovation strength and potential to accelerate the green economy,” stated BNDES’ chair.

Beyond environmental impact, BNDES emphasizes that selected projects are expected to generate social and economic benefits, such as job creation, regional development, and productive inclusion. This initiative is expected to support Brazil’s consolidation as a leader in climate solutions in Latin America, drawing foreign capital and fostering strategic partnerships.

Currently, BNDESPAR has BRL 8.4 billion allocated to funds and, with the new selection, this amount can increase by up to 60%. With this, BNDES reinforces its role as a catalyst for sustainable investments, promoting a development model that combines economic competitiveness with environmental responsibility.

Soy Moratorium: CADE expands investigation to individuals, but STF orders suspension of proceedings

The future of the Soy Moratorium – one of the main environmental agreements in Brazilian agribusiness – remains uncertain amid escalating disputes between regulatory agencies, the production sector, and the Judiciary.

On September 30, 2025, the Brazilian Competition Authority (“CADE”) had provisionally lifted the preventive measure that halted the pact, ensuring the validity of the moratorium until December 31 and allowing negotiations among the parties. However, the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court (“STF”) has recently granted an injunction ordering the suspension of administrative proceedings regarding the legality or constitutionality of the Soy Moratorium.

In early November, CADE broadened the scope of its investigation by initiating a new administrative inquiry against 15 individuals associated with companies that had signed the agreement, seeking to determine the personal liability of executives and representatives in the implementation and monitoring of the moratorium. This measure represents an expansion of the investigations, which had previously focused on the companies and associations involved.

Within the Judiciary, the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (“ABIOVE”) – an entity representing Brazil’s leading soybean traders and processors – filed a petition within the scope of Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (“ADI”) No. 7774. This lawsuit, currently pending before the STF, challenges the constitutionality of a state law in Mato Grosso related to granting tax incentives to companies adhering to the pact. It further requests the suspension of all judicial and administrative proceedings in Brazil that directly or indirectly address the legality of the Soy Moratorium, due to the risk of conflicting decisions and legal uncertainty for the sector.

Within this context, Justice Flávio Dino, the reporting officer of ADI No. 7774, granted an injunction on November 05, 2025, ordering the suspension of all judicial and administrative proceedings concerning the legality or constitutionality of the Soy Moratorium until the STF issues a final ruling. The decision was endorsed by a majority of the justices, who recognized the relevance of the matter and its potential economic and environmental impacts.

In compliance with the STF order, CADE published a decision on November 11, 2025, suspending any administrative proceedings related to the Soy Moratorium. As a result, all investigations and administrative measures will remain on hold until the STF delivers a definitive judgment, placing the future of this environmental pact in the hands of Brazil’s highest court.

Brazilian Federal Revenue Service launches new compliance initiative targeting individuals in the rural sector

The Federal Revenue Service of Brazil (“RFB”) has initiated a new phase of its compliance program, targeting individuals engaged in rural activities, with a specific focus on income derived from lease agreements for rural real estate.

The initiative, named “Declara Agro – Arrendamentos”, aims to guide taxpayers on the correct taxation of such income, supporting self-assessment and regularization. According to the RFB, taxpayers who comply and correct their returns by January 30, 2026, will avoid official penalties.

STF resumes debate on tax incentives for pesticides

In a session held on November 19, 2025, the STF resumed the trial of Direct Actions of Unconstitutionality (ADI No. 5553 and ADI No. 7755) challenging the tax benefits granted to agricultural pesticides, particularly the exemptions from the Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Services (“ICMS”) and the Tax on Industrialized Products (“IPI”) provided under ICMS Agreement No. 100/1997 and provisions of Constitutional Amendment No. 132/2023.

The new session exposed a three‑way division within the Court:

The reporting officer, Justice Edson Fachin, supported by Justice Cármen Lúcia, voted to declare the incentives unconstitutional based on the principles of environmental and health protection, supporting the State’s duty not to subsidize products deemed harmful.

In dissent, Justice Cristiano Zanin aligned himself with Justices Luiz Fux and Dias Toffoli, recognizing the full validity of the benefits as legitimate instruments of agricultural policy and competitiveness.

Justice Flávio Dino, aligning with Justice André Mendonça, issued a partial dissent in which he recognized the constitutionality of tax incentives for agricultural inputs, arguing that Constitutional Amendment No. 132/2023 had incorporated this policy into the Constitution.

In light of the divergent positions and the relevance of the tax, environmental, and agricultural matters involved, the trial was suspended and will be resumed at a later date Among the issues that remain unresolved are whether periodic review of the benefits will be required, the compatibility between favorable tax treatment and environmental protection, and the financial implications for states and producers.

State of São Paulo introduces new tax benefits for yeast-derived products

The Government of the State of São Paulo has published Decree No. 70,024/2025, introducing significant changes to the São Paulo State ICMS Regulation (“RICMS-SP”).

The decree establishes specific tax rules for domestic transactions involving yeast-derived products, classified under MERCOSUR’s Common Nomenclature (“NCM”) 2102.20.00 and originating from the sugarcane fermentation process.

The regulation introduces two provisions to the state tax code:

Article 361-A – ICMS deferral on first sale:

The ICMS deferral will now apply to the first domestic sale of inactive dry, autolyzed, hydrolyzed, cell wall, and extracted yeast. This mechanism postpones the ICMS collection to the following stage in the supply chain, thus reducing the immediate financial impact on manufacturers and distributors.

Annex I, Article 183 – Exemption for pet food production:

Domestic transactions involving the same products will be exempt from ICMS when destined exclusively for the production of pet food, reinforcing policies aimed at stimulating the pet segment and agroindustrial chains linked to sugarcane.

The decree took effect on November 01, 2025, allowing companies in the sector to adjust their processes and evaluate opportunities to leverage new incentives.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION:

Legal Reserve

GOIÁS

Goiás establishes procedures for analysis and approval of Legal Reserve

On November 03, 2025, the State Secretariat for Environment and Sustainable Development (“SEMAD”) published SEMAD Normative Instruction No. 23/2025, providing for administrative procedures and technical criteria for the analysis and approval of the Legal Reserve. The normative instruction also provides for the rules for relocation, compensation, and implementation of collective or condominium Legal Reserves.

The regulation stipulates that the analysis and approval of Legal Reserves will be carried out through the Rural Environmental Registry (“CAR”), except in cases provided for in the normative instruction. It further defines technical criteria for location, prioritizing areas with greater conservation of native vegetation, less fragmentation, and connectivity with other protected areas.

Additionally, the normative instruction regulates procedures for environmental licensing, establishing that the Legal Reserve approval may occur within the scope of land-use conversion, including the conditions for title rectifications and CAR updates. It also establishes rules for off‑property relocation, compensation, and the creation of collective Legal Reserves, requiring, among other conditions, that they be located within the same biome and expanded in area to ensure environmental gains.

Finally, the normative instruction provides for compensation rules in cases of vegetation suppression, as well as criteria for regularization and integration of control systems, ensuring compliance with state and federal legislation.

Rural Insurance

FEDERAL

National Council of Private Insurance establishes environmental, social, and climate guidelines for rural insurance

On November 04, 2025, the National Council of Private Insurance (“CNSP”) published CNSP Resolution No. 485/2025, establishing guidelines on environmental, social, and climate-related issues applicable to rural insurance.

The regulation requires that areas covered by rural insurance contracts be identified by geodetic coordinates and registered in the CAR. It prohibits the execution of contracts for real estate not registered or with suspended registration, as well as for activities in areas embargoed by environmental authorities or located in conservation units, Indigenous lands, Quilombola communities, or undesignated public forests, except as provided for in specific exceptions.

The resolution also prohibits contracting by policyholders listed in the registry of employers who have subjected workers to conditions analogous to slavery, establishes risk mitigation criteria, requires insurers to comply with the guidelines before underwriting, and further mandates specific clauses in contracts for reporting non-compliance.

The regulation will take effect 180 days after publication and authorizes the Superintendence of Private Insurance (“SUSEP”) to issue complementary regulations for its implementation.

Environmental Rural Registry

PARANÁ

Paraná establishes procedures for automated analysis of Rural Environmental Registry

On November 03, 2025, the Government of the State of Paraná published Decree No. 11,711/2025, establishing procedures for applying Articles 3 and 13 of Law No. 18,295/2014, with a focus on streamlining the analysis of information declared in CAR at the state level.

The regulation introduces mechanisms for the automated CAR analysis, enabling corrections and adjustments based on certified cartographic data, satellite imagery, and official technical criteria, with the aim of enhancing speed and accuracy in the environmental regularization of rural real estate.

The decree defines concepts such as the National Rural Environmental Registry System (“SICAR”), the Environmental Regularization Program (“PRA”), and the Degraded Area Recovery Project (“PRADA”). It also provides that the automated analysis may correct information regarding Permanent Preservation Areas (“APPs”), Legal Reserves, restricted-use areas, and administrative easements, without prior request.

Additionally, any real estate with its CAR analyzed and deemed compliant may request the cancellation of annotations related to commitment terms recorded in real estate registries. The state will offer free technical assistance to owners of real estate – including up to four fiscal modules – and may enter into cooperation agreements for the preparation of PRADAs and regularization measures.

RIO GRANDE DO SUL

Rio Grande do Sul regulates procedures for analysis and validation of the Rural Environmental Registry

On November 19, 2025, the State Secretariat for Environment and Infrastructure in collaboration with the Henrique Luiz Roessler State Foundation for Environmental Protection (“FEPAM”) published SEMA/FEPAM Joint Normative Instruction No. 9/2025, establishing administrative procedures for the analysis, validation, amendment, and cancellation of rural real estate registrations in the Rural Environmental Registry (“CAR”).

The regulation defines the procedures for validating the information submitted to the CAR for the purpose of certifying the environmental compliance of rural real estate with existing legislation, particularly in relation to APPs, Legal Reserves, restricted‑use zones, and consolidated areas. It also specifies that the analysis will be conducted through the SICAR module, with the option to use automated mechanisms and state cartographic databases. The normative instruction creates the Owner/Holder Portal as the official channel for monitoring analyses as well as submitting documents and corrections. Additionally, it establishes the CAR Management Committee, responsible for defining technical criteria and monitoring the progress of ongoing analyses.

Among its key provisions, the instruction outlines procedures for validating property boundaries, permissible area discrepancies, and overlaps with settlements, Indigenous lands, conservation units, and embargoed areas..

The normative instruction also sets deadlines for responding to notifications (120 days) and provides for the cancellation of the CAR after one year of suspension due to a lack of regularization. The regulation addresses the analysis of land use and cover, APPs, and Legal Reserves, establishing criteria for issuing notifications and requiring supporting documentation, as well as rules for amendments to registrations and for CAR cancellation in specific cases, such as overlaps or improper registration.

The regulation reinforces that, while the environmental authority has not ruled on pending issues, CAR registrations will be considered effective for all legal purposes. The normative instruction also authorizes field inspections and requires that registration information be updated whenever there is a change in ownership or possession. With these measures, the state aims to ensure greater legal certainty and transparency in the CAR validation process, aligning it with the Forest Code and federal regulations.

MINAS GERAIS

Minas Gerais establishes guidelines for CAR analysis and regularization of Legal Reserve areas

On November 19, 2025, the State Secretariat for Environment and Sustainable Development (“SEMAD”), the State Environmental Foundation (“FEAM”), and the State Forestry Institute (“IEF”) published SEMAD/FEAM/IEF Joint Resolution No. 3,390/2025, establishing procedures for the analysis of the CAR of rural real estate in Minas Gerais and specifying the documentation required to support regularization processes of Legal Reserve areas.

The regulation establishes technical and administrative criteria for validating information declared in the CAR, including verification of real estate boundaries, APPs, consolidated areas, anthropized areas, and the location of Legal Reserves. The analysis will be conducted through the SICAR analysis module, prioritizing real estate associated with environmental licensing, intervention authorizations, or judicial proceedings. Notifications may be submitted via the Owner/Holder Portal, with a 120-day period for corrections, under penalty of registry suspension.

The regulation also sets permissible limits for discrepancies in area measurements and overlaps with other real estate, settlements, conservation units, and Indigenous territories, as well as rules for automatic rectification by the environmental authority in specific cases.

Finally, the regulation reinforces that the CAR registration is a prerequisite for Legal Reserve regularization and that previous administrative acts will be observed, ensuring legal certainty. The resolution also repeals SEMAD/IEF Joint Resolutions No. 3,132/2022 and SEMAD/FEAM/IEF No. 3,353/2025.

TOCANTINS

Tocantins establishes new geospatial bases for CAR analysis

On November 12, 2025, the Nature Institute of Tocantins (“NATURATINS”) published Ordinance No. 265/2025, providing for the adoption of new official geospatial vector bases for CAR registrations in the state of Tocantins.

The measure took effect on December 01, 2025, and is a mandatory reference for registration, technical analysis, validation, and other procedures related to CAR.

The regulation establishes the following official bases:

Hydrography from the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (“FBDS”);

Waste use in agriculture

SANTA CATARINA

Santa Catarina establishes guidelines for waste use in agriculture, forestry, and industrial processes

On November 14, 2025, the State Environmental Council (“CONSEMA”) of Santa Catarina published CONSEMA Resolution No. 290/2025, establishing guidelines and criteria for the use of waste classified as Class I, IIA, or IIB as inputs in agriculture, forestry, industrial or construction processes, as well as procedures for environmental licensing and technical control.

The regulation stipulates that the use of such waste may only occur upon a specific Environmental Authorization (“AuA”) issued by the competent environmental authority, linked to the validity of the project’s operating license.

Activities such as co-processing, thermal treatment of waste, energy recovery in boilers, recycling of uncontaminated materials, and destinations authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture are excluded from the scope of this resolution. The AuA requirement is waived for situations involving reuse by the generator itself or the use of Class IIB waste, provided that other applicable regulations are met.

The resolution defines technical concepts such as waste characterization and classification according to Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (“ABNT”) standards, criteria for environmentally appropriate final disposal, and parameters for toxicity assessment (“FT”). Generators must submit a detailed description of the origin process, technical reports on physicochemical and ecotoxicological characterization, and classification according to NBR No. 10004, with analyses performed exclusively by laboratories accredited by the National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (“INMETRO”). For Class I waste, an ecotoxicity test with standardized organisms is mandatory, following specific technical procedures.

Recipients must submit a complete project to obtain the AuA, including: Process flowchart; Description of waste incorporation;

Percentage and quantity to be used; Emission and effluent control systems; Functional and environmental assessment of the product; Identification of the technical team responsible, with Technical Responsibility Annotation (“ART”). The regulation sets FT toxicity limits and rules for temporary storage, in compliance with ABNT standards. It also requires that waste transportation comply with the Waste Transport Manifest (“MTR”) provided for in state legislation.

Use of prescribed and controlled burning

RORAIMA

Roraima extends authorization cycle for controlled burning and prescribed fire

On November 07, 2025, the State Foundation for Environment and Water Resources published FEMARH/PRES/DIRAF/DRH Ordinance No. 1,167/2025, extending the 16th authorization cycle for the use of prescribed fire and controlled burning in the state of Roraima.

The ordinance extends the authorization period for burning activities until December 06, 2025, maintaining the provisions established in the Roraima State Plan for Deforestation and Burn Control (“PPCDQ/RR”) and the guidelines of the National Policy for Integrated Fire Management. It also provides that authorized burns may be suspended based on a technical assessment by the State Committee for the Prevention, Control of Burns, and Wildfire Suppression, using monitoring data from the National Institute for Space Research (“INPE”) and alerts issued through the State Wildfire Prevention and Suppression System (“SEPCIF”).

The use of fire in agroforestry‑pastoral areas without authorization, or in violation of the terms of the issued authorization, will be considered illegal burning, subject to a fine of BRL 10,000 per hectare or fraction thereof, in compliance with Decree No. 12,189/2024.

Additionally, the ordinance establishes operational requirements for prescribed burning activities, including:

Prior notification of neighboring landowners;

Advance communication to Civil Defense and the Fire Department;

Maintenance of firebreaks;

Availability of water sources and suppression equipment; and

Execution only during safe burning windows – after the first rains and under low‑wind conditions;

All of which aim to ensure adequate risk mitigation and prevent the spread of wildfires.

Special regularization program

GOIÁS

Goiás extends deadlines for Special Regularization Program and repeals provisions on land subdivision

On November 19, 2025, SEMAD published SEMAD Ordinance No. 585/2025, amending Ordinance No. 753/2024, which established the Special Regularization Program, aiming to extend its validity period and repeal provisions related to land subdivision.

The regulation extends to two years – counted from November 13, 2024 – the period during which unlicensed or unregistered agents responsible for projects or activities may regularize their status, including their eligibility for the discounts offered under the program. This extension applies to activities such as animal confinement, irrigated perennial agriculture, and projects involving dams, provided that corrective registration or licensing is requested within the established period.

In addition to the extension, the regulation repeals item IV of §1 of Article 4, Section IV on “Land Subdivision Activities”, of Chapter III, as well as Article 8 of Ordinance No. 753/2024.

Environmental licensing

FEDERAL

Senate approves creation of Special Environmental License for strategic projects

On December 03, 2025, the Federal Senate approved Provisional Measure No. 1,308/2025, converted into Bill of Conversion No. 11/2025, which creates the Special Environmental License (“LAE”) for projects deemed strategic by the Federal Government.

Bill No. 11/2025 now proceeds to presidential sanction. The LAE will apply to activities or projects defined as strategic by decree, based on the biennial proposal of the Government Council. Among the expressly listed cases are reconstruction and repaving works on existing highways connecting federal units, such as BR-319, which links Porto Velho (in Roraima) to Manaus (in Amazonas). The regulation also allows projects that use environmental resources and cause significant environmental degradation to request the LAE, provided that they comply with the established conditions.

Finally, Bill No. 11/2025 removes the provision for financing technical assistance to affected communities, which was included in the previous version of the text. It also reinforces that the LAE does not eliminate the obligation to comply with environmental and social conditions addressed in the legislation.

Congress overturns vetoes and reinstates provisions of the General Environmental Licensing Law

On November 27, 2025, the Brazilian National Congress overturned 52 executive vetoes of Law No. 15,190/2025 (“General Environmental Licensing Law”), reinstating provisions regarding the waiver and simplification of environmental licensing, entrepreneurs’ responsibilities, and the definition of the competencies of federal, state, and municipal authorities. The Presidency will now promulgate the sections rejected by the Brazilian Parliament.

Among the reinstated provisions are rules allowing the waiver of environmental licensing for specific activities until the universalization targets addressed in Law No. 14,026/2020 are met. The waiver covers activities such as maintenance and improvements of existing highway infrastructure, power and gas pipeline installations, and basic sanitation works.

Provisions simplifying licensing for lower-impact projects were also reinstated, such as small or medium-sized activities with low or medium pollution potential, which may use the Environmental License by Adhesion and Commitment (“LAC”), upon the applicant’s commitment to comply with predefined requirements established by the licensing authority.

Another relevant point is the possibility of issuing the Corrective Operating License (“LOC”) to regularize activities operating without an environmental license, subject to conditions proportional to the identified impacts. The law also reinforces that environmental restrictions imposed on entrepreneurs must have a technical justification and a direct link to the project’s impact.

By overturning the vetoes, the law restores greater autonomy to federative entities to define concepts such as activity size, pollution potential, and typologies subject to licensing. It also allows states and municipalities to establish criteria for applying the LAC. Additionally, the regulation also relaxes the requirement for prior consent from federal agencies for vegetation suppression in the Atlantic Forest, making such consent advisory rather than mandatory if there is a delay in response.

With the vetoes overturned, the General Environmental Licensing Law takes effect with provisions that expand simplification and flexibility in licensing, establishing new parameters for strategic works, rural activities, and infrastructure projects, while maintaining the need for technical studies and conditions proportional to environmental impacts.

MATO GROSSO

Mato Grosso establishes procedures for environmental licensing of energy cogeneration in ethanol plants

On December 02, 2025, the State Environmental Council (“CONSEMA”) of Mato Grosso published CONSEMA Resolution No. 75/2025, establishing the criteria and procedures for the environmental licensing of energy cogeneration activities in facilities dedicated to producing ethanol from sugarcane. The regulation aims to integrate cogeneration licensing into the main industrial activity’s licensing process.

The resolution defines key concepts, such as:

Primary energy – energy available in nature without transformation.

Secondary energy – resulting from the conversion of primary energy, such as electricity or petroleum derivatives.

Energy cogeneration – combined production of thermal and mechanical/electrical energy from a single source, such as sugarcane biomass.

Environmental Control Report (“RCA”) – a simplified document for low-impact projects.

Cogeneration licensing will be carried out in a single process, jointly with the ethanol industry’s licensing, and will be considered an ancillary and complementary activity. Technical documents and studies must be submitted in an integrated manner, ensuring a unified environmental analysis. For expansions, an environmental impact study will not be required, and submission of the RCA will suffice.

The regulation emphasizes that cogeneration must follow the same licensing class and typology assigned to the main facility and provides measures for simplification and efficiency, aligned with the National Environmental Policy and the National Environment Council (“CONAMA”) resolutions.

PARANÁ

Paraná regulates environmental licensing for biodigesters with biogas energy recovery

On November 13, 2025, the Water and Land Institute (“IAT”) published IAT Normative Instruction No. 24/2025, establishing definitions, criteria, guidelines, and procedures for the environmental licensing of biodigesters intended for biogas energy recovery in the state of Paraná.

The regulation applies to the licensing of biodigesters designed for the treatment of industrial, urban, or rural effluents and organic waste, as well as for the energy recovery of biogas generated in existing sanitary landfills. Additionally, the resolution defines essential technical concepts such as anaerobic biodigestion, biogas, biomethane, digestate, and solid waste, and establishes parameters for classifying projects according to size and category.

Among its key provisions, the instruction establishes the types of environmental licensing, which may be:

Three-phase (Preliminary License, Installation License, and Operating License);

Two-phase; and

Single-phase (Simplified Environmental License), in addition to establishing specific procedures for the regularization and expansion of projects. IAT Normative Instruction No. 24/2025 also establishes necessary administrative procedures, such as:

Declaration of Exemption from Environmental Licensing;

Licenses by Adhesion and Commitment;

Simplified Licenses;

Preliminary, Installation, and Operating Licenses;

Environmental and forestry authorizations.

Moreover, the normative instruction establishes standards for liquid effluent discharge, parameters for agricultural use of digestates, requirements for specific projects, safety measures for biodigester operation and biogas handling, rules for waste and effluent transportation, location criteria for project implementation, and guidelines for mitigating environmental impacts.

REGULATION – MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK (MAPA)

Federal Government recognizes certification bodies for agricultural sustainability programs

On November 17, 2025, the Brazilian Federal Official Gazette published MAPA/MF Interministerial Ordinance No. 27, recognizing certification bodies and Participatory Organic Conformity Assessment Bodies (“OPACS”) responsible for three strategic programs of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (‘”MAPA”): Integrated Production (“IP Brazil”); Good Agricultural Practices (“BPA”); and Organic Production.

The regulation implements CMN Resolution No. 5,229/2025, which establishes bonuses for producers adopting sustainable practices, thereby strengthening the governance of certifications used to access rural credit based on environmental criteria.

Key provisions include:

Recognition of certification bodies and OPACS authorized for IP Brazil, BPA, and Organic Production programs, valid until June 30, 2026.

Integration of information into the Agro Brasil + Sustainable Platform (AB+S), which will provide a compliance verification solution – essential for interest rate reductions in financing under Plano Safra.

Responsibility of certifiers and organizations to keep all data on classification, inclusion, or exclusion of certified producers updated on the platform.

Penalties for certifiers and producers in the event of non-compliance with sustainable practice criteria, including loss of bonuses.

A consultation platform for financial institutions to verify certification validity before granting credit.

In case of VGM infrastructure unavailability, a contingency system will ensure automatic continuity of program access, and rural producers will be notified of activation and deactivation of contingency levels through communication channels listed on MAPA’s website.

Management of animal production waste;

Intensive finishing systems.

The request for import authorization will be submitted for analysis by MAPA and, if authorized, may be valid for a single import operation or multiple import operations, depending on the associated health and phytosanitary risks and the characteristics of the product.

The initiative results from partnerships between the Secretariat for Rural Development (“SDR/MAPA”) and the Federal Data Processing Service (“SERPRO”) through a Technical Cooperation Agreement (“ACT”), and between the SDR and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (“CNPq”) through a Decentralized Execution Term (“TED”).

Among the key points discussed in the regulation are:

Consolidation of metrics for the ten SPSABC+ technologies, enabling analyses at national and state levels.

Availability of information on databases, methodologies, and glossaries used in building the dashboards.

Integration with the Integrated Information System of the Sectoral Plan (“SINABC”), strengthening the ABC Platform.

Strategic partnerships for technological development and promotion of sustainable practices.

MAPA updates list of quarantine pests present in Brazil

On November 12, 2025, MAPA published SDA/MAPA Ordinance No. 1,443/2025 – through the Secretariat of Agricultural and Livestock Defense –, amending the list of quarantine pests present in Brazil, as established in the Annex to Normative Instruction No. 38/2018.

The regulation adds new occurrence areas for two pests already monitored by MAPA under specific national prevention and control programs:

Rhizoctonia theobromae (Ceratobasidium theobromae) – affecting cassava crops; detected in Almeirim (PA).

Xanthomonas campestris pv. viticola – affecting grapevine crops; detected in the state of Rio Grande do Norte.

Key points:

The newly included areas will follow the rules of national phytosanitary prevention and control programs for the handling of host plants.

For cassava, handling affected material from affected areas to pest-free regions is prohibited to prevent pest spread.

The update reinforces the importance of phytosanitary surveillance and control of host plant handling activities.

Enforcement of these measures lies with state plant protection agencies, with official information available on MAPA’s website.

Decree modernizes oversight of plant-based products and consolidates agricultural regulations

On October 31, 2025, Decree No. 12,709 was published, unifying the regulation of plant-based products under numerous sectoral laws, including Law No. 14,515/2022, which established self-monitoring as the cornerstone of agricultural defense. The regulation represents a significant step forward by consolidating rules and aligning Brazil with international practices.

The decree sets technical standards to ensure compliance of plant-based products, including:

Sensory normality, quality, and quantity of the components;

Absence of harmful substances, contaminants, and deterioration;

Compliance with microbiological and physico-chemical limits;

Adoption of good manufacturing practices and appropriate technological processes; and

Preservation and presentation compatible with safe consumption.

Quality and identity standards will be established in complementary normative acts, and in the absence of such standards, the Codex Alimentarius may be used as a reference.

Traceability and recall

The decree requires all agents in the plant production chain – including producers, distributors, retailers, and importers – to implement traceability mechanisms for each product batch, supported by systematic and auditable records that allow identification of origin and monitoring handling across the entire supply chain. Information must remain available for inspection for 18 months after the product’s expiration date or shipment.

The decree establishes rules for recall procedures, which must be initiated when deficiencies or non-conformities are identified posing risks to consumer, plant, or animal health. In such cases, the responsible party or importer must immediately remove the product from the market at their own expense. This obligation includes halting commercialization, segregating the batch, and implementing the prescribed corrective measures, which may occur at the initiative of the operator, by order of the supervisory authority, or by administrative decision. MAPA will issue risk alerts with information on recalls and actions to be taken by involved parties.

Oversight and Inspecting Authorities

The decree establishes the Brazilian Inspection System for Plant-Based Products (“SISBI-POV”) to ensure identity, quality, and hygienic-sanitary safety of plant products. Implementation will occur under a voluntary adherence regime, with equivalent systems among the Federal Government, states, municipalities, and public consortia. MAPA is responsible for coordinating SISBI-POV and carrying out activities such as adherence audits, establishment and product registration, self-monitoring oversight, import/export certification, compliance program management, and other actions to mitigate agricultural defense risks.

Infractions and Penalties

Applicable penalties include warnings, fines, product condemnations, registration suspensions or cancellations, enrollments or accreditations, and revocations of professional authorizations. Minor infractions corrected prior to an official notice will not be recorded, in compliance with Law No. 14,515/2022. Fines range from BRL 100 to BRL 150,000, with a 10% increase for repeat offenses. Suspension or cancellation penalties may be converted into fines through a Conduct Adjustment Agreement (“TAC”). If it is accepted by MAPA, it will have the effect of an extrajudicial enforceable title.

Penalty assessment will consider the risk associated with the infraction, prior records, and mitigating or aggravating circumstances, ensuring proportionality and effectiveness in holding agents accountable.

Transition rules

The decree took effect on October 31, 2025, with immediate application, except for:

Guidelines for identifying facility and product registration and mandatory labeling descriptions for online product offers, which will take effect 90 days after publication, subject to complementary regulation;

Adjustments to beverage registration information for name changes, which will take effect 730 days after publication.

According to MAPA, omitted cases or questions regarding the new rules and requirements under Decree No. 12,709/2025 will be resolved by the Department of Inspection of Plant-Based Products.

REAL ESTATE REGULATION

Committee simplifies probate for small rural real estate

On November 12, 2025, the Committee on Agriculture, Livestock, Supply, and Rural Development of the House of Representatives approved Bill No. 3,720/2025, introducing significant changes for family farmers and small rural producers.

Among these changes, the bill authorizes that real property belonging to the estate of up to four fiscal modules may be probated directly at a notary’s office, without requiring an attorney, provided all heirs are legally competent and agree on the division.

The waiver of attorney involvement in simple probate proceedings represents a major shift, reducing costs and time to regularize rural real estate, which often remain under irregular ownership due to difficulties in completing probate proceedings. This measure may facilitate the transfer of rural real estate used in numerous operations, preventing disruptions caused by succession issues.

Despite the simplification, it is essential to ensure that the division is carried out with technical rigor, avoiding defects that could lead to nullities or future disputes. The possibility of using the public deed of probate to update records with the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (“INCRA”) and the RFB also contributes to integrating and updating registrations.

The bill is being processed under a conclusive procedure and will be reviewed by the Committee on Constitution, Justice, and Citizenship. To become law, the bill must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Federal Senate.

Senate discusses ratification of public land registrations in border zones

On November 07, 2025, the Senate Plenary approved Bill No. 4,497/2024, which addresses the ratification of real estate records resulting from alienations and concessions of federal lands in border zones carried out by the states. The text now returns to the House of Representatives for review.

Bill No. 4,497/2024 establishes that the responsibility for registration lies with notary’s offices – under INCRA’s supervision –, which will have five years to certify compliance with the social function of the real estate, as required by the Federal Constitution. The bill amends both the Public Records Law (Law No. 6,015/1973) and Law No. 13,178/2015, which governs land regularization in border zones.

The purpose of the bill is to ensure legal certainty for real estate records in border zones and eliminate requirements deemed unnecessary or impractical, aligning with STF decisions and the guidelines of the National Agrarian Reform Plan and of the National Agricultural Policy.

The proposal eliminates discrepancies among state-level regulations, bringing uniformity to the ratification process and greater predictability for real estate operations and rural credit transactions, ensuring legal certainty for the procedure.

Additionally, the five-year certification period by INCRA reinforces compliance with constitutional standards, potentially impacting unproductive or environmentally-liable real estate.

The measure is expected to unlock investments and regularize large areas, favoring structured operations, leases, and financing.",https://www.demarest.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/recorte-background-of-the-interior-of-a-minimalist-constru-2024-10-18-09-00-46-utc.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:56:14.318694

Warnick filed three bills, including topics of wildfire risk models and insurance, carbon alternative jet fuel and workforce education. Dent filed two bills, including one extending wildfire aviation funding and another enhancing regulations on vehicle loads.

Wildfire aviation

Dent, alongside Reps. Larry Springer, D-Snoqualmie; Cindy Ryu, D-Shoreline; and Andrew Engell, R-Colville, filed House Bill 2104 on Dec. 8, 2025. The bill is aimed at enhancing aviation assurance funding in response to wildland fires. This is a permanent extension to a bill that was previously passed by the 2023 legislature and set to expire in 2027.

Dent had previously told the Columbia Basin Herald this was one of his top priorities for the upcoming session.

“The fire departments have found great value in this program,” he said. “I am pushing to make this provision permanent, as it enhances our ability to respond quickly to wildfires, benefiting not only the environment but also the safety and well-being of our citizens.""

Provisions in the bill allow local fire departments to access certified aviation resources for the deployment of fire retardants and water, aimed at containing wildfires before they necessitate larger-scale state and federal interventions.

Dent explained this saves the state money by paying a smaller cost for aviation assistance versus the cost of a fire, which may become larger because it did not receive suppression assistance.

Additionally, the bill mandates the Department of Natural Resources to provide ongoing suppression funding and aviation resources, ensuring local departments maintain the financial capacity needed for effective initial attack strategies against wildfires.

There is no cost analysis available as of Friday. More information on the bill can be found at bit.ly/WAHB2104.

Wildfire risk

Following the theme of wildfires, Warnick, along with Sen. Shelly Short, R-Addy, filed Senate Bill 5928 on Dec. 22, 2025. The bill aims to enhance transparency in property insurance related to wildfire risk in Washington State.

It mandates insurers to disclose several key pieces of information to policyholders when utilizing a wildfire risk score for underwriting or rating purposes, including the property’s current score, factors influencing the score, and options for mitigation.

Additionally, the bill requires insurers to provide this information in writing within set timeframes following applications for coverage or during policy renewals or cancellations. Insurers must also incorporate community-level and property-specific mitigation actions into their risk models, offering discounts for policyholders who undertake such measures.

The bill further stipulates that insurers to submit their risk models to the Insurance Commissioner, ensuring they comply with the outlined regulations while safeguarding sensitive information as trade secrets.

There is no cost analysis available as of Friday. More information on the bill can be found at bit.ly/WASB5928.

Jet fuel

Warnick also pre-filed Senate Bill 5932, which has to do with jet fuel production Dec. 23, 2025. She is the sole sponsor of the bill.

The proposed legislation seeks to promote the development of low-to-zero carbon alternative jet fuel, also known as sustainable aviation fuel.

The bill highlights the necessity for state support to achieve emissions reduction goals outlined in various climate policies, ensuring alternative jet fuel production aligns with Washington's clean energy objectives.

The bill stipulates tax credits will be available for manufacturers and users of alternative jet fuel, contingent upon the establishment of facilities capable of producing at least 20 million gallons annually.

Furthermore, the legislation emphasizes the assignment of carbon intensity attributes based on energy sourcing and mandates that credits can only be claimed following verification by the appropriate state departments, ensuring an organized and accountable approach to promoting sustainable aviation fuel.

There is no cost analysis available as of Friday. More information on the bill can be found at: bit.ly/WASB5932.

Vehicle loads

Following the theme of transportation, Dent, alongside Rep. Adam Bernbaum, D-Olympic Peninsula, and Shelley Kloba, D-Kirkland, pre-filed House Bill 2109 on Dec. 8, 2025. The bill aims to enhance safety on public highways in Washington by establishing stricter regulations for securing vehicle loads.

The bill specifies that no vehicle should operate on public roads unless its load is secured to prevent it from dropping, spilling, or leaking, with specific provisions for covering loose materials such as dirt and gravel.

Violations may lead to criminal repercussions, categorized into different degrees based on the severity of harm or property damage caused by the unsecured load.

Importantly, the bill allows public maintenance vehicles to drop sand or use other substances to maintain traction or road conditions without penalty.

The bill does not have a cost analysis report yet. However, more information about the proposed legislation can be read here: bit.ly/WAHB2109.

Workforce education

Warnick, alongside Sen. T’Wina Nobles, D-Fircrest, filed Senate Bill 5931 on Dec. 23, 2025. The bill establishes the Workforce Education Investment Accountability and Oversight Board, comprising 18 members from various sectors, including the legislature, businesses, labor organizations, higher education institutions, and students.

The board will consist of four legislative members and 14 appointed by the governor, focusing on business representation, labor organizations, and education stakeholders to ensure diverse perspectives.

The board’s primary objectives include providing legislative guidance on workforce education funding priorities and ensuring investments lead to improved student success and career readiness, as measured by retention and job placement rates.

The announcement was made at a news conference at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, featuring Erik Meade, CEO, DHL Forwarding Latin America, and Georgina Sánchez-Baca, Regional Senior Partnership Sales Manager for Mexico, Formula E.

Since Formula E’s inaugural season, DHL has supported the all-electric series across more than 140 races in 33 cities and 24 countries, managing the complex logistics required to move a global championship calendar. “DHL was one of the first brands to believe in this project, not just as an idea, but as something that would change motorsports,” Sánchez-Baca says.

Each Formula E race requires the transport of over 400 metric t of freight, including race cars, high-voltage batteries, broadcast equipment, track infrastructure, tires, and full charging units. “What we do is work with companies that are experts in regulation, and we make sure everything we move by air meets those requirements,” Meade says. “We have internal experts, but we also carry out external evaluations, especially for the handling of batteries and other dangerous goods.”

The 2025-26 season will feature 17 races in 11 cities, making it one of the most active calendars in Formula E history. Organizers say the schedule has been designed to reduce travel distances between venues, lowering emissions associated with transporting cars, batteries, and infrastructure. In addition, the initial shipment of equipment for the season will move from Brazil to Mexico by sea before continuing to Miami by road, a route intended to reduce emissions while improving operational efficiency.

According to Sánchez-Baca, the Mexico City E-Prix draws the largest crowds on the calendar, with more than 40,000 spectators. The Mexico City race carries additional significance this season, as it will mark the 150th race in Formula E history.

Collaboration with DHL on sustainable logistics measures is not new for the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. In 2024, the series announced it had worked with DHL to reduce the carbon footprint of its global logistics operations by shipping essential equipment to races outside the European Union using two cargo planes instead of three. According to DHL, the change reduced championship-related emissions by about 5,500 metric tons of CO2 across a 16-race calendar.

The improvement was achieved by reducing freight volumes by over 80 metric t and increasing the use of in-market assets, as well as deploying multiple sets of equipment that can be moved by sea or road rather than air. From Season 6 onward, road transport for these assets has relied on renewable biofuels, which have gradually been integrated into the series maritime transport operations. These changes have delivered up to an 80% reduction in emissions compared with conventional fuels used in those sectors. In 2024, the partnership also tested Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through DHL’s GoGreen Plus service.

Julia Palle, Vice President of Sustainability, Formula E, says the freight changes reflect the championship’s broader strategy. “We are proud to take our sustainability credentials and commitment to reducing our overall emissions to the next level,” Palle says. She adds that close collaboration with DHL has contributed directly to the series’ Science Based Targets initiative commitment to cut its overall carbon footprint by 45% by 2030, using Season 5 as a baseline.

Formula E: A Global Leader fo Sustainability Within Sports

In 2024, Formula E became the first sport to commit to the British Standards Institution’s Net Zero Pathway. The championship uses ISO 14064-1 standards to quantify and report greenhouse gas emissions and applies ISO Net Zero Guidelines to support emissions reduction and reporting.

Since its inaugural season, the electric racing series has focused on measuring, reducing, and offsetting its environmental impact as part of its commitment to net zero carbon. As a signatory to the UN Climate Neutral Now initiative, Formula E began by measuring its full carbon footprint using a lifecycle assessment model that covers all race operations and headquarters activities. Annual assessments track greenhouse gas emissions, identify key sources of environmental impact and inform operational improvements.

Following several seasons of detailed measurement, Formula E set formal emissions-reduction targets in 2021 and became the first sport to have its goals validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The championship committed to cutting absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 60% by 2030 from a Season 5 baseline, and to reducing Scope 3 emissions by 27.5% over the same period. Together, these targets amount to a 45% absolute emissions reduction by 2030, aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5° C. In Season 9, Scope 3 emissions — primarily from freight, travel and car production — accounted for 98% of the championship’s footprint, while Scope 1 emissions represented 1.3% and Scope 2 accounted for 0.7%.

To address remaining emissions, Formula E began offsetting unavoidable emissions in Season 6 by investing in renewable energy projects in race markets. These initiatives support local economic development while contributing to emissions neutrality. In Season 9, Formula E further strengthened its environmental framework by aligning with PAS 2060, becoming the first global sports organization to meet the international specification for demonstrating carbon neutrality.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/IMG_2943%20%283%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.jpeg?h=c3a6872c&itok=B7PgMLRO,N,,2026-01-06 16:57:48.150674

In Closing The international push for Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a paradoxical story of unprecedented financial commitment colliding head-on with sobering scaling realities.","The conversation around Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is in full swing, where ambition is flying high, but prices are soaring even higher. Global commitment is booming, driven by mandates and massive capital pushes, even as the industry grapples with the cold, hard reality that building gigascale clean fuel plants is, well, hard. This investment focused post confirms that green aviation is now a serious financial play, clocking in £14.7 billion in global private investment, with the USA snagging 46% of that total.

Europe Steps Up the to Plate with a €100 Billion Insurance Policy

The clear leader in terms of policy muscle is Europe, which is deploying huge public funds to de-risk this crucial sector. The European Commission unveiled the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), a strategic roadmap aiming to unlock the estimated €100 billion (about $108 billion) required by 2035 to scale production. This massive investment is a direct response to the binding ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, which requires SAF blending to start at 2% in 2025 and rise dramatically to 70% by 2050.

As a short-term kick-start, the EU expects to mobilize at least €2.9 billion until the end of 2027 through existing programs like InvestEU and the European Hydrogen Bank. Eight EU member states recently launched the eSAF Early Movers Coalition to mobilize at least €500 million ($580 million) specifically for synthetic aviation fuel (eSAF) projects. This coalition aims to introduce novel mechanisms, such as double-sided auctions, to provide the revenue certainty that producers and financiers desperately need to greenlight new factories. Think of this public commitment as a government-backed insurance policy, guaranteeing that high initial costs won’t result in stranded assets.

Meanwhile, across the Channel, the UK is getting serious too, moving to pass the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill to introduce a statutory Revenue Certainty Mechanism. This mechanism guarantees a fixed “strike price” for SAF producers, boosting investor confidence and accelerating Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) to meet the UK’s 2030 target of 10% SAF blending.

American Companies Score Big Deals

While Europe relies on heavy-handed mandates, the US investment scene is driven by corporate ingenuity – and perhaps a touch of regulatory uncertainty. Corporate venture arms, still recovering from COVID-19 and facing tight budgets, are creatively tackling capital-intensive sectors like SAF by “clubbing together” on investments. The Oneworld Alliance airlines, including American and Alaska Airlines, jointly backed a $150 million SAF fund managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. This approach pools expertize and protects long-term SAF investments from short-term corporate priority shifts.

In commercial news, logistics giant DHL Group committed to purchasing over 300 million liters of SAF from Phillips 66 over three years, one of the largest such agreements by a US producer. This fuel will come from Phillips 66’s massive Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California, a former oil refinery converted to process only waste feedstocks.

On the development front, XCF Global completed initial site work for its second SAF facility, New Rise Reno 2, representing a $300 million planned investment to nearly double its production capacity to 80 million gallons annually. Even international players are flocking to the US, with Korean Air partnering with Samsung E&A to explore SAF production and supply chains, citing the US’s advanced technology and abundant feedstock availability.

LanzaJet’s World First

In a massive technological breakthrough, US-based firm LanzaJet successfully produced commercial SAF from ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia. This achievement marks a world first for alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology operating at a commercial scale. Industry analysts had been warning that SAF made using traditional Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathways was approaching a plateau due to feedstock limitations, making LanzaJet’s alcohol-based solution a sound alternative. The technology can harness widely available ethanol feedstocks, including municipal solid waste and agricultural residues, potentially opening new pathways for waste sources to contribute to the aviation energy mix.

The Price Tag and the Reality Gap

Despite the flood of money and mandates, the SAF industry is facing a reality check regarding scale and cost. The unfortunate truth is that project failures and delays currently outnumber successful completions. By 2024, only 24% of announced global SAF production capacity was realized on time. Over 40% of the announced capacity for 2030 risks delays or cancellations.

This slow scale-up, coupled with surging demand from European mandates, is sending prices through the roof. Neat SAF prices in Europe recently hit a two-year high of nearly $3,000 per metric ton, making it approximately four times the cost of conventional jet fuel. Analysts warn that this volatile, illiquid market is destabilizing and risks eroding confidence among investors and policymakers. It appears there simply aren’t enough used fryers in the world – or, as one expert put it, “There are not enough McDonald’s on the planet to feed 30,000 planes every day” – to meet growing demand through traditional feedstocks alone.

With the supply shortage being so acute, the targets set by airlines are now “beyond the reach of the vast majority,” according to IATA Director General Willie Walsh at the IATA Global Media Day. Never one to mince words, Walsh described the pace of progress toward net zero as “disappointing and worrying,” making the ambition “more and more challenging and more expensive”. The hard numbers bear this out: the growth rate for SAF production is slowing down. While SAF output is expected to hit 1.9 Mt in 2025 (making up 0.6% of consumption), growth is projected to crawl to 2.4 Mt in 2026, reaching only 0.8% of jet fuel consumption.

The core of the problem, according to IATA, is that regulators introduced mandates, particularly in Europe, that have not spurred greater production but have instead led to “price gouging” by fuel suppliers. Rather than increasing supply, suppliers are allegedly abusing their position to introduce “compliance fees,” which are nothing more than costs passed on to airlines to shield themselves from penalties for not meeting the mandated targets.

This behavior, which Walsh called “ripping us off,” resulted in a staggering cost for airlines operating within Europe and the UK in 2025. Of the $2.9 billion premium paid for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available, $1.5 billion was incurred solely as these compliance fees. This artificial price hike has made SAF up to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Walsh criticized regulators for introducing a mandate that “has driven this behaviour” and the fuel suppliers for failing to deliver production while protecting their profitability.

Airlines are thus forced to hold onto older aircraft, pushing the average fleet age above 15 years. The result? Expected fuel efficiency gains for the industry have slowed drastically, projected to be only 1.0% in 2026, down from a historical average of 2.0% per year. The sector is currently stuck in a climate Catch-22: unable to access the clean fuel they are mandated to buy, and unable to acquire the cleaner planes they need to reduce consumption.

Tackling Non-CO2 Effects

Finally, aviation is confronting its “other” climate problem: contrails. These thin ice-crystal clouds, formed by aircraft exhaust, are now recognized as capable of generating a warming effect that can exceed the CO₂ emissions of the flight itself.

The UK has launched the QRITOS project, led by Rolls-Royce, British Airways, and Heathrow, to study how SAF deployment can be optimized to address this hidden danger. The crucial insight is that fuel chemistry matters: ultra-clean SAF, particularly that derived from the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, generates fewer soot particles, drastically reducing warming contrails.

Since SAF remains scarce, the solution is “precision deployment,” targeting the limited supply to specific flights, flight levels, and weather windows where persistent contrails are most likely to form, maximizing the climate benefit of every clean drop. It turns out that to truly clean up the skies, there is a need for fuel that is not just sustainable, but precision-engineered.

In Closing

The international push for Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a paradoxical story of unprecedented financial commitment colliding head-on with sobering scaling realities. Driven by key legislative actions, the European Union has pledged billions toward the required €100 billion ($108 billion) investment by 2035 to meet ambitious mandates, while the UK is establishing a statutory Revenue Certainty Mechanism to de-risk investment in domestic SAF projects. On the technology front, innovation is delivering new pathways, notably LanzaJet’s world-first commercial production of SAF from ethanol using its Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, a crucial step as traditional feedstock supplies face a potential plateau.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vYxv!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59509289-e100-4967-97d3-91334669804a_1794x1194.png",N,,2026-01-06 12:12:18.878056

The approval – issued with conditions – sets the stage for the next phase of planning and development.

The proposed renewable energy park aims to produce two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable methanol. These fuels will be produced using a fully integrated clean-energy system that brings together over 1 GW of renewable electricity generated from NSF’s planned solar and wind farms in the District of St. Mary’s, local sustainable biomass and water.

“This approval moves us one step closer to delivering the clean-energy solutions needed to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, which accounts for approximately one quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions,” said Andrew Parsons, Project Director for NSF. “We’re excited about the progress and the potential impact this project can have for Nova Scotia and beyond.”

SAF is made from renewable materials and performs just like traditional jet fuel. NSF plans to produce 165,000 tons of SAF annually, and the sustainable fuel is expected to cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than 85% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The project includes the construction of a renewable energy park at the site of Pieridae Energy Ltd.’s formerly proposed Goldboro Liquified Natural Gas Project. Nova Sustainable Fuels purchased the highly sought-after 266-acre development site with extensive existing permits in place in 2024.

Federal leaders also welcomed the progress. “Atlantic Canada offers exceptional conditions for renewable energy development, including strategic access to global markets, abundant resources and strong government support,” said the Honorable Laurel Broten, CEO of Invest in Canada. “Nova Sustainable Fuels’ progress reflects the region’s growing role in advancing clean energy solutions, and we welcome this milestone as Canada continues to provide a safe, stable environment for transformative projects.”

NSF intends to submit a second environmental assessment in 2027 for the renewable power generation components of the project. Construction is expected to commence in 2028 after all required permits have been obtained, and the project is expected to be operational in 2031. “We’re committed to doing this right and will continue to engage with local communities as the project progresses,” said Parsons. “Community feedback and local knowledge are essential, and we want to ensure this project delivers real benefits while respecting the people and environment of the area.”

What are the different types of sustainable fuels?

Sustainable fuels include the following:

Conventional biomass-based fuels are produced from organic matter, including food crops. These fuels are typically blended with small amounts of conventional fossil fuels.

Ethanol is a well-known conventional biofuel. First-generation ethanol is made from corn, while second-generation ethanol is produced from residues such as bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane processing. Ethanol is used primarily in gasoline blends.

Other biofuels include fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), a type of biodiesel derived from either vegetable oils or animal fats. Biomethanol is produced from agricultural residues, woody biomass, or byproducts from pulp mills. And biogas is produced through the anaerobic digestion of waste streams such as manure, food waste, or wastewater.

Drop-in sustainable fuels can be used in existing, conventional internal combustion engines (ICE). These can be produced from either edible or residue biomass sources by using low-carbon hydrogen or by synthesizing sustainable captured carbon and low-carbon hydrogen. Drop-in fuels have already been used as replacements for diesel, jet fuel, and natural gas.

Non-drop-in e-fuels or hydrogen-based fuels are manufactured by using captured carbon and hydrogen from low-carbon electricity sources (such as renewable or nuclear energy). Low-carbon hydrogen produced through electrolysis is also sometimes known as liquid hydrogen or gaseous hydrogen. When hydrogen is combined with acceptable sources of carbon, it can form e-fuels such as e-methanol or e-ammonia.

How can existing petroleum refineries be converted to produce sustainable fuels?

Petroleum refineries around the world are under pressure to ramp up sustainable-fuel production from a range of factors, such as changing market conditions, evolving environmental regulations, and higher costs. In response, leaders in the petroleum industry are looking to convert existing refineries to produce sustainable fuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. This kind of conversion can be faster and more cost effective than constructing brand-new production facilities for renewable fuel.

The major considerations for converting existing refineries include the availability of feedstock and the plant’s current configuration and production capacity. Refineries that are close to big cities will have access to a steady supply of used cooking oil, for example, whereas those close to ethanol production facilities will have access to soybean oil or distillers corn oil. Government incentives to make these changes vary by region, as does market demand.

What Are the Major Trends in the Sustainable Fuel Market?

Regulatory Mandates: Governments and international organizations, including the IMO and ICAO, are intensifying regulations and blending mandates to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. This regulatory clarity fosters increased investment and adoption within the aviation and maritime industries.

Scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): SAF has achieved commercial advancement, with global production projected to double. Significant airline commitments and refinery expansions.

Expansion of Synthetic E-Fuels: E-fuels, produced by integrating green hydrogen with captured CO2, represent the fastest-growing segment of this technology. Although presently costly, they offer the potential for an unlimited, net-zero carbon supply compatible with existing internal combustion engines.

Innovation and Digitalization: Innovation led the product development and optimized the solution, while digital integration involves smart systems, especially in automation.

Decarbonization of Maritime and Heavy Industry: The adoption of sustainable fuels in shipping is increasing in response to increasingly stringent IMO regulations and the global shift toward a carbon neutrality target.

Commitments and Strategic Collaborations: Airlines, shippers, and fuel producers are establishing strategic partnerships and long-term supply agreements aimed at meeting ambitious net-zero and ESG objectives, thereby reducing investment risks and reinforcing supply networks.

MIAMI, Jan. 06, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF), a Delaware-incorporated company advancing enzymatic biorefining solutions for renewable fuels and functional nutrition, today announced Strategy 2026, outlining its transition from technology validation to disciplined, industrial-scale commercialization across global energy and wellness markets.

Strategy 2026 prioritizes the scaling of UMeWorld’s Malaysia-based biofuel platform to address the global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) opportunity, alongside continued expansion of its DAGola™ functional nutrition platform.

Strategy 2026: Global Industrial Execution

B2B Ingredient Strategy

Building on the commercial validation of DAGola™, UMeWorld is expanding its enzymatic processing capabilities into a high-margin B2B ingredient strategy, supplying global food and ingredient manufacturers with clinically validated diacylglycerol (DAG) oils designed to improve lipid metabolism in consumer products.

Capital Markets Readiness

The Company is preparing for a potential uplisting to the NYSE American or Nasdaq, leveraging its Delaware corporate structure and international operating footprint to attract institutional ESG- and energy-transition-focused capital.

Biofuel Platform: Addressing the SAF Feedstock Constraint

UMeWorld’s biofuel strategy targets one of the primary bottlenecks limiting global SAF adoption: the scalable availability of low-carbon, waste-based feedstock.

Malaysia Pilot Facility

Capacity: 10,000-tonne annual nameplate capacity

Feedstock: Locally sourced POME, used cooking oil, and animal fats

Regulatory Alignment: Engineered to meet EU ReFuelEU Aviation carbon-intensity thresholds

As part of its execution strategy, UMeWorld has received a proposal from an experienced international biofuel engineering group to support detailed process design, plant engineering, and project management for the Malaysia facility. The proposed scope includes process integration, equipment specification, construction oversight, and commissioning support, with the objective of accelerating industrial validation while maintaining capital discipline. The engineering group under consideration has prior experience supporting the delivery of waste-based biofuel and renewable diesel facilities at commercial scale.

In parallel, UMeWorld has identified a qualified general contractor with experience in industrial energy and biofuel infrastructure to support construction execution for the Malaysia pilot facility. The Company is currently advancing site selection within Malaysia, evaluating locations based on feedstock availability, logistics access, utilities, permitting considerations, and development timelines. To support local development, permitting, and project execution, the Company plans to establish a wholly owned subsidiary in Malaysia to serve as the operating entity for the biofuel pilot facility.

“The Malaysia facility is the cornerstone of our industrial strategy,” said Michael Lee, Chief Executive Officer of UMeWorld. “By validating our enzymatic process configuration and operating model at industrial scale, we are establishing a replicable blueprint for future SAF deployment while maintaining execution discipline.”

Functional Nutrition: Regional Validation and U.S. Expansion

UMeWorld’s DAGola™ brand serves as the commercial proof-of-concept for the Company’s enzymatic processing platform and its ability to execute localized production and distribution strategies across markets.

APAC Performance: Following a late-December 2025 regional launch, DAGola™ generated approximately USD $132,934 in initial unaudited revenue.

January 2026 Outlook: Based on secured distributor orders, management expects January regional revenue to scale to approximately USD $1.10 million, representing an eight-fold increase over the launch period.

United States Production & Expansion: DAGola™ products for the U.S. market are bottled in California, supporting regulatory compliance, supply-chain resilience, and brand positioning. In addition, localized production and bottling mitigate tariff exposure and cross-border trade friction. The Company intends to pursue similar localized production and bottling strategies in other international markets, where appropriate, to improve logistics efficiency, tariff management, and market responsiveness.

Corporate Governance and Capital Markets Readiness

In October 2025, the Company completed a statutory merger under which UMeWorld Inc., a Delaware corporation, became the surviving legal entity. Operations are conducted through the Delaware entity, supporting the Company’s U.S. reporting framework and global operating strategy.

Because the Company’s shares trade on the OTC Markets, certain corporate actions associated with the merger, including issuer name changes and related matters, remain subject to review and effectiveness by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Until that process is completed, public disclosures continue to reference UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF) for trading and reporting purposes.

The Company’s operational activities are centered in Miami, Florida, with Asia-Pacific operations being established in Malaysia to support regional management, manufacturing coordination, and future growth initiatives.

Uplisting Preparation

UMeWorld has engaged investment banking advisors to support a potential uplisting to the NYSE American or Nasdaq, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. Management believes such a transition would enhance trading liquidity, broaden institutional participation, and support the Company’s long-term growth strategy.

2026 Outlook

Entering 2026, UMeWorld believes it is positioned with:

Demonstrated commercial revenue traction across international markets

A scalable enzymatic platform spanning functional nutrition and renewable energy

A defined, EU-aligned pathway toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) commercialization

A focused U.S. expansion strategy for DAGola™, supported by localized production

Strengthening corporate governance and capital markets infrastructure

“Our focus in 2026 is execution,” Lee added. “We are building credibility through real commercialization and disciplined growth, with the objective of creating durable long-term value for shareholders.”

Chicago, Illinois--(Newsfile Corp. - January 6, 2026) - SYNTHOLENE ENERGY CORP (TSXV: ESAF) (""Syntholene"" or the ""Company"") announces that the Company's common shares have been approved for listing and have commenced trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse) under the trading symbol FSE: 3DD0. The Frankfurt co-listing is intended to broaden the Company's European investor audience and increase visibility within one of the world's most important clean energy and synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) markets.

The Frankfurt Stock Exchange is one of the largest and most liquid securities markets in Europe, and serves as a primary access point for European institutional and retail investors. The Company's primary listing remains on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol ESAF.

""Listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is a strategically important step for Syntholene,"" stated Syntholene CEO Dan Sutton. ""Europe is the center of global eSAF and eFuel markets today through its mandated demand, and policies encouraging market growth. Providing European investors with direct access to our shares aligns our capital markets strategy with the strongest structural tailwinds for eSAF. We view this as a natural extension of our TSXV listing and a foundation for long-term engagement with European stakeholders as we drive deployment of production infrastructure within the European Economic Zone.""

Syntholene believes the Frankfurt co-listing supports the Company's presence and investor access in Europe, which is an important market for eSAF. The European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates rising sustainable aviation fuel blending requirements across all major EU and European Economic Zone airports beginning in 2025 (EASA). These binding requirements, combined with targeted eSAF subsidies of up to €6 per liter (Reuters) for qualifying synthetic fuels, create one of the world's most robust and durable demand frameworks for producers of next-generation eFuels.

eFuel Market

Synthetic aviation fuel is a clean, drop-in-ready jet fuel made from renewable power, green hydrogen, and captured CO₂, offering up to 90% lower lifecycle emissions and helping airlines meet global decarbonization mandates without changing their aircraft engines or retrofitting.

The broader global aviation fuel market size was valued by Fortune Business Insights at USD 391.23 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 431.70 billion in 2024 to USD 819.73 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.35% during the forecast period (Fortune Business Insights).

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sustainable aviation fuel market is projected to expand from an estimated USD 2.06 billion in 2025 to approximately USD 25.62 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 65.5%.

Within these projections lies the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, the European Union's landmark mandate requiring airlines and fuel suppliers to adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at all major EU and EU Economic Zone airports starting in 2025. The regulation sets binding, rising SAF blending requirements of 2% in 2025, 6% in 2030, 20% in 2035 and up to 70% by 2050, creating one of the world's largest guaranteed markets for clean jet fuel (EASA).

The EU has also paired this demand-side measure with a supply-side subsidy, offering up to 6€ per liter to airlines that purchase eSAF specifically (Reuters). The combination of mandated demand and subsidized supply underscores the EU's seriousness about bolstering the rapid scale-up of eSAF production from producers like Syntholene.

The 12-month average blend rate, which reflects longer-term trends, also hit a record of 10.48 percent in October.
Expanding availability of E15 appears to be the driving factor in the blend rate increase, according to RFA.
In Iowa, for example, E15 accounted for roughly 25 percent of total gasoline sales in November, virtually doubling since the start of 2025.
“Indeed, EIA’s data clearly show that the average ethanol blend rate actually reversed course and fell when EPA granted SREs en masse in the 2018-19 timeframe and failed to reallocate the lost volume.","Ethanol accounted for 11.06 percent of the nation’s gasoline in October, marking the first time in history that the monthly ethanol “blend rate” has topped 11 percent, according to newly released data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The Renewable Fuels Association said the record-high blend rate reflects the expanding use of E15 and flex fuels like E85, and should put to rest—once and for all—the myth that a so-called “blend wall” prevents ethanol from making up more than 10 percent of the gasoline pool.

The 12-month average blend rate, which reflects longer-term trends, also hit a record of 10.48 percent in October. Expanding availability of E15 appears to be the driving factor in the blend rate increase, according to RFA. In Iowa, for example, E15 accounted for roughly 25 percent of total gasoline sales in November, virtually doubling since the start of 2025. And with E15’s legal approval in California in October, RFA is working with retailers in that state to make the more affordable blend available to Golden State drivers as soon as possible.

“The new data from EIA and the Iowa Department of Revenue provide clear evidence that ethanol is continuing to gain market share in the U.S. fuel market as American drivers increasingly choose lower-cost, cleaner-burning E15 and flex fuels like E85,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “The numbers also prove that the fictitious ‘blend wall’ is nothing but an imaginary barrier created by those who oppose American-made renewable fuels produced from American-grown crops.”

Cooper noted that expanding sales of E15 in 2025 were facilitated, in part, by the Trump Administration’s timely issuance of emergency fuel waivers allowing E15 sales to continue throughout the summer months. However, the emergency waivers are a “band-aid fix,” he said. “To truly unleash lower-cost E15 in the marketplace, we need Congress to pass legislation that permanently removes the decades-old regulatory red tape that prevents most retailers from offering E15 to their customers during the busy summer driving season. Passing year-round E15 legislation would not only continue to build on the progress we saw in 2025, but it would also open a badly needed new market opportunity for our nation’s farmers.”

RFA also underscored the importance of quickly finalizing EPA’s proposed 2026-27 renewable volume obligations, which include the highest-ever renewable fuel blending requirements. “The continued expansion of E15 depends, in large part, on EPA’s pending action to finalize robust RFS volumes for 2026-27 and full reallocation of any small refinery exemptions granted for 2023 and later compliance years,” Cooper said. “Indeed, EIA’s data clearly show that the average ethanol blend rate actually reversed course and fell when EPA granted SREs en masse in the 2018-19 timeframe and failed to reallocate the lost volume. Farmers, ethanol producers, and consumers simply can’t afford a repeat of the demand destruction we experienced due to SREs seven years ago.”

Based on EIA’s latest short-term energy outlook, maintaining an average blend rate of 11 percent for a full year would equate to 15 billion gallons of domestic ethanol consumption.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/691/1000/gas-station-night.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 09:57:19.918549

So in terms of availability, where is this agricultural biomass?
The REFRAME project is part of Schmidt Sciences’ Virtual Institute on Feedstocks of the Future (VIFF).","NC State University researchers will use a grant from Schmidt Sciences to develop an AI-enabled, open-source platform that can analyze the potential to convert agricultural leftovers — biomass such as misshapen sweet potatoes or their discarded green tops — into biofuels or other bioproducts, creating new business opportunities.

The four-year project, Resource Engineering Framework for Responsible, Augmented Modeling and Engagement (REFRAME), supports the path to a circular bioeconomy, where biomass is repurposed to create new materials. This approach reduces waste, creates opportunities for entrepreneurs, and provides new sources of income for farmers and agribusinesses.

To find the best ways of converting sweet potatoes and green tops into biofuel, for example, a sustainable aviation fuel company will be able to use the new platform to analyze the current yield in an area and determine where to locate a collection facility or biorefinery. The platform will be designed to assist farmers, processing plants, researchers and policymakers in making decisions.

NC State University’s Daniela Jones will lead the project. She is an assistant professor in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, joint appointment faculty member with Idaho National Laboratory, and N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative Education and Workforce Development Platform director. REFRAME co-leads are NC State University’s Debjani Sihi from the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, Joe Sagues from the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, and Cranos Williams from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Additional collaborators are from Idaho National Laboratory, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, ICF International and McCarl & Associates.

We asked principal investigator Jones to explain the team’s plan for REFRAME.

How will you approach the REFRAME project?

My expertise is in supply chain analytics, so our efforts cover the full supply chain. So in terms of availability, where is this agricultural biomass? In terms of accessibility, how do we move it from point A to point B? How can we characterize it? What are its qualities? What can it become through conversion? What would be the cost? What would be the impact or the shock from introducing a new product into the market? How would farmers respond? How would biomanufacturing affect land use? These are examples of the questions we want to be able to answer much more rapidly with an AI-enabled platform.

Will you incorporate any existing digital models or tools?

For all of these supply chain components, we have identified some legacy models, models that have been developed for years that are open source and that have been tackling one aspect of the supply chain — for example, agronomic models that analyze availability of biomass. However, these legacy models have always worked in silos. A lot of people have worked very diligently on one model, but strong connections between models don’t currently exist. The pipeline, in waiting for the delivery of one model’s output so that it can go into another as an input, takes months and years.

How will you apply AI to help with these issues?

What we are creating is first a digital backbone, a digital environment where we can store and have the computing capacity to be able to run a model multiple times so that we can create AI surrogates that are much faster. By creating simplified versions of these models that run faster, we have the potential to predict things that were not previously possible with the legacy models. So that’s the gist of it. We will create this pipeline of models and it will become accessible to anyone out there as an AI-enhanced, open-source platform.

The new stretched A350 widebody touched down at 10:41 am local time in Taipei on January 6, 2026, according to Flightradar24. The new jet will bring a greater capacity airframe to the steadily growing STARLUX stable of Airbus jets.

STARLUX & Airbus: Growing Together

STARLUX has proven to be a strong customer of the A350 family, and the airline’s 28-strong fleet exclusively consists of Airbus jetliners. Last year at the Paris Air Show, the airline ordered 10 more A350-1000 variants, adding to an order that also includes A350F cargo models. The Airbus A350 family is steadily growing as the maker attempts to recapture the market segment that has been dominated by the 787 Dreamliner.

Although the composite Boeing jet beat the A350 to market, the latter offers more range and greater capacity than even the largest 787-10 variant. This, combined with the reputational dent that Boeing has suffered in recent years, has helped the European manufacturer gain favor with operators like STARLUX. STARLUX Airlines CEO Glenn Chai made these remarks following the carrier’s additional order of A350-1000s in June 2025:

“Expanding our international fleet with additional A350-1000s is a significant step toward reinforcing our global presence. (...) [It is] the perfect fit for our strategy to optimise long-haul operations while delivering an exceptional passenger experience.”

A First For STARLUX & Taiwan

STARLUX’s rivals in Taiwan, EVA Air and China Airlines, have also ordered the A350-1000 but have yet to receive their first examples. As Air Insight reported, STARLUX was the first to sign on the dotted line for the extra-long A350-1000 at the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2018.

The airline’s competitors did not finalize their first order until 2025, highlighting how early adoption of Airbus's latest and greatest clean sheet airliner is giving STARLUX a leg up today. With the first already on the ramp in Taipei, the airline has a backlog of 17 A350-1000s expected to be delivered in the future.

STARLUX also flies the A350-900, the first of which was received in 2022. The exceptional fuel efficiency and range, paired with the dramatically improved cabin comfort of the A350XWB has been received enthusiastically. In addition to the growing order book of STARLUX Airlines, more operators around the Asia Pacific region have shown strong interest in A350 models, such as Cathay Pacific and others.

The XWB Difference

The A350, also known as the XWB for 'eXtra WideBody,' is the first Airbus jet made from scratch with composite materials in mind as the primary basis for its construction. The aircraft has proven to be exceptionally fuel efficient, low maintenance, reliable, quiet, and, thanks to its very strong fuselage, much more comfortable for passengers. Inside the A350 are upgrades that are both obvious immediately once you step on board, and those that are invisible but make a dramatic difference.

The cabin is pressurized to a lower altitude than legacy aircraft and has a higher humidity level, significantly reducing discomfort in flight and jet lag after landing. Airbus notes that the A350 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel ( SAF) in its effort to greatly reduce emissions, even beyond the 25% lower fuel consumption levels already offered by the jet. Airbus aims to make its aircraft up to 100% SAF capable by 2030.

The A350 family has more than 1,400 orders from 60 customers, with 157 ordered in 2025, and over 650 planes in service with 38 operators today. There were 44 A350s delivered in 2025. The manufacturer's scramble to achieve its 2025 goal of 820 deliveries saw 793 reach customers before the new year. While falling short of the original goal, that number was right on target for the revised tally after supplier issues slowed things down.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tail-livery-of-the-first-starlux-a350-1000.jpg?w=1200&h=675&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-06 08:57:09.951311

The proposal would amend Decree 1073 of 2015 and introduce changes to how locally produced and imported gas is declared and sold.
The ministry said recent developments in the natural gas market have exposed structural weaknesses that require government action.
This has increased Colombia’s reliance on imported gas, exposing the country to international price fluctuations and logistical risks.
Industry body Naturgas said Colombia now has limited flexibility because of falling domestic gas supply, rising imports and delays in major strategic projects.","Biogas and biomethane could help Colombia reduce its dependence on foreign natural gas during periods of supply pressure, according to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, reports Bnamericas.

The ministry said studies carried out by the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME) show that Colombia has strong potential to produce biogas and biomethane using agricultural waste, livestock residues and organic urban waste.

To make use of this potential, the ministry has issued a draft decree proposing technical rules for bringing these alternative fuels into the energy system. The proposal would amend Decree 1073 of 2015 and introduce changes to how locally produced and imported gas is declared and sold.

The ministry said recent developments in the natural gas market have exposed structural weaknesses that require government action. It said intervention is needed to address market imbalances, protect competition, ensure supply security and safeguard consumers.

According to the ministry, gas producers have been reporting steadily lower production capacity. Current projections suggest output could fall to between 750 and 780 billion British thermal units per day by 2027, compared with earlier estimates of more than 1,000 BBTU per day.

It added that actual gas production has been running 5 to 15 per cent below declared capacity due to maintenance work, operational issues and the natural decline of mature gas fields. This has increased Colombia’s reliance on imported gas, exposing the country to international price fluctuations and logistical risks.

Industry body Naturgas said Colombia now has limited flexibility because of falling domestic gas supply, rising imports and delays in major strategic projects. It said average gas supply over the past five years stood at about 1,074 BBTU per day, but declining local production has meant that between 7 and 19 per cent of gas used in 2024 and 2025 had to be imported. So far this year, imports account for about 20 per cent of total gas consumption.

The Ministry of Mines and Energy has invited public comments on the draft decree, which can be sent by email. The full proposal and supporting documents have been made available for review.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Biogas-7.png,N,,2026-01-06 08:57:17.247137

This proactive commitment has now reached a new milestone: decarbonising our air freight. We are proud to announce a new partnership with DHL Express to reduce 100% of our share of air freight emissions in the DHL transport network.

Starting January 2026, we invest in reducing emissions corresponding to 100% of our B2B and B2C jewellery distribution emissions through DHL GoGreen Plus. As part of DHL’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, GoGreen Plus is a logistics solution that enables businesses to lower their indirect supply chain (Scope 3) emissions through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This powerful collaboration cements our shared commitment to sustainability and ensures our deliveries are part of our aim to reduce emissions throughout our supply chain. By integrating SAF, we are offering a tangible, low-carbon solution; marking a major milestone in our ongoing sustainability journey.

THE IMPACT

SAF can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 80%* over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel. In other words, a single air shipment can not be fully climate-neutral in itself. However, the ambitious companies that take part in investing in SAF can reduce up to 100% of their share of air emissions within the logistics network through a book-and-claim system.

THE SCIENCE

Unlike traditional fuel, which releases carbon locked away underground, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a biofuel made from non-fossil, renewable resources. SAF is an alternative liquid fuel, with a drastically lower environmental impact than traditional jet fuel. It utilises certified feedstock such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and agricultural waste.

THE CYCLE

Because the feedstock absorbs carbon during its lifecycle, the carbon released when SAF is burned is largely balanced, significantly reducing carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

Since beginning our emissions reporting in 2021, we have proactively sought ways to lower our footprint by adopting recyclable materials and altering business practices. Our total emissions for 2024 equated to 324 tCO2e, a 6% emission reduction from the previous year. Transportation and distribution (part of Scope 3 emissions) represented 29,6% of our total emissions during 2024 - presenting our second biggest driver of emissions. With ambitious growth targets going forward, reducing distribution emissions will be crucial to make a difference across our value chain.

In our commitment to drive sustainable change, we strategically invested in SAF to achieve a 30% reduction in emissions for our B2C jewellery distribution in 2024. Building on this progress, we increased the impact to a 50% emission reduction across both B2C and B2B in 2025. This corresponded to reducing half of all jewellery shipment emissions in our logistics chain; from supplier and wholesale shipments to online orders. Starting January 2026, we substantially increase our investment across B2C and B2B, reducing 100% of our share of air emissions across the DHL transport network.

The shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel not only reduces our carbon footprint over time, but also supports the global transition to cleaner logistics solutions. While there’s a long journey ahead reaching net zero in carbon air freight, SAF remains the closest solution to this goal. This vital step represents a significant transformation, reflecting our belief that responsible business practices require action beyond the industry standard.

In 2025, the company advanced several key levers of its sustainability strategy, from scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to electrifying last‑mile delivery and building solar‑powered infrastructure. These achievements mark meaningful progress toward DHL’s goal of net‑zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and reinforce its role in building more sustainable, efficient, and resilient global trade. Here are five milestones that defined this progress.

Advancing sustainable aviation: Largest SAF agreement in the U.S.

Air freight remains the most carbon-intensive mode of transport per ton-kilometer, and DHL has been a pioneer in adopting SAF since 2021. In 2025, DHL signed one of its largest-ever SAF agreements with Phillips 66: over 240,000 metric tons (approximately 314 million liters) of SAF over three years. This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e – about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL’s West Coast operations.

Cutting emissions at sea: Partnership with CMA CGM

Ocean freight moves most global goods, making sustainable marine fuel (SMF) critical for reducing emissions. DHL and CMA CGM partnered to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO₂e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions). That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport.

Hydrogen on the horizon: First pilot in the Middle East

Hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonizing long-haul logistics, providing longer range than electric trucks.

The year is likely to be rough for many companies commercializing biobased chemicals and fuels, according to Jim Flatt, CEO of DMC Biotechnologies.
Flatt said biobased chemicals will have an easier time than sustainable fuels because the sector enjoys fewer federal subsidies.
He said he’s always urged his bioeconomy peers to have business plans that benefit from subsidies but don’t require them.
Even as subsidies wane, some biobased fuel firms will also advance in 2026.","The world of biobased chemicals will be tumultuous in 2026. In some corners, new technology platforms will emerge, and companies will start to produce meaningful volumes. In other corners, start-ups and projects will falter and fall as an uncertain policy environment scares off investors, especially in the US.

The year is likely to be rough for many companies commercializing biobased chemicals and fuels, according to Jim Flatt, CEO of DMC Biotechnologies. The US government has pulled sharply away from supporting cleantech, and many consumer-facing firms that were interested in the environmental benefits of biobased feedstocks are backing away from their sustainability goals in response.

Flatt said biobased chemicals will have an easier time than sustainable fuels because the sector enjoys fewer federal subsidies. He said he’s always urged his bioeconomy peers to have business plans that benefit from subsidies but don’t require them. “The companies that make it through this will have the ability to thrive.”

DMC, one of C&EN’s 10 Start-Ups to Watch in 2022, said at the Alternative Fuels and Chemicals Coalition’s recent annual meeting in Washington, DC, that this year, it will start selling myo-inositol to the nutraceutical market at a scale of hundreds of metric tons and L-alanine to cleaning-product makers at thousands of metric tons. DMC installs metabolic switches in fermentation microbes so that operators can toggle between growth and production phases with simple chemical cues.

Other firms are doing this kind of biosynthesis outside the cell. One start-up that even pulls its name from the idea is eXoZymes. Chief Commercial Officer Damien Perriman said at the meeting that he hopes the name is so clear it gets genericized, like Kleenex or Dumpster, as a shorthand for the concept. The firm is using artificial intelligence along with reams of public and private protein-structure data to reengineer natural enzymes so they are stable and efficient in a reactor instead of a cell.

Part of the appeal of cell-free biosynthesis is not having to tend to the needs of a complex, living organism to keep reactors running, said Alex Rosay, CEO of Cascade Biocatalysts. Rosay’s start-up immobilizes and protects enzymes within polymer brushes affixed to tiny silica beads. The enzymes still need some babying, such as a steady supply of cofactors or metal ions, but all the sugar or other biochemical fuel goes to the desired reaction instead of being split between chemical production and cellular reproduction.

Even as subsidies wane, some biobased fuel firms will also advance in 2026. Nearly all the biofuels on the market today are made by upgrading used vegetable oil, but the supply of that feedstock is nearly all spoken for, according to Keith Gillard, CEO of Sustaero. The firm is converting old wood pulp mills to make syngas and liquid fuels instead of paper; its first plant is scheduled to come on line in 2029.

The alcohol-to-jet fuel company Gevo, meanwhile, expects to approve a final investment decision this year on a plant in North Dakota that would make 114 million L per year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from ethanol. Other routes to SAF are progressing too, such as Captis Aire’s thermochemical process to make the fuel from wood-waste terpenes and Twelve’s electrolysis stack that makes it from carbon dioxide via carbon monoxide. Captis Aire has sold a full barrel of fuel from its pilot plant in Arizona, and Twelve is constructing a demonstration-scale plant in Washington State.

These investments aside, a US policy environment that is unfriendly now and uncertain for the future will push bioeconomy investment dollars overseas, predicted Joanne Ivancic, executive director of the advocacy nonprofit Advanced BioFuels USA. China is rapidly adding the renewable electricity infrastructure that’s needed to produce low-carbon fuels and chemicals, Europe is enacting policies that mandate the use of biobased and circular feedstocks, and global consumer demand for sustainable products is growing every year.

Investors won’t stop trying to capitalize on the sustainability megatrend just because the US market has become inhospitable for cleantech, Ivancic said. Instead, they’ll look elsewhere for projects they can invest in safely.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/WCO--Biobased-chemicals-and-fuels---266250:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2026-01-06 08:58:22.959380

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry.

IATA reports SAF production reached 1.9 million tonnes in 2025, criticises EU and UK mandates for limiting supply and raising costs for airlines.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released updated estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, highlighting challenges in scaling the industry. In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024. Growth is projected to slow in 2026, reaching 2.4 million tonnes. Despite this increase, SAF will account for only 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8 per cent in 2026. At current prices, the SAF premium will add approximately USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

The downward revision from earlier forecasts reflects insufficient policy support to fully utilise installed SAF capacities. SAF costs exceed conventional jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption. In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have raised profit margins so that airlines pay up to five times the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation. In the UK, SAF mandates have also triggered price spikes, forcing airlines to absorb significant costs. In total, airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 million tonnes of SAF available in 2025.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognise that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The shortfall in SAF supply will force many airlines to review their 2030 SAF commitments. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), policymakers must avoid repeating previous mistakes. “Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2463328421-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 08:58:29.937566

Segmental Analysis

By Feedstock Type, Which Strain Balances High Lipid Content with Cultivation Robustness?

Nannochloropsis spp. leads the segment with a 28% share. This genus is favored for its naturally high lipid yield, particularly triglycerides suitable for fuel conversion, and its resilience in varied cultivation conditions, including saline water.

Its predominance reflects a focus on strains that provide a strong baseline economic potential for lipid-per-acre metrics. The extensive research history and genetic tractability of Nannochloropsis also allow for further strain improvement through engineering, positioning it as a foundational organism for the first generation of commercial algae-to-jet fuel operations.

By Technology Route, Which Process Best Handles Wet Biomass and Delivers High-Qield Hydrocarbons?

Hydrothermal liquefaction is the leading technology at 38%. HTL’s advantage lies in its ability to process wet algae biomass directly, eliminating the energy-intensive drying step—a major cost hurdle. It efficiently converts the entire biomass, including proteins and carbohydrates, into a crude bio-oil that can be catalytically upgraded to jet-range hydrocarbons.

This whole-biomass utilization and compatibility with high-moisture feedstock make HTL the most promising pathway for achieving the necessary economic and energy balance for commercial scale, attracting significant R&D and pilot investment.

By End Use, Which Sector Provides the Anchor Demand and Willingness to Pay a Premium?

Commercial aviation is the dominant end-use segment, accounting for 56% of demand. Airlines are under the most intense regulatory and public pressure to decarbonize, facing mandates like the EU’s ReFuelEU and CORSIA. Their large, centralized fuel needs provide the volume necessary to justify large-scale biorefinery investments.

The sector’s ability to absorb a cost premium through sustainability surcharges or blended ticket prices creates the initial market pull, making commercial aviation the essential first customer for scaling microalgae SAF production.

What are the Drivers, Restraints, and Key Trends of the Sustainable Jet Fuel Microalgae Market?

Factor Type Elaboration Regulatory Blending Mandates Driver Policies like ReFuelEU legally require increasing SAF volumes, creating guaranteed demand and de-risking production investments. Capital Intensity & System Integration Restraint The need for massive photobioreactors or pond systems, plus downstream refining, requires billion-dollar investments and untested scale-up. Integration with Carbon Capture Trend Co-locating algae farms with industrial emitters (e.g., cement plants) transforms a cost center (CO2) into a feedstock, improving economics and LCA.

Analysis of the Sustainable Jet Fuel Microalgae Market by Key Countries

Country CAGR (2026 to 2036) China 18.10% India 17.30% USA 14.80% UK 13.90% Japan 12.70%

How is China's Command-Driven Industrial Ecology and Carbon Neutrality Pledge Catalyzing Scale?

China's leading 18.10% CAGR is a function of its state-capitalist model, where national carbon neutrality goals directly translate into targeted funding and pilot projects. Algae cultivation is strategically linked to industrial carbon capture from its vast manufacturing base.

The government can mandate pilot partnerships between state-owned energy giants, airlines, and research institutes, rapidly iterating and scaling integrated systems with a focus on controlling the entire technological value chain for future export.

What is the Impact of India's Focus on Energy Security and Non-Arable Land Utilization?

The DHL Group said it is on track with its net-zero goal by 2050, citing five key achievements in its global decarbonization journey last year.

In 2025, the company advanced several key levers of its sustainability strategy, including scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to electrifying last‑mile delivery and building solar‑powered infrastructure, the company said in a media release.

“These achievements mark meaningful progress toward DHL’s goal of net‑zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and reinforce its role in building more sustainable, efficient, and resilient global trade,” it said.

One of last year’s milestones was setting up solar-powered warehousing in Asia and continuing to explore facilities that produce or source renewable energy on-site, combining sustainability with energy self-sufficiency.

DHL launched a solar-powered warehouse in Thailand that is expected to generate 100% of its energy on-site through a 4.2 MWp solar array and advanced battery storage. This facility eliminates reliance on fossil-based grid electricity and sets a blueprint for future logistics infrastructure worldwide.

This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e – about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt, DHL said.

The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL’s West Coast operations.

At sea – where most global goods are moved, making sustainable marine fuel critical for reducing emissions – DHL said it has partnered with CMA CGM to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO₂e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions).

“That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport,” DHL said.

On land, hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonizing long-haul logistics, providing longer range than electric trucks. As such, DHL has been actively testing hydrogen trucks in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, and will now introduce them in the Middle East.

In recent years, CNSL, a fuel made from cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), emerged as a promising, but at times unreliable alternative to existing biofuels. Its tendency to polymerise and inability to reliably blend has been a cause of frustration among shipowners. This sticky characteristic isn’t surprising, though, given that it is traditionally used as a resin to thicken paint.

But now, through a proprietary upgrading process, MASH Makes developed a CNSL-based fuel that is clean-burning, stable, and suitable for commercial shipping.

The tested blend — 20% Upgraded CNSL and80% VLSFO — was evaluated at FVTR GmbH using a marinegrade single cylinder research engine. The fuel showed clean combustion, No injector fouling or residueand Stable operation across all loads, with no tuning or pressure adjustments required.

“The upgraded CNSL fuel from MASH Makes performed reliably across all tested loads, showing clean injection behaviour and no signs of degradation,” said Robert Bank, the team lead for team lead fuels and component analyses at FVTR.

“From a technical standpoint, it behaved comparably to conventional marine fuels.”

The upgraded CNSL also showed improved emissions compared to earlier blends: NOx slightly increased but stayed within IMO Tier II limits, CO levels remained stable, indicating good combustion and smoke decreasedat partial loads and increased only slightly at full load.

This test represents a key milestone in making CNSL a viable and scalable commercial fuel for shipping.

“This result proves that with the right upgrading process, CNSL can become a serious contender in marine fuels,” said MASH Makes head of research and development Krishna Chakravarty. “It’s cost-effective, scalable, and doesn’t require fossil infrastructure changes.

With this certification, Bunge becomes the first company worldwide to have soybeans approved under this high-level sustainability standard.","Bunge Brazil has received a major sustainability certification for soybeans supplied for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marking an important step in efforts to reduce emissions from air travel, reports Milling Middle East & Africa.

The certification, announced in late December 2025, confirms that the soybeans meet strict standards for traceability and environmental responsibility throughout the supply chain. It follows the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) framework used for biofuel raw materials.

The certification was granted by SCS Global Services under the ISCC CORSIA PLUS system, which is recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It includes the ISCC CORSIA PLUS Low-LUC seal, which ensures that the soybeans can be traced back to their origin and are produced under strict farming rules.

According to the certification, soybeans processed at the facility carry a low risk of indirect land-use change, a key requirement to ensure that SAF production does not lead to deforestation or environmental damage.

The initiative covers soybeans sourced from Bunge’s operations in the states of Mato Grosso and Goiás. These operations follow zero-deforestation commitments, promote soil-friendly farming methods, and aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Certified volumes are initially estimated at around 100,000 tonnes. These supplies are expected to support SAF producers, including Brazilian airlines and international fuel refiners working toward carbon-neutral flights by 2050.

Audits carried out as part of the certification confirmed compliance with no-burning practices, improved soil management, and protection of biodiversity.

The certification supports ICAO’s broader CORSIA programme, which requires airlines to cut emissions by using carbon offsets and cleaner fuels such as SAF.

With demand for SAF rising steadily, certified Brazilian soybeans could play an important role for airlines seeking to meet international climate requirements.

The process builds on Bunge’s fully traceable soy supply system, which has been expanded from 80 per cent coverage in the Cerrado region to full traceability. The system uses digital tracking to monitor the supply chain from farms to processing.

The soybeans also meet requirements under the European Union’s deforestation regulation set to take effect in 2026. These include farm location tracking and low-emission farming practices such as reduced soil disturbance and crop rotation.

Brazil, the world’s largest soybean exporter with annual shipments of about 170 million tonnes, is under increasing pressure to ensure sustainable sourcing as new European import rules come into force.

Industry observers say the move places Bunge ahead of competitors such as Cargill and ADM and could allow the company to earn higher prices for soybeans used in aviation fuel.

Global demand for SAF is growing by about 20 per cent each year, driven by ICAO climate policies. Brazil has set a target of blending five per cent SAF into aviation fuel by 2030.

With this certification, Bunge becomes the first company worldwide to have soybeans approved under this high-level sustainability standard. For Brazil, the development highlights the growing role of agriculture not only in food supply but also in supporting cleaner energy solutions to address climate change.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 08:59:16.147827

As 2025 began, the global aviation sector stood at a critical crossroads: Industry stakeholders were working to balance post-COVID recovery with ambitious net-zero emission goals. However, progress was shaped by various risks — economic, technological, ideological, and geopolitical. The biggest hurdle in aviation’s decarbonization journey remains the cost and availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), along with questions about its sustainability credentials. Despite this, 2025 saw major advancements across the sector.

In January, the European Union implemented its first SAF mandate through the RefuelEU Aviation Directive. The regulation requires airlines to blend SAF with conventional jet fuel, with minimum blending targ set for airports handling over 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tons of freight annually. In support of this mandate, the European Commission allocated over $110 million worth of EU Emissions Trading System allowances to help airlines cover the cost difference between fossil fuels and SAF.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) also made key progress by adopting a global framework for SAF, Low Carbon Aviation Fuels and other clean energy sources. An implementation roadmap and a long-term monitoring and reporting methodology were approved, with oversight by ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection.

In September, ICAO partnered with the International Renewable Energy Agency to launch Finvest@ETAF, a global portal designed to connect SAF developers with investors across the value chain. This initiative is expected to help accelerate investment and support the sector’s decarbonization goals. According to a Gena report published in August, a total of 11.3 million tons of SAF production capacity has reached final investment decision. The report forecasted a potential increase to 19 Mt annually by 2030 in a best-case scenario.

Meanwhile, several major companies announced agreements. In September, Catagen, a developer of modular SAF production systems, signed offtake agreements with Ryanair and Shell. The same month, Oneworld (a group of airline partners) joined forces through Breakthrough Energy Ventures to invest in next-generation SAF technologies, as reported by Green Air.

While challenges remain, particularly in technology scalability and fuel economics, coordinated efforts across research, policy and innovation are positioning aviation to take a leading role in the global climate response. Investment continues to pour into SAF, electric aviation and climate-aligned technologies, supported by international platforms like the G7 and G20, which reinforce the need for sustained global cooperation.

For ground transportation, sustainability is manifesting through a mix of technological innovation, consumer preferences and governmental regulations. There was a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles on the road, with global production exceeding 85 million vehicles, according to the International Energy Agency’s report, “Trends in the Electric Car Industry,” published in May. The reduction in the cost of solid-state batteries and an improvement in energy density helped. The EU’s Fit for 55” legislative package aims to install 3 million public chargers by 2030.

On another front, autonomous vehicles are moving into practical applications, including freight and logistics, and pilot programs leading to autonomous public transportation. In artificial intelligence-driven urban mobility, algorithms are being perfected to optimize traffic flows, predict demand, personalize mobility experiences, and improve safety. In March, Science News Today reported on the push to make hyperloop technology and high-speed rail transportation the way for future high-speed ground transportation. The Boring Company is striving to drastically cut-down travel time using zero-emission systems and in 2025 built 68 miles (109 km) of tunnels. Japanese trains such as Maglev and Europe’s Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) are making fast headway towards becoming the more sustainable mode of transportation between cities. The TEN-T’s completion dates are 2030 for the core network, 2040 for the extended core network, and 2050 for the comprehensive network.",https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SAF-fuel-loading.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 02:56:41.548313

Revealed on 5 January, the so-called Kahuewai Hawaii Investment Plan calls for sustained investment in Hawaiian’s physical and digital infrastructure, particularly in airports in Hawaii.

The Honolulu-based member carrier of Alaska Air Group plans to begin upgrading customer-facing technology –and the lobbies and gates at airports in Honolulu, Lihue, Kahului, Kona and Hilo – starting this year and continuing through decade-end.

Meanwhile, it will start overhauling its full fleet of A330s in 2028. New furnishings will include seats, carpets, lighting, first-class suites and a premium economy cabin.

Hawaiian says it is ”acquiring three of its A330 aircraft off lease to support the future of this fleet in its service across the Pacific”.

Fleets data provided by aviation analytics firm Cirium show that Hawaiian currently operates 33 A330-200s and -300s.

In addition to the newly announced investment plan, Alaska Air Group said last month it is investing in Hawaii-produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through partnerships with energy producer Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific.

The airline does not disclose financial details of those investments.

”Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation,” the airline group says.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian plan to become the launch customers for Par Hawaii’s locally produced SAF in the first quarter. Meanwhile the companies are studying the use of camelina sativa – a flowering plant that grows both agriculturally and naturally in Hawaii’s tropical climate – as feedstock for the development of future SAF products.

Pono Pacific says it is launching a subsidiary called Pono Energy to accelerate development of camelina as a source of feedstock.

The company says that camelina is a ”high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens”.

Using farmland to produce SAF for airline operations is controversial, as some studies have highlighted land-use issues such as reducing space available for food production.

He added that tenders for the superstructure of the new terminal are expected to be launched in the coming weeks.

""We were not sure what the future of aviation would hold,"" Siow said, referring to the collapse in air travel during the pandemic. But the government decided to go ahead, and the future now looks bright, he added.

Global air traffic is expected to double by 2050, with the Asia-Pacific region leading growth, according to projections cited by the minister. Terminal 5, scheduled to open in the mid-2030s, is intended to anchor Singapore's role in that expansion.

The mega terminal is being designed as a technology-intensive hub, featuring automation, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and robotics to support operations such as baggage and cargo handling. AI systems are also expected to improve flight planning, passenger services and responses to operational disruptions, including severe weather.

Terminal 5 will be fully electrified and designed to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel, positioning it as a key part of Singapore's push for greener aviation. Passenger experience is another focus, with plans for seamless journeys from immigration to boarding, reduced walking distances, and personalized retail and dining recommendations.

Once completed, Terminal 5 will lift Changi Airport's total passenger capacity by more than 55%, from 90 million to 140 million passengers a year. The terminal will be connected to existing terminals via a new underground people-mover system, allowing passengers to travel between Terminal 5 and Terminal 2 in about four minutes.

The expansion is also expected to create new jobs across the aviation sector, particularly in data science, systems operations and sustainability, areas officials say will appeal to younger Singaporeans.",https://vcdn1-english.vnecdn.net/2026/01/05/hte32q6cy5nvhb5go7l6ilpexa-176-7998-4222-1767614616.jpg?w=680&h=0&q=100&dpr=1&fit=crop&s=HuaZUVs9dDa7XZo3lWEwTw,N,,2026-01-05 22:57:07.047640

The airline: Turkish Airlines

Route Istanbul to Sydney, flight TK174

Frequency Daily

Aircraft Airbus A350-900 (359)

Class Economy; seat 16K, window

Flight time Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur is 10 hours, 15 minutes. The second leg Kuala Lumpur to Sydney is 7 hours, 25 minutes.

Checking in

I’ve seamlessly checked in at Frankfurt for a 7am connecting flight to Istanbul (Turkish Airlines flies to more countries in the world than any other airline). So boarding onto Sydney via Kuala Lumpur I’m already in the furthest flung corner of Europe, making the remaining journey feel mercifully short.

Advertisement

There’s a single flight number so we have one boarding pass and shuffle off (with carry ons) in Kuala Lumpur with time for a quick coffee to shuffle back onto the same plane – cleaned from tip to toe with refreshed pillows and blankets. Turkish Airlines doesn’t have rights between Malaysia and Australia, meaning it can’t carry passengers solely on that sector and can only fly passengers through to the final destination.

Baggage

Checked luggage is 23kg, 30kg, 35kg or 40kg depending on which of the four categories of economy fare has been booked. All fares include a cabin bag of up to eight kilograms.

Loyalty scheme

Miles & Smiles. The airline is a Star Alliance member, along with Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways and United Airlines, among many others.

The seat

The seats are comfortable at 18-inches (46cm) wide with a pitch (legroom) of 32 inches (81cm). Their A350-900 fleet has an average age of only 2.4 years, and the interior is a smart navy with stylish red pops.

Entertainment + tech

Thank you, plane gods – a USB port! (Along with other power points.) Turkish Airlines is a regular entertainment award winner, with options ranging from wildlife documentaries to the recent Mission:Impossible on a 13.3″ (34 cm) crystal clear touchscreen display.

Service

There’s five courteous, friendly crew serving the cabin, dispensing amenity packs – which have been cancelled by most airlines for economy passengers – a thoughtful touch I appreciate.

Food

Is it a burger? Is it a dish? On the first leg a ‘chicken burger’ is presented with chicken patty, sauteed vegetables, dips and bread roll on separate plates. Figuring it’s a build-your-own situation, I devour the extremely delicious maybe-burger. The second dish of traditional, juicy mince kofte with a succulent tomato bulgur, buttered rice and mung bean salad beautifully salutes their DNA as Turkey’s national flag carrier. Both meals are restaurant level in flavour and creativity.

My fork is poised excitedly during the second leg, but Malaysia catering hasn’t understood the assignment. A mushroom and omelette is piping hot and palatable, but something in my soul dies with the breakfast in a box. Like the chicken and Emmental panini, served later, I feel sad and soggy. Blast you, panini, we almost hit economy food perfection.

Sustainability

Turkish Airlines aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050 and is expanding the use of SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) to new routes. *

One more thing

Advertisement

Two free nights in a 4-star Istanbul hotel? Sign me up! The Turkish Airlines Stopover offer is like a mini bonus holiday and reason alone to fly with the airline.

The price

From about $1800 Sydney to Istanbul return in economy class. Flights to European cities with a lot of competition are cheaper, for example Sydney to Rome is just $1350 return; Sydney to Paris is $1450.

The verdict

Advertisement

“I’ve just booked them for Christmas, have I made a good choice?” a curious friend messages. “Excellent move! Won’t regret,” is my immediate reply. If you haven’t heard much about Turkish Airlines (yet), it’s because they began flying their own planes into Sydney and Melbourne in late 2024 (previously it was a codeshare partner to Asia). So now you can experience from our shores why they won Skytrax’s Best Airline in Europe award in 2025 for the 10th time.

The short legs from Istanbul make this feel like the world’s quickest flight to Europe, though it will feel even quicker when the airline launches its planned non-stop flights from Sydney to Istanbul this year. If it wasn’t for the greasy chicken panini in an otherwise gastronomic adventure, it would be top marks.

This represents a further thanfifty-fold increase, driven by strict nonsupervisory authorizations, ambitious airline decarbonisation targets, and evolving consumer demand for greener trip. This explosive growth signals a major metamorphosis for the global aeronautics assiduity and presents immense openings within the broader clean energy transition.

Unprecedented Market Growth Driven by Policy and Demand

exploration indicates the SAF request is poised for a composite periodic growth rate( CAGR) of around 43 from 2025 to 2035. This acceleration is n't simply academic ; it's unnaturally sustained by concrete policy fabrics. Leading the charge are blending authorizations from major nonsupervisory bodies.

The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation action, for case, requires that 6 of all aeronautics energy be sustainable by 2030, rising sprucely in posterior times. also, the United States has introduced its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, aiming to supply enough SAF to meet 100 of public aeronautics energy demand by 2050. coincidently, major airlines and commercial trip programmes are making bold net- zero commitments, creating a important,multi-faceted pull for SAF product.

Scaling Production: The HEFA Pathway Leads, New Technologies Emerge

presently, the dominant product system for SAF is the Hydroprocessed Esters and Adipose Acids( HEFA) pathway, which converts waste canvases , fats, and greases into energy. This technology is well- understood and certified for use, but it faces limitations regarding the scale and sustainability of its feedstock force.

To meet the colossal unborn demand, the assiduity is laboriously developing and spanning advanced pathways. These include

Alcohol- to- spurt( AtJ) Converting waste- grounded alcohols.

Power- to- Liquid( PtL) Using renewable electricity, water, and captured carbon dioxide to synthesise energy.

Gasification and Fischer- Tropsch( FT) Processing solid biomass or external solid waste.

Commercialising these technologies is critical to diversifying feedstocks beyond natural accoutrements and achieving truly scalable, low- carbon aeronautics energy product.

Navigating the Challenges to Widespread Adoption

Despite the auspicious outlook, significant hurdles must be overcome for the SAF request to realise its full eventuality. The most prominent challenge is cost; SAF remains significantly more precious than conventional spurt energy, frequently going two to five times as much.

This price gap necessitates probative government programs, similar as duty impulses and carbon pricing mechanisms, to ameliorate competitiveness. likewise, erecting the necessary product, storehouse, and distribution structure at a global scale requires enormous capital investment. Eventually, icing the environmental integrity of SAF through robust sustainability instruments and transparent lifecycle emigrations account is essential to maintain public and investor confidence.

A Catalyst for Broader Economic and Environmental Change

The rise of SAF extends far beyond the aeronautics sector. It's poised to stimulate invention and investment in conterminous diligence, including husbandry, waste operation, renewable energy, and carbon prisoner.

The development of a indirect bioeconomy, where waste aqueducts come precious feedstocks for energy, presents a compelling model for sustainable assiduity. Successfully spanning the SAF request is extensively viewed as anon-negotiable element of global sweats to achieve net- zero emigrations, offering a practical pathway to decarbonise a sector that's notoriously delicate to exhilarate.

Conclusion: A Sector Poised for Take-Off

The protuberance of a$ 350 billion SAF request by 2035 underscores a vital shift in the future of flight. While the path forward involves complex challenges related to technology, cost, and structure, the confluence of nonsupervisory pressure, commercial ambition, and technological progress creates important instigation.

The elaboration of this request will be a crucial index of the global frugality’s capacity to introduce and unite in pursuit of a sustainable future, unnaturally altering the environmental footmark of air trip for generations to come.",https://responsibleus.com/uploads/images/202601/image_750x415_695bd9014d9da.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 20:57:19.590951

Hawaiian framed the investment plan as part of Alaska Air Group’s Alaska Accelerate strategy for the combined airline group.
Our Kahu’ewai Hawai’i Investment Plan represents one of Hawaiian Airlines’ largest single investments in our infrastructure, products and services in Hawai’i.
It reflects our kuleana to our people and guests in the islands and reinforces our commitment to deliver safe and remarkable service that enables Hawai’i and Hawaiian Airlines to thrive.” Diana Birkett Rakow, Chief Executive Officer, Hawaiian Airlines “Hawaiian Airlines’ investment is exactly the kind of long-term commitment Hawaiʻi needs.
We appreciate Hawaiian Airlines’ partnership in advancing workforce development, regenerative tourism, clean energy, and community programs that reflect the values of our islands.”","Hawaiian Airlines has announced a more than $600 million, five-year investment program aimed at modernizing airport infrastructure across Hawaiʻi, improving digital and operational technology, and refreshing key elements of its onboard experience, while expanding community and sustainability initiatives in the islands.

The initiative, branded the Kahuʻewai Hawaiʻi Investment Plan, is designed to improve the guest journey from booking through day-of-travel and equip airport and in-flight employees with updated tools and workspaces. Hawaiian said the plan will also support efforts to advance lower-emission technologies and expand programs tied to regenerative tourism, culture, and conservation.

A central pillar of the investment is a multi-airport renovation program scheduled to run from 2025 through 2029. Hawaiian said it will renovate lobbies and gates at Honolulu, Līhuʻe, Kahului, Kona, and Hilo to improve passenger flow and comfort, with updated seating, expanded amenities, and additional power charging. In Honolulu, the carrier’s largest hub, Hawaiian plans to build a 10,600-square-foot premium lounge at the entrance to the Mauka Concourse in Terminal 1.

On the technology front, Hawaiian said it will launch a redesigned app and website in spring 2026, with updated functionality intended to simplify travel planning, booking, and trip management, including self-service capabilities such as changing flights and redeeming award travel on global partners. The airline is also investing in new technology to support employees across operations, and said the full impact of these improvements will be realized once Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines share the same passenger service system and Hawaiian joins the oneworld alliance, both targeted for late April 2026.

Hawaiian also outlined a longer-term cabin retrofit program for its widebody Airbus A330 fleet, based in Honolulu. Starting in 2028, the A330s are slated for a full interior upgrade that includes new seats, carpets, and lighting, as well as first-class suites and the introduction of a premium economy cabin. The carrier said the updated experience will include a Bluetooth-enabled in-flight entertainment system with high-definition seatback screens and an expanded content library, plus fast, free Starlink Wi Fi. Hawaiian also said it is acquiring three of its A330 aircraft off lease to support the long-term future of the fleet in its Pacific network.

The airline’s plan also includes new loyalty incentives targeted at residents. Hawaiian said it will provide Huakaʻi by Hawaiian loyalty members who live in Hawaiʻi with a 50% bonus on Atmos Rewards points and status points earned on Neighbor Island flights, adding to kamaʻāina benefits that it said already include a free checked bag, quarterly discounts when flying within the state, and monthly systemwide deals.

Beyond customer and operational upgrades, Hawaiian said it will expand partnerships in education and workforce development, pursue new grant-making opportunities, and extend sustainability investments focused on regenerative tourism and natural resource preservation. The carrier said it is expanding its partnership with business accelerator Mana Up by investing in the Mana Up Capital II fund to help more local companies scale globally. It noted it has featured more than a dozen local retailers on board since becoming Mana Up’s official airline sponsor in 2017.

Hawaiian also pointed to recent sustainable aviation fuel and emissions-related initiatives, including an investment tied to locally produced sustainable aviation fuel in partnership with Pono Pacific and Par Hawaii, with deliveries of Hawaiʻi-made sustainable aviation fuel expected later in 2026. The airline said it is also investing in hybrid electric propulsion developer Ampaire to support lower emission options for short haul flying and increasing the use of electric ground service vehicles at Honolulu airport.

As part of its community giving strategy, Hawaiian said it will provide grants to nonprofit organizations supporting cultural programs, environmental preservation, and the perpetuation of Native Hawaiian art and language through the Alaska Airlines | Hawaiian Airlines Foundation, a newly integrated 501(c)(3) foundation focused on these efforts in Alaska and Hawaiʻi. Hawaiian framed the investment plan as part of Alaska Air Group’s Alaska Accelerate strategy for the combined airline group.

The ""Kahuʻewai Hawai’i Investment Plan"" includes renovations to airport facilities in Honolulu, Līhuʻe, Kahului, Kona, and Hilo through 2029. The improvements will feature redesigned lobbies and gates with better seating, increased charging stations, and more amenities to improve passenger flow.

A new 10,600-square-foot premium lounge will be constructed at the entrance of Honolulu’s Mauka Concourse in Terminal 1, according to the press release.

The airline will also update its mobile app and website this spring to simplify travel planning and booking. Hawaiian’s fleet of widebody Airbus A330 aircraft will undergo interior upgrades starting in 2028, including new seats, carpets, lighting, first class suites, and the addition of a premium economy cabin.

Later this year, Hawaiian Airlines will offer Hawaii residents who are members of its Huaka’i loyalty program a 50% bonus on rewards points earned on inter-island flights, adding to existing local benefits.

""Our Kahuʻewai Hawai’i Investment Plan represents one of Hawaiian Airlines’ largest single investments in our infrastructure, products and services in Hawai’i,"" said Hawaiian Airlines CEO Diana Birkett Rakow in the statement.

The investment plan also includes community initiatives focused on sustainability, including an investment in locally produced sustainable aviation fuel. The airline stated it would be the first to take deliveries of Hawaii-made sustainable aviation fuel later this year.

The investment is part of Alaska Air Group’s broader strategic plan following its acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines.

In other recent news, Alaska Air Group has revised its fourth-quarter earnings forecast, significantly lowering its expected adjusted earnings per share to approximately $0.10, down from a previous guidance of at least $0.40. This adjustment is attributed to various operational challenges impacting the airline’s financial performance. Additionally, Alaska Airlines has announced plans to launch daily, year-round flights between Seattle and London Heathrow starting in May 2026, expanding its international service offerings. The airline will also introduce seven new nonstop routes from Anchorage and Portland, enhancing connectivity across its network starting in spring 2026. Furthermore, Alaska Airlines will resume nonstop service between Seattle’s Paine Field and Portland International Airport in June 2026, reconnecting major Pacific Northwest cities. In leadership updates, Alaska Air Group has appointed Ryan Sather as the new vice president of safety and security, responsible for overseeing and advancing the company’s safety strategies. These developments reflect Alaska Airlines’ ongoing efforts to expand its network and strengthen its operational framework.

The company creates Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), solar diesel, and solar gasoline.
Synhelion’s solar fuel production process involves creating renewable synthetic crude oil, or “syncrude,” using solar heat energy and sustainable materials.
Solar fuel can be produced and stored for when sunlight is unavailable, much like solar energy storage, giving the sustainable fuel an edge over fossil fuels.","Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and the cleantech company Synhelion have entered into a long-term offtake agreement for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Beginning in 2027, the airline will purchase at least 200 tons of solar-derived jet fuel annually.

The agreement establishes SWISS as the first airline to sign a binding five-year contract with Synhelion, supporting the commercial scale-up of synthetic fuel production. Under the partnership, SWISS acts as a customer, investor, and strategic partner.

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonising our flight operations,” said Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS.

“Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

Creating synthetic solar fuel

In 2024, Synhelion inaugurated DAWN: calling the project ‘the world’s first industrial plant for the production of solar fuels’. The company creates Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), solar diesel, and solar gasoline.

Synhelion’s solar fuel production process involves creating renewable synthetic crude oil, or “syncrude,” using solar heat energy and sustainable materials.

This syncrude is processed in existing refineries alongside fossil crude to produce certified Jet-A-1 fuel. The resulting fuel is compatible with current infrastructure and logistics chains, requiring no technical adjustments for delivery to airports.

Solar fuel can be produced and stored for when sunlight is unavailable, much like solar energy storage, giving the sustainable fuel an edge over fossil fuels.

“The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of our technology,” commented Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion.

“This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

Logistics

The partnership also involves logistics provider Kuehne+Nagel, which will purchase a portion of the solar fuel from SWISS. The fuel will be used for air freight via Swiss WorldCargo to help cargo customers reduce their carbon footprints.

This long-term agreement follows an initial delivery in July 2025, when SWISS used Synhelion’s solar fuel in regular flight operations for the first time.

That fuel was produced at Synhelion’s DAWN plant and refined in northern Germany before entering the supply system at Hamburg Airport.

The move is among the first initiatives of its kind in the Gulf’s leisure marine sector, reports Zawya.com.

With this step, DMYC and CMYC have become some of the earliest marinas in the region to offer sustainable biofuel for recreational yachts. The initiative supports Emaar’s broader sustainability strategy and aligns with the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 targets.

As part of the collaboration, both marinas will supply Sustainable Bio Yacht Fuel (SBYF) produced by Lootah Biofuels. The fuel is made from used cooking oil collected from hotels, homes and Emaar’s mixed-use developments. The waste oil is processed into marine-grade biofuel, allowing yacht owners to refuel with a lower-impact alternative directly at their home marinas.

An official from Emaar Hospitality Group said the company aims to place sustainability at the centre of its marina and hospitality operations. He said the introduction of bio yacht fuel gives members a clear and practical option to reduce environmental impact, while also encouraging more responsible practices in the leisure marine sector.

The rollout of SBYF will be carried out in phases to ensure smooth operations, reliable supply and consistent fuel quality. Dedicated refuelling points will be set up at both DMYC and CMYC, giving yacht owners and club members easy access to the new fuel option.

Emaar said the initiative reflects its focus on realistic, locally relevant solutions to reduce emissions, rather than broad commitments. The partnership also highlights how waste materials can be reused within a circular system across hospitality, leisure and marine operations.

Lootah Biofuels, a UAE-based company that specialises in biodiesel made from used cooking oil, will manage the collection, processing and supply of the fuel to both marinas. The company said its biofuel solutions have shown clear reductions in carbon emissions compared to conventional marine fuels.

Lootah Biofuels’ chief executive said the partnership shows how locally sourced waste can be converted into valuable energy, supporting both environmental goals and operational efficiency in the UAE.

During the initial phase, sustainable refuelling at the two marinas will be offered on a scheduled basis, with scope for expansion depending on demand. The initiative is expected to contribute gradually to lowering carbon emissions from leisure boating activities in the region.

Dubai Marina Yacht Club already holds environmental certifications such as Fish Friendly and Clean Marina status, reflecting its commitment to responsible marine practices. The marina has also introduced a drinking water initiative using technology that converts moisture from the air into potable water, which has been supplying captains and crew for the past year. The launch of bio yacht fuel builds on these efforts and further strengthens Emaar’s sustainability plans for marine leisure.

Emaar said the project forms part of its ongoing effort to embed sustainability across its businesses. By working with Lootah Biofuels at both marinas, the company aims to support national climate goals while offering yacht owners a practical and responsible fueling choice.

An Emaar executive said the focus is on turning sustainability into real action, adding that the partnership represents a clear step toward cleaner and more environmentally friendly marine leisure experiences.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/biofuel-pump.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 11:12:52.792088

According to IATA data, global passenger traffic increased by 5.3%, closely aligned with the long-term average growth rate of 5%, while 2026 projections signal stable profitability.

Cargo Growth and Financial Pressures

Asia-Pacific led global traffic growth in 2025 and remained the strongest performing region. The region benefited from strong domestic markets and rising international demand, confirming its role as the main driver of aviation growth.

Europe maintained stable growth, while Latin America and Africa posted solid gains. North America continued to lag, affected by weaker domestic demand and operational constraints.

Capacity remained tight throughout the year. The global passenger load factor, indicating the percentage of available seating that is filled with passengers, reached 86% in August 2025, marking the highest level ever recorded. High load factors reflected strong demand but also limited aircraft availability.

Global air cargo traffic rose by 3.3% in 2025, supported by resilient global trade and strong demand for time-sensitive shipments. Growth was again led by Asia-Pacific, driven by e-commerce and technology-related goods.

Cargo performance is expected to strengthen further in 2026. Air cargo traffic is forecast to grow by 8.5%, with total revenues projected to reach $158 billion.

Despite solid demand, airlines faced rising costs. Labour and maintenance expenses increased due to wage inflation, pilot shortages and ageing fleets. Employment growth and labour productivity are both slowing, with each expected to fall by close to 2% in 2026.

Fleet availability remains one of the industry’s most persistent challenges. In 2025, a record number of aircraft were undergoing maintenance, increasing demand for spare parts and replacements. Aircraft delivery delays forced airlines to keep older aircraft in service and delay fleet renewals.

2026 Projections and Industry Outlook

Looking ahead, global passenger traffic is expected to grow by 4.9% in 2026. Asia-Pacific is projected to remain the fastest-growing region, with traffic forecast to rise by 7.3%.

Financial performance is expected to remain stable. Operating profit margins are forecast to edge up to 6.9% in 2026, while net margins are expected to remain at 3.9% and industry revenues are projected to grow by 4.5%.

Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important across the sector, particularly in cargo logistics, operations and data analysis. However, measurable productivity gains remain limited at a global level.

Although the airline industry is committed to achieving net-zero CO2 emissions, sustainability challenges persist. Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is expected to account for less than 1% of total fuel use in 2026, partly due to poor alignment between CORSIA and multiple regional and national schemes, which fragments policy, increases costs and limits real emissions reductions.

As global aviation enters 2026, demand remains strong, profitability stable and structural constraints unresolved. The industry continues to balance growth with limited capacity, rising costs and slow progress on decarbonization.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tianlei-wu-WYxmb27zqMM-unsplash-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 15:57:00.808756

This marks a significant milestone for the airport and for VINCI Airports’ commitment to accelerating the energy transition across its mobility infrastructure and with its stakeholders.

Salvador Bahia Airport already stands as a regional benchmark for environmental performance.

As the first airport in the Americas to achieve the highest level of Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA 5), it has implemented advanced practices for carbon management and reduction.

Today, more than 15 airports across its network already offer SAF, and the introduction of this fuel into regular operations in Salvador further strengthens this position and aligns with decarbonisation goals across the VINCI Airports network.

In Brazil, SAF is distributed commercially by Vibra. The fuel blend used at Salvador complies with international sustainability criteria and can help lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Two daily flights departing from Salvador Bahia and operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas and LATAM Airlines Brasil are now supplied with SAF.

They use a blend containing 10% pure SAF and 90% conventional jet fuel, currently the highest proportion applied in Brazilian aviation.

The pure SAF, produced from used cooking oil, is presently the only one available on the national market.

While emissions from flights fall under airlines’ scope 1 and the airport’s scope 3, this renewable fuel contributes to reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

The US military’s lightning extraction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was a move reminiscent of the Cold War, but the motivation was purely 21st-century energy cravings.

By President Donald Trump’s own admission, this wasn't just about democracy; it was about the world’s largest oil reserves.

For Washington, the goal is a nostalgic return to 1976, before nationalisation, when American oil giants were deeply enmeshed in the country’s oil economy.

But as we enter 2026, the flare-up in Caracas is only half the story.

While the West remains obsessed with securing the supply of fossil fuels, the real revolution has been happening on the demand side in the world’s most populous nation, India.

The Real Shift

Last August, Washington slapped an additional 25% import duty on Indian exports, a punitive tax for India buying discounted Russian crude.

It was a blunt instrument intended to signal that buying from Moscow is tantamount to funding the war in Ukraine.

The strategy, however messy, showed results.

Russian oil, which once commanded 40% of India’s imports, ebbed to a three-year low of 25% as Indian refiners ducked the crossfire of secondary sanctions.

Which brings us to the demand side of the equation.

A conversation with Vartika Shuka, Chairman and Managing Director of Engineers India Limited (EIL), the state-owned firm that helps build India’s energy infrastructure, brought this to the fore for me last week.

In a conversation two weeks ago, I asked Shukla about an exciting project that her team had worked on in the last year.

Bear in mind that EIL is busy building refineries, petrochemical complexes and energy projects from Mongolia to Nigeria and Guyana to, of course, India and overseeing cutting-edge projects ranging from small modular nuclear reactors to sustainable aviation fuel.

But the pet project is a solar cooker.

And an attempt to de-engineer the cost and weight of solar thermal cooking for the masses, picking up on a project kickstarted by state-owned oil giant Indian Oil Corporation.

“We wanted to see how we as a team can look at reducing the cost as well as the weight of the solar cooker such that it becomes, you know, affordable and friendly to the masses,” she told me at the EIL headquarters in New Delhi.

It sounds simplistic, even quaint, until you look at the math.

India imports more than 80% of its crude. For a nation of 1.4 billion, energy security isn't just about finding more oil; it’s obviously about needing less of it.

This is not new thinking as is reflected in India’s hard push for renewable energy in recent years which is now overtaken targets set for 2030.

But we have also seen this play out in schemes like UJALA.

Ten years ago, the Indian government bet that bulk procurement could turn LED bulbs from a luxury into a commodity.

Today, with 368 million bulbs distributed and an estimated $2.3 billion in annual electricity savings, the ""world’s largest zero-subsidy lighting program"" has demonstrated that market-driven demand reduction can be effective in managing demand.

For example, it has curtailed over 9,000 MW of peak demand, the equivalent of several large coal plants, simply by changing a lightbulb.

Demand Is the Story

The 2026 trend to watch isn't just the supply story of American interventionism in South America.

It is the demand story written in the consumer choices of countries like India.

Whether it is the surge in electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers on Indian roads or the

push for energy-efficient households, the goal is clear: decoupling growth from the whims of petro-states.

As we navigate this complex year, the lesson for policymakers is stark.

Managing the geopolitics of supply is a reactive, expensive game of whack-a-mole.

But fostering conscious consumerism, perhaps even convincing the public that a 10-minute grocery delivery isn’t worth the carbon footprint, is where the real sovereignty lies.

Gasification-based hydrogen holds a leading 39% market share. This technology is favored for its maturity and ability to process diverse, low-cost solid biomass at large scale, producing a syngas that can be integrated into existing refinery hydrogen plants, such as steam methane reformers, with carbon capture, or purified in dedicated units.

Its technological readiness and potential for negative emissions when combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) make it the cornerstone technology for near-to-mid-term decarbonization of refinery hydrogen demand.

By End-Use Application, Where is the Immediate Decarbonization Pressure Greatest?

Refinery fuel hydrogen constitutes the dominant application, accounting for 41% of the market. Hydrogen is a massive operational input in refineries for desulfurization and product upgrading.

Replacing conventionally produced hydrogen with biomass-derived hydrogen directly addresses a major portion of a refinery's operational emissions. This application offers a clear, quantifiable carbon reduction that aligns with regulatory mandates and corporate net-zero pledges, creating a strong, immediate incentive for investment.

By Feedstock Type, Which Source Balances Availability and Sustainability?

Agricultural residues, such as straw, husks, and stover, lead the feedstock segment with a 37% share. These materials are widely available as by-products of food production, avoiding land-use change controversies associated with dedicated energy crops. Their use promotes circularity within the agro-industrial sector.

Logistical challenges related to collection, transportation, and storage drive innovation in decentralized pre-processing and densification to make this feedstock economically viable for large-scale hydrogen production near refinery hubs.

What are the Drivers, Restraints, and Key Trends of the Refinery Biomass Hydrogen Tech Market?

The primary market driver is the combination of stringent carbon pricing mechanisms, low-carbon fuel standards, and government subsidies for clean hydrogen production, which are improving the economic case for biomass-derived hydrogen.

Refineries face mounting stakeholder pressure to future-proof their assets. The strategic need to produce lower-carbon intensity transportation fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which require substantial hydrogen inputs, further accelerates adoption.

A significant market restraint is the high capital intensity and technological complexity of building large-scale, integrated biomass gasification or liquefaction plants with the required reliability for refinery operations.

Securing long-term, cost-stable biomass feedstock contracts at the necessary scale can be challenging due to seasonal variability and competing uses. The lifecycle carbon accounting and sustainability certification of biomass feedstocks also require rigorous management to ensure genuine emissions benefits and avoid reputational risk.

Key trends include the development of hybrid systems that co-process biomass with waste plastics or fossil feedstocks in existing gasifiers to reduce risk and cost. There is a strong focus on advanced gas cleaning technologies to handle the complex contaminant profile of biomass-derived syngas and protect downstream catalysts.

Modular, skid-mounted biomass-to-hydrogen units are being developed for smaller-scale or distributed deployment. Furthermore, digital twin and AI optimization of these complex thermochemical processes are improving efficiency and operational predictability.

The certification, announced late December 2025, verifies traceability and sustainability metrics across the supply chain and aligns with International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standards for biofuel feedstocks.

The certification is from SCS Global Services under the ISCC CORSIA PLUS protocol, recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

The certification includes the ISCC CORSIA PLUS Low-LUC seal, which guarantees traceability and compliance with strict agricultural practices.

The certification verifies that soybeans processed at the facility carry a low risk of indirect land use change (LUC), a critical factor in ensuring that SAF production does not contribute to deforestation or environmental degradation

This initiative covers soybeans from Bunge’s extensive operations in Mato Grosso and Goiás, emphasizing zero-deforestation practices, regenerative agriculture, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

The certified volumes, initially estimated at 100,000 tonnes, support SAF producers such as Brazilian airlines and international refiners aiming for net-zero flights by 2050.

Bunge’s rigorous audits confirm compliance with no-burn policies, soil health enhancements, and biodiversity preservation.

The certification aligns with ICAO’s broader push for CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), which requires airlines to reduce emissions through offsets and sustainable fuels.

As demand for SAF grows, Brazil’s certified soybeans could become a vital resource for airlines seeking compliance.

The process integrates Bunge’s 100% traceable soy platform, expanded from 80% in the Cerrado biome, using blockchain for end-to-end monitoring.

Soybeans meet EU Deforestation Regulation thresholds effective in 2026, including geolocation of farms and low-carbon farming practices such as no-till and crop rotation.

Brazil, the world’s top soybean exporter, with 170 million tonnes annually, faces mounting pressure to source sustainably amid EU import rules.

Bunge’s move positions it ahead of rivals like Cargill and ADM, potentially commanding 10-15% price premiums for SAF-grade soy.

SAF demand surges 20% yearly, driven by ICAO’s CORSIA program, with Brazil aiming for 5% SAF blend by 2030.

This achievement makes Bunge the first company worldwide to certify soybeans under this rigorous sustainability standard.

For Brazil, it signals a new chapter in leveraging agricultural exports not just for food, but for clean energy solutions that support the global fight against climate change.",https://millingmea.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bunge-.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 10:58:24.461074

LONDON, Jan. 5, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Global energy and commodity price reporting agency Argus has launched a new suite of renewable fuel ticket prices for the Netherlands.

The country is gearing up to implement the latest update to the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) and is switching over from mandating a specific share of renewable energy in transport to an overall emissions savings mandate.

As a result, Argus' daily assessments will track the Netherlands' newly launched emission reduction units — known by the Dutch acronym EREs — and replace long-standing assessments for renewable fuel units — HBEs.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: ""We are pleased to have worked closely with market participants to provide new price transparency which will help them comply with the changed mandates. Our new assessments underscore the importance of reliable market standards and are supported by careful stewardship of our biofuel and associated feedstock price benchmarks.""

Argus has launched six separate assessments based on the Netherlands' definition of various transport sectors, aimed at cutting emissions both from land and maritime transport. The assessments cover the road fuels blending of biofuels produced from feedstocks defined as advanced (RED Annex IX A), conventional waste (RED Annex IX B), and conventional crop and other waste/crop feedstocks. They are mirrored by a similar set for shipping.

Biofuels markets have evolved a long way since the launch of the Argus Biofuels report in 2008, and Dutch compliance has become a staple of European biofuels trade. It is central to Argus' efforts to support the changing nature of spot trade as well as to provide benchmarks for the growing derivatives markets.

The Netherlands' move from an energy-basis target to focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) savings will mark the end of the use of most multipliers, including the Dutch double counting of RED Annex IX biofuels that have to date been a stalwart of Dutch transport emissions reduction.

The new Argus ERE assessments, in place of its HBE prices, join similar Argus price assessments for Germany's GHG reduction quota as well as the UK's renewable transport fuel certificates and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) tickets.

Renewable fuel tickets are used by companies which bring liquid or gaseous fossil fuels into general circulation and are obligated to pay excise duty/energy tax on fuels.

For Plug Power, the Walvis Bay project marks its entry into the commercial green hydrogen market in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Company officials said the project shows that green hydrogen production is possible in regions with reliable renewable energy and supportive government policies.
In addition to environmental benefits, the hydrogen plant created around 150 direct jobs during construction and start-up, along with about 200 indirect jobs in related fields.
Such plans could support local industries, attract foreign investment and help position Namibia as a regional hub for green hydrogen.","A green hydrogen plant with a capacity of 5 MW began operations at Namibia’s Walvis Bay port in December 2025, marking an important step toward cleaner energy use in Africa. The project, developed by Plug Power together with Cleanergy Solutions Namibia, is one of the first fully integrated commercial green hydrogen facilities on the continent and operates entirely using renewable energy, reports Hydrogen Fuel News.

The facility has been set up at Namibia’s main export port and produces hydrogen on site using power generated from nearby solar and wind sources. The hydrogen is used to run port equipment, including yard trucks, cargo cranes and small service vessels, helping cut fuel use and reduce emissions from daily port operations. The project is being seen as a working example for other African ports looking to move toward cleaner energy.

At the centre of the plant is a 5 MW system that uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. When operating at full capacity, it produces around two tonnes of green hydrogen per day, enough to keep more than 40 heavy-duty port vehicles running throughout the day. The oxygen produced in the process is either safely released or stored for use in other industries.

The system uses about nine litres of water to produce one kilogram of hydrogen and occupies space similar to a small warehouse. Its design allows parts to be replaced without major construction work. Company officials said the plant is built for long-term use, with future expansion expected to help lower costs through increased capacity and shared facilities.

For Plug Power, the Walvis Bay project marks its entry into the commercial green hydrogen market in Sub-Saharan Africa. The company already operates hydrogen projects in Europe and the United States and considers Africa’s strong solar and wind resources a major opportunity for future growth. Company officials said the project shows that green hydrogen production is possible in regions with reliable renewable energy and supportive government policies. Plug Power has indicated that planned projects across Africa could exceed 1 GW in total capacity, with interest coming from mining companies and government bodies.

Walvis Bay, with a population of about 65,000, is a key part of Namibia’s export economy, handling products such as uranium and fish. The area’s sunny weather and strong coastal winds make it suitable for renewable energy projects. In addition to environmental benefits, the hydrogen plant created around 150 direct jobs during construction and start-up, along with about 200 indirect jobs in related fields. Cleanergy Solutions Namibia is also working with local training centres to develop skills in hydrogen system operation and maintenance.

Project partners are exploring the option of exporting surplus hydrogen to overseas markets, possibly in the form of ammonia for use in fertilisers and marine fuels. Such plans could support local industries, attract foreign investment and help position Namibia as a regional hub for green hydrogen.

Industry observers say the Walvis Bay project highlights the growing role of green hydrogen in reducing emissions from sectors such as ports, shipping and heavy industry. With similar projects emerging in other parts of Africa and Europe, the facility is increasingly being viewed as a model for clean energy development in emerging economies.
