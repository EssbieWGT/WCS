Alcohol-to-jet stuck on runway as US policy shifts

New York, 4 June (Argus) — Proposed changes to a US clean fuel tax credit may be a boon for farmers, but a future where ethanol is a major ingredient in jet fuel remains far off. The massive Republican budget bill currently advancing through Congress would extend the ""45Z"" credit, which offers larger subsidies to fuels as they produce fewer emissions. The proposal too would bar regulators from weighing indirect land use impacts , effectively upping subsidies for crop-based fuels like ethanol, in a win for agribusiness. Farm groups have hoped that such changes could open the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market to ethanol producers, otherwise at risk from an increasingly efficient and electric US vehicle fleet. Airlines too are eager for more diverse SAF sources since the main pathway nowadays, processing vegetable oils and animal fats, draws from more limited feedstocks. United Airlines government affairs director Tom Michels said at an OurEnergyPolicy forum earlier this year that the company hopes ethanol-based fuel ""could fulfill around a quarter of our future SAF needs."" But incentives in law and under the proposal, which passed the House last month, would do little to boost ""alcohol-to-jet"" output. While ethanol typically trades at a discount to gasoline, SAF is substantially more expensive than petroleum, making government support essential for uptake. The Republican caucus has a range of views, with clean energy advocates wary of phasing out subsidies, farm-state representatives intent on boosting biofuels, and conservatives committed to curbing government spending. Republicans plan to use a process called reconciliation that allows them to pass the bill without Democratic support. How policymakers implement 45Z will be crucial for a wave of alcohol-to-jet startups eyeing production this decade. That includes Gevo, whose plans for an integrated 60mn USG/yr plant in South Dakota are complicated by another company's struggles starting an interstate carbon pipeline. Meanwhile, people familiar with the matter say that LanzaJet's 10mn USG/yr alcohol-to-jet pilot project in Georgia — which opened last year but is not yet fully operational — is not currently producing any SAF. ""The suite of policies we would need to make ethanol-to-jet pencil out just does not exist right now,"" said Brian Jennings, chief executive of the American Coalition for Ethanol. RINs wear thin Ethanol-based SAF would likely still produce too many emissions to claim any 45Z subsidy even if the proposed emissions tracking changes took effect — since the pathway requires more energy-intensive processing to make fuel suitable for jet engines. Carbon capture could make up the difference, though few facilities have that capability. The lack of subsidy would compound barriers from the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners to blend biofuels or buy credits from those who do. Under the program, blending corn ethanol earns a Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit, but there is no certified pathway yet to offer RINs for corn-based SAF blending. Even if there were, advanced biofuel credits have traded recently at only a slight premium, reducing the incentive for ethanol producers to eye new markets. Argus last assessed current year D4 biomass-based diesel credits at 92.25¢/RIN and D6 conventional credits at 86.50¢/RIN, and they traded at parity much of last year. Meanwhile, the typical US dry mill ethanol producer would likely qualify for some 45Z subsidy if the Republican bill passed, adding to RIN benefits. Those plants would have to forgo both incentives to sell to SAF makers. It is unclear how producers of a more-expensive and less-subsidized SAF could compete on price. Gevo chief executive Patrick Gruber said that his company's integrated model — producing ethanol and SAF at the same sites — is less risky than buying ethanol from elsewhere. But there are other policy headwinds. A new South Dakota law to restrict eminent domain could derail Summit Carbon's planned multistate carbon pipeline, which dozens of biorefineries, including one Gevo facility, want to join. Gevo has purchased a North Dakota biorefinery that can already capture carbon on site, a potentially lucrative workaround to pipeline delays, and is eyeing SAF production there too. There is a RIN pathway for SAF from Brazilian sugarcane ethanol — a model that LanzaJet has pursued — but credit pricing makes economics challenging there too, adding to freight and tariff costs . Even then, the bill to change 45Z would restrict eligibility to North American feedstocks, upending LanzaJet's plans for Brazilian ethanol without making US alternatives more economical. ""45Z as currently drafted creates a disincentive for US ethanol to be used in SAF,"" said LanzaJet vice president of government and regulatory affairs Angela Foster-Rice. ""We are hopeful to get this issue addressed in the Senate bill."" Despite policy uncertainty, airlines have committed to procuring far more SAF and might be willing to pay a premium. But they are more likely to pay up for fuel they can at least use for SAF mandates in the EU and UK, which do not credit fuels from first-generation crops. US federal and state programs subsidize lower-carbon jet fuels but do not mandate usage. The floor is yours The Republican bill is still just a proposal, leaving the possibility for changes. The Senate reconvened this week with a goal of passing the bill before 4 July, and members have signaled they might take a different approach to clean energy subsidies than the House. Some biofuel lobbyists support shifting rules to benefit SAF — potentially by providing a higher ""floor"" credit for refiners that barely qualify or allowing alcohol-to-jet producers to claim the same benefit as upstream ethanol refiners. Under current rules, fuels may earn just cents per gallon. But such changes could rile trucking groups frustrated with 45Z already offering heftier subsidies to SAF and deficit hawks worried about the bill's mounting costs.

Shell diverts Ostra crude to USGC in rare move

Singapore, 4 June (Argus) — Two cargoes of May-loading Brazilian heavy sweet Ostra crude appear to have been diverted to the US Gulf coast for refining, instead of heading to their typical destination of Singapore for use in very-low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) blending, trading sources told Argus . Ostra crude has a gravity around 20-24°API and sulphur content close to 0.35pc, and is shipped from the 100,000 b/d Espirito Santo floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, connected to Brazil's offshore Ostra field. A cargo of Ostra crude loaded onto the Loire vessel from the Espirito Santo at the end of May and is currently declaring for discharge at the US Gulf coast, according to data from global trade analytics platform Kpler. The cargo is likely intended for refinery feedstock, traders said. And another cargo of Ostra crude loaded onto the Sonangol Kulumbimbi in early May, with the cargo expected to discharge in the Gulf coast this week, Kpler data show. These trade flows are unusual as Ostra crude — typically lifted by Shell at volumes of around 150,000t/month — is almost always shipped to the Singapore strait for VLSFO blending. The last recorded delivery to the US Gulf coast was in June 2023. Strong products crack spreads, particularly for gasoline and diesel, likely supported the decision to reroute the cargoes for refining in the US Gulf. Forward month VLSFO east-west spreads are hovering in the low $30s/t at present, making it unattractive to send cargoes east, a Singapore-based fuel oil trader said. A recent tightening in heavy crude supply in the US — driven by the discontinuation of Venezuelan crude exports and concerns about potential wildfire-related crude supply disruptions in Canada — may have also supported the rare exports. The diversion of around 150,000t of Ostra crude will tighten Singapore VLSFO balances for July, at a time when the arrival of replenishment supplies from Europe was due to offer some reprieve in the market. The Argus- assessed June-July and July-August VLSFO time spreads rose on the session, assessed at $7.50/t and $5.25/t, respectively, on 4 June, up from $6.75/t and $4.50/t on 3 June. VLSFO supplies are expected to remain tight throughout June, with the majority of European supplies — or around 4-5 Suezmax cargoes — due to arrive from early to mid-July onwards.

Mexico factory contraction extends into May

Mexico City, 3 June (Argus) — Manufacturing activity in Mexico contracted for a 14th consecutive month in May, though at a slower pace, according to a purchasing managers' survey. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 47.4 in May from 45.5 in April, marking the 14th consecutive month below the 50-point threshold between contraction and expansion, the finance executives' association IMEF said. The subindex for new orders increased by 2.7 percentage points to 44.4, recovering from a post-pandemic low in April. The production subindex rose by 3.1 points to 46.6, while employment held almost steady at 44.6. New orders and production have now been in contraction for 15 consecutive months, and employment for 16. The inventories subindex rebounded by 5 points to 51.2 in May, returning to expansion after one month in contraction. The upticks in May likely reflect firms restarting production to process backlogged orders previously paused because of US tariff uncertainty and re-build inventories as new orders also began to arrive last month, IMEF's head of economic studies Victor Herrera told Argus. ""The initial implementation of tariffs led many to put the brakes on production, but this was ultimately short-lived, as reorders started to come through,"" Herrera said. The non-manufacturing PMI — covering services, commerce and trade — also rose slightly to 49.4 in May from 49.1 in April, marking a sixth month in contraction, under 50. Within that index, new orders increased by 0.7 points to 48.8, production by 1.7 points to 49.5 and employment fell by 0.4 points to 48.5.

It is a similar story when looking at data centers.
Tim Walz said, “Data centers travel in packs, they travel in groups, and you get one and you get a big one.
Fighting for jobs, capital and a future tax base.
Walz and leaders of both parties to prioritize our state’s future economic opportunities in these industries.","Innovation has built Minnesota’s economy, and it depends on economic and regulatory certainty. Given international and national trends, innovation and certainty are more critical to grow Minnesota’s economy now than ever before.

That’s why in the final days of the legislative session, a broad range of business, labor and other economic champions of Minnesota are sounding the alarm. The state is risking significant future investment by not agreeing to and passing a tax bill that recognizes two emerging industries: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and data centers.

A report released last week from the Minnesota Chamber Foundation shows the importance of broad investment in future economic development. Two $5 billion megaprojects were announced for Minnesota in 2024, accounting for over 80% of the state’s total business capital investment commitments.

According to the report, “These two proposed projects alone — a SAF facility in Moorhead and a data center development in the south Metro — plan to bring $10 billion in new capital investments to the state. These projects are still in proposal stages, and final outcomes are not guaranteed. However, they represent among the largest expansions in the state’s recent history should they come to fruition.”

These projects would make Minnesota more economically competitive. Each sector would mean further investment in the decades to come. Politically speaking, each has broad bipartisan support.

Minnesota has been looked at as a SAF leader in the U.S. and around the world since it passed one of the first SAF tax credits in 2023. The state SAF tax credit enabled the newly created MN SAF Hub to make fast progress out of the gate in executing its strategy, and helped give Minnesota an early lead in the global SAF race. But other states are looking to seize on the economic development opportunities related to SAF as well.

Since Minnesota took action in 2023, Illinois, Washington, Colorado, Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa have all passed their own legislation to promote a SAF economy. Minnesota is leading, but the bipartisan SAF bill that has support from both the agriculture and environment communities is not guaranteed to pass — and if it doesn’t it would leave Minnesota to chase other states and lose our competitive edge.

It is a similar story when looking at data centers. A broad coalition of businesses, labor and environmental groups have worked together on data center legislation that will incentivize the responsible development of data centers, while protecting the environment and ratepayers. This same legislation has been endorsed by a broad,bipartisan coalition of legislators.

Just last fall, Minnesota was touting itself as a leader in attracting these future technology hubs to our state. Our weather and climate are advantages. At the groundbreaking for a large-scale data center last year, Gov. Tim Walz said, “Data centers travel in packs, they travel in groups, and you get one and you get a big one. And we’d had more before. And so we’ll be more to this.”

The data center tax incentive is scheduled to sunset and needs to be extended and modernized in order to be competitive with our peer states such as Iowa, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Just last week, Iowa announced a multibillion-dollar data center investment.

Both SAF and data centers mean jobs — construction jobs, high-tech jobs, across diverse sectors of agriculture, energy, AI, and transportation throughout the entire state.

Elected officials at the capitol are putting these investments at risk without taking action to support these industries in the tax bill. In an era of polarization, bipartisan legislation is worth fighting for. Fighting for jobs, capital and a future tax base.

We won’t stop working to keep investments coming to Minnesota. We call on Gov. Walz and leaders of both parties to prioritize our state’s future economic opportunities in these industries.

BC's SAF mandate faces global headwinds -,"Geoff Russ, Resource Works, Stewart Muir",,,,,https://resourceworks.com/doubling-down-on-sustainable-aviation-fuel-is-the-wrong-move-at-the-wrong-time/,"This is decidedly off-course from what is happening in the rest of the world, where SAF production is still limited, very expensive, and being sidelined.
British Columbia’s ambitious plan to require Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) targets is misguided and will put the province on the fringes of the airline industry.
Currently, BC’s SAF policy is aimed at cutting emissions caused by air travel to help the province meet its climate goals.
BC’s SAF policy aims to rapidly expand sustainable aviation fuel production and use, significantly cutting aviation-related pollution and carbon emissions.
Finally, economic studies show that the costs of SAF mandates always end up being passed on to consumers.","The BC Chamber of Commerce has passed a resolution saying that BC has uniquely strict rules in North America regarding SAF, with target mandates of 1 percent of jet fuel in 2028, which is set to rise quickly to 3 percent by 2030. This is decidedly off-course from what is happening in the rest of the world, where SAF production is still limited, very expensive, and being sidelined.

On January 1, 2026, the BC Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) will require a 2 percent reduction in carbon intensity (CI) for jet fuel, marking the first stage of a progressive increase that is part of BC’s broader effort to incorporate SAF into the aviation fuel supply.

British Columbia’s ambitious plan to require Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) targets is misguided and will put the province on the fringes of the airline industry.

Currently, BC’s SAF policy is aimed at cutting emissions caused by air travel to help the province meet its climate goals. Furthermore, the government has touted it as an opportunity to stimulate investment in clean tech, expand local economic growth, and generate modern aviation jobs.

Premier David Eby has touted his government’s work on SAF, particularly in collaboration with facilities like Vancouver International Airport (YVR).

“By working together on shared priorities, like promoting made-in-B.C. clean tech and expanding trade diversification while reducing pollution, we can maximize benefits for all British Columbians, while strengthening our province’s economic future,” said Eby last year.

BC’s SAF policy aims to rapidly expand sustainable aviation fuel production and use, significantly cutting aviation-related pollution and carbon emissions. It also seeks to stimulate clean-tech investment, creating local economic growth and resilient, sustainable aviation jobs.

First, SAF production around the world isn’t growing fast enough to meet these requirements set by BC. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says that only 2 million tonnes of SAF will be made around the world in 2025. This is only 0.7 percent of the world’s aviation fuel use. Willie Walsh, the Director General of IATA, said that the low availability of SAF has already caused compliance fees in Europe to skyrocket, making SAF almost five times more expensive than regular jet fuel.

The Financial Times (FT) reports that airline industry leaders in Europe, where SAF mandates have been put in place, are very sceptical and are pushing back. For example, leaders at Ryanair and Lufthansa have openly questioned whether the current SAF targets are realistic.

Their worries follow facts that were brought to light in earlier FT reports, which found that Europe’s SAF mandates made energy companies hesitant to make new investments or even stop them altogether, like Shell’s biofuels facility in Rotterdam, which is on hold. The situation is a warning for BC that making rules too soon can stop investments instead of speeding up the switch to green energy.

The Wall Street Journal has written extensively about how unclear it is what qualifies as SAF, which adds even more risk to the province’s ambitious goals. The differences between U.S. and European standards have made markets less clear and scared off investors. European rules say that crop-based SAF is not allowed, but the U.S. gives incentives for it. This makes the global market less stable. This lack of consistency in policy makes it even harder for Canadian producers to set up viable domestic SAF facilities, making the province even more dependent on expensive imports from a small number of international sources.

The Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (C-SAF) acknowledges that it is hard to increase production in Canada. Even though more than 60 airlines have signed on, Canada’s SAF market is still in its early stages. BC could needlessly harm the airline industry and the wider economy by enforcing strict rules without a strong local industry to support them.

The Chamber of Commerce is right to point out the economic risk. Airports like Vancouver International (YVR) are important for BC’s economy because they connect people and are vital hubs for importing and exporting. If BC airports don’t have enough domestic supply, overly aggressive mandates could make them less competitive. Smaller, regional carriers are already having a hard time making money, and now they are facing threats to their very existence. Last year’s failure of Lynx Air shows that rising fuel prices have real effects.

Also, BC’s policy too closely resembles European goals, which have proven too ambitious. The EU was once a strong supporter of SAF, but airlines are now strongly against it and warning about rising costs and limited SAF availability, which is leading to calls for policy changes. To stay competitive, airlines have even tried to make Europe’s strict carbon pricing and SAF rules fit in with less strict global standards. If Europe, which is a leader in climate change, has to rethink its rules, BC’s decision to go it alone looks even more wrong.

Finally, economic studies show that the costs of SAF mandates always end up being passed on to consumers.

For many BC communities, air travel is not optional. It’s the only lifeline for passengers, medevacs, time-sensitive goods, and perishable supplies. This, carbon pricing and SAF mandates hit harder in B.C. than in more road-connected provinces, potentially disrupting lifeline services and increasing costs for rural and Indigenous residents.

BC’s separate SAF mandate, as stated in the BC Chamber’s resolution, is not in line with what is happening in North America and around the world. Instead of encouraging real progress for the environment, the policy could hurt the economy and be meaningless. A better way to go about things would be to set timelines and goals that are in line with global standards, encourage domestic SAF production, and support technological progress before putting in place rules that BC’s economy can’t realistically handle.",https://resourceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/53603042355_16ad95af4d_k.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:56:33.414943

Dr Chaudhari pointed out the need for alternative to diesel in India and role of bioenergy sector in developing the alternate fuels to traditional fossil fuel. We need to promote biodiesel as an alternative to diesel in order to boost bioenergy sector and also to reduce carbon footprint in India. Raj Industries is working on the production of biodiesel and we have found new additives in this area, he said.

While highlighting the importance of agriculture biomass as a major contributor of raw material for the production of biofuel, Dr Chaudhari said that companies are working in the supply chain of biomass from last few years and with the right policy support and investment it is poised to grow. IFGE has chosen a right niche to support the movement in biofuel production.

Dr Y B Ramkrishna, Senior Vice President IFGE and Former Chairman, Working Group on Biofuel MoPNG emphasised the need to use of biological sources apart from feedstocks which can be considered as substitute to conventional fuels. We are looking at various sources which are considered as industry waste and can be converted into bioenergy. We are also looking at the low carbon fuels which will not only reduce the carbon footprint but also are sustainable and commercially viable options over traditional fossil fuel and a lot of R& D work is being conducted in this sector. We need to create an ecosystem in which all the wasted resources can be made available to the industry to convert it alternate biofuel. By practising this 100 per cent of country’s energy will come from bioenergy sector.

Dr Ramkrishna also added that government is supporting bioenergy sector by pushing various schemes for the sector and policy intervention. But still there are few gaps in the policies which needs to address and IFGE is addressing to these challenges and bridging the gap between the industry and government for the growth of bioenergy sector.

Vaibhav Dange, Founder Director IFGE informed the audience about the remarkable growth of bioenergy sector in India and IFGE’s contribution to the growth of the sector. He mentioned that India’s entire spectrum of bioenergy was displayed for the first time in the last year edition of India Bioenergy & Tech and that has added value of the bioenergy to the minds of the policy makers, industry leaders and created a buzz among the industry stakeholders.

But not all SAFs are created equal. With a potential to slash aviation’s CO₂ emissions by more than 90%, e-kerosene (also known as e-SAF) is the only scalable and sustainable option in the long term.

Despite a strong regulatory framework under the Fit for 55 package and ReFuelEU Aviation, e-SAF projects in the EU have yet to reach Final Investment Decision (FID). This is due to high capital and operational costs, a lack of long-term offtake agreements, and insufficient revenue certainty — a market failure that existing EU mechanisms have not been able to resolve.

The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) presents a unique and timely opportunity to correct this imbalance. By focusing its support on the most strategic SAF pathway – e-SAF – the STIP can catalyse the deployment of clean aviation fuels while boosting the EU’s industrial competitiveness, energy independence, and jobs.

To do so, the STIP should embed a comprehensive mechanism, such as a European Hydrogen Clearing House (EHCH). The EHCH would operate through double-sided auctions, matching fuel producers and buyers (e.g. airlines), while ensuring price stability and demand aggregation. This would de-risk production through long-term contracts and contract for differences for e-SAF, enabling scale-up while ensuring alignment with the EU’s competitiveness goals.

Innovative tradition As the world’s second-largest producer of wine, Italy’s wine industry was valued at $21.5 billion annually.","Welcome to 3p Happy Hour! As we all eye the exit door on Friday afternoons, we're raising our glasses to the sustainable wine, beer and spirits brands serving up stiff sips with less environmental impact while benefiting communities.

In the wine-making world, Italy is a full-bodied behemoth, boasting 590 grape varieties and a 4,000-year-old history of wine production. When the Greeks settled there in the 8th century, they aptly named it the land of wine. Stateside, we’ve fully embraced this tradition, importing the most Italian wine of any country.

Despite the delights of a floral, brick-red Barolo, the industry uses large amounts of pesticides and water, while also creating waste like leftover grape skins, seeds and pulp. Plus, wine production emits greenhouse gases, particularly from packaging and grape cultivation. While it’s only a small amount per bottle, this quickly adds up considering billions of gallons of wine are consumed annually.

Thankfully, some organizations in the industry are taking the environment as seriously as their Chianti collection. Mezzacorona Group, a community of nearly 1,600 winegrowers and farms in northern Italy, has sustainability at its core. Representing a variety of brands like Mezzacorona, Rotari and Nota, this cooperative is focused on mitigating wine’s environmental footprint. From cover crops to packaging, it’s helping the environment while still offering the perfect pasta pairing.

Mezzacorona Group

Founded in 1904, Mezzacorona was the first winegrowers’ association established in northern Italy, located in the mountainous Trentino-Alto Adige region bordering Switzerland and Austria. Members supply grapes to Mezzacorona’s sustainable winery, where they are transformed into a variety of products, from Pinot Grigio to sparkling wine and grappa. Members actively set policies and strategies for the organization, while receiving information and training in return.

Another noteworthy principle is the group’s strong commitment to the environment. “At Mezzacorona, generations of families have chosen to operate with respect to the environment, adopting sustainable and integrated production techniques, thus producing genuine products,” Lucio Matricardi, a winemaker at Mezzacorona, told TriplePundit in an email. “A passionate and skillful team of oenologists [experts in wine making] and agronomists work day-by-day in close contact with our vine growers following the entire product life cycle in the vineyards, care during harvesting, and up to the bottling phase.”

Members are also certified under a voluntary national program aimed at minimizing pesticide, fertilizer and water use. “In 2016, all our winegrower members obtained the Ministerial Certification SQNPI — Italy’s National Integrated Production Quality System — for their grapes. And in 2017, this certification was obtained for all our Controlled Designation of Origin wines,” Matricardi said. “A double recognition that guarantees, through a series of controls throughout the supply chain, that our work is sustainable from the land to the winery, from the vineyards to the bottle.”

Widely recognized throughout the European Union, these certifications are renewed every three years.

Cultivating change

Mezzacorona’s sustainable approach starts in the vineyard, where a number of techniques minimize its footprint.

“Sustainability is woven into Mezzacorona’s DNA — from the careful cultivation of its vineyards to the final bottle on the shelf,” Matricardi said. “In the fields, we practice low-impact viticulture [the cultivation and harvesting of grapes].”

The cooperative prioritizes soil health by using cover crops and green manure, which is the practice of growing and incorporating plants into the soil.

“Our vineyards are planted with grasses and legumes and benefit from the practice of green manuring,” Matricardi said. “This naturally adds organic matter to the soil. In addition, mechanical operations are kept to a minimum to avoid soil compaction.”

Green manure improves soil fertility, thereby reducing the need for synthetic fertilizer. It also increases the soil’s ability to hold water while preventing erosion and weed growth.

Mezzacorona also preserves hedgerows and stone walls in its vineyards to provide shelter for plants and animals. In turn, hedgerows reduce erosion, minimize wind damage to crops, and provide habitat for the natural enemies of crop pests, reducing pesticide use.

But winemaking is also a thirsty endeavor. Researchers estimate that producing a standard 750 ml bottle of Italian wine uses anywhere from 451 to 1193 liters of water, with over 97 percent of that used in the vineyards. To address this, Mezzacorona adopted drip irrigation, which delivers water directly to the base of a plant. The practice can reduce water use compared to traditional systems such as sprinklers. But one drawback is the expense of installing and maintaining these irrigation systems.

From sprays to sustainability

Besides the vineyard, Mezzacorona is addressing other skeletons in the Chardonnay closet. For instance, Sangiovese is noted for its hints of leather and tart cherry, not pyrimethanil and fenhexamid. Researchers have found that wine can contain residues of over two dozen pesticides, mainly fungicides and insecticides. While helping to eliminate diseases, insects and weeds, these chemicals can damage the soil, pollute the air and water, and harm wine growers, workers and neighbors. Plus, they can lower the quality of the wine itself.

Mezzacorona still uses pesticides, but strives to minimize their use with a technique called mating disruption, where vineyards are flooded with female pest pheromones to attract males. With pheromones throughout the area, the likelihood of a male finding a female is lowered, consequently reducing their population size. The technique has lowered the densities of a serious pest, the vine mealybug, in California vineyards.

Mezzacorona has other sustainable measures swirling in its glass, too. “In our case, we have chosen to adopt sustainability standards such as the Equalitas certification, which allows us to monitor our carbon dioxide emissions and work to reduce them through targeted improvement actions,” Matricardi said.

The Equalitas certification focuses on the social, environmental and economic aspects of sustainable winemaking. The program has environmental requirements for soil biodiversity, carbon and water footprints, pesticide and fertilizer use, and social practices like workers’ rights, anti-discrimination policies and training programs.

And since most of wine’s carbon footprint comes from the production and transport of glass bottles, the cooperative is lightening up its packaging, too. “Over the years, we have significantly reduced the weight of our bottles,” Matricardi said. “We also use certified paper for our labels and recyclable cardboard packaging.”

While a positive move to mitigate carbon emissions, lighter glass bottles still have a higher carbon footprint compared to other types of packaging.

Innovative tradition

As the world’s second-largest producer of wine, Italy’s wine industry was valued at $21.5 billion annually. Fortunately, sustainable wine is set to capture a growing segment of that market, with 57 percent of consumers saying they prefer wines that disclose their carbon footprint in a survey from the food and beverage industry software company Tastewise. And nearly three-fourths of consumers said they are more likely to trust a brand that promotes its environmental impact. Environmentally-conscious organizations, like Mezzacorona, are one sip ahead of the competition.

“Our farmers have deep roots in the region,” Matricardi said. “And their commitment to the land runs generations deep, making sustainability a shared priority driven by genuine care and long-standing connection.”

Beyond 2030, SAF demand is expected to nearly triple to 40 Mt (13.2Bgal) by 2035, driven by accelerated mandates. With expected SAF capacity being 18 Mt (6 Bgal) in 2030, this creates a 26 Mt (8.6 Bgal) gap to be addressed in just five years. Co-processing and renewable diesel is expected to contribute up to 6 Mt (2 Bgal), but the majority will need to come from additional capacity

Supplied volumes doubled to 1 Mt (0.3 Bgal) in 2024 compared to 2023 levels, the EU and UK mandates started in January 2025, and approximately 60 airlines set specific SAF targets for 2030. As investment continues to flow into the industry, SAF is strengthening its role as the cornerstone for the decarbonization of the aviation industry.

5 June, 2025 Amsterdam – SkyNRG releases fifth Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market Outlook, developed in close collaboration with ICF today. This year’s edition highlights both the progress made and the important steps still needed to ensure a resilient, scalable SAF industry capable of meeting long-term decarbonization goals.

“It is with great pride that we present SkyNRG’s fifth Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market Outlook,” said Maarten van Dijk, CEO and Co-founder of SkyNRG. “This year’s edition is particularly special, as it has been developed in close collaboration with ICF. While the report continues to guide our internal strategy, we also hope it contributes to broader market understanding and momentum.”

Key findings and outlook

The SAF market is experiencing a period of rapid development. In 2024, supplied volumes doubled from the previous year. The start of the EU and UK SAF mandates in January 2025 marked a critical step, with projected global demand reaching approximately 2 million tonnes this year.

Looking ahead to 2030, demand could rise to over 15 million tonnes, with significant contributions from both mandated and voluntary commitments. However, the report also highlights that nearly 82% of current SAF capacity relies on HEFA technology, which is limited by available feedstocks. This indicates a need to scale up alternative technologies and feedstock pathways to meet future demand.

“To capture longer-term dynamics, we’ve extended our analysis to reflect what is needed through 2050,” van Dijk added. “Robust policy frameworks and targeted support, for offtakers, technology developers, and infrastructure players are essential to keep SAF growth on track.”

Collaborative industry insight

Dan Galpin, Global Aviation Lead at ICF, emphasized the collaborative nature of this year’s effort and the evolving landscape:

“It has been our pleasure to work with SkyNRG on this flagship SAF Market Outlook report. With mandates now in effect in the EU and UK, and more ambitious policies taking shape globally, the SAF market is entering a new phase. Hundreds of projects have been announced, showing strong confidence. Continued policy support remains key to realizing long-term goals.”

A strategic moment for SAF

The report’s findings underscore both the progress to date and the strategic opportunities ahead. As SAF demand is expected to nearly triple again between 2030 and 2035, achieving that growth will depend on expanded investment, supportive regulation, and supply chain coordination.

“The challenge is massive, but the rewards can be even bigger,” van Dijk concluded. “We hope you find this year’s Market Outlook insightful and engaging.”",https://skynrg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5107-1024x753.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 14:57:27.200945

Dive Brief:

Charlotte-based technology conglomerate Honeywell, Samsung’s engineering subsidiary Samsung E&A, chemicals company Johnson Matthey and chemical engineering firm Gidara Energy have joined together to create a strategic sustainable aviation fuel technology group, Honeywell announced Thursday.

The four companies, organized as the SAF Technology Alliance, aim to create a new technology offering to help scale and deliver a full-service SAF production chain to take the fuel from a waste feedstock to a final product.

The new SAF-focused alliance will look to scale the use of gasification and the Fischer-Tropsch process — a chemical reaction that makes synthesis gas — in SAF production in the near term, according to the release. SAFs still made up less than 1% of global jet fuel use last year and are growing at a ""disappointingly slow” rate, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Dive Insight:

Currently, each of the four companies that compose the alliance have expertise in one or more aspects of the SAF production process, but the group estimates that the combined resources and integrated solution will reduce the time between a feasibility study and facility startup by 15%, according to the June 5 release. The SAF Technology Alliance also said their modular, integrated solutions should reduce capital expenditures by 10%, based on a theoretical schedule and cost analysis conducted by the companies.

Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions CEO Ken West said that the “end-to-end SAF alliance demonstrates the power of collaboration to address the world’s energy demands.” The four companies will create a non-exclusive product for clients that combines Gidara’s expertise in gasification and synthesis gas production; Johnson Matthey’s catalysts and technology to convert syngas to fuels; Honeywell’s technology and digital automation; and Samsung E&A’s expertise in global engineering, procurement, production and project execution.

“As demand for SAF increases, the technology to expand available feedstock options becomes increasingly vital,” West said in the release. “This comprehensive alliance provides refiners with a strategic approach to quickly execute their vision.”

Maurits van Tol, CEO of Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies, said the group is looking to target “the common challenges faced by SAF producers” to, ultimately, accelerate global SAF deployment.

The alliance said it will first focus on scaling the use of gasification and the Fischer-Tropsch method because it will enable the use of biomass and municipal solid waste as a feedstock, and such production methods are “increasingly important.” The International Energy Agency estimated in 2023 that waste-, residue- and nonfood energy crop-derived biofuels could meet 40% of all biofuel demand by 2030.

Samsung E&A CEO Hong Namkoong said the combined expertise of the companies will create a “resilient and scalable” SAF supply chain, and Gidara Energy CEO Norbert Kamp said the group will help unlock “the value of waste to meet the growing demand for SAF.”

Uttar Pradesh is making a bold move with its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Manufacturing Promotion Policy-2025, the first of its kind in India. This initiative aims to convert agricultural waste-like sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, and wheat straw-into bio-jet fuel, creating new revenue streams for farmers while advancing India's green aviation goals.

The policy is expected to attract ₹3,000 crore in investments, with over 18 companies expressing interest in setting up SAF production units in the state. It also offers capital subsidies, state GST reimbursements, land waivers, and interest subsidies to incentivize industry participation.

The policy offers capital subsidies, GST reimbursements, and land waivers to attract private players.

Beyond economic benefits, this policy aligns with India's climate commitments, helping reduce carbon emissions and promoting energy security. With Uttar Pradesh's strong logistics infrastructure, including five international airports, the state is positioning itself as a hub for SAF production.

This could be a game-changer for India's aviation sector.

India's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) policy is ambitious, but it differs from global approaches in key ways. While India leverages agricultural waste like sugarcane bagasse and rice husk, making it cost-effective and farmer-friendly, The EU and UK have blending mandates requiring airlines to use SAF, but these have led to high costs due to supply chain inefficiencies.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) warns that SAF production is too low globally, covering just 0.7% of airline fuel needs. India accounts for ~2.5% of global aviation fuel demand, with significant room for SAF expansion.

While India focuses on bio-based SAF, global efforts also explore hydrogen fuel and electric aircraft, though these technologies are still in early stages.

This, combined with the use of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is presumably what gives the aircraft the appendage ‘eco’, and separates it from its competition.

“A very proud moment”

In a roll-out event in the airline’s hangar on May 28, Deutsche Aircraft’s CEO, Nico Neumann, took the time to speak with LARA editor, Rob Munro, stressing that it was “a very proud moment for the whole Deutsche Aircraft team to bring the aviation [production] entirety back to Germany”.

When asked about the market for the D328eco, Neumann said: “on one side [there’s] the replacement market, so that is all the aircraft flying [in] that segment which are going into retirement age. Then we have [the] gross market in the multi-mission, multi-role segment, [for example] flying hospitals, search and rescue, border control”. Neumann also pointed to the less saturated markets for regional aircraft, like India, where the new turboprop is likely to be popular.

Reality bites

Despite Neumann and his team’s undoubted pride in their shiny new creation, there are some in the industry who are keen to inject some cold, objective reality into the proceedings.

“There is demand for smaller turboprops, but this generally emanates from the used sector, as the ATR42-600 is the only in-production aircraft currently servicing the sub-50-seats segment,” Jonathan Mcdonald, Manager of Classic and Cargo Aircraft at IBA, told LARA. “The ATR42-600 is by no means a poor performing product; moreover, it is ordered as a niche among operators that do not need the 72 seats plus of an ATR72-600”.

He points out that only 70 ATR42-600s have been delivered over a 14-year period, amounting to a somewhat paltry average of five aircraft a year.

“This supports the notion that most operators looking to acquire a new passenger turboprop will pursue the avenue of 72 seats plus,” says McDonald

Deutsche Aircraft is also keen to promote the new turboprop’s ability to run on 100% SAF but McDonald feels this might not be the unique selling point they are hoping for.

“If some…less developed jurisdictions either cannot access SAF or find the fuel diversification challenging, this could be an issue for Deutsche Aircraft, with would-be operators continuing to use older models instead and therefore limiting re-marketing prospects for the D328eco,” he says.

Rugged reliability

One of the major attractions of regional turboprops is their rugged reliability and this very strength could be a barrier to entry for the D328eco, competing to replace older programmes such as the SAAB 340 series and Dash 8-100/Q200/Q300 which are still performing well despite their age..

“Most of these programmes have some form of life extension program in place, and operators are taking advantage of this,” says McDonald. “Despite their age, these older turboprops can still be operated very efficiently, and their operator’s operational modus operandi is centric to these types. To transition to a newer model would be a huge logistical exercise and investment.”

To summarise, Deutsche Aircraft’s enthusiastic and dynamic launch of this smaller turboprop regional aircraft has been met with considerable positivity and admiration but its practical appeal to operators remains to be proven.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8.png,N,,2025-06-06 11:57:03.464106

The collaboration will focus on creating new commercial models that balance the requirements of SAF producers and buyers by introducing novel pricing and offtake structures that provide greater access to SAF.

The MoU outlines plans for evaluating commercial models that support SAF procurement, designed to acknowledge the value of LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) fuel pathway.

LanzaJet CEO Jimmy Samartzis said: “Scaling SAF requires flexible, forward-thinking commercial models that work for both producers and consumers.

​“This collaboration with ATOBA Energy is about building the kind of aligned ecosystem we need to drive innovation, catalyse investment, and accelerate SAF deployment globally. It’s another step forward in ensuring that the value of next-generation technologies like ours can be realised at scale because the future growth and sustainability of aviation depends on it.”

ATOBA focuses on facilitating the development of SAF production through its comprehensive management of upstream and downstream SAF offtake portfolios.

The company’s approach involves off taking from a variety of producers who utilise different production technologies such as HEFA, Alcohol to Jet, Gas-Fischer Tropsch, or Power to Liquids.

This strategy helps mitigate technological and pricing risks related to these diverse SAF production pathways.

Furthermore, ATOBA facilitates long-term offtake agreements among airlines, jet-fuel distributors, SAF producers, and financial institutions. These agreements are vital for scaling up the industry.

LanzaJet’s ATJ technology benefits from such commercial models, which help maintain the integrity of its value proposition and promote more sustainable growth pathways.

ATOBA Energy co-founder and CEO Arnaud Namer said: “We are delighted to develop long-term offtake agreement models with LanzaJet, a company that is leading the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway.

“ATJ plays a key technological role in scaling the SAF industry as it contributes to using the best production route and feedstock depending on the specific regional characteristics.

The alliance will draw on their respective strengths – Gidara’s proficiency in gasification and syngas, Johnson Matthey’s catalysts and technology know-how, Honeywell’s process tech and digital automation and Samsung’s global EPC and project experience – to streamline the entire SAF production chain, from feedstock to final product.

By collaborating, the companies plan to introduce a new joint technology offering that leverages the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) production process and aims to unlock abundant, globally available feedstock options to help meet growing demand for SAF and support energy security.

The joint approach aims to expedite project timelines and provide customers with a single point of accountability for project execution and product guarantees, ensuring communication, coordination and reliability throughout the SAF production process.

With the resources of all four companies, the integrated and modular solution is expected to reduce the time between feasibility study and facility startup by more than 15% and could reduce capital expenditures by up to 10%.

Over the near term, the collaboration aims to scale the use of gasification and FT SAF production methods, while enabling biomass and municipal solid waste to be used as feedstocks.

As the SAF industry is potentially hamstrung by the limits of traditional feedstocks, this production method is becoming increasingly important, with the International Energy Agency reporting that biofuels produced from waste and non-food energy crops will meet more than 40% of total biofuel demand by 2030.

Ken West, President and CEO, Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said, “As demand for SAF increases, the technology to expand available feedstock options becomes increasingly vital. This comprehensive alliance provides refiners with a strategic approach to quickly execute their vision.”

Dr Norbert Kamp, CEO of Gidara Energy, said it is not just providing a technical solution but helping clients and communities realise the potential of waste as a catalyst for a future supported by cleaner energy sources.

It will give producers price stability and should support sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the UK by helping to de-risk investment in production.

This is something that Logistics UK has been calling for for some time, so it is good for the sector that the government is listening to industry as it continues its journey towards net-zero emissions.

On the same day, the government also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers, which should also help the aviation industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year.

The mandate specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030 should be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

Sustainable aviation fuel as a drop-in fuel is a vital alternative to traditional kerosene jet fuel, reducing aviation lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%.

It also lowers other harmful pollutants, such as particulate matter and sulphur oxides, contributing to better air quality around airports and reducing the aviation sector’s overall environmental impact.

With no zero-emission alternative currently viable for long-haul flights, SAF is the most significant opportunity to reduce aviation emissions in the medium term.

SAF is now a proven technology and is used in aircraft today, therefore, attention must turn to addressing barriers around costs and increasing production to meet rising demands.

It will be essential to expand feedstocks beyond HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids derived from oils or fats) to include other sustainable sources such as waste and these options should be explored without passing along costs to industry.

Producing SAF domestically in the UK carries several economic and strategic advantages. First and foremost, producing SAF in the UK will increase availability, addressing a key concern around security of supplies, as well as helping to reduce overall costs as the industry is scaled up.

Domestic production of SAF can have wider national benefits too, such as stimulating economic growth by creating new jobs across the supply chain, from feedstock production to fuel distribution.

This has the potential to benefit local economies, particularly in rural areas where biomass feedstocks are sourced, and in industrial regions where new SAF production facilities are established.

A key challenge for emerging SAF projects is the uncertainty of revenue streams, which can deter investment and hinder the growth of the industry.

This is why the government must ensure the bill passes through parliament as quickly as possible to ensure a revenue certainty mechanism is operational as soon as possible, given the SAF mandate is already effective and has been since the beginning of this year.

By integrating SAF into the fuel supply chain and adopting higher SAF blends, the aviation industry can make significant progress towards achieving international climate targets and support the UK’s commitment to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/0/8/11208_alexandra_herdman_logistics_uk_source_30_5_25_678145.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 12:57:08.446072

NEW DELHI: US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has undertaken a commitment that all of its commercial planes will be 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatible by 2030. With India one of its major markets, the company is making initial steps for creating an enabling environment for a SAF ecosystem.

Brian Moran, Chief Sustainability Officer at Boeing, in an interaction with ET Infra, highlighted that India has a lot of potential for development of a SAF ecosystem and Boeing is keen to share all the resources and experience that it has gathered over the years in partnership with the Indian government.

Advt

Recently, the aircraft major entered into a partnership with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd to explore opportunities to scale up SAF production in India, support the certification of domestically produced SAF, and advocate policies to develop a robust SAF ecosystem in the country.

“We have been very engaged on the technology side, which is where we control the airplane and work with our suppliers. But we also engage with energy companies in doing feedstock assessment, regional studies because different regions have different potential for feedstock,” said Moran, adding that over the years Boeing has undertaken feedstock assessments in countries such as Brazil, Southeast Asia, Japan.

Boeing is currently working with the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for undertaking a new study on India for capacity building in the development and deployment of SAF.

“What is really exciting here in India is the breadth of feedstock. From used cooking oil to municipal solid waste in the future, to e-fuels or power to liquid fuels, you really have the range of potential here in India.” said Moran.

Food vs Fuel

While the adoption of SAF by the global commercial airline industry will become mandatory from 2027 onwards, the food vs fuel debate lingers on, which highlights whether farmland or crops should be diverted for fuel production rather than focus on food security.

Advt

“It should never be a debate because if you compete with food, your aviation fuel is not sustainable. It is an important discussion, but our position is this fuel should not compete with food,” said Moran.

Moran highlighted that there has been lots of advancement in cropping and agriculture that actually helps the food supply, and not compete with it.

“There is a whole science around regenerative agriculture where some of the new types of crops being grown that you can use for SAF, can be grown out of cycle. So you grow food and then in the periods of time when that land is not used, you can use these cover crops to produce fuel and it is actually good for the soil. It regenerates the soil quicker,” said Moran.

India SAF Adoption

Boeing customers in India-Air India, Akasa Air and SpiceJet-will be looking forward to taking deliveries of aircraft which are SAF compatible as the Indian government undertakes steps to adhere to international norms on SAF adoption.

“The good news is that today's (Boeing) aircraft are certified up to 50 per cent (SAF compatible). So we have a long way to go. By 2030 we want to make sure that all of our aircraft can have 100 per cent (SAF compatible),” said Moran.

The adoption of SAF by the Indian aviation industry will be necessary to be in compliance with ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation or CORSIA obligations, a carbon offset and reduction scheme.

The offsetting requirement for most aircraft operators, including Indian airlines for international operations, will mandatorily come into effect from 2027 onwards. The Indian government has set an indicative target of 1 per cent blending of SAF in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) initially for international flights with effect from 2027 and to be gradually increased to 2 per cent in 2028 and to 5 per cent by 2030.

Last session, a similar bill was sent to the House Government Operations Committee after passing the Senate.
Opponents included the Small Business Association of Michigan, the Detroit Regional Chamber, Michigan Chemistry Council, the Michigan Waste and Recycling Association, and the Michigan Manufacturers Association.
“To date, the Michigan Department of State has produced more than 3,300 pages of materials and posted them on our website for all to see,” Hardmon said.
“There was precisely no money in the state school aid act, nothing to address the teacher shortage, even though it was rife, from fiscal year 2020 and before.","A handful of metro Detroit municipalities testified in support of hazardous waste legislation in a Senate committee on Thursday after their local disposal sites accepted hazardous waste from an Ohio train disaster and the Manhattan Project.

Without warning, Republic Industrial and Energy Solutions in Romulus accepted toxic debris from the 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, for underground injection. Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy inspections later found violations at the facility related to improperly labeled signs and malfunctioning alarm systems.

Less than a year later, the Wayne Disposal landfill in Van Buren Township initiated a transfer of radioactive soil and concrete from several nuclear test sites as part of a planned hazardous waste facility expansion.

Van Buren, Romulus, Canton, and Belleville filed an injunction after finding out, and a judge subsequently issued a restraining order on the move in September 2024.

Backed by Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton.), the community’s leaders since have been working on legislation to manage the toxic materials coming into their backyards.

SB 246, taken up for testimony in the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, would overhaul hazardous waste management in the following ways:

Hazardous waste disposal (“tipping”) fees would increase from $10 a ton to $25 a ton. Michigan has some of the lowest tipping fees in the country, Camilleri said, which is why it regularly receives waste from across state lines. Canton Township Supervisor Anne Marie Graham Hudak said this would encourage waste to be disposed of at sites in other, less-populated areas.

Technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM) disposal would be prohibited above extreme thresholds, and its tipping cost would go up. Van Buren Township Supervisor Kevin McNamara said this would still allow things like radioactive medical waste to be thrown away in Michigan but would protect against nuclear waste.

All hazardous waste facilities and expansions would be postponed for five years to allow for the development of a statewide hazardous waste plan. The plan would restrict the amount of waste dumped in Michigan to the amount of waste it produces and would create stricter siting requirements, Camilleri said.

SB 247 would impose a 0.417 fee per gallon on the type of hazardous waste disposal wells holding materials from the East Palestine derailment in Romulus. Revenue from the fee would then go toward waste management grants for the city, distributed by EGLE.

Last session, a similar bill was sent to the House Government Operations Committee after passing the Senate.

“I’ve had countless conversations with residents and local municipal leaders who are horrified about potentially harmful material being transported to their communities on their roads and disposed of in their backyard,” Camilleri said. “Frankly, it is ridiculous that these facilities are located at dense population centers in the first place.”

Since similar legislation was introduced in 2024, Camilleri said he has negotiated a fair price hike for tipping fees with the governor’s office. Revenue generated by the fee increase would fund resources to enforce the bill and its regulations.

The bill did not receive a vote.

Supporters included the Michigan Environmental Council, the Huron River Watershed Council and the Wayne County Executive. Opponents included the Small Business Association of Michigan, the Detroit Regional Chamber, Michigan Chemistry Council, the Michigan Waste and Recycling Association, and the Michigan Manufacturers Association.

The House filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on Thursday in the Court of Claims for failing to comply with a subpoena issued by Rep. Jay DeBoyer and the House Oversight Committee.

“Our commitment to bring accountability to Lansing is not just lip service,” DeBoyer (R-Clay) said in a statement. “After going years without legislative oversight, Benson has clearly grown comfortable operating independent of the other, co-equal branches of government.”

Department of State Spokesperson Cheri Hardmon said on Thursday Benson was glad the House had finally taken the issue to court.

“Since the beginning of this saga, Secretary Benson has asked lawmakers to let a court review their request for sensitive election information that, in the wrong hands, would compromise the security of our election machines, ballots and officials,” Hardmon said is a statement. “We are glad they have finally acted accordingly and look forward to a court of law resolving this dispute.”

DeBoyer also said in his statement that the House has attempted to get Benson to cooperate through requests, offers and other legal routes.

“Her continued defiance now brings us to the courtroom, where we will continue to diligently work to deliver government transparency for the people of Michigan,” he said.

Benson and her staff have turned over some of the requested information but have refused to turn over other materials they argue are sensitive and, if publicly released, could be used to interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment, or impersonate a clerk on Election Day.

“To date, the Michigan Department of State has produced more than 3,300 pages of materials and posted them on our website for all to see,” Hardmon said. “Let’s be clear – the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee is demanding information that could be used to interrupt the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment of impersonate a clerk on Election Day.”

The lawsuit requests a declaratory judgment from the court that the Michigan House has issued a valid subpoena that Benson must comply with and requests an injunction prohibiting Benson or the Department of State from modifying any relevant records.

“Government actors, regardless of their title, all have a responsibility to uphold their constitutional oath and adhere to the law,” DeBoyer said. “Yet, Jocelyn Benson, one of the most powerful office holders in Michigan, must instead be brought to court and forced to comply with Michigan statute. We will not let her disregard for the law keep us from delivering results to the people we represent.”

Hardmon said the department remained committed to transparency but would not compromise election security.

“We look forward to working with a judge to come to a resolution that will resolve this dispute,” she said.

A coalition of education advocacy groups are looking to put a new option for school funding on the ballot in 2026: raising the state income tax rate on Michigan’s highest earners, with the possibility of generating $1.7 billion annually in K-12 revenue.

The Invest in MI Kids initiative seeks to amend the Constitution to change Michigan’s 4.25% flat income tax rate to require individuals earning over $500,000 and couples earning over $1 million to pay 5% of their income in state taxes. According to taxpayer data compiled by the Department of Treasury, fewer than 60,000 of the 4.9 million people who filed income tax returns in 2021 reported an income over $500,000.

Organizers of the initiative said placing a higher financial burden on the wealthiest residents of the state would help close the funding gap in Michigan’s education system, which advocates estimate is roughly $4 to $5 billion annually. Increased revenue to the School Aid Fund, they said, would allow the state to support new funding for priorities like career and technical education, recruiting and retaining teachers, and reducing class sizes.

“Michigan’s flat tax system was designed for the ultra-wealthy, not working families,” said Molly Sweeney, Organizing Director of 482 Forward, one of the coalition’s founding partners. “That’s why we’re coming together to rewrite the rules so those who aren’t paying what they owe in taxes finally chip in to support the services we all rely on – especially public education.”

Jase Bolger, President and Chief Executive Officer of the West Michigan Policy Forum, today issued the following statement after it was reported that petition language was filed for a ballot proposal that would create a 5% income tax surcharge on individuals who earn $500,000 annually:

West Michigan Policy Forum Chief Executive Officer Jase Bolger in a statement panned the proposal, saying workers and kids deserve better.

“Way too many kids in Michigan can’t read, but it’s clear these adults can’t do simple math. Today in Michigan, the more you make the more you pay,” Bolger said. “But worse is that this proposal would drive Michigan further in the wrong direction. While states that are growing are overwhelmingly cutting taxes on work, or don’t tax work at all, this would double down on Michigan’s lagging policies that have led to the fastest growing unemployment rate in the country.”

Invest in MI Kids is supported by education organizations including the Michigan Education Justice Coalition and Fund MI Future, a coalition of groups including the Michigan League for Public Policy and Progress Michigan.

“This is about fairness, plain and simple,” Fund MI Future organizer Charlie Cavell said in a statement. “When you include sales tax and other taxes, working and middle-class families in Michigan actually pay a higher percentage of their income in state taxes than the top 1 percent. That’s upside-down. Our ballot initiative will restore balance and ensure that those at the very top finally contribute to our schools and communities like the rest of us already do.”

Organizers said the coalition aims to gather 600,000 signatures, exceeding the 2026 requirement of 446,198 signatures for a constitutional amendment measure to appear on statewide ballots.

A similar surcharge was approved by voters in Massachusetts in 2022, requiring taxpayers who make over $1 million annually to pay more towards public education and transportation infrastructure.

A draft petition will likely come before the Board of State Canvassers at the board’s June or July meetings.

Superintendent of Public Instruction Michael Rice and State Board of Education President Pamela Pugh responded to a volley of criticisms from Republican members of the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, defending the Department of Education’s budgetary requests and progress made in student achievement in recent years, even as many areas still require improvement.

Rice and Pugh gave a presentation to the committee on MDE’s Top Ten Strategic Education Plan and the state’s progress in meeting each one, noting improvements that include a record high graduation rate in 2024, progress toward Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s 60 by 30 goal for postsecondary education and increases in both Advanced Placement course enrollment and Advanced Placement test scores.

They also emphasized record enrollment in the Great Start Readiness Program and Michigan’s #1 rating in preschool quality, as well as the successes seen in teacher recruitment and retention upon continued investment in the Grow Your Own program. Rice said these improvements to Michigan’s education system in recent years reflect legislative changes and budgetary attention being paid after decades of neglect.

“There was precisely no money in the state school aid act, nothing to address the teacher shortage, even though it was rife, from fiscal year 2020 and before. It wasn’t until fiscal year 2021 that you invested anything in addressing the teacher shortage, and those were small dollars in ’21 and ’22,” Rice said. “It wasn’t until ’23, based on the recommendation of the department, that you began to consider and ultimately invest in addressing the teacher shortage, $1 billion in the last three years to teachers.”

Still, Rice said, most of the investments in addressing teacher retention and other aspects of education improvements are in their infancies and can only provide partial or rudimentary evidence for their impact.

“What have the results been? Well, the results are fledgling, because the funding is fledgling,” Rice said.

The main ask MDE currently has for the Legislature is mandating Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling, or LETRS training. Rice and Pugh said it would be a significant step in improving literacy proficiency for younger students.

Upon the presentation’s completion, the committee’s Republican members were quick to critique MDE and its leadership for Michigan’s low spot in national rankings for literacy proficiency. Rice noted that the most frequently cited test result by legislators, the National Center for Education Statistics’ Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, is based on only a small sample of students from each state and has different metrics for proficiency than other standardized tests taken by students in Michigan.

On the College Board’s PSAT testing that most 8th graders in the state take, 64% of Michigan students score at or above proficiency for their grade level, compared to 25% on the NAEP test.

Republican committee members, however, called the scores “unacceptable” and representative of “failure” on behalf of the department, arguing that Rice and Pugh should not have come to the Legislature asking for additional funding without concrete evidence of improvement in literacy metrics.

“The funding asks that you have made today have been not an education-related fund requests,” Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) said. “You can focus on reading, writing, and arithmetic and getting back to the basics. I encourage the department to focus on that.”

Tensions rose when Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay) inquired about a resolution the board passed in March condemning executive orders from President Donald Trump seeking to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in schools. Pugh defended the resolution, which she brought before the board.

“When we talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion, I’m talking about the superintendents who said at the end of our board table and talked about the special needs children who they are concerned will not be able to get the education that they need and deserve, educators who sat at the end of our board table from all over the state, from rural areas, talking about if they don’t have diversity, equity, and inclusion reflected up in the budget, or that has to be cut, that they may not be able to transport their children to the classroom,” Pugh said. “Reading the resolution and comprehending it, I know that’s a little difficult, but education is about making sure that our children have safe spaces where they can be supported to be able to learn, and that is what we’re talking about when we talk about DEI.”

Pugh said many of the initiatives that the federal government currently defines as DEI are critical to meeting children’s needs in school.

“Their needs are to be able to read and do math,” DeBoyer shot back. “That’s what their needs are, and we’re failing.”

Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) appeared to argue in favor of large class sizes after Rice detailed the department’s requests for the Legislature to address class sizes becoming exorbitantly large in recent years.

“The greatest generation, 1920, you know, the classroom sizes were 30, 40, 50 kids,” he said. “That produced the greatest generation. And if you’re worried about crowded classrooms, I think I offer this as a solution. Offer a voucher program and let parents choose to spend their money on programs, home school, programs with no strings attached, and that will reduce the amount of individuals in public education, because more families will be using their money to seek alternative means that might be more effective.”

Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) said he “has a problem” with referring to an age of school segregation and widespread illiteracy as an example to emulate in 2025.

“Literacy rates are higher today than they were in 1920,” Wegela said.

Rice reiterated several times the past four years of increased school funding, after decades of chronic underfunding, cannot be expected to yield immediate results without ongoing and increasing support from the state. Pugh likened Michigan’s history of education funding to dropping a brick on someone’s foot – “once you lift the brick off, the bones don’t go back together right away.”

Rice and Pugh cited the state’s new literacy and dyslexia laws as proof of the drawn-out nature of education policy showing results – negotiation and work during the lawmaking process took years, and the policies won’t be fully implemented in all Michigan schools until the 2027-28 school year, they estimated. Still, they argued, it’s worth continuing to invest in additional support and offer targeted funding to address specific problems.

“We’ve shown many metrics that have increased, that’s number one. Number two, all metrics have not increased, and we’ve acknowledged where those metrics haven’t increased relative to literacy,” Rice said. “We’ve pushed forward a plan with the legislature in concert. We’ve said we need every teacher to provide the state to do LETRS training without exception.”

Wegela asked Rice to assess what impact a budget process exceeding the statutory deadline of July 1 might have on local school districts. Rice said if the Legislature continues to drag its feet, schools will be forced to make staffing decisions based on an incomplete financial picture for the upcoming fiscal year.

“Local school districts have a responsibility to pass a budget by June 30. They don’t get to punt, and they’re going to pass budgets that are going to be unduly conservative because they don’t know what’s going to come out of this institution,” Rice said. “The result of that is going to be some real challenge in terms of staffing up classrooms. People who have opportunities elsewhere are going to take those opportunities and go, whether they’re in the private sector or in another state.”

Michigan could become a leader in producing sustainable aviation fuel that airlines want moving forward as they eye lower emissions by approving tax incentives to get the market off the ground, officials said during committee meetings in both the House and Senate.

On Tuesday, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee discussed HB 4424 and HB 4425, sponsored by Rep. Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd) and the Senate Natural Resources and Agriculture Committee discussed SB 235, and SB 236, sponsored by Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Sen. Joe Bellino (R-Monroe).

The bills would create a sustainable aviation fuel incentive program to provide corporate income tax credits to produce the product in Michigan. The program, which would sunset after 10 years under the bills, would be capped at $4.5 million in the first year and $9 million in subsequent years.

Supporters said the bills would benefit Michigan farmers and rural communities as it would provide another use for corn and other crops, as well as a financial incentive. Airlines would also benefit as they look to limit their emissions in the next 30 years.

“Our airline industry can either buy this product out of state or have it blended it out of state, or we can provide the opportunity … for our farmers and ethanol producers to enter this market,” Neyer said.

Major airlines are all hoping to decrease emissions in the coming decades and other states have already passed tax incentives for sustainable aviation fuel, Sarah Gonzales with the Delta Airlines told the House panel.

Gonzales said Delta alone purchases 4 billion gallons of fuel annually and in the next 30 years wants all 4 billion gallons to be sustainable fuel. She said no state has cornered the market yet on the fuel type.

“We truly imagine Michigan has all the right tools at our fingertips to …be the leader in the market,” she said.

John Delmotte, president of the Michigan Corn Growers Association, said the aviation fuel legislation is the best thing he’s seen in years for the rural economy. The benefit to farmers will also help others in rural communities, he said.

“Michigan’s corn farmers are facing challenging economic times. The price of corn is down by more than 40% since 2022, while the price of everything else from inputs to logistics has gone up significantly,” he said in written testimony. “In addition, farmers are facing increased pressure from developers who want to purchase farmland and move it out of production. Having access to new and innovative markets is critical to ensuring that our family farmers can stay in business and keep that land in agriculture. A strong SAF market represents an opportunity to make sure farms stay profitable and can continue to be passed down through the generations.”

Nichole Keway Biber, an organizer with Clean Water Action, spoke in opposition to SB 235 and SB 236. She told committee members that the bills subsidize industries and likely do not reduce overall emissions.

“This is no time for false climate solutions that divert investments and focus away from achieving real … sustainability,” Biber said.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/hazardous-waste_featured-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 12:57:12.905675

This partnership focuses on delivering an integrated, end-to-end solution that transforms biomass and municipal solid waste into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) using the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis process. The vision? To streamline the entire journey, from raw waste to refined fuel, by combining each company’s unique expertise into a seamless, unified system.

At the heart of this collaboration lies a clear division of roles: Gidara Energy brings its cutting-edge gasification technology to convert diverse waste streams into syngas, the essential building block for synthetic fuel. Johnson Matthey provides the sophisticated catalysts and FT technology required to chemically transform syngas into liquid hydrocarbons, fuel ready for aviation use. Honeywell steps in with robust process infrastructure and advanced digital automation, ensuring all stages integrate smoothly and efficiently. Meanwhile, Samsung E&A oversees the engineering, procurement, construction, and overall project execution, serving as the anchor for on-the-ground delivery.

What sets this alliance apart is its unified accountability. Rather than a patchwork of vendors and subcontractors, the companies offer a single, coordinated point of contact, cutting through the complexity that traditionally bogs down SAF projects. Their combined approach aims to slash development timelines by over 15% and trim capital expenditures by up to 10%, addressing two of the biggest hurdles facing SAF adoption.

Samsung E&A’s chief executive, Hong Namkoong, said: “At Samsung E&A, we believe that delivering end-to-end SAF solutions requires more than innovation—it demands strong alliances with world-class technology providers.

“By integrating these advanced technologies and leveraging our proven engineering…we are building a resilient and scalable SAF value chain that will drive the future of sustainable aviation.”

Globally, the alliance plans to target governments and aviation fuel producers eager to adopt lower-carbon alternatives that can be deployed more quickly and cost-effectively. But the backdrop is complex. In the UK, the EU, and beyond, airports face tightening mandates to increase the SAF content in jet fuel to meet legally binding climate targets. However, despite broad industry support, especially for long-haul flights, the promise of SAF is shadowed by controversy.

Supply struggles to keep pace with demand and many production projects have stumbled financially. Critics question whether existing production pathways truly offer meaningful carbon reductions when considering the whole lifecycle. Issues like competition with food crops, deforestation linked to crop-based fuels, and the high energy demands of synthetic fuels risk undermining SAF’s environmental credentials.

As regulatory pressure intensifies, the industry faces a critical pivot point. Reliance on traditional feedstocks, such as used cooking oil or palm derivatives, is increasingly viewed as unsustainable. The race is on to develop next-generation feedstocks and production methods, solutions that can deliver genuine, scalable climate benefits without unintended trade-offs. This alliance, with its integrated and technology-driven approach, aims to be at the forefront of that shift.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c9eb1d76af5caf79d3fa20f9a5452c92.jpg/v1/fill/w_791,h_627,al_c,q_85/c9eb1d76af5caf79d3fa20f9a5452c92.jpg",N,,2025-06-06 10:56:18.364187

Scrutiny mounts over SAF

In markets including the UK and EU, airports are being mandated to increase the proportion of SAF in jet fuel provisions, in a bid to curb aviation’s emissions in line with legally binding climate goals.

But SAF, which is supported across the aviation industry and in the long-haul space in particular, has become increasingly controversial.

Demand is not yet ready to meet predicted supply needs, with many production projects faltering financially. And critics are increasingly questioning whether many current production methods actually deliver meaningful climate benefits across the fuel lifecycle.

Concerns range from competition with food production and deforestation linked to crop-based fuels, to the high energy demands of synthetic alternatives that could divert renewable power from more effective uses.

To integrate the farm economy with green energy, the Yogi Adityanath government 2.0 is drafting ‘Uttar Pradesh Sustainable Aviation Fuel Manufacturing Promotion Policy 2025’.

The state has already received 18 investment proposals to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore from companies looking to set up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) units in UP under the proposed policy.

The roadmap aligns with UP’s vision of becoming a $trillion economy with a major focus on manufacturing and green energy on the back of ‘Make in UP’ and ‘Made in UP’ roadmap.

The proposed policy aims at providing impetus to rural income by using biomass and grain-based feedstock such as sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, wheat straw and surplus food grains for generating aviation fuel.

UP, which is India’s top agricultural producer, is working on a roadmap to augment its portfolio of clean energy such as compressed bigas (CBG) to pare consumption of fossil fuels amid growing energy demand.

Some of these firms are Greenko, AM Greens, Balrampur Chini Mills, E20 Greenfuels, New Era Clean Tech and the Malbros Group.

Meanwhile, the UP government is holding consultations with key stakeholders including investors and energy majors to finalise India’s first SAF promotion policy before it is approved by the Yogi cabinet.

The proposed policy will accelerate UP’s green energy transition, thus putting money into the hands of the farmers while fostering a green ecosystem, according to UP chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh.

The policy will provide a host of incentives on land and capital investment to attract investment in the SAF domain.

Boasting India’s largest network of air, rail, road and expressway infrastructure, including five international airports, UP offers seamless logistics and market connectivity to investors.

Meanwhile, state industry interface ‘Invest UP’ has floated an Expression of Interest (EOI) inviting global SAF technology providers and clean energy innovators to join the ecosystem.

Moreover, the Yogi government is wooing investors with incentives, ‘Ease of Doing Business’ pitch and UP’s advantages as a production hub owing to its vast agri base, robust infra and proactive industrial policies.

At the centre of this shift is intermodal transport, a logistics model that uses more than one mode of transport but ensures the cargo stays in the same load unit throughout the journey.

It’s not a new concept, of course. Goods have always changed hands and vehicles, from carts to ships to wagons, but intermodal transport gained its full meaning in the 1960s with the standardisation of ISO containers. These made it possible to move cargo efficiently across long distances without unpacking or repacking between transport stages.

The aim today is clear: to create faster, more efficient and cleaner logistics solutions that cut emissions while keeping goods moving. DHL, under Julian Neo’s leadership in Malaysia and Brunei, is focusing on expanding infrastructure and operational capabilities to support this approach.

In pursuit of sustainability

Each mode of transport has its pros and cons. Road is fast and flexible but produces higher emissions; rail is more sustainable but relies on available infrastructure; ships move large volumes but are slow; and air is the fastest and cleanest at point of delivery but emits more CO2 per shipment.

Intermodal logistics attempts to get the best of each mode by combining rail or sea for the main leg, with shorter road journeys where required. This is particularly important in the context of Scope 3 emissions, which businesses are now under increasing pressure to reduce.

Through the GoGreen Plus programme, DHL allows customers to cut the carbon emissions linked to their shipments by investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“The main obstacle to the adoption of SAF is high costs, as production capacity remains limited,” explains Julian. “In 2022, we announced one of the largest SAF deals to date—a collaboration with bp and Neste to purchase further SAF through 2026.

“According to a Bloomberg article, DHL Group leads the world in SAF adoption, getting more than 3% of the aviation fuel in our own fleet of aircraft from sustainable aviation fuels in 2023. To achieve this, the company purchased more lower-emission jet fuel than all US airlines combined. Around 15% of the global supply of SAF in 2023 was purchased by DHL.”

DHL uses a ‘book and claim’ method to separate the environmental benefit from the physical supply chain, meaning businesses can claim a verified reduction in emissions, even if they’re not shipping from a location where SAF is currently used.

If the main transport leg is powered by rail or sea – and if SAF is used in aviation segments where necessary – then businesses can reduce emissions even in long-distance or complex supply chains.

""Sustainability now occupies a higher place in the customer agenda than ever before,” adds Julian.

This shift is backed by policy as Malaysia’s government prepares to introduce a carbon tax by 2026, targeting sectors such as energy and steel. The move is set to push logistics providers to integrate cleaner transport options across all stages of the supply chain.

Solving barriers to wider adoption

Using different carriers across a journey introduces complexity in pricing, tracking and accountability. That’s where logistics providers like DHL step in, offering end-to-end services from a single source, ensuring full visibility and carbon reporting.

“For many of our customers, the largest contributor of their Scope 3 emissions is upstream and downstream transportation and distribution activities,” says Julian.

“Businesses rely on complex logistics networks as part of their operations. Freight, delivery and packaging form the three main elements of any ecommerce company’s footprint.”

Digital tools now support this, too. DHL’s Carbon Dashboard simulates different shipment options to show their environmental impact. Its GoGreen portfolio also includes real-time emissions tracking, individual carbon reports and optimisation services that help businesses choose the most efficient and sustainable path for their freight.

“GoGreen Plus allows customers to ‘inset’ their supply chains through investment in SAF,” continues Julian. “As a result, the buyer owns the environmental benefits without physically possessing the fuel. They will also receive an independently-verified certificate to certify their claim.”

Momentum is growing, with more than 90,000 customers in Asia-Pacific already signed up to GoGreen Plus in its first year. Some, like AFFIN Group, are targeting emission reductions of up to 70%.

Julian concludes: “By allowing for greater accessibility, we can help to build demand and accelerate production towards scaling up global supply where it is needed to effectively reduce the carbon footprint of the transportation sector and make progress towards climate change mitigation.”

For companies operating in or through Malaysia, DHL’s approach means they can access cleaner fuels and intermodal efficiencies even before local SAF production starts in 2028.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/6caf7d63f14928d4b7a4a23c0165db88:16a3c3ffc16aaa89a80850786fee362c/b849454e-0d8b-4a79-bbab-1a2a6e04f974.jpeg.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 07:56:46.000125

Reuters said the move is consistent with Trump’s goal to slash regulations on oil and gas development and increase domestic fuels production as part of his energy agenda.

Last year the administration of Joe Biden prohibited oil and gas leasing on 10.6 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, while limiting development on more than 2 million additional acres.

The NPR-A is a 23-million-acre area on Alaska’s North Slope that was set aside in 1923 as an emergency oil supply for the US navy. The land, Reuters said, was opened to commercial development in the 1970s and is now managed by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management.

Companies active in the reserve include ConocoPhillips, Santos Ltd., Repsol SA, and Armstrong Oil & Gas Inc. ConocoPhillips is developing its 600-million-barrel Willow project, with first production expected in 2029.

While groups lauded the Biden rule for protecting animal habitats and the way of life of Indigenous communities, critics said it would cost jobs and make the US reliant on foreign sources for energy.

“Congress was clear: the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska was set aside to support America’s energy security through responsible development,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “The 2024 rule ignored that mandate, prioritizing obstruction over production and undermining our ability to harness domestic resources at a time when American energy independence has never been more critical.”

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the North Slope accounts for just over 3% of US oil production.

A 2020 assessment of Alaska’s Central North Slope by the US Geological Survey found there to be an estimated $3.6 billion barrels of oil and 8.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. This assessment is for undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources in conventional accumulations.

As of 2020, 18 billion barrels of oil had been transported through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, most of which was produced from the Central North Slope, states the USGS.

Most of the lands are owned by the State of Alaska and Alaskan native corporations.

The assessed area includes the Prudhoe Bay field, which lies between the National Petroleum Reserve to the west, the Brooks Range to the south, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the east. Within the giant field, the largest in North America and the 18th biggest worldwide, just over half of the 25 billion barrels of oil in place can be recovered with current technology, states BP Exploration, the operator of the field and 26 percent owner. ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. and ExxonMobil each owns 36 percent.

Trump officials, along with government and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, visited Prudhoe Bay on Monday, June 2.

An Associated Press story via The Globe and Mail, said that President Trump wants to double the amount of oil moving through Alaska’s pipeline system, and build a new natural gas project that would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas (LNG) overseas.

For years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.

The second technique was to look at the increased use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.
Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the main term used by the aviation industry to describe a non-conventional (fossil-derived) aviation fuel.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has updated its outlook on the ramp-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in 2025.
The problem lies with Europe’s SAF mandates Most of the available SAF is currently being directed towards Europe, where both the European Union and the UK introduced SAF mandates starting January 1, 2025.","Sustainable Aviation, which was the buzzword at the turn of the decade, seems to be cooling off. While everyone wants to look for a solution to cut down on aviation emissions, the work done towards it is not matching the speed of execution needed, and so, I wonder if things are working in the right direction or not.

How is aviation looking at lower emissions?

In 2021, commercial aviation came together to state that they would go to net zero by 2050 in an initiative that was brought together by IATA, the aviation industry representation body.

There were three major ways to cut down emissions, broadly. First, keep the current aircraft fleet young, which means the fuel consumption goes down because newer engines such as the CFM-LEAP and Pratt & Whitney’s GTF technology consume 15-18% lesser fuel than the earlier classic engines. The upgrades are broadly a decade old now and continue to mature.

The second technique was to look at the increased use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the main term

used by the aviation industry to describe a non-conventional (fossil-derived) aviation fuel. Current technology allows fuel to be

produced from other alternative sources, including non-biological resources; thus, the term is adjusted to highlight the sustainable

nature of these fuels.

The third approach has been to move away from combustion engines altogether, where alternative technologies are being explored, such as hydrogen-powered aircraft, electricity-powered aircraft and so on. Airbus, in 2021, launched the ZeroE initiative, where, every year, it intended to showcase the work done towards moving in this direction. They were working towards hydrogen-powered aircraft, electric powerplants and more, to eventually decide on what technology to move forward with.

Apart from all of these methods, aviation companies such as seat makers and others are continuously working on making more sustainable products to be fitted on board, and also upcycling whatever they remove from aircraft, rather than just throwing it away.

SAF is floundering

Sustainable Aviation Fuel has been around for a long while now, but production is still abysmally low. The input (feedstock) availability seems to be the challenge. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has updated its outlook on the ramp-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in 2025. According to the latest figures, global SAF output is expected to reach 2 million tonnes (2.5 billion litres) next year—double that of 2024, but still only 0.7% of total fuel consumption by airlines.

The problem lies with Europe’s SAF mandates

Most of the available SAF is currently being directed towards Europe, where both the European Union and the UK introduced SAF mandates starting January 1, 2025. However, this policy has come with unintended (and expensive) consequences.

To meet these new mandates, airlines are expected to procure around 1 million tonnes of SAF in Europe alone in 2025, costing an estimated USD 1.2 billion at market rates. But that’s not all, compliance fees and markups imposed by SAF suppliers could add another USD 1.7 billion to the bill. That makes SAF nearly five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel in the region. That cost has landed on our air tickets, as well. For instance, here is the extra I paid for a 1-hour travel ticket inside Europe a couple of months ago.

IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, said this on the sidelines of the IATA AGM earlier this week,

While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate

IATA argues that the money being spent on compliance costs could have been better utilised, specifically, in abating an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

Willie also said, in the press conference held later,

I think there is great concern that we’re not making sufficient progress, not as airlines, but as the value chain that needs to support the airlines transitioning to Net Zero in 2050. And that’s the reason we’re calling it out. We clearly want to see more coordinated action on the part of governments. I think we’re not being helped by countries and regions with mandates without accompanying incentives to stimulate production. I think we’ve been able to demonstrate that mandates have really not done anything to promote the additional production of sustainable aviation fuels, but have merely added additional costs with no environmental benefit. And that’s a great concern for all of the CEOs in the airline industry. I think we’re also concerned that a number of the key players who have said nice words about net zero in 2050 aren’t matching those words with actions. And we’ve made clear from the very beginning that the airline industry will not be able to achieve net-zero in 2050 unless everybody in the wider value chain supports the industry in doing that. So I think today, today it’s, you know, I use the word sounding the alarm. I think it is a wake-up call. We still have time to get there, but we do need to see more action on the part of all of the partners in the value chain to make sure that the industry can get there.

Of course, the unavailability of SAF in real usable quantities means that airlines are unable to use it meaningfully. For instance, Pieter Elbers, on behalf of IndiGo, said there was no point SAF was going to be used in India until it was produced here.

It doesn’t make any sense for us to start shipping in SAF from outside the country to India and then to say, we’re great, we’re having a bit of SAF, doesn’t make any sense.

Where are we with alternative technology?

One of the most prominent works has been going on with the CFM RISE project, which tests technologies that could be available by the second half of the next decade. The programme goals include improving fuel efficiency by more than 20 per cent compared to today’s most efficient engines, as well as ensuring compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to provide further emissions reductions.

Airbus promised entry into service in 2035 of the various technologies it started to work on in 2020. However, as the WSJ reported earlier this year, the OEM, after spending 1.7 Billion Euros, has cut down on funding and reassigned part of the talent assigned to the R&D were moved to other projects. This means a delay of up to a decade to the launch of the “sustainable aircraft”.

Bottomline

While it’s encouraging that SAF production is set to double in 2025, the economics and policy frameworks still present serious challenges. IATA is sounding the alarm on the European model of mandates that push costs higher, and is instead pushing for smarter, global-scale solutions. On the other hand, the emergence of new technologies has also slowed down for the time being, with major vendors putting their plans on ice to do R&D on the new aircraft technologies, while they focus on filling up the current backlog.

What do you make of the sustainability ambitions of the aviation industry? Do you think it is floundering as well?

An example of this is Repsol Nexa Diesel, formulated on the basis of the company's HVO, 100% renewable and which also has the premium additive package.
In fact, we have the first large-scale 100% renewable fuel plant in the iberian peninsula, a project that represents a new step towards mobility aimed at reducing carbon emissions.
This plant, located in Cartagena, has the capacity to produce HVO and other biofuels from raw materials of organic origin.
The agreement joins similar ones signed with different companies, in order to reduce transport emissions through our 100% renewable fuels.","HVO or hydrobiodiesel is a biofuel that is produced from organic waste such as recycled vegetable oils and animal fats. Unlike conventional biodiesel, which is obtained by a chemical process of transesterification (a method that converts oils or fats into biodiesel by exchanging components with an alcohol), HVO is produced by hydrogenation. This process improves the quality of the resulting fuel by removing impurities, increasing its stability and performance, and producing a fuel with better combustion properties.

In practice, hydrogenation involves the addition of hydrogen to oils and fats under high temperatures and pressure, removing oxygen and creating a chemical structure similar to that of diesel of mineral origin, but with a significantly smaller carbon footprint. This feature is one of the main attractions of hydrobiodiesel.

Achieving a low-carbon future depends, to a large extent, on innovation. In the renewable fuels sector, the types and applications we develop at Repsol stem from this commitment to the search for innovative solutions. Within this chapter, however, it is worth distinguishing between synthetic fuels or e-fuels - still in the experimental phase - and biofuels, which are already a reality and are available in an increasing number of our service stations in the iberian peninsula.

An example of this is Repsol Nexa Diesel, formulated on the basis of the company's HVO, 100% renewable and which also has the premium additive package. It is important to note that being the leading producer of HVO in the iberian peninsula, as well as the first marketer for the end customer of 100% renewable fuels in Spain, is the result of years of research in our R&D center, Repsol Technology Lab. In fact, we have the first large-scale 100% renewable fuel plant in the iberian peninsula, a project that represents a new step towards mobility aimed at reducing carbon emissions. This plant, located in Cartagena, has the capacity to produce HVO and other biofuels from raw materials of organic origin.

Another example of technological innovation is biofuels for aircraft (biojet, or SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel), which are the main lever to reduce CO2 emissions in the aviation sector, since in their entire life cycle they avoid up to 80% of them. Recently - together with Iberia - we have signed an agreement with Inditex that allows Repsol's SAF to represent 5% of the fuel that Iberia uses to transport Inditex merchandise on its flights.

The materialization of these and other actions is observed in agreements such as the one reached with the Sesé logistics and transport group. Under the agreement, Repsol will supply eight million litres of hydrobiodiesel over the next two years to vehicles in the company's fleet.

Achieving Airport Carbon Accreditation Level 5 in 2023, Schiphol is the only airport among Europe’s five busiest hubs to reach this milestone.
“We are proud of these achievements and the teams involved in ensuring our commitment to more sustainable aviation,” Pronk adds.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel Schiphol recognises that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is currently the most viable option to reduce aviation emissions in the short term.
With its ambitious goals and concrete actions, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport is proving that sustainable aviation is not just a vision but a reality in the making.","As the aviation industry grapples with the urgent need to decarbonise, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) emerges as a beacon of sustainable innovation. With a vision of achieving zero waste and zero emissions by 2030, the Dutch airport is taking bold steps to transform its operations and infrastructure in alignment with global environmental goals. As one of Europe’s busiest hubs, Schiphol’s commitment to sustainable practices sets an important precedent for the global aviation industry.

In 2023, Schiphol became the first airport in the world to have its long-term net-zero targets validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). “Schiphol has set ambitious sustainability goals, including zero emissions by 2030 for Scope 1 and 2, and net-zero for Scope 3 by 2050,” says Denise Pronk, Head of Sustainability at Schiphol.

Achieving Airport Carbon Accreditation Level 5 in 2023, Schiphol is the only airport among Europe’s five busiest hubs to reach this milestone. “We are proud of these achievements and the teams involved in ensuring our commitment to more sustainable aviation,” Pronk adds.

Greener ground operations One of Schiphol’s most groundbreaking initiatives is the electrification of its ground operations. Partnering with KES, Schiphol is testing an Iron Flow Battery that supports electric ground power units (E-GPUs) by providing a consistent, substantial supply of electricity. With a maximum storage capacity of 500 kWh, the battery helps alleviate pressure on the energy grid while enabling aircraft to turn off their Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) that run on kerosene.

“Electric ground equipment is becoming ever more popular at Schiphol,” says Pronk. “But there are challenges, such as needing additional personnel to charge e-GPUs and managing battery charge levels during busy operations.” Despite these challenges, transitioning to electric ground support equipment, including electric buses that reduce emissions and improve air quality, is a crucial step toward creating a greener airport environment.

Harnessing renewable energy Since 2018, Schiphol has powered its operations with 100% Dutch wind energy, thanks to a partnership with energy supplier Eneco. The airport is also expanding its use of solar energy, including a major solar panel farm that powers the entire P3 parking garage.

A significant shift away from natural gas is also underway. Pronk shares that Schiphol has implemented Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems to drastically cut gas consumption. Between 2010 and 2024, the airport reduced its gas usage by almost 70 million cubic meters—equivalent to the consumption of 46,000 households.

Terminal 3 has been equipped with ATES since 2019, significantly reducing gas dependence. In 2024, Schiphol continued its efforts to phase out natural gas with the successful delivery of a central ATES system at the Schiphol Central Business District. Almost all piers are now equipped with TES systems, and Pier E will be fully integrated with ATES by 2025. Looking ahead, Terminals 1 and 2 are set to implement ATES by 2030. Additionally, new buildings such as Pier A and the new Pier C are being constructed gas-free as standard, reinforcing Schiphol’s commitment to sustainable and resilient infrastructure.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Schiphol recognises that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is currently the most viable option to reduce aviation emissions in the short term. According to Pronk, blended SAF can reduce CO₂ emissions by 70% to 90% compared to fossil kerosene. However, it is not yet fully sustainable, as current HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) SAF production is limited due to supply constraints and production challenges.

“In the short term, blended SAF is the best option to reduce emissions, but R&D is needed to develop e-SAF, like synthetic kerosene, which has the potential to be produced in volumes that are needed to decarbonise the global aviation industry,” says Pronk.

Zero-waste ambitions and community engagement Beyond energy and fuel, Schiphol is tackling waste through a comprehensive zero-waste roadmap, collaborating with business partners to monitor and reduce waste production. One of the airport’s key strategies is setting up a monitoring system to track zero-waste goals, prioritising waste streams based on mass and their CO₂ footprint. This approach allows Schiphol to identify areas that need improvement and work with partners to reduce waste generation at the source.

“We have developed a monitoring system to track our zero-waste goals. We prioritise streams based on the mass produced and their CO₂ footprint. Many of our actions are based on reducing these streams,” says Pronk.

To gain deeper insights, Schiphol conducts targeted waste scans in various areas of the terminal, identifying specific products and passenger behaviours that contribute to waste. These scans help the airport understand which items are most problematic and how to address them effectively. For example, single-use plastic items commonly discarded by passengers have been identified, prompting Schiphol to collaborate with partners to find more sustainable alternatives.

“We also conduct waste scans to gain insights into different areas within the terminal. This helps us identify products to address with business partners and understand passenger behaviours that need to be nudged to avoid and reduce waste,” Pronk explains.

Schiphol also recognises the importance of engaging with the local community to address environmental concerns, particularly noise pollution. The airport has taken proactive steps to encourage airlines to use quieter aircraft, offering reduced fees for quieter models and imposing higher charges on older, noisier planes. As of 2025, the loudest aircraft will be banned from operating at Schiphol.

To further support local communities affected by aviation activities, Schiphol has set up a €10 million annual Environmental Fund that will run until 2031. The fund is dedicated to quality-of-life improvements in the surrounding areas, demonstrating the airport’s commitment to balancing operational growth with community well-being.

Partnerships and future vision Collaboration is key to Schiphol’s strategy, exemplified by its leadership in the TULIPS program. This consortium, funded by the European Union, brings together 32 European partners, including airports, airlines, knowledge institutions, and companies, to develop sustainable solutions that align with the European Green Deal.

The TULIPS program aims to reduce CO₂ emissions from mobility and promote sustainability at airports through 17 concrete demonstration projects. These projects include testing an Iron Flow Battery and a hydrogen Ground Power Unit, as well as demonstrating solutions for unattended charging of electric aircraft. Additionally, Schiphol is conducting trials with electric trucks for the ‘last mile’ at the airport and experimenting with heat storage systems for buildings.

In line with its commitment to circularity, Schiphol is also working on improving the circular use of materials, addressing both passenger waste and construction waste as valuable resources. Plans are underway to conduct trials for the large-scale supply of more sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and further demonstrations of hydrogen-powered ground handling equipment—all of which play a vital role in achieving the airport’s sustainability targets.

“Collaboration with partners is crucial, learning from other airports and sectors. Integrate sustainability in everything you do. It takes effort and time, but in the end, it pays off handsomely for everyone,” emphasises Pronk.

With its ambitious goals and concrete actions, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport is proving that sustainable aviation is not just a vision but a reality in the making. As other hubs look to follow suit, Schiphol stands as a model of how the aviation industry can adapt and thrive in a more sustainable world.

The global aviation sector is on the cusp of transformation—not just due to climate mandates but because of an emerging realization: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is as much about geopolitical stability and economic resilience as it is about decarbonization. The shift is less about environmental compliance and more about strategic empowerment.

The Rise of SAF: Numbers Tell a Story

Forecasts now place the aviation biofuel market at nearly 49 billion USD by 2030, rising from 38.7 billion USD in 2024. Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) are projected to anchor this growth with a valuation of 18 billion USD by 2030. Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil is also gaining ground with a 4.1 percent compound annual growth rate. While the U.S. remains the largest market, China’s pace is notable, expanding at 7 percent annually.

From Mandate to Market Momentum

Global regulations such as CORSIA and the EU RefuelEU initiative initially propelled SAF into public discourse. But these frameworks have now sparked a wider momentum. What was once a compliance necessity is becoming an industrial policy strategy. SAF is increasingly tied to employment, innovation, and rural development—embedding it within national growth agendas.

Feedstock Diversification: Beyond the Usual Suspects

One of the most promising shifts is the evolution of feedstock strategies. The industry is moving past used cooking oil and tallow to explore lignocellulosic biomass, municipal waste, and even algae. This is not only expanding fuel pathways such as Fischer-Tropsch and Alcohol-to-Jet but also creating a robust buffer against agricultural market volatility.

Airports and Airlines: A Unified Front for Change

Airports like Schiphol, Frankfurt, and LAX are becoming hubs for SAF distribution, investing in infrastructure upgrades to support blending, storage, and compliance tracking. Meanwhile, airlines—especially flag carriers and climate-conscious budget operators—are locking in long-term offtake agreements, signaling a commitment to scale rather than experimentation.

Policy Synergy is the Real Accelerant

While technological innovation plays a key role, it’s the synchronization of policy across energy, transport, and agriculture that is proving most catalytic. Blending mandates, tax credits, and roadmap strategies in places like the U.S., Canada, and Japan are creating predictable market conditions that draw private capital and de-risk investment.

Industry Collaboration: De-Risking Through Partnership

Joint ventures between airlines, refiners, and clean tech developers are no longer speculative. They are structured with price floors, forward contracts, and even blockchain-based traceability systems to ensure scope 3 emissions accounting. These models are paving the way for credible carbon claims and investor-grade sustainability reporting.

The Bigger Picture: SAF as Infrastructure, Not Alternative

Perhaps the most underappreciated development is the reframing of SAF as core infrastructure. When treated as such, it draws funding from climate bonds, national infrastructure plans, and multilateral banks—not just voluntary offset markets. This reframing allows SAF to compete on capital grounds, not just carbon.

Conclusion: From Fuel to Foundation for Resilient Aviation

The aviation biofuel story is no longer about offsets and optics. It is about reshaping the very foundation of how aviation intersects with energy, economy, and the environment. This strategic repositioning—from sustainability project to infrastructure imperative—is the real insight.

As the world moves toward net-zero, SAF stands not merely as a transitional tool but as a foundational element in building an aviation system that is both future-ready and resilient.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-23.svg,N,,2025-06-06 05:56:25.780560

It takes 2 litres of ethanol to make one litre of SAF. The development of SAF can be supported with right policy decisions and right technology at a place”, said Dr Pramod Chaudhari, President of Indian Federation of Green Energy and Executive Chairman, Praj Industries at the curtain raiser event of 2nd edition of India Bioenergy & Tech Expo held in Pune.

Dr Chaudhari pointed out the need for alternative to diesel in India and role of bioenergy sector in developing the alternate fuels to traditional fossil fuel. We need to promote biodiesel as an alternative to diesel in order to boost bioenergy sector and also to reduce carbon footprint in India. Raj Industries is working on the production of biodiesel and we have found new additives in this area, he said.

While highlighting the importance of agriculture biomass as a major contributor of raw material for the production of biofuel, Dr Chaudhari said that companies are working in the supply chain of biomass from last few years and with the right policy support and investment it is poised to grow. IFGE has chosen a right niche to support the movement in biofuel production.

Dr Y B Ramkrishna, Senior Vice President IFGE and Former Chairman, Working Group on Biofuel MoPNG emphasised the need to use of biological sources apart from feedstocks which can be considered as substitute to conventional fuels. We are looking at various sources which are considered as industry waste and can be converted into bioenergy. We are also looking at the low carbon fuels which will not only reduce the carbon footprint but also are sustainable and commercially viable options over traditional fossil fuel and a lot of R& D work is being conducted in this sector. We need to create an ecosystem in which all the wasted resources can be made available to the industry to convert it alternate biofuel. By practising this 100 per cent of country’s energy will come from bioenergy sector.

Dr Ramkrishna also added that government is supporting bioenergy sector by pushing various schemes for the sector and policy intervention. But still there are few gaps in the policies which needs to address and IFGE is addressing to these challenges and bridging the gap between the industry and government for the growth of bioenergy sector.

For the uninitiated, they are carriers of renewable carbon and energy, sourced from responsibly managed forests; a real, scalable, domestic resource that delivers energy security, climate value, and rural jobs while sustaining and growing forests. Wood pellets are emerging as one of the smartest plays in America’s energy and climate portfolio.

The Math Works

Let’s be clear: climate solutions need to scale. We need terawatts of clean power, gigatons of carbon removal, and a replacement for fossil carbon in sectors where options are limited. Think steel mills, cargo ships, aviation fuel, and cement plants — industries that can’t rely on solar panels and wind turbines.

Enter forest biomass. Every year, America’s 360 million acres of privately-owned forests grow more wood than we harvest. Driven by strong markets for wood products, these forests are powerful carbon sinks that have been growing since the 1950s when regenerative forestry practices became the norm.

Responsible forest management, the kind that thins out fuel for wildfires, not only keeps forests healthy but also supplies feedstock for wood pellets. These pellets burn clean, emit fewer particulates than coal, are carbon-neutral, and have the potential to be carbon-negative when sourced sustainably. In other words, we’re turning forest byproducts into a strategic asset instead of a forest fire risk and ensuring more investment into our nation’s forests.

Valued at $1.75 billion, the U.S. led the world last year in wood pellet exports — heating homes and decarbonizing power grids from Cambridge to Copenhagen. That’s not just a climate win. It’s a geopolitical and economic one. Furthermore, there are ample opportunities to increase use domestically.

The Digital Surge: Data Centers Meet Biomass

Data centers are growing at breakneck pace. From streaming to AI, every click and query demands energy. These facilities already consume nearly 3% of global electricity, and that figure is climbing fast. In the U.S. alone, data center energy demand is expected to double by 2030.

While tech companies make pledges to run on “100% renewable,” achieving this goal is challenging. Intermittent renewables like wind and solar can’t always deliver the 24/7 baseload power data centers require. Wind and power are not the silver bullet many had hoped, because expensive batteries must be manufactured and installed to account for their lack of reliability. Meanwhile, wood pellets offer a firm, dispatchable, renewable fuel that can complement the grid and provide the consistent power backbone data infrastructure needs, without the carbon price tag of fossil fuels.

Speed is also a challenge. AI infrastructure is being developed on start-up timelines, but the grids meant to supply power are often hampered by multi-year planning cycles and limited capacity. Utilizing the existing biomass fleet or retrofitting coal-fired power stations to run on sustainable biomass bypasses these time-intensive and costly barriers. These sites are already grid-connected, often already have relevant permits, and crucially a coal-to-biomass conversion can be completed in under two years.

A Carbon-Negative Future? Biomass is the Feedstock

There’s another dimension to this story. Biomass isn’t just an energy source; it’s a carbon solution. Engineered carbon removal technologies like Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) require a steady, sustainable feedstock to function at scale. That feedstock needs to be renewable, reliable, and available today. Wood pellets fit that bill.

When wood pellets are used in BECCS systems, they generate power and remove CO₂ from the atmosphere at the same time, locking it away underground or turning it into usable materials like concrete, fuels, or even long-lived bioplastics. That’s negative emissions. Not net zero. Below zero.

With private markets pouring billions into carbon removal innovation, the need for biogenic carbon is accelerating. Whether it’s carbon-negative electricity, sustainable aviation fuel or green hydrogen, they all have one thing in common: they start with a reliable renewable carbon stream. Wood pellets and woody biomass are poised to play a major role in supporting these emerging technologies.

Missing the Forest for the Trees

Despite all this, woody biomass, like all energy, eventually finds itself in the crosshairs. Critics claim it’s just “burning trees,” a false narrative that ignores both the science and the forests. Sustainable biomass doesn’t chop down protected, old-growth forests. It’s sourced from working forests, the type that are deliberately selected and sustainably managed to produce our dimensional lumber and furniture. Except biomass utilizes the lowest-value fiber that comes off these tracts.

As America’s pulp and paper industry has declined, shuttering dozens of mills and shedding thousands of jobs over the last decade, wood pellets have offered a new market for low-value wood. This fiber has little economic value and without a buyer will often rot, burn, or get landfilled. Using this wood isn’t deforestation, it’s responsible forest stewardship. In fact, without reliable markets like biomass, private landowners will sell and convert their forests for more lucrative returns like agriculture, golf courses, and residential developments.

Investing in Rural America

The benefits of the wood pellet industry go beyond carbon math. This is a sector that brings real jobs to rural America. It supports forest owners, loggers, truckers, and working forests. This is climate action with a hard hat, not a hashtag.

If we’re going to win the climate war, we have to include the states in America’s wood basket where trees grow, people work the land, and decarbonization isn’t an abstract ideal.

Wood pellets are real, scalable, renewable and a true American resource.

In a world increasingly distracted by hype, maybe it’s time we doubled down on solutions that deliver quietly, reliably, and sustainably. One of the smartest is hiding in plain sight — in our forests.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/68/688590_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 04:58:04.708352

This study introduces an innovative approach for producing isoalkane-enriched sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) fractions. It involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using Y-type zeolites as catalysts without an external hydrogen supply, all of which can be conducted in one step under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed reactor. The Y zeolite catalysts, including HY, HUSY, and Meso-HY, are compared, and the influences of feedstock-to-catalyst ratio and pyrolysis temperatures on the yield and composition of the resulting fuels are evaluated. The optimal conditions are identified to use the Meso-HY catalyst with a feedstock-to-catalyst mass ratio of 3:2 at 500 °C, achieving an optimum SAF component selectivity of 78 area% and SAF fractions’ yield of 54.13 wt %. The resultant liquid fuel exhibits a high selectivity of isoalkanes (51 area%) and relatively low selectivity of aromatics (21.9 area%). The superior performance of the Meso-HY catalyst is attributed to its mesoporous structure and weak acidity, which favor the formation of isoalkanes. Additionally, a novel Fe/Meso-HY catalyst with magnetic properties has been developed to facilitate catalyst recovery after pyrolysis, showing good stability and minimal impact on isomerization efficiency. Hydrogen transfer during pyrolysis is explored by combining experiments and ReaxFF MD simulations; and a reaction pathway elucidating the mechanism of hydrogen self-supply during LDPE isomerization has also been proposed. The findings offer a foundational understanding required for producing SAF from waste plastics and provide valuable insights into the optimization of the production methods.",https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-acs-4898564/55162927/thumb.png,N,,2025-06-06 00:56:19.163386

Enersur, one of Paraguay’s foremost renewable energy companies, has selected Praj Industries for its next major project. Praj, a global leader in bioeconomy-driven process solutions, will support the development, assessment, and phased implementation of a fully integrated biorefinery project in Paraguay.

The biorefinery aims to produce, in addition to ethanol, co-products such as distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), corn oil, biogas, biobitumen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The two companies signed the agreement to this effect in the august presence of Santiago Peña Palacios, President of the Republic of Paraguay. The President, accompanied by a high-level delegation of ministers, senior officials, and business leaders, was on a state visit to India from June 2 to 4, 2025.

This comes on the back of the contract awarded to Praj by Enersur to design, supply, and commission a state-of-the-art 600 m³/day anhydrous ethanol plant in Canindeyú, Paraguay. This facility, which will use corn as feedstock, represents a significant step forward in Paraguay’s commitment to clean energy and rural development, while also contributing to reduced reliance on fossil fuels.

Praj’s extensive scope of work includes process technology licensing, full-scale design and engineering, supply of core process equipment, and on- ground supervisory support. The plant is expected to be fully operational by October 2026.

“We are proud to collaborate with Enersur in shaping Paraguay’s bioenergy landscape and accelerating the transition towards a sustainable bioeconomy,” said Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Founder Chairman of Praj Industries.

“This partnership goes beyond ethanol—it embodies our shared vision to harness the full potential of bio-based innovations for clean energy, circular economy, and long-term energy resilience across South America.”

“We chose Praj as our partner because of their proven expertise, cutting-edge technology, and extensive experience in delivering large-scale bioenergy projects globally,” commented Mr. Omar Bustos, President Enersur S.A. “Their strong track record in South America and commitment to sustainability perfectly align with our vision to develop Paraguay’s bioeconomy and drive long-term rural and economic development through this landmark project.”",https://www.indianchemicalnews.com/public/uploads/article/Praj_Enersur.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 00:56:24.761304

Zero-emission electric aircraft have begun to emerge, but only at a small scale and for short distances. Bio-based sustainable aviation fuel offers the potential for more rapid scale-up because it can be blended with conventional jet fuel for use in existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. Until recently, sustainable aviation fuel was only available in limited quantities, but new supplies may soon change that.

The Slow Pace of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Uptake

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) stakeholders have experimented with many different kinds of bio-based sources since the early 2000s, including algae, food waste, and agricultural and forest waste, along with cultivated energy crops including oilseeds and grasses as well as corn and soy.

But progress is moving at a snail’s pace. United Airlines, for example, became the first major airline to test sustainable aviation fuel back in 2009 and since then has explored various bio-based sources including algae. The company says it has invested in the “future production” of more than 5 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, but achieving that scale is a long-term goal.

In the meantime, United advises that “production remains very limited,” and very expensive as well, and the airline is not alone. Sustainable aviation fuel accounted for less than 0.15 percent of the total fuel used among 77 leading airlines last year, according to a survey from the European organization Transport & Environment.

Corn, soy oil, and other cultivated crops accounted for more than 30 percent of this fuel used among the airlines T&E surveyed, indicating that agriculture-related carbon emissions could offset much of the gains from using bio-based resources. In addition, 100 percent bio-based fuel is not a complete solution. Also called “neat” SAF, 100 percent bio-based sustainable aviation fuel is not certified for use on its own. Instead, it is blended with conventional jet fuel, making it all the more important to keep agricultural supply chain emissions down to a minimum.

The Electrofuels Solution

Electrofuels are an alternative solution that is gaining ground. Sometimes called solar fuels or e-fuels, electrofuels are synthetic hydrocarbon fuels produced by deploying electricity — ideally from solar power or other renewable resources — to separate green hydrogen gas from water. The hydrogen is then combined with captured carbon to create new fuels that are chemically identical to fossil-sourced fuels, meaning they can be used on their own on a drop-in basis instead of blending with conventional jet fuels.",https://givingcompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/af84537b-3d8c-4d21-b489-069fa6bcf9ca-700x394.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 04:58:11.151161

The result is a non-exclusive, globally deployable SAF production solution that supports decarbonisation without sacrificing operational efficiency or economic viability.
“The global aviation sector is under increasing pressure to cut emissions while meeting surging demand,” said a Honeywell spokesperson.","In a decisive move to bolster the aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts, four global industrial leaders—Honeywell, Johnson Matthey, GIDARA Energy, and Samsung E&A—have announced the formation of a strategic technology alliance aimed at fast-tracking the global production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The announcement was made on 5 June 2025 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

This new collaboration presents a fully integrated, modular approach that streamlines the SAF value chain from feedstock to fuel. The offering is designed to enable faster, more cost-efficient deployment of SAF facilities, helping operators and governments meet increasingly ambitious emissions targets.

At the heart of this alliance is the application of the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, a proven technology that will be adapted to unlock a wide array of globally available feedstocks, including biomass and municipal solid waste. The partners intend to offer an end-to-end solution with a single point of accountability, ensuring a seamless journey from project concept to fuel production.

According to the companies, the integrated model could reduce the time between feasibility study and facility start-up by over 15%, and capital expenditure by as much as 10%, based on comparative industry benchmarks when modularisation is applied during the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) phase.

Leveraging Global Expertise

Each partner brings specific expertise to the alliance:

GIDARA Energy provides advanced gasification technology to transform waste into clean syngas.

Johnson Matthey contributes world-leading catalyst and conversion technology for syngas-to-fuel processes.

Honeywell integrates digital automation and process technologies to ensure operational excellence.

Samsung E&A adds deep global experience in EPC and project execution management.

The result is a non-exclusive, globally deployable SAF production solution that supports decarbonisation without sacrificing operational efficiency or economic viability.

“The global aviation sector is under increasing pressure to cut emissions while meeting surging demand,” said a Honeywell spokesperson. “This alliance demonstrates what’s possible when industry leaders align to provide real-world, commercially viable answers.”

A Timely Response to Industry Demand

As SAF mandates gain traction around the world, the demand for reliable, scalable production methods continues to rise. This alliance seeks not only to address supply shortages but also to offer clients the assurance of delivery through coordinated execution and guaranteed performance.

The partners emphasised that the offering is suitable for public and private operators alike, including those seeking to build regional SAF supply hubs or national energy resilience programmes.

With the SAF market poised for exponential growth, this alliance signals a critical step forward in closing the gap between ambition and implementation.",https://worldairnews.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/green-plane-ecofriendly-environment-1024x771.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 16:56:16.275595

This cross-agency team is comprised of the Executive Offices of Economic Development (EOED), Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEEA), Administration and Finance (A&F), the Office of Climate Innovation and Resilience, Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC), the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) Aeronautics Division and Massport.

The announcement was made today at the Regional Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Workshop, co-hosted by Massport, which brought together over 130 industry leaders, policymakers and stakeholders from across the region to explore practical steps for advancing technology and policies to support SAF development and deployment – right here in our region. With aircraft responsible for nearly 80 percent of green gas emissions at Boston Logan, Massport is focused on supporting airlines in their journey to decarbonize – and SAF is a cornerstone of that strategy.

“Cleaner air and a healthier environment are important to everyone, and reducing pollution from aviation is essential for achieving this goal,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “These recommendations highlight the need to explore viable, long-term strategies that support cleaner air travel. We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this effort.”

“Aviation contributes significant pollution to our air, and these recommendations recognize the urgent need to find ways to make air travel cleaner, while also providing an opportunity to further our state’s leadership in climatech,” said Climate Chief Melissa Hoffer. “We’re proud to have worked across government to develop these recommendations and push Massachusetts forward as a leader in sustainable and cleaner aviation.”

“Massachusetts has the assets, talent, and innovation ecosystem to lead in sustainable aviation fuel, and this report lays out clear next steps to help us get there,” said MassCEC CEO Dr. Emily Reichert. “Advancing SAF production and adoption will not only reduce harmful pollution, it will also unlock new economic opportunities across our clean energy and transportation industries and their supply chains. MassCEC is proud to be a part of this collaborative effort to position the Commonwealth at the forefront of sustainable aviation.”

“Massachusetts has been at the forefront of innovation for over 250 years, and the recommendations of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Working Group are the latest example of how we tackle big challenges with bold solutions,” said Interim Secretary of Economic Development Ashley Stolba. “With Massport’s leadership and the SAF Working Group’s partnership with our world-class industries, the Commonwealth is not only preparing for a cleaner future—we’re helping to shape it, addressing complex issues that affect not just our state, but the entire country and the world.”

Based on research, best practices from other states, and input from experts, the SAF Workgroup identified five short-term and long-term recommendations.

1. Launch a Regional SAF Planning Study

Conduct a comprehensive study of SAF production, transportation, storage, blending, and usage, including current jet fuel logistics and regional feedstock opportunities.

Timeline: Target completion by Fall 2025.

2. Establish a Massachusetts/New England SAF Hub

Form a regional SAF hub with key stakeholders – major employers, academia, airports, airlines, and general aviation – to foster collaboration, share information, and drive short-and long-term SAF initiatives.

Timeline: Near-term launch, including a regional SAF workshop.

3. Leverage Existing Programs and Federal Support

Promote existing state programs supporting climate goals, technology and economic development to boost SAF production and innovation. Explore federal opportunities to strengthen SAF’s role in the climatetech ecosystem.

Timeline: Begin near-term; continue through medium and long term.

4. Advance SAF Tax Credit Legislation

As we mark World Environment Day, we’re proud to share four ways we’re working to create a cleaner, more sustainable future for air travel and the communities we serve.

From reducing emissions on the ground and in the air to future-proofing our infrastructure, here’s how YVR is contributing to a more sustainable planet:

1. Powering a low-carbon future for aviation

We’re helping lead the transition to cleaner fuels. In 2023, YVR developed a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Strategy focused on market development, adoption, and long-term production. Building on this work, we launched the BC Low Carbon Jet Fuel Incentive Program in 2024 to stimulate early SAF uptake and we partnered with the Province of BC on a SAF Opportunity Study to explore how to promote BC-based SAF production.

To reduce emissions on the ground, we’ve expanded the use of ground power units (GPUs), allowing aircraft to plug into B.C.'s clean electricity while at the gate, and invested in electric vehicle charging stations for airside ground support.

We’re also advancing the YVR Energy Strategy to support the aviation industry’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050. As part of this, we established the YVR Energy Advisory Council in 2024—a group of six independent experts who are guiding our approach to future energy solutions for aviation and infrastructure. The Council will produce a report outlining the key actions needed to support our long-term energy and emissions goals.

2. Building climate resilience into our infrastructure

Preparing for the impacts of climate change is a key part of our sustainability approach. YVR is investing in long-term infrastructure upgrades to protect Sea Island from sea level rise and extreme weather.

Between 2025 and 2026, we will invest $60 million to raise dikes and replace floodboxes, along with an additional $12 million to upgrade pump stations. Beyond 2026, we plan to invest $12.5 million annually to enhance flood protection and strengthen long-term resilience.

We’re also integrating sustainability considerations into all new infrastructure planning, ensuring that our airport is ready to meet the challenges of tomorrow.

3. Cutting carbon across the terminal

We are proud to be a carbon neutral organization and are one of only 3 airports in North America certified at Level 4+ under the Airport Carbon Accreditation Program.

But we are not stopping there! We are well on our way to reaching our goal of net zero by 2030 for airport operations; our emissions footprint decreased by 19 per cent in 2024 relative to 2023. HVAC and lighting projects reduced emissions by 515 tonnes in 2024 – the equivalent of taking 120 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles off the road for a year.

We are investing in cleaner fuels to reduce emissions from our vehicle fleet and from heating the Terminal. In 2024, sixty-two per cent of the diesel purchased for our airside fleet was renewable diesel and 36 per cent of the natural gas used for main terminal heating was renewable natural gas.

YVR is building one of Canada’s largest geoexchange systems to harness the earth’s own heating and cooling properties, backed by high-efficiency boilers using renewable natural gas. When complete, it will save over 4,800 tonnes of carbon emissions every year.

In addition to heating some of our terminal water with solar thermal heating, YVR plans to reduce carbon emissions from remaining hot water systems to zero by installing air source heat pumps for all three domestic hot water loops in the Main Terminal. This technology is four times more efficient than using electricity alone, and it will reduce YVR’s carbon emissions by 855 tonnes per year.

4. Empowering a culture of sustainability

Sustainability at YVR extends beyond operation, it’s part of our workplace culture. Through our Green Commuter Program, employees are rewarded for walking, biking, taking transit, or carpooling to work. As a Transit Friendly Employer, we’re proud to support greener commuting that’s convenient, cost-effective, and good for the climate

We’re also collaborating with our Sea Island business community to reduce emissions collectively across our supply chain, creating shared value for partners and the planet.

Learn more: our Environmental Sustainability Plan

These actions are just a snapshot of the bold steps YVR is taking. Earlier this year, we launched our Environmental Sustainability Plan—a roadmap to reduce emissions, adapt to climate change, and drive innovation across all areas of our business.

by Richard Murphy (Aviation Week) ... But the real question isn’t whether this fuel can power aviation. It’s why the vision of widespread, hydrogen-powered flight keeps slipping further into the future.

For instance, while British-American aircraft developer ZeroAvia recently announced plans to open a hydrogen powertrain manufacturing facility in Scotland, Airbus rowed back on promises to develop hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by the mid-2030s, citing slower-than-expected technological development. Despite the promise of hydrogen, widespread adoption in aviation may be decades away, with technological, safety, and cost challenges all complicating the picture.

Hydrogen holds several advantages over existing fuels. It’s an excellent fuel source, with the highest energy content of any fuel by mass, and it burns cleanly with water vapor its primary byproduct.

...

Despite the advantages of hydrogen’s high energy content by mass, it’s extremely low energy content by volume creates significant storage challenges. To be viable for aircraft, hydrogen must be liquefied either through supercooling, similar to LNG; or using liquid ammonia, which is 70% hydrogen. It can also be stored in a metal hydrate, but this increases its weight, which makes it counterproductive for aviation.

Cost remains one of the biggest obstacles to hydrogen adoption in aviation.

...

In aviation, the demands of safety will always dictate the pace of innovation. Hydrogen ignites easily – sometimes too easily, as the 1937 Hindenburg disaster proved.

The clean jet fuel, which can be made from used cooking oil, wastes, or plants, reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 80%, the aviation industry says.
However, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel, according to IATA’s estimates.
With the fuel so expensive that it’s impossible to compete with jet fuel made from petroleum, the nascent SAF industry faces challenges at the start of the supply chain.
As SAF production costs and prices remain the top obstacles, the result is a vicious cycle, according to BCG.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the most promising lever known today to accelerate progress toward a net zero future, says Delta Air Lines.

The clean jet fuel, which can be made from used cooking oil, wastes, or plants, reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 80%, the aviation industry says.

However, SAF faces many challenges on the runway to take off. Scale and cost are the two biggest and interconnected challenges for the industry to begin replacing petroleum-based kerosene.

High Costs, Low Availability

“Unfortunately, there isn’t enough SAF today to fuel the world’s commercial airlines for even a single day and it is currently 2 to 4 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel,” Delta says.

In 2023, Willie Walsh, Director General at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said that the airline industry would be ready to embrace the fact that SAF would always be more expensive than oil-based jet fuel.

IATA said at the end of 2024 that growth in SAF volumes is “disappointingly slow.”

Last year, SAF production volumes reached 1 million tons, double the 500,000 tons produced in 2023. However, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel, according to IATA’s estimates.

Related: Putin Warns Trump of Response to Ukraine Drone Strikes

This year, SAF production is set to double again to reach 2 million tons, but this would still be just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025, IATA said this weekend.

“The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” Walsh said as the association criticized policy shortcomings that make the fuel even more expensive than it is.

“Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging,” Walsh added.

“Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel,” the association said, warning that this could put SAF production at risk.

“Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.

With the fuel so expensive that it’s impossible to compete with jet fuel made from petroleum, the nascent SAF industry faces challenges at the start of the supply chain.

“Investors in new generation fuel producers seem to be waiting for guarantees of easy money before going full throttle,” IATA’s Walsh said in December.

To reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, IATA analysis shows that between 3,000 and more than 6,500 new renewable fuel plants – also producing renewable diesel and other biofuels – will be needed.

The annual average capex needed to build the new facilities over the 30-year period is about $128 billion per year, in a best-case scenario, according to IATA.

Long-Term Purchase Agreements

Long-term purchase agreements could help create demand, according to Matthias Berninger, an executive vice president and sustainability head at chemicals giant Bayer, which owns Monsanto.

“If they (airlines) commit to buy a certain amount over a certain period of time, we can guarantee that farmers will grow it and processors will process it,” Berninger told Reuters.

""And the question whether or not that supply meets the market (demand) depends on long-term purchasing contracts of the airline industry sending a very clear demand signal comparable to what we have in the renewable space,” the executive added.

Some companies have already committed to purchase agreements.

For example, to help make SAF cost-competitive, Delta has joined a so-called “Demand Consortium” that includes Bank of America, Deloitte, Delta, and Ecolab. The consortium has been formed to purchase the first several million gallons of SAF each year, starting in the second half of 2025.

The goal of the purchase agreements is to “scale production, drive down costs and secure multi-year demand that spurs continued growth of the SAF market,” Delta says.

Each of these companies are also providing funding to support the market production of SAF, which will contribute to verified carbon emission reductions associated with their employee business travel.

IATA expects the largest acceleration in the SAF market to take place in the 2030s as policy support becomes global, hopefully.

The association estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

Yet, progress in SAF has slowed due to economic and regulatory uncertainty, high production costs, and weak demand signals, including the lack of firm long-term off-take agreements, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said in a report earlier this year.

Too many players are in “wait and see” mode, the report found, as only a small subset of companies along the value chain has shown active leadership.

Moreover, the lack of a clear business case is a major obstacle to greater investment, BCG says.

As SAF production costs and prices remain the top obstacles, the result is a vicious cycle, according to BCG.

“Low voluntary demand and limited willingness-to-pay weaken the business case for SAF, which slows investment in supply and delays the learning curve needed to drive costs down.”

Ardian has been investing in infrastructure for 20 years, gaining a reputation as a pragmatic and collaborative owner of essential assets that underpin economic growth. This is an important qualification for its intended role at Heathrow. “We are known as a sensible shareholder and a good citizen in these situations,” says Juan Angoitia, Co-Head of Ardian Infrastructure, Europe, and a member of the Heathrow board.

But equally important is Ardian’s experience as an owner of airports since 2013, first London Luton and then a portfolio of Italian airports including Milan and Naples. At Luton, Ardian demonstrated its commitment to invest in growth by expanding capacity with a new terminal.

Whenever we invest, we select situations where there is a decision to be taken that could transform the company,” he explains. In Heathrow’s case, that decision – whether to add a third runway – has been debated for decades. Ardian’s purchase of a 32.6% stake in the airport comes at a moment when the possibility seems to be growing, thanks to the UK government’s desire to accelerate economic growth. Heathrow’s role in the UK economy goes well beyond passenger travel: Heathrow is the UK’s largest port by value.

Ardian and the Heathrow management also agree that expansion cannot come at the expense of the climate. The airport is committed to sustainable growth and in 2023 became the first in the world to issue sustainability-linked bonds including a target to reduce Scope 3 emissions. It has created an incentive to cover half the extra cost to airlines of adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In 2025, its target is for 3% of fuel loaded at Heathrow to be SAF, rising to 11% by 2030. “The only way to develop Heathrow is in a sustainable way,” says Angoitia, adding that airports are uniquely positioned to drive the transformation of air travel because they bring together all the major players.

As the best-connected airport in the world, Heathrow sits at the heart of the industry’s biggest eco system. This gives it an unparalleled opportunity to help steer air travel towards a low-carbon future.

Ardian AirCarbon brings data science to accelerate emission reduction and sustainability at airports

During Ardian’s ownership of several Italian airports, including those in Milan, Naples and Turin, the company started using its expertise in data science to help the management teams implement their sustainability strategy. The result was Ardian AirCarbon, a cloud-based platform that analyzes aircraft movements based on real-time data and allows airports to model ways to reduce their emissions. Ardian AirCarbon had a material impact at Ardian’s Italian airports: in Naples, aircraft emissions on take off were cut by 30% by modifying f light trajectories. The tool was subsequently implemented at Iceland’s Keflavík airport, which is not owned by Ardian.

Attachment Aviation Biofuel Market","Dublin, June 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Aviation Biofuel - Global Strategic Business Report"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Aviation Biofuel was valued at US$38.7 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$48.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.9% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.

Global regulatory frameworks, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) CORSIA program and the EU's RefuelEU initiative, are mandating lifecycle emissions reductions and SAF blending targets to push the industry toward net-zero by 2050. Biofuels derived from sustainable feedstocks - such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, municipal waste, and non-food energy crops - are central to meeting these mandates. As airlines, airports, and fuel suppliers align with ESG targets and carbon offset mechanisms, aviation biofuel adoption is transitioning from pilot-scale to commercial viability.

Beyond emissions mitigation, aviation biofuel offers strategic value in energy diversification and supply chain resilience. Regional production of SAF using local feedstocks reduces dependence on volatile crude oil markets and enhances energy security. Governments are now treating SAF capacity building as an industrial policy priority, linking it with job creation, rural development, and innovation in the circular economy. With climate imperatives accelerating, aviation biofuel is no longer a niche alternative but a central enabler of the industry's long-term operational and reputational sustainability.

What Are the Factors Driving Growth in the Aviation Biofuel Market?

The aviation biofuel market is accelerating as decarbonization pressure, regulatory mandates, and energy diversification imperatives converge across the aviation value chain. SAF is uniquely positioned to deliver near-term emissions reductions while leveraging existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure - bridging the gap between climate ambition and operational feasibility.

Key growth drivers include the global rollout of emissions compliance frameworks, expanding feedstock and conversion technologies, rising corporate travel decarbonization commitments, and increasing alignment between energy, agriculture, and aviation sectors. As production scales and costs decline, SAF is expected to evolve from a niche sustainability initiative to a mainstream component of global aviation fuel supply.

As climate targets tighten and flight demand rebounds, could aviation biofuel become the defining catalyst that enables the aviation industry to decouple growth from carbon - transforming air travel into a climate-resilient, net-zero mode of global connectivity?

How Are Feedstock Technologies, Processing Pathways, and Certification Standards Advancing Commercial Deployment?

Technological innovation across the SAF value chain is accelerating scalability and performance optimization. Multiple conversion pathways - such as HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), and Synthetic Iso-Paraffins (SIP) - are being deployed based on regional feedstock availability and policy incentives. HEFA remains the most commercially mature route, using waste fats and oils, while emerging platforms are targeting lignocellulosic biomass, algae, and carbon-captured e-fuels for next-generation feedstock flexibility.

Feedstock diversification is a key focus, with industry stakeholders investing in low-cost, non-edible, and waste-based inputs to avoid land-use conflicts and food security concerns. Advanced R&D in microbial conversion, pyrolysis, and gasification is enabling higher yields, lower GHG intensity, and broader compatibility with global supply chains. Lifecycle assessments and carbon intensity metrics are becoming standard components of SAF procurement, ensuring that environmental claims are verifiable, traceable, and aligned with global climate protocols.

Which Airline Segments, Airport Hubs, and Regional Policies Are Accelerating Aviation Biofuel Uptake?

Commercial airlines are leading the charge in SAF adoption, particularly flag carriers, full-service networks, and sustainability-focused low-cost carriers. Major players in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific have entered long-term offtake agreements with biofuel producers to secure supply and meet emissions reduction targets. SAF is being integrated into regular flight operations, with flagship routes and climate-conscious travel options marketed to corporate and leisure customers seeking greener alternatives.

Airports are becoming critical facilitators of SAF deployment through fuel blending infrastructure, storage upgrades, and collaboration with regional suppliers. Hubs such as Los Angeles (LAX), Amsterdam Schiphol, Frankfurt, and Singapore Changi are establishing SAF-ready fueling systems and incentivizing carriers through reduced landing fees, emissions credits, or preferential gate allocation. Regional airport authorities are also working with municipal waste processors and agribusinesses to co-locate SAF production near major air corridors.

National and regional policies are providing the structural support needed to scale aviation biofuel markets. The European Union's RefuelEU Aviation initiative mandates SAF blending percentages beginning in 2025, with targets increasing through 2050. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act includes tax credits and production incentives for SAF, while countries like the UK, Japan, and Canada are launching SAF roadmaps that link aviation decarbonization to national climate goals. These regulatory levers are fostering demand certainty, investment pipelines, and cross-sector collaboration - catalyzing the transition from demonstration to deployment.

How Are Industry Collaboration Models, Capital Deployment, and Supply Chain Innovation Reshaping Market Expansion?

Strategic partnerships between airlines, energy companies, and technology developers are driving investment into biofuel production capacity and distribution logistics. Co-development agreements, equity investments, and joint ventures are helping de-risk SAF commercialization by aligning feedstock sourcing, refining capabilities, and offtake commitments. Major oil and gas companies are repositioning biofuels as part of their decarbonization strategies, leveraging existing refinery assets to integrate SAF into their product portfolios.

Capital deployment into aviation biofuel infrastructure is scaling rapidly, with public-private funding mechanisms, green bonds, and climate-aligned financial instruments supporting new biorefineries and retrofitting of legacy plants.

Energy spend set to hit $3.3 trillion in 2025: IEA

London, 5 June (Argus) — Global energy investment is set to reach a record $3.3 trillion in 2025, two-thirds of which will be on ""clean energy"" technologies, double the amount going to fossil fuels, according to a report released today by the IEA. The total marks a 2pc rise ""in real terms"" compared to 2024 , ""despite headwinds from elevated geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty"", the agency said. The IEA forecasts that around $2.2 trillion will go to renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, energy efficiency and electrification in 2025, compared to $1.1 trillion for oil, gas and coal. The rise in ""clean energy"" investment reflects ""not only efforts to reduce emissions but also the growing influence of industrial policy, energy security concerns and the cost competitiveness of electricity-based solutions"", the agency said. Energy security is ""a key driver"" of the growth in investment globally, IEA executive director Fatih Birol said. Although the ""fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals… in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects,"" he added. Age of electricity Investment trends are being shaped by a ""rapid rise in electricity demand"", the IEA said. Global spend on the electricity sector is set to hit $1.5 trillion this year, driven mainly by record investment on low-emissions generation, the organisation said. It expects solar power alone to attract $450bn this year. Investment in power grids is ""struggling to keep pace with the rise in power demand"", although spending is still forecast to surpass a record $400bn this year, it said. In contrast, investment in fossil fuel supply is expected to fall by around 2pc this year — the first decline since 2020 — owing to a ""drop in prices and uncertain investment climate"", the IEA said. Upstream oil and gas investment is forecast to fall by approximately 4pc to just under $570bn, led by a 6pc decline in upstream oil spending to roughly $420bn. ""The sharp drop in oil prices, rising operational costs, the impacts of tariffs and concerns about potential oversupply have led many companies to revise their investment plans,"" the IEA said. Investment in coal supply is set to grow again in 2025, but more slowly — up by 4pc on the year, compared with an average 6pc annual increase over the past five years, the IEA said. Coal investment is largely driven by China and India. Spending on ""low-emissions fuels"" is expected to hit a new record in 2025, but will remain below $30bn, the IEA said. The agency flagged that such projects ""are particularly prone to policy uncertainty"". The IEA noted regional disparity across energy spending. China remains the world's largest investor ""by a wide margin"", it said, adding that the country's share of global clean energy investment has risen from a quarter a decade ago to almost one-third today. In the US, investment in renewables and lower-emissions fuels is ""set to level off as supportive policies are scaled back"", the IEA said. It noted that US shale oil producers are particularly challenged by falling oil prices, and that upstream oil and gas spending ""is gravitating towards large resource-holders in the Middle East"".

New York, 4 June (Argus) — Proposed changes to a US clean fuel tax credit may be a boon for farmers, but a future where ethanol is a major ingredient in jet fuel remains far off. The massive Republican budget bill currently advancing through Congress would extend the ""45Z"" credit, which offers larger subsidies to fuels as they produce fewer emissions. The proposal too would bar regulators from weighing indirect land use impacts , effectively upping subsidies for crop-based fuels like ethanol, in a win for agribusiness. Farm groups have hoped that such changes could open the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market to ethanol producers, otherwise at risk from an increasingly efficient and electric US vehicle fleet. Airlines too are eager for more diverse SAF sources since the main pathway nowadays, processing vegetable oils and animal fats, draws from more limited feedstocks. United Airlines government affairs director Tom Michels said at an OurEnergyPolicy forum earlier this year that the company hopes ethanol-based fuel ""could fulfill around a quarter of our future SAF needs."" But incentives in law and under the proposal, which passed the House last month, would do little to boost ""alcohol-to-jet"" output. While ethanol typically trades at a discount to gasoline, SAF is substantially more expensive than petroleum, making government support essential for uptake. The Republican caucus has a range of views, with clean energy advocates wary of phasing out subsidies, farm-state representatives intent on boosting biofuels, and conservatives committed to curbing government spending. Republicans plan to use a process called reconciliation that allows them to pass the bill without Democratic support. How policymakers implement 45Z will be crucial for a wave of alcohol-to-jet startups eyeing production this decade. That includes Gevo, whose plans for an integrated 60mn USG/yr plant in South Dakota are complicated by another company's struggles starting an interstate carbon pipeline. Meanwhile, people familiar with the matter say that LanzaJet's 10mn USG/yr alcohol-to-jet pilot project in Georgia — which opened last year but is not yet fully operational — is not currently producing any SAF. ""The suite of policies we would need to make ethanol-to-jet pencil out just does not exist right now,"" said Brian Jennings, chief executive of the American Coalition for Ethanol. RINs wear thin Ethanol-based SAF would likely still produce too many emissions to claim any 45Z subsidy even if the proposed emissions tracking changes took effect — since the pathway requires more energy-intensive processing to make fuel suitable for jet engines. Carbon capture could make up the difference, though few facilities have that capability. The lack of subsidy would compound barriers from the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners to blend biofuels or buy credits from those who do. Under the program, blending corn ethanol earns a Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit, but there is no certified pathway yet to offer RINs for corn-based SAF blending. Even if there were, advanced biofuel credits have traded recently at only a slight premium, reducing the incentive for ethanol producers to eye new markets. Argus last assessed current year D4 biomass-based diesel credits at 92.25¢/RIN and D6 conventional credits at 86.50¢/RIN, and they traded at parity much of last year. Meanwhile, the typical US dry mill ethanol producer would likely qualify for some 45Z subsidy if the Republican bill passed, adding to RIN benefits. Those plants would have to forgo both incentives to sell to SAF makers. It is unclear how producers of a more-expensive and less-subsidized SAF could compete on price. Gevo chief executive Patrick Gruber said that his company's integrated model — producing ethanol and SAF at the same sites — is less risky than buying ethanol from elsewhere. But there are other policy headwinds. A new South Dakota law to restrict eminent domain could derail Summit Carbon's planned multistate carbon pipeline, which dozens of biorefineries, including one Gevo facility, want to join. Gevo has purchased a North Dakota biorefinery that can already capture carbon on site, a potentially lucrative workaround to pipeline delays, and is eyeing SAF production there too. There is a RIN pathway for SAF from Brazilian sugarcane ethanol — a model that LanzaJet has pursued — but credit pricing makes economics challenging there too, adding to freight and tariff costs . Even then, the bill to change 45Z would restrict eligibility to North American feedstocks, upending LanzaJet's plans for Brazilian ethanol without making US alternatives more economical. ""45Z as currently drafted creates a disincentive for US ethanol to be used in SAF,"" said LanzaJet vice president of government and regulatory affairs Angela Foster-Rice. ""We are hopeful to get this issue addressed in the Senate bill."" Despite policy uncertainty, airlines have committed to procuring far more SAF and might be willing to pay a premium. But they are more likely to pay up for fuel they can at least use for SAF mandates in the EU and UK, which do not credit fuels from first-generation crops. US federal and state programs subsidize lower-carbon jet fuels but do not mandate usage. The floor is yours The Republican bill is still just a proposal, leaving the possibility for changes. The Senate reconvened this week with a goal of passing the bill before 4 July, and members have signaled they might take a different approach to clean energy subsidies than the House. Some biofuel lobbyists support shifting rules to benefit SAF — potentially by providing a higher ""floor"" credit for refiners that barely qualify or allowing alcohol-to-jet producers to claim the same benefit as upstream ethanol refiners. Under current rules, fuels may earn just cents per gallon. But such changes could rile trucking groups frustrated with 45Z already offering heftier subsidies to SAF and deficit hawks worried about the bill's mounting costs.

Australian carbon safeguard mechanism not a shield: CMI

Sydney, 4 June (Argus) — Australia's federal carbon compliance market's safeguard mechanism should not be used as ""a shield for inadequate"" climate considerations in approval processes, lobby group Carbon Market Institute (CMI) said today in response to the extension of Woodside Energy's North West Shelf (NWS) LNG project. The NWS LNG terminal was provisionally authorised to continue operating until 2070 in Western Australia's (WA) Pilbara region, newly appointed environment minister Murray Watt said last week. The permits include strict conditions relating to the impact of air emissions levels from the operation of an expanded onshore Karratha gas plant, the minister said. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and climate change and energy Chris Bowen also pointed out the project will need to comply with the safeguard mechanism, which sets out declining scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions baselines for the country's largest industrial facilities towards net zero by 2050. But the extension decision highlights that ""reforms to our outdated environmental laws are well overdue,"" CMI's chief executive John Connor said on 4 June. ""CMI supports a more rigorous assessment framework that would require project approval processes to have regard to the climate impacts of upstream and downstream greenhouse gas emissions associated with significant new developments and regional planning processes, as well as significant development extensions and/or expansions,"" Connor noted. Extending the project lifetime beyond 2030 will also place more spotlight on Australia's upcoming 2035 emissions reduction target , he added. Emissions projection NWS LNG has been among the top three largest facilities under the safeguard mechanism in recent years. It reported covered scope 1 emissions of 6.09mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in July 2023-June 2024, the first compliance year of the reformed mechanism , which was far above its baseline of 5.49mn t of CO2e. It surrendered 607,982 Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) as a result — the largest volume across all facilities. In its extension proposal submitted to WA's Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in 2022, Woodside estimated scope 1 emissions over 50 years between 2020-70 would reach up to a cumulative 385mn t of CO2e, with peak annual levels as high as 7.7mn t of CO2e, in case no mitigation activities were carried out. Planned mitigation and use of carbon offsets, however, would result in scope 1 emissions of up to 138.85mn t of CO2e over 2020-70, according to the company. Woodside has been accumulating ACCUs over the past few years, indicating it held around 12mn units out of a portfolio of 20mn unretired carbon credits as of December 2023 , including units yet to be issued and delivered as part of third-party contracts and the company's own originated projects.

Japan’s power utilities on course to rebuild LNG stocks

Osaka, 4 June (Argus) — LNG stocks at Japan's main power utilities are steadily increasing ahead of the peak summer demand season, and the latest stocks already exceed 2024 levels. The utilities held 2.26mn t of LNG inventories on 1 June, up by 4.6pc from a week earlier, according to a weekly survey by the trade and industry ministry Meti. This is higher by 1.3pc compared with 2.23mn t on 2 June 2024 and up by 7.6pc against 2.1mn t, the average end-June stocks over 2020-24. Lower utilisation of gas-fired fleets to meet weaker electricity demand in the week to 1 June helped utilities increase LNG stocks. Gas-fed output averaged 22GW in the week to 1 June, down by 8.3pc from a week earlier, according to nationwide transmission system operator the Organisation for Cross-regional Co-ordination of Transmission Operators (Occto). Reduced gas-fired generation came despite a 13pc weekly decline in base-load coal-fired output to an average of 18GW on 26 May-1 June. Oil-fed generation averaged at 158MW in the week, higher by 36pc from a week earlier. Large parts of Japan experienced cooler-than-normal weather last week, which limited electricity use for cooling purposes. The country's power demand averaged 82GW over 26 May-1 June, down by 4.3pc from a week earlier, Occto data show. Weaker power demand weighed on Japan's wholesale electricity prices and worsened generation economics for the country's thermal power plants, especially gas. Margins from a 58pc-efficient gas-fired plant running on oil-linked LNG averaged at -¥1.44/kWh (-$9.99/MWh) over 26 May-1 June. This is down from the average loss of -¥0.32/kWh a week earlier. The 58pc spark spread using spot LNG fell to an average loss of -¥2.20/kWh from -¥0.74/kWh a week earlier, based on the ANEA — the Argus assessment for spot LNG deliveries to northeast Asia. Coal remained competitive in Japan's merit order. The dark spread of a 40pc-efficient coal-fired unit averaged at ¥1.99/kWh in the week to 1 June, despite a 38pc drop on the week, based on Argus ' spot coal and freight assessments.

by Nathaniel Cline (Virginia Mercury) With biofuel production rising and pressure to reduce emissions growing, state and regional leaders embrace cleaner alternatives in the skies. -- As President Donald Trump’s administration scales back national climate initiatives, local leaders in the Washington Metropolitan region are stepping up to push for cleaner skies — with jet fuel made from trash, crops and forest waste.

At the heart of the push is Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, a biofuel derived from sources like corn grain, municipal solid waste, wet waste, and agricultural residues. Though not yet widely used, SAF is gaining traction thanks to its lower emissions and growing interest from regional policymakers.

The aviation industry has yet to fully embrace the alternative fuel, largely due to the high cost of production and limited infrastructure for storage costs. But with international interest rising and U.S. climate policies shifting, local leaders remain hopeful that a wider transition is on the horizon.

“I’m very optimistic about its ability to survive because it goes straight to the farmers, and it is really about American-made products,” said Ed Hubbard, general counsel and vice president of governmental affairs for the Renewable Fuels Association. “If you can fall within the framework of ‘American energy, greatness and dominance,’ I think that those are the aspects that survive throughout the process.”

Hubbard warned that if the Trump administration withdraws incentives for SAF, it would contradict its own America First Investment Policy — a doctrine designed to pressure companies into manufacturing domestically instead of overseas.

On Tuesday, Hubbard joined a panel discussion in Washington, D.C., focused on raising awareness about SAF. The event highlighted the formation of a working group, a directory of aviation-related associations, and plans for a traveling presentation aimed at engaging government and aviation leaders.

Introduction: The Aviation Industry’s Carbon Challenge

In the global fight against climate change, every sector must play its part. The aviation industry, responsible for approximately 2% of global CO2 emissions, faces a unique challenge. With air travel and freight expected to grow in the coming decades, the urgency to find sustainable solutions has never been greater. As a leader in digital logistics solutions, we at FreightAmigo are committed to staying at the forefront of industry developments that can benefit our clients and the planet.

In October 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) made a groundbreaking commitment to achieve net-zero emissions across global air transport by 2050. This ambitious goal has set the stage for a transformation in the aviation sector, pushing for innovative solutions to reduce its carbon footprint.

The Promise of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Among the various strategies being explored to decarbonize aviation, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a frontrunner. SAF is a low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, offering a lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reduction of up to 80% compared to traditional fuels. This makes SAF one of the most promising tools currently available for reducing aviation’s environmental impact.

The importance of SAF in the fight against climate change is gaining recognition worldwide. In Europe, the European Parliament has adopted new requirements for aviation fuel, mandating an incremental increase in the use of SAF from 2025 onwards. Meanwhile, in the United States, initiatives like the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act aim to significantly scale up SAF production over the next decade.

Understanding the Book and Claim Model

One of the innovative approaches to promoting SAF adoption is the “book and claim” chain of custody model. This system allows businesses to purchase the environmental benefits associated with SAF without being directly connected to the physical supply of the fuel. Here’s how it works:

As sustainable fuel is produced and consumed, companies can “book” a purchase of the sustainability benefits from SAF.

In return, the company receives a SAF certificate to lay “claim” on the environmental attributes.

These certificates can be used to apply reductions towards the company’s corporate carbon footprint.

The beauty of this system is that it requires no changes to existing supply chains. Companies can purchase SAF certificates for any air shipment emissions, regardless of the trade lane or carrier. This flexibility makes it an attractive option for businesses looking to reduce their carbon footprint without disrupting their operations.

The Current State of SAF Adoption

Despite its potential, SAF currently makes up less than 1% of jet fuel used globally. However, the book and claim model is helping to accelerate adoption by making SAF more accessible to a broader group of stakeholders. As more businesses become aware of this option and choose to participate, it could drive increased demand for SAF production, potentially leading to economies of scale and reduced costs in the long run.

Both frameworks play critical roles in addressing aviation’s carbon emissions but operate at different levels: the EU-ETS targets emissions within the European Union, while CORSIA aims to manage global emissions from international aviation. There remains much uncertainty surrounding the compatibility of these two carbon pricing mechanisms.

Our report analyzes the potential synergies and challenges of these two mechanisms for decarbonizing aviation, considering their effectiveness in reducing emissions, their geographical scope, and their impact on the industry. By exploring their alignment and potential conflicts, this report provides insight into how these systems can work together to achieve meaningful decarbonization in the aviation sector.

Post-pandemic, carbon emissions in aviation have rebounded, nearing pre-crisis levels. Despite efforts to prevent a further decline, emissions from international flights continue to grow. However, there exist effective tools that can curb both short- and long-term carbon impacts in the sector.

EU ETS: Pricing carbon to drive sustainable aviation

The EU-ETS is a market-based mechanism that places a price on carbon emissions. Aviation was incorporated into the EU-ETS in 2012, meaning airlines operating within the EU are required to buy allowances for their carbon emissions. The system works by capping the total number of emissions and allowing airlines to buy and sell allowances, thus incentivizing them to reduce emissions cost-effectively. Over time, the cap is reduced, driving down emissions and decarbonizing aviation.

CORSIA: Offsetting carbon on a global scale

Carbon offset programs are an effective way to impact aviation now, not later. CORSIA, adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is a global framework aimed at limiting the growth of carbon emissions from international aviation to 2019 levels. It requires airlines to offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from verified projects that reduce or remove carbon from the atmosphere. CORSIA started with a pilot phase in 2021 and is expected to ramp up over time.

Our Capgemini Invent report examines the efficiency and compatibility of these two carbon-pricing mechanisms. We believe they offer the sector substantial gains while decarbonizing aviation. But it is important to understand the different levels at which the two schemes operate, which disparities exist, and where the two overlap.

The facility, named NovaSAF 1, will be located in Durazno in Uruguay. It is expected to produce more than 350,000 gallons of SAF annually. The project is underpinned by long-term feedstock and site agreements with Estancias del Lago, a major Uruguayan dairy and agri-energy operator.

Kent will lead the FEED phase and support permitting and equipment sourcing. Final investment decision is targeted for Q4 2025, with commercial operations planned to begin in early 2027.

The project will use Syzygy’s NovaSAF platform, which integrates biogas and power-to-liquids technologies to convert agricultural waste and renewable electricity into liquid fuel. According to the company, this approach avoids the need for pipelines, gas separation, or water-intensive processes and enables a more-than 80% reduction in carbon intensity compared with conventional Jet-A fuel.

“This is more than just a SAF plant. It’s a new model for biogas economics,” said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. “We’re unlocking a global asset class of underutilised biogas sites and turning them into high-value clean fuel hubs without subsidy dependence.”

The platform is designed to be modular and exportable, with the potential for replication in biogas-rich regions. Syzygy claims it offers over 50% higher SAF yields than conventional thermal reforming pathways, and that the process may qualify as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin under EU regulations.

Jose Pedro Sanchez, COO at Estancias del Lago, added that the project combines agricultural waste with Uruguay’s near-fully renewable electricity grid to support local value creation and SAF production.

The company also stated that NovaSAF 1 is intended to meet EU, US and CORSIA SAF regulatory requirements.

Uncertainty beyond design stage

While the announcement of a FEED phase is a milestone for SAF projects, it does not guarantee that construction will proceed. Several factors can delay or halt progress between FEED and the final investment.

A major challenge is securing long-term offtake agreements. Airlines, the main consumers of SAF, often hesitate to commit to long-term fuel purchases due to the higher costs of SAF compared with conventional jet fuel.

Technical and regulatory uncertainties also feed into project delays. For instance, last year Shell paused construction of its planned 820,000 tonnes per year biofuel plant in Rotterdam having taken a final investment decision in 2021.

Earlier this year, Finnish biofuels company UPM said that it would halt the development of its planned second biomass-to-fuels refinery at the Port of Rotterdam. The 500,000 tonnes per year refinery was earmarked to be one of Europe’s biggest biorefineries.

Having first announced plans for the facility in 2021, the company announced it would delay final investment until 2023. This was subsequently pushed back to 2026, after the company was expecting to complete its testing and evaluation of the project.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), achieving net-zero carbon emissions in aviation by 2050 will require SAF to account for approximately 65% of the sector’s total fuel consumption.

This translates to an estimated 449 billion litres of SAF annually by mid-century. Given that global SAF production is projected to reach only two million tonnes in 2025 – representing just 0.7% of total aviation fuel use – the industry faces a huge challenge in scaling up production to meet future demand – and many more projects will have to start to produce.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2325764425.jpg",N,,2025-06-05 07:57:08.431952

At the heart of the push is Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, a biofuel derived from sources like corn grain, municipal solid waste, wet waste, and agricultural residues. Though not yet widely used, SAF is gaining traction thanks to its lower emissions and growing interest from regional policymakers.

The aviation industry has yet to fully embrace the alternative fuel, largely due to the high cost of production and limited infrastructure for storage costs. But with international interest rising and U.S. climate policies shifting, local leaders remain hopeful that a wider transition is on the horizon.

In the first three quarters of 2024, U.S. production of SAF reached 30 million gallons — a sharp increase of just five million in 2021, according to recent data collected by the U.S. Department of Energy.

“I’m very optimistic about its ability to survive because it goes straight to the farmers, and it is really about American-made products,” said Ed Hubbard, general counsel and vice president of governmental affairs for the Renewable Fuels Association. “If you can fall within the framework of ‘American energy, greatness and dominance,’ I think that those are the aspects that survive throughout the process.”

Hubbard warned that if the Trump administration withdraws incentives for SAF, it would contradict its own America First Investment Policy — a doctrine designed to pressure companies into manufacturing domestically instead of overseas.

On Tuesday, Hubbard joined a panel discussion in Washington, D.C., focused on raising awareness about SAF. The event highlighted the formation of a working group, a directory of aviation-related associations, and plans for a traveling presentation aimed at engaging government and aviation leaders.

The panel was hosted by the Greater Washington Region Clean Cities Coalition (GWRCCC), which works to promote affordable, local transportation fuels, energy-efficient mobility systems, and other fuel-saving practices.

The federal government developed a strategy to encourage the commercial-scale production of SAF through a plan called the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge.

Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the initiative set primary goals to reduce costs, bolster energy security, and significantly increase the production and use of SAF. Key targets include achieving a 50% reduction in life cycle emissions compared to traditional fuels and meeting production milestones of three billion gallons annually by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 — enough to meet all domestic demand.

Given the significant impact of jet travel on the environment, advocates hope SAF can help mitigate the pollution it causes. In 2022, aviation accounted for 2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and that share is expected to grow. The agency noted that aviation has experienced faster growth in recent decades than rail, road, and shipping.

“They pollute the environment, and the closer you live to those environments, the more negative it is on public health,” said Antoine Thompson, CEO and executive director for GWRCCC.

Data provided by GWRCCC at Tuesday’s meeting showed a combined 622 private and public airports between Maryland and Virginia.

Virginia began considering sustainability strategies at its airports earlier than other states. The commonwealth has a total of 406 public and private airports, 400 of which are privately owned.

In July 2016, the Virginia Department of Aviation (VDOA) commissioned the Virginia Airports Sustainability Management Plan — a voluntary guide for Virginia’s public airports to define their own sustainability priorities and needs.

Rusty Harrington, chief planner with VDOA, was one of the contributors to the plan.

“We have so many people that are working in parallel, and (the meeting) has been an opportunity for us to see what everyone else is working on and find some mutual common ground opportunities,” Harrington said.

Beyond SAF, Harrington noted that researchers also exploring advancements in engine technology, as well as the use of using electrification and hydrogen resources.

As for Virginia’s role in environmental stewardship, Harrington said the commonwealth is taking it very seriously.

“We want to protect the resources that we have, and we want to lessen our impacts in almost every activity we do — from design, construction, operation, maintenance of our airports — with the goal of securing and balancing the economic, the environmental and the social impacts of any of our actions,” Harrington said. “We like to think we’re doing a very good job of that because it’s inherent in whatever we do in airport development.”

“We are the lucky ones who can pioneer every day.” A brief history of aviation and aviation fuel Since the Wright brothers’ first powered flight in 1903, aviation has been synonymous with progress.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a broad term for non-fossil-derived fuels that can be blended with, or replace, conventional jet fuel.
About Airbus Airbus is more than just an aircraft manufacturer.
“We don’t want every country to have a different definition about what is sustainable aviation,” he warns.","Few industries capture the imagination like aviation. The freedom to fly has revolutionised economies, connected cultures and made the world smaller.

But as the climate crisis intensifies, aviation's environmental impact is under the microscope. With around 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions attributed to air travel – and demand for flights projected to soar – decarbonising aviation is one of the 21st century’s great sustainability challenges.

At the heart of this revolution is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a technology offering hope, complexity and innovation in equal measure.

Airbus, as one of the world’s leading aerospace manufacturers, is at the forefront of this transition.

“Climate risk is a humanitarian risk, but it's also a business and a financial risk,” says Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer at Airbus.

“At Airbus we remain committed to sustainability. No, we don't have all the answers and yes, it's hard, but we do have a collective goal to reach net zero for the industry.”

Despite the challenges, Airbus remains committed to its mission – to pioneer sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world.

“We are in the fourth revolution of aviation,” says Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus.

“The first one was more than a century ago with the beginning of flight in 1905. It used to be a very dangerous game – the average lifetime of a plane and the pilot was very short.

“The second revolution was to make aviation a safe mode of transport. It took a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of failures.

“The third transformation was to make it available for everyone, to make it affordable so that it became a viable method of transport.

“We are now in the fourth revolution of aviation – making it sustainable.”

“What is really exciting and what makes me passionate is that we have a purpose statement that says we pioneer sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world,” says Julien Manhes, Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Carbon Dioxide Removal at Airbus.

“We are the lucky ones who can pioneer every day.”

A brief history of aviation and aviation fuel

Since the Wright brothers’ first powered flight in 1903, aviation has been synonymous with progress.

For decades, kerosene-based jet fuel – derived from fossil sources – has been the industry standard, prized for its energy density and reliability. But extracting and burning fossil fuels releases carbon that has been locked underground for millennia, adding to atmospheric CO₂ and driving global warming.

The aviation sector’s reliance on fossil fuels has made it a hard-to-abate industry. Unlike cars or trains, where electrification is advancing rapidly, the energy requirements of flight make battery-powered planes viable only for short journeys.

For long-haul flights, liquid fuels remain essential – for now.

“Electricity generated by wind turbines dates back to the 19th century,” Julie explains.

“But wind power only really took off in the 1970s in the face of an energy crisis, and last year 30% of the electricity generated in the UK was generated by wind.

“That shows that we don't have to look too far in the face of crisis to see how transformation can come through innovation and technology. We need to start and we need to continue.

“This decade has shown us that every year brings a new crisis. We are living in a world of uncertainty and at Airbus, our conviction remains.

“We are pioneering sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world.”

What is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a broad term for non-fossil-derived fuels that can be blended with, or replace, conventional jet fuel. Most SAF today is produced from biomass, such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues or even municipal waste.

“In order to make SAF, it all starts with a CO₂ absorption,” explains Julien. “The biomass, when it grows, absorbs CO₂. Then you process that biomass into your biofuel. And when you burn the fuel, the CO₂ is released again. So you’re working effectively in a closed loop where you’re using CO₂ that is already in the atmosphere.”

This is fundamentally different from fossil fuels, which Julien says “pull carbon from the soil and release it back into the atmosphere, where it stays for centuries”.

SAF, when produced and sourced responsibly, can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The development of SAF

SAF’s journey from concept to commercialisation has been long and complex.

“What we did together with the industry is to make sure that we could make this synthetic fuel flyable,” says Julien.

“We spent quite a lot of time making sure that the different recipes of SAF could be used on our platforms – not only commercial aircraft, but also military aircraft and helicopters.”

Today, technical standards exist to ensure that SAF blends meet the stringent safety and performance requirements of aviation.

“Now there are technical standards that SAF producers can refer to, to ensure that what they produce, when it’s mixed with kerosene, is fulfilling the technical standards required to fly safely,” Julien explains.

About Airbus

Airbus is more than just an aircraft manufacturer. With a global workforce and a history of innovation, it has taken a proactive role in the SAF ecosystem.

“We have a lot of partnerships with a lot of different producers simply because we want to support the emergence of SAF at scale,” says Julien. These partnerships span established energy giants like TotalEnergies and Neste, as well as agile startups pioneering new feedstocks and production methods.

Airbus’s approach is holistic, supporting the supply and demand sides of the SAF equation.

“We provide financing so that SAF producers can start their production facility,” Julien explains. “For those smaller producers, it’s really hard to find cheap financing to make their project work.”

The challenges of decarbonising aviation

Technical barriers

While SAF is “drop-in” – meaning it can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure – there are still technical hurdles. Not all feedstocks are created equal and scaling up production to meet global demand is a massive challenge.

Economic realities

The biggest challenge, however, is economic. “There is one single major issue, and I say major, but it’s the money,” says Julien. “The problem with those fuels is that they’re very expensive to manufacture and therefore the price at which they’re being sold is two to three times the price of conventional fuel.”

Policy and regulation

Policy frameworks are crucial. “A policy will enable a new industry to emerge,” Julien believes. But definitions of what constitutes “sustainable” can vary. For example, the EU restricts certain feedstocks, such as crop-based biofuels, while the US is more permissive. “We don’t want every country to have a different definition about what is sustainable aviation,” he warns.

Supply and demand

The classic ‘chicken and egg’ dilemma looms large – airlines want to buy SAF, but producers need assurance of demand before investing in new facilities. “You can activate demand by saying, okay, I force the fuel distributors to incorporate a certain percentage, a certain level of blend in the overall fuel mix.”

Innovations in SAF and aviation decarbonisation

Airbus is investing in a wide range of SAF innovations.

“We partner on all fronts with all types of producers and we really think that we can bring, with a lot of humility, a little contribution to all those partners,” says Julien.

This includes supporting startups working on novel feedstocks such as waste, sewage and even alcohol-to-jet technologies.

Beyond SAF, Airbus is exploring hydrogen-powered flight and advanced aircraft designs. But for the foreseeable future, SAF is considered by many as the most viable way to decarbonise long-haul aviation.

The role of collaboration

The scale of the challenge demands collaboration.

“We are seeking partnerships and collaboration across the entire value chain,” Julien says.

“We are also sponsoring some studies, for example, of different crops that could be used as a feedstock for SAF. We are discovering a new world like pioneers do – a world of collaboration and a wealth of failure, because sometimes we realise that what we are doing doesn’t work. That’s very much the beauty of innovating and allowing ourselves to fail from time to time.”

The role of the consumer

While airlines and manufacturers are central to the SAF transition, passengers and corporate customers also have a part to play.

“When you buy your ticket, have a look as to whether the airline is proposing to you having a little bit of SAF in your ticket,” suggests Julien. “You’re no longer buying only the experience of travelling from A to B. You are buying this experience plus a reduced carbon footprint.”

Corporate customers, in particular, are leading the way by purchasing SAF credits to offset their business travel emissions.

“When I fly on business travel with Air France, we buy from Air France 100% CO₂ reduction out of SAF. We buy SAF from Air France, or the CO₂ reduction attributes of the SAF that Air France procures. In return we get certificates that we can claim for.”

Book and claim mechanisms: Making SAF more accessible

One of Airbus’s proudest recent achievements is the development of a ‘book and claim’ mechanism for smaller customers. This system allows customers to claim the environmental benefits of SAF, even if the physical fuel is not used on their specific flight.

“The book and claim mechanism is correlating the attributes of SAF or the environmental attributes of SAF from the physical product. It is a great enabler for SAF to take off,” Julien says. “For us, this demonstrator is really the opportunity to show that it’s robust whilst at the same time helping our customers to decarbonise.”

Policy, innovation and hope

Looking to the future, Julien is cautiously optimistic.

“My wish for the UK and Europe is to continue implementing their regulation while developing more support mechanisms for the local airlines. The threat that we see is that if the regulations in Europe and the UK are not fairly designed, it may have a negative impact on their competitiveness.”

He also hopes to see major economies like India and China embrace SAF, which will send a positive signal towards the rest of the industry.

And, crucially, he wants to see evidence of voluntary demand.

“There is demand from passengers and a little bit of willingness to pay a little bit more to fly with a lower carbon footprint,” he says.

“To me, that would give me a lot of hope for our success going forward and for our ability to achieve net zero in 2050.”

Revolutionising aviation

The transition to SAF is a revolution for the air transport industry – one that will require technical ingenuity, policy innovation and global collaboration.

“The energy challenge of human mankind in that transition is huge,” Julien reflects. “We don’t want to look at it only from the perspective of aviation. It is much bigger than us, much bigger.”

Yet, as Airbus and its partners demonstrate, the journey is well under way. The pioneers of sustainable flight are not only changing how we fly, but also how we think about our place in a rapidly warming world.

Alcohol-to-jet stuck on runway as US policy shifts

Alcohol-to-jet stuck on runway as US policy shifts

New York, 4 June (Argus) — Proposed changes to a US clean fuel tax credit may be a boon for farmers, but a future where ethanol is a major ingredient in jet fuel remains far off. The massive Republican budget bill currently advancing through Congress would extend the ""45Z"" credit, which offers larger subsidies to fuels as they produce fewer emissions. The proposal too would bar regulators from weighing indirect land use impacts , effectively upping subsidies for crop-based fuels like ethanol, in a win for agribusiness. Farm groups have hoped that such changes could open the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market to ethanol producers, otherwise at risk from an increasingly efficient and electric US vehicle fleet. Airlines too are eager for more diverse SAF sources since the main pathway nowadays, processing vegetable oils and animal fats, draws from more limited feedstocks. United Airlines government affairs director Tom Michels said at an OurEnergyPolicy forum earlier this year that the company hopes ethanol-based fuel ""could fulfill around a quarter of our future SAF needs."" But incentives in law and under the proposal, which passed the House last month, would do little to boost ""alcohol-to-jet"" output. While ethanol typically trades at a discount to gasoline, SAF is substantially more expensive than petroleum, making government support essential for uptake. The Republican caucus has a range of views, with clean energy advocates wary of phasing out subsidies, farm-state representatives intent on boosting biofuels, and conservatives committed to curbing government spending. Republicans plan to use a process called reconciliation that allows them to pass the bill without Democratic support. How policymakers implement 45Z will be crucial for a wave of alcohol-to-jet startups eyeing production this decade. That includes Gevo, whose plans for an integrated 60mn USG/yr plant in South Dakota are complicated by another company's struggles starting an interstate carbon pipeline. Meanwhile, people familiar with the matter say that LanzaJet's 10mn USG/yr alcohol-to-jet pilot project in Georgia — which opened last year but is not yet fully operational — is not currently producing any SAF. ""The suite of policies we would need to make ethanol-to-jet pencil out just does not exist right now,"" said Brian Jennings, chief executive of the American Coalition for Ethanol. RINs wear thin Ethanol-based SAF would likely still produce too many emissions to claim any 45Z subsidy even if the proposed emissions tracking changes took effect — since the pathway requires more energy-intensive processing to make fuel suitable for jet engines. Carbon capture could make up the difference, though few facilities have that capability. The lack of subsidy would compound barriers from the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners to blend biofuels or buy credits from those who do. Under the program, blending corn ethanol earns a Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit, but there is no certified pathway yet to offer RINs for corn-based SAF blending. Even if there were, advanced biofuel credits have traded recently at only a slight premium, reducing the incentive for ethanol producers to eye new markets. Argus last assessed current year D4 biomass-based diesel credits at 92.25¢/RIN and D6 conventional credits at 86.50¢/RIN, and they traded at parity much of last year. Meanwhile, the typical US dry mill ethanol producer would likely qualify for some 45Z subsidy if the Republican bill passed, adding to RIN benefits. Those plants would have to forgo both incentives to sell to SAF makers. It is unclear how producers of a more-expensive and less-subsidized SAF could compete on price. Gevo chief executive Patrick Gruber said that his company's integrated model — producing ethanol and SAF at the same sites — is less risky than buying ethanol from elsewhere. But there are other policy headwinds. A new South Dakota law to restrict eminent domain could derail Summit Carbon's planned multistate carbon pipeline, which dozens of biorefineries, including one Gevo facility, want to join. Gevo has purchased a North Dakota biorefinery that can already capture carbon on site, a potentially lucrative workaround to pipeline delays, and is eyeing SAF production there too. There is a RIN pathway for SAF from Brazilian sugarcane ethanol — a model that LanzaJet has pursued — but credit pricing makes economics challenging there too, adding to freight and tariff costs . Even then, the bill to change 45Z would restrict eligibility to North American feedstocks, upending LanzaJet's plans for Brazilian ethanol without making US alternatives more economical. ""45Z as currently drafted creates a disincentive for US ethanol to be used in SAF,"" said LanzaJet vice president of government and regulatory affairs Angela Foster-Rice. ""We are hopeful to get this issue addressed in the Senate bill."" Despite policy uncertainty, airlines have committed to procuring far more SAF and might be willing to pay a premium. But they are more likely to pay up for fuel they can at least use for SAF mandates in the EU and UK, which do not credit fuels from first-generation crops. US federal and state programs subsidize lower-carbon jet fuels but do not mandate usage. The floor is yours The Republican bill is still just a proposal, leaving the possibility for changes. The Senate reconvened this week with a goal of passing the bill before 4 July, and members have signaled they might take a different approach to clean energy subsidies than the House. Some biofuel lobbyists support shifting rules to benefit SAF — potentially by providing a higher ""floor"" credit for refiners that barely qualify or allowing alcohol-to-jet producers to claim the same benefit as upstream ethanol refiners. Under current rules, fuels may earn just cents per gallon. But such changes could rile trucking groups frustrated with 45Z already offering heftier subsidies to SAF and deficit hawks worried about the bill's mounting costs.

France-based Global Bioenergies on June 3 announced the company has launched an official search for buyers in the form of a “pre-pack sale” as part of a conciliation procedure. Purchase offers are due July 9.

The company, which has been operating for more than a decade, developed a process produce biobased isobutene, a molecule with applications in the energy, materials and cosmetics industries. Global Bioenergies in mid-2024 announced it had adopted its process to convert biobased materials into e-SAF, a form of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, using acetic acid as a resource.

In October 2024, Global Bioenergies announced plans to focus its business exclusively on e-SAF production. The decision was made after a proposed plant dedicated to the cosmetics market failed to find adequate investors.

The company earlier this year supplied a batch of SAF to Safran, the world’s second-largest aircraft equipment manufacturer, for evaluation. Safron assessed the specific properties of the fuel during the fuel injection phase prior to combustion in the engine. ONERA, the French aerospace center, has also carried out tests on a laboratory burner to quantify the particles emitted during combustion of SAF. According to Global Bioeneries, that testing demonstrated a 40-99% reduction in soot emissions when compared with Jet-A-1 fuel, depending on the conditions tested in the laboratory.

In its June 3 announcement, Global Bioenergies said it has been unable to find strategic investors to finance the continuation of its business. The planned pre-pack sale enables potential buyers to position themselves for the acquisition of all or part of the company’s business or assets. Completion of the sale plan, once decreed by the Commercial Court, will be followed by the liquidation of the company, involving the un-collectability of all or part of its liabilities, notably bank debts, and will results in the desilting of its securities.

“As a reminder, we were unable to finance our first plant project and switched in the autumn of 2024 to an R&D collaboration project with a major international industrialist, aiming to combine its technology with ours to produce particularly competitive sustainable aviation fuels,” said Marc Delcourt, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Global Bioenergies. “In this context, we had to finance our share of this project until profitability was reached.

“We contacted numerous potential investors, mainly large industrial companies who would play an operational role in the project in addition to their investment,” Delcourt continued. “Despite several promising discussions and significant expressions of interest, we regret to say that none of these players is interested in acquiring a minority or majority stake in the Company in its current configuration and in the current geopolitical climate, which is adverse to investment in solutions to fight global warming and promote the energy transition. As a result, we are now looking for a buyer for the business.”

The Commercial Court of Evry will evaluate the offers and select the buyer. A sales transaction is currently expected to close in September or October 2025.

This milestone brings the total number of E15 projects awarded this fiscal year to 388, by far the most grants in a year since RFIP’s inception.
“These investments are a win for Iowa drivers, farmers, and fuel retailers,” said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.
These public dollars have spurred millions more in private investment, accelerating the expansion of higher blends of renewable fuels across the state.
The Iowa Legislature recently approved an additional $10 million in funding for the program for the upcoming fiscal year.","During its last scheduled meeting during fiscal year 2025, the Iowa Renewable Fuels Infrastructure Program today awarded more than $1 million in cost-share grants to support the installation of E15 at 91 additional retail fuel sites across Iowa. This milestone brings the total number of E15 projects awarded this fiscal year to 388, by far the most grants in a year since RFIP’s inception.

“These investments are a win for Iowa drivers, farmers, and fuel retailers,” said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. “Retailers are working hard to meet the E15 Access Standard, and this program is a critical tool to help them bridge the gap in offering higher blends.”

So far in the current fiscal year, which began on July 1, 2024, RFIP has awarded over $11 million in grants, funding 388 E15 projects and 39 biodiesel projects. These public dollars have spurred millions more in private investment, accelerating the expansion of higher blends of renewable fuels across the state.

“It is clear the Governor’s E15 Access Standard is working and on pace for implementation on January 1 next year,” said Shaw. “We’re also pleased to see that as we predicted a huge number of retail locations in Iowa have been able to offer E15 with a very small investment, most of which is covered by the RFIP grants.”

In total, since the program's founding, more than $59 million in state grants have been awarded through RFIP, helping fund ethanol and biodiesel infrastructure. These investments have enabled hundreds of Iowa fueling stations to offer cleaner-burning, homegrown fuels like E15, E85, and biodiesel blends to consumers.

The Iowa Legislature recently approved an additional $10 million in funding for the program for the upcoming fiscal year. “We thank Governor Reynolds and state legislative leaders for stepping up,” Shaw added. “With a nudge from the Governor’s Biofuels Bill and support from the RFIP grant program, in less than three years E15 has gone from hard to find to readily available to the vast majority of Iowans. In short, the E15 Access Standard has been a remarkable success for motorists, Iowa’s economy, our environment, and for Iowa’s farmers.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/epm/posts/web/2014/04/GasPumps_13975131953062.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 20:56:39.178630

A draft version of the policy, which will be effective for a period of five years from the date of promulgation, is now up for comments and suggestions. ""The policy aims to position UP as a leading hub for SAF manufacturing in India, enhance energy security, support decarbonisation of the aviation sector, and generate green employment opportunities through innovation, investment, and public-private partnership,"" said a senior officer in the state govt. The officer informed that Invest UP will be the nodal agency for sanction and disbursement of fiscal incentives to SAF units that come up under the policy. As per the draft, in addition to the primary goals, the policy also aims to support research, innovation, and technology partnerships in SAF feedstock processing and fuel conversion. It seeks to create rural and urban green employment opportunities through feedstock supply chains and processing facilities, contribute to national climate goals and India's SAF blending targets, while enhancing energy security, among others. To achieve the goals, the state govt would roll out several fiscal and non-fiscal benefits to willing investors. For this, the draft policy first describes large and mega SAF units based on minimum capital investment. While those with a minimum investment of Rs 50 crore and up to Rs 199 crore will be called large, those with an investment of Rs 200 crore or more would be called mega. The incentive framework also spells out eligibility criteria to elaborate on the fiscal benefits the state govt would extend. The list includes a front-end land subsidy of 50% to units that come up in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad and 75% in the rest of western UP and central UP districts. For districts in the eastern UP and Bundelkhand region, the incentive would be 80%. The list also includes stamp duty exemptions, waiver for land use conversion, exemption from developmental charges, capital subsidy, state GST reimbursement, interest subsidy, skill development subsidy, and reimbursement of patent registration fees, among others. The non-fiscal benefits include the development of aggregated feedstock procurement platforms to ensure a steady and quality supply of biomass, used cooking oil, and municipal waste. It will facilitate linkages with farmers, waste management bodies, and industries for feedstock supply contracts, and the development of dedicated SAF storage, blending, and distribution infrastructure at airports and fuel depots at strategic locations having high biowaste production in proximity to aviation zones. The state govt will promote feedstock certification and sustainability standards to ensure compliance and market acceptance, among others. Companies like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum are actively exploring partnerships and pilot projects to commercialise SAF technologies. Moreover, global players like Boeing and Airbus have entered collaborations with Indian institutions to develop indigenous SAF solutions.

Climate Costs Could Mean Higher Air Fares Reuters reported that IATA said some of that cost will likely be passed on to travelers through higher fares.
The airlines cannot absorb increased costs,"" Walsh previously said.
It said that in 2025, it is projected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.
“We reject claims from the aviation sector suggesting a lack of sustainable aviation fuel supply,” the group previously told Skift.","The airline industry is sticking to its target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, despite growing concerns over the slow ramp-up of green aviation fuels.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents more than 350 airlines globally, reaffirmed its climate goal at the close of its two-day annual summit in New Delhi on Tuesday.

“There had been no talk of any delay to the target,” IATA director Willie Walsh said in a press conference, according to Reuters. He added that the goal remains both realistic and necessary.

The target had come under scrutiny amid fears it might be delayed due to the lack of available low-emissions fuel.

“There is great concern that we're not making sufficient progress, not as airlines, but as the value chain that needs to support the airlines transitioning to net zero,” Walsh said.

“We still have time to get there, but we do need to see more action from all of the partners in the value chain.”

Fuel Producers Not Playing Their Part

Walsh called out oil majors and fuel producers for scaling back their investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the sector’s preferred alternative to fossil-based jet fuel.

The sector says SAF can reduce emissions by around 60%, but it currently accounts for less than 1% of global jet fuel use.

“We have made clear from the very beginning that the airline industry will not be able to achieve net zero in 2050 unless everybody in the wider value chain supports the industry in doing that,” Walsh said. “I think it is a wakeup call.”

While industry profits have rebounded since the pandemic, IATA warned that the cost of meeting net zero could reach as much as $4.7 trillion.

Climate Costs Could Mean Higher Air Fares

Reuters reported that IATA said some of that cost will likely be passed on to travelers through higher fares. Walsh and IATA have previously spoken about the risk of higher fares.

""Going forward as we see increases in carbon costs, there has to be an impact on ticket prices as the industry transitions to net zero. The airlines cannot absorb increased costs,"" Walsh previously said.

In a new report, IATA estimated that the average cost of SAF in 2024 was 3.1 times that of conventional jet fuel. It said that in 2025, it is projected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.

Lufthansa has already introduced an environmental surcharge on all tickets from most European countries. The amount of the surcharge varies between $1 and $78, depending on the flight route.

""This is due to steadily rising additional costs due to regulatory environmental requirements,"" the airline said in a statement. ""These include the statutory blending quota of initially 2% for SAF for departures from European Union.""

IATA is expected to release further guidance on SAF deployment and financing later this year.

Fuels Europe, which represents companies like BP and Shell, have rejected the aviation industry’s claims.

“We reject claims from the aviation sector suggesting a lack of sustainable aviation fuel supply,” the group previously told Skift. “Our members are on track to meet their current mandate and exceed 2030 targets. Despite policy and investment challenges, European fuel producers have rapidly scaled SAF output and lowered costs.”

The project, located in Durazno, Uruguay, is being developed in partnership with Kent, a firm known for its experience in SAF project execution, reports Biomass Magazine.

NovaSAF 1 is expected to produce more than 350,000 gallons of ASTM-certified SAF each year, using biogas and clean electricity in a breakthrough production process that aims to cut costs and carbon emissions. Syzygy says the plant will serve as a blueprint for scalable and low-cost SAF production worldwide.

The facility is backed by long-term agreements with Estancias del Lago (EDL), one of Uruguay’s largest dairy and agri-energy operations, securing both the site and biogas feedstock for the project. Permitting and equipment sourcing are underway in parallel with engineering design.

The plant will run on Syzygy’s proprietary NovaSAF platform, which merges biogas use with Power-to-Liquids (PtL) technology. By using waste as a feedstock and avoiding the need for gas pipelines or intensive water use, the process is designed to be both resource-efficient and environmentally responsible.

Syzygy says NovaSAF could meet EU Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) criteria, positioning it as a potential solution to global regulatory demands. Unlike more established SAF production methods—such as HEFA, ATJ, or traditional PtL—NovaSAF aims to deliver sustainable jet fuel at a cost that matches conventional Jet-A fuel once fully commercialized.

This joint project aims to support the development and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Mexico with a study on possible SAF production conducted by ICAO through the Assistance, Capacity Building and Training for SAF (ACT-SAF) Programme, in coordination with the Mexican Technical Working Groups for SAF Roadmap development co-led by the Federal Civil Aviation (AFAC) and Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA).

ICAO’s ACT-SAF programme assists States in developing their SAF potential implementation, including an overview of policy and regulatory frameworks, assessment of feedstocks and pathways for SAF production, and implementation support and financing. With Volaris’ support, this is the first time an airline in the Americas has actively contributed through investment to this Voluntary Environment Fund. This partnership reinforces the industry’s collaboration and engagement towards achieving ICAO’s long term aspirational goal of reaching net zero emission for the sector by 2050.

Airbus and ICAO recently announced feasibility studies for Argentina, Panama and Perú. This fourth feasibility study announcement reaffirms the Company’s commitment to lead the decarbonization of the aviation sector.

SAF has been identified as one of the enablers of greenhouse gas emissions reductions. It can reduce CO2 emissions by up-to 80% throughout its life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel. Airbus supports the large-scale development of SAF and collaborates with airlines, airports, SAF producers, research institutes and civil aviation authorities around the world to advance the SAF ecosystem, addressing the policy and regulatory environment as well as supply and demand drivers.

Zero-emission electric aircraft have begun to emerge, but only at a small scale and for short distances. Bio-based sustainable aviation fuel offers the potential for more rapid scale-up because it can be blended with conventional jet fuel for use in existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. Until recently, sustainable aviation fuel was only available in limited quantities, but new supplies may soon change that.

The slow pace of sustainable aviation fuel uptake

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) stakeholders have experimented with many different kinds of bio-based sources since the early 2000s, including algae, food waste, and agricultural and forest waste, along with cultivated energy crops including oilseeds and grasses as well as corn and soy.

But progress is moving at a snail’s pace. United Airlines, for example, became the first major airline to test sustainable aviation fuel back in 2009 and since then has explored various bio-based sources including algae. The company says it has invested in the “future production” of more than 5 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, but achieving that scale is a long-term goal.

In the meantime, United advises that “production remains very limited,” and very expensive as well, and the airline is not alone. Sustainable aviation fuel accounted for less than 0.15 percent of the total fuel used among 77 leading airlines last year, according to a survey from the European organization Transport & Environment.

Corn, soy oil, and other cultivated crops accounted for more than 30 percent of the sustainable aviation fuel used among the airlines T&E surveyed, indicating that agriculture-related carbon emissions could offset much of the gains from using bio-based resources. In addition, 100 percent bio-based fuel is not a complete solution. Also called “neat” SAF, 100 percent bio-based sustainable aviation fuel is not certified for use on its own. Instead, it is blended with conventional jet fuel, making it all the more important to keep agricultural supply chain emissions down to a minimum.

The electrofuels solution

Electrofuels are an alternative solution that is gaining ground. Sometimes called solar fuels or e-fuels, electrofuels are synthetic hydrocarbon fuels produced by deploying electricity — ideally from solar power or other renewable resources — to separate green hydrogen gas from water. The hydrogen is then combined with captured carbon to create new fuels that are chemically identical to fossil-sourced fuels, meaning they can be used on their own on a drop-in basis instead of blending with conventional jet fuels.

Although cost is an obstacle, some analysts project the price of green hydrogen will dip to a competitive level by 2030.

United is among the aviation stakeholders signaling that the electrofuels pathway is a promising one. Last month, the company's United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund invested in the U.S. electrofuels startup Twelve. The startup describes its green hydrogen process as a form of artificial photosynthesis, deploying renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel from carbon dioxide and water, yielding a potential cut of 90 percent in lifecycle carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

With additional funding in hand, Twelve plans to begin producing fuel at a plant in Moses Lake, Washington, later this year and aims for an output of 50,000 gallons annually. The company also entered a 14-year contract with a five-airline group in Europe, to be named later, for a total of 260 million gallons of fuel.

More sustainable aviation fuel is on the way

Bio-based sustainable aviation fuel ventures also continue to attract investors and public funding.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently noted a sharp increase in production of what it classifies as ""Other Biofuels,"" which practically doubled from December 2024 to February 2025. “Other Biofuels” include renewable heating oil and emerging biofuels, but the EIA notes that sustainable aviation fuel is beginning to dominate the category, making it a useful indication of activity in this sector. “With [sustainable aviation fuel] production capacity now around 30,000 [barrels per day] and growing in 2025, SAF will likely drive significant growth ... and make up most of U.S. Other Biofuels production,” EIA reported.

Among the recent projects the agency highlighted is a 15,000 barrel-per-day facility in Texas under the umbrella of Diamond Green Diesel, a joint venture of Valero Energy and the firm Darling Ingredients, which focuses on producing biofuels from animal fats, used cooking oil and food waste among other sources.

Another newly operational project comes from New Rise Renewables, which converted a former biodiesel operation in Nevada to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The company, a branch of the firm XCF Global, began producing fuel at the facility in February at a rate of 3,000 barrels per day. XCF says a third-party buyer has already contracted for more than 3 million gallons.

Meanwhile, the Montana Renewables branch of Calumet is now producing sustainable aviation fuel at its facility in Great Falls, Montana. “Montana Renewables expects to reach 120- to 150-million-gallon SAF capacity sooner than previously reported for a fraction of the cost,” Calumet reported in May, citing its experience over the past two years as the main factor enabling the facility to expand while cutting costs. The company says it's on track to reach a capacity of up to 300 million gallons per year by 2028.

The expansion of Montana Renewables is particularly noteworthy because it is one of few renewable energy projects supported by the Donald Trump administration. To help finance the expansion, Montana Renewables applied for and received a loan guarantee of $1.44 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy. The transaction was closed during the final days of the Joe Biden administration. On Feb. 18, almost a month after President Trump took office, Calumet announced that the first drawdown of $782 million was authorized by the Energy Department.",https://back.3blcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/ratio_3_2/public/triplepundit/wide/getty-images-Q0gNKKSP4aE-unsplash.jpg?h=f4bc3890,N,,2025-06-04 14:56:29.504482

While the goal to double SAF production is commendable, cost remains the industry’s biggest concern.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced a major target: doubling global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to 2 million tonnes (2.5 billion liters) by 2025. That would mark real progress for a sector under increasing scrutiny for its carbon emissions. Yet even with that increase, SAF would still make up just 0.7% of total aviation fuel use—a sliver of what’s needed to decarbonize the skies.

The aviation sector accounts for nearly 2% of global CO₂ emissions, and SAF is currently seen as the most viable near-term solution to cut that number. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is derived from renewable feedstocks like waste oils and organic waste, and can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%.

Still, airlines are far from breaking their dependency on fossil fuel. Today, 99% of aviation fuel remains petroleum-based, and without major policy interventions, that may not change fast enough.

Why Scaling SAF Remains So Hard—and Expensive

IATA further explains that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) costs about five times more than regular jet fuel. This high price comes from the complex process of making SAF, which uses advanced technology and hard-to-find raw materials. On top of that, airlines face extra costs to meet government rules in places like the EU and the UK. For example, European airlines may have to spend an extra $1.7 billion just to follow SAF requirements.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said,

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

For smaller airlines, these costs are especially punishing. That’s why IATA and industry leaders are calling for stronger government support—tax credits, subsidies, and policy reforms that can level the playing field with fossil fuels.

Without such support, there’s a risk that SAF production could stagnate right when it needs to ramp up.

Walsh further says,

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”

Government Support: The Missing Link?

Progress is visible in some regions. The Biden administration has launched green aviation programs in the U.S., though many in the sector say the funding and guarantees still fall short. Meanwhile, Norway and Sweden are setting the pace with robust incentives that make SAF more accessible and affordable.

These countries show that smart policy can align environmental and economic goals. Their models could be copied elsewhere, especially in emerging markets where aviation growth is exploding.

IATA urges governments to focus on three key priorities:

Fixing the policy imbalance: Redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies could boost SAF economics dramatically.

Building integrated energy strategies: A long-term plan must ensure SAF gets a fair slice of the renewable energy supply and infrastructure.

Supporting CORSIA: IATA wants more Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). So far, only Guyana has made its carbon credits available to airlines under the scheme.

Building the SAF Market: IATA’s Initiatives

To help scale up the SAF market, IATA is supporting two key programs:

SAF Registry (via CADO): A global system to track SAF usage and emissions reductions. It ensures compliance with standards like CORSIA and the EU ETS.

SAF Matchmaker: A platform that connects airlines seeking SAF with producers who have it, helping both sides find better deals and drive volume.

Together, these tools aim to bring more transparency and efficiency to a market that’s still in its infancy.

The Global SAF Market in 2030: A Long Climb Ahead

Key trends shaping the SAF market:

High prices continue to slow adoption

Investor interest is rising, especially in new tech like waste-to-fuel systems that could cut costs

Policy action will determine how fast production scales

With the right mix of investment and regulation, SAF could become cost-competitive with fossil fuel sooner than many expect.

India: A Growing Aviation Power Makes a SAF Play

India is stepping into the spotlight with bold SAF goals. As the world’s third-largest oil consumer and third-largest aviation market, India has launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to accelerate the adoption of alternative fuels, including SAF.

The country aims for a 2% SAF blend in international flights by 2028. To reach this goal, India plans to offer guaranteed pricing, capital support, and technical standards.

IATA is partnering with ISMA (Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association) and Praj Industries to guide India on feedstock sustainability and lifecycle assessments—critical steps toward building a globally recognized SAF ecosystem.

Can the Aviation Industry Afford to Go Green?

While the goal to double SAF production is commendable, cost remains the industry’s biggest concern. Airlines operate on razor-thin margins and can’t absorb high fuel costs without passing them on to passengers.

What’s needed is a system-wide alignment:

Governments must provide financial support through subsidies and grants

Airlines must commit to long-term SAF purchase agreements

Investors must back scalable, cost-cutting tech

Consumers must favor low-carbon travel options

The stakes are high, but so is the potential. SAF offers the most immediate path to decarbonize long-haul aviation, where electric or hydrogen options won’t be viable anytime soon.

Doubling SAF output to 2 million tonnes by 2025 is a strong step. But to meet net-zero goals by 2050, the world needs to go far beyond. That means bold policies, faster tech innovation, and deeper collaboration between governments, airlines, and energy producers.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/flux_IATA-Aims-to-Double-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-by-2025-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 13:56:30.324615

While the hoped-for future trade between Europe and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) remained in focus, a shift in emphasis appeared. While national goals look increasingly dubious, progress is occurring in specific industry sectors guided by international agreements. Meanwhile, MENA countries confront the imperative to develop domestic markets for their clean hydrogen.

Looking for good news

Industry observers strained to find good news during a discussion called ‘Low carbon and green hydrogen: navigating challenges to open opportunities.’

High cost, lack of demand and regulatory uncertainty were named as the main factors holding projects back.

Even the world’s premier project – NEOM Green Hydrogen in Saudi Arabia – is in danger of delays. TotalEnergies will buy 70,000 tons per year in a long-term contract, about one-third of planned production, but there are no other buyers yet according to a report by Bloomberg News last week.

In Europe, with EU mandates and pipelines for hydrogen under development, there is ongoing criticism of the regulatory regime being shaped by the EU, which many participants believe is too onerous. Europe’s incentive schemes and contract for difference programs are producing just a small part of the green fuels required to meet EU goals.

And the outlook for hydrogen in the US remains precarious, where incentives may be revoked to offset tax cuts.

Chicken and egg

There’s a basic ‘chicken and egg’ problem afflicting the nascent industry, in which there’s no market without demand, and no demand without a market.

“We’re trying to create a market out of essentially nothing, we’re at very early stages,” said Frederik Beelitz, Head of Advisory for Central Europe, Aurora Energy Research.

“Bridging the gap between the levelized cost of hydrogen and the willingness to pay is currently the big challenge, mainly on the demand side,” he said.

“Potential offtakers for green or low-carbon hydrogen are just not willing to pay the relatively high cost that it now incurs.”

Producers want long-term off-take agreements, but off-takers such as industrial companies and utilities want shorter agreements in anticipation of the cost of hydrogen falling as production ramps up and technology improves.

""No one can commit to a 10-year price, no one can carry that risk,” said Jan Haizmann, CEO, Zero Emissions Traders Alliance.

“But we’ve seen how quickly renewables scaled and hydrogen might follow the same path if the conditions are right.""

In Europe, the chicken and egg problem is being met with push and pull policies. On the supply side, pull factors taking the levelized cost of hydrogen down include support mechanisms for capital cost and financing. On the demand side, push factors act to raise the capacity or willingness or buyers to pay. Auction devices such as Germany’s H2Global, now going into its second auction round, provide critical price information while subsidizing the difference between suppliers’ long-term prices and buyers’ preference for short-term contracts. However, it’s unclear whether these programs will build meaningful scale.

Sector specific

At last week’s conference and other recent events, there’s been less use of the term ‘hydrogen industry’ and more emphasis on industry sectors. Hydrogen and its derivatives are now seen as high value fuels for very specific applications.

In Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) sets clear targets for the maritime and aviation sectors, in the form of the percentage of ‘renewable fuels of non-biological origin’ (RFNBO) that fuels must contain.

This should create demand for derivatives and synthetic or e-fuels produced with hydrogen. Such fuels include ammonia and e-methanol in the maritime sector and e-kerosene in the aviation sector.

In aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) has entered Phase 1. Airlines can purchase carbon credits in the voluntary market, which must meet the high CORSIA standards, or they can purchase sustainable aviation fuel. The amount of emissions covered will expand greatly when Phase 2 starts in 2027 with the inclusion of Brazil, India, Russia and China in the scheme.

In global shipping, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has issued draft rules mandating greenhouse gas emissions reductions for ships (5,000 gross tonnage or greater) and imposing penalties for non-compliance.

These rules will effectively impose the first ever global carbon price for international shipping and create demand for green and low-carbon hydrogen derivatives and biofuels. They should compel shipowners and the fuel producers and bunkering companies supplying them to substitute renewable and low-carbon fuels, including expensive-to-produce e-methanol, in place of fossil-derived fuels.

Demand for low-carbon hydrogen should also arise in the power sector, with more electrification of transport and industry and increasing demand for electricity produced from renewable energy systems.

As the price of renewable power continues to decline, it will make hydrogen more competitive because much of its cost is based on electricity prices. Where seasonal power demand variations occur, it can play a critical role in seasonal storage.

In fact, hydrogen production and storage could help utilities to hedge against low power prices in Europe, where renewable energy has exposed them to very low and even negative prices.

Carrots and sticks for domestic markets

For MENA countries, the prospects for large-scale green hydrogen exports look increasingly unlikely in the near future. Yet countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already invested a lot and risk stranded assets. The question is critical for Saudi Arabia, where the biggest electrolyser production in the world will launch at NEOM next year, and this hydrogen will need to find 100% offtake for 600 tonnes per day produced.

“To have it all go out on ships is very ambitious,” said Jan Haizmann. “They will have to think about what to do with the remainder, as export opportunities may not be realized.”

The countries are already large consumers of hydrogen in their refining and chemicals industries. They have green hydrogen targets in place and plan to develop domestic demand for green and blue (with carbon capture) hydrogen.

""Countries in the region need to build their own internal markets with clear rules and binding targets that drive demand,"" said Haizmann. And he emphasized that they will likely need incentives to create demand.

They will need ‘carrots and sticks’, including binding targets that compel companies to procure certain volumes of low carbon fuels for their operations or face penalties, because a purely voluntary system that mostly relies on export scenarios is unlikely to work.

As an example, he pointed to the incentives that, over time, supported the rise of renewable energy systems in many regions.

“With every new technology, there is a need to incentivize it to get to high volumes, and when high volumes are achieved, then prices come down,” he said.

“The production opportunities for hydrogen in MENA are fantastic, almost unrivalled, because of the sunshine here,” he said. “But it doesn’t remove the need to do something to realize the opportunities.”

The development of the list in 2022 formed part of an anti-ESG movement in Republican states, which has gained further momentum since the election of President Trump, with Texas consistently at the forefront.
In a statement provided to ESG Today, a BlackRock spokesperson said: “We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter.
BlackRock is proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state.

The development of the list in 2022 formed part of an anti-ESG movement in Republican states, which has gained further momentum since the election of President Trump, with Texas consistently at the forefront. Texas is the largest net energy supplier in the U.S., providing nearly a quarter of the country’s domestically produced energy, and accounting for over 40% of the nation’s crude oil proved reserves and production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Under Texas law, the Comptroller is required to maintain and update a “list of financial companies that boy energy companies,” with the law giving companies given 90 days to “cease boycotting energy companies in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by state governmental entities.”

BlackRock was one of the investment companies first included on the list when it was launched by the Comptroller’s office in 2022. While Hegar welcomed changes made by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list and noted that “it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift,” each of the other investment companies included on the initial 2022 list remain on the updated list, expect for Credit Suisse, which has been acquired by UBS – which is also on the updated list.

In a statement announcing the removal of BlackRock from the list, Hegar said:

“This is a meaningful victory and validates the leadership Texas has shown on this issue, which has seen a monumental shift in the way companies, governments and individual Americans view the energy sector.”

The Comptroller’s office listed a series of moves by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list, including the investment manager’s decision to exit the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative and to reduce its participation in Climate Action 100+, as well as reducing the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas. Hegar added that BlackRock “shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future.”

15 companies remain on the Comptroller’s list, including AMP, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Danske Bank, HSBC, Impax Asset Management, Jupiter Fund Management, NatWest, Nordea Bank, Rathbones, Schroders, Societe Generale, Svenska Handelsbanken, Swedbank and UBS, in addition to hundreds of individual funds.

The stewardship report, published on 4 June, detailed LGPS Central’s manager engagement, with the pension pool marking engagement disclosure through a rating process. If the level of engagement disclosure was unsatisfactory, or where the link between an engagement and subsequent investment decision-making was unclear, fund managers were marked down through a rating review.

According to the report, in quarter two of 2024, LGPS Central took the decision to downgrade one of its fixed income managers from “yellow” to “amber”. The report cited that the downgrade reflected long-term concerns that the manager, despite being able to discuss ESG risks associated with its holdings, was not integrating these factors into its decision-making process.

“This was evidenced by the presence of several investments with high exposure to ESG risk coupled with limited efforts to mitigate that risk through stewardship,” the report said.

According to a company statement released on June 4, the facility in Durazno, Uruguay, is expected to produce over 350,000 gallons of ASTM-certified SAF annually and serve as a replicable model for scalable and cost-efficient clean fuel.

The facility will operate using Syzygy's proprietary NovaSAF platform, which combines renewable biogas and carbon dioxide with clean electricity to produce drop-in aviation fuel.

The plant's feedstock, derived from cow manure and captured CO2, will be supplied through long-term agreements with Estancias del Lago, one of Uruguay's largest dairy and agri-energy operations.

With Uruguay's nearly 100% renewable power grid, NovaSAF 1 aims to deliver ultra-low carbon intensity fuel with over 80% emissions reduction compared to conventional Jet-A.

""This is more than just a SAF plant, it's a new model for biogas economics,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""We're turning waste into value by converting underutilized biogas sources into high-value clean fuel hubs without relying on pipelines, gas separation, or subsidies. NovaSAF™ is one of the few pathways that can offer Jet-A parity pricing while meaningfully decarbonizing aviation.""

Syzygy's electrified approach - distinct from conventional SAF pathways like HEFA or ATJ - allows the direct use of raw biogas without costly pre-processing.

The design is modular and scalable, making it ideal for replication in other biogas-rich regions such as dairy farms, landfills and wastewater treatment plants.

According to the company, the NovaSAF 1 facility will have more than 50% higher SAF yield than traditional biogas reforming methods by utilizing both methane and CO2 as feedstocks.

""We're proud to support Syzygy in delivering the world's first profitable biogas-to-SAF plant,"" said Tom Bullard, EVP Operations, The Americas at Kent, the engineering partner leading FEED. ""This project highlights our capability to deliver groundbreaking clean energy infrastructure at scale.""

The facility is expected to reach the final investment decision by the fourth quarter and begin commercial operations by Q1 2027. SAF produced at the site will comply with international aviation sustainability standards, including those set by EU RFNBO, US federal programs and CORSIA.

Biogas-based SAF

Syzygy's NovaSAF project builds on the company's recent breakthrough: the world's largest all-electric GHG e-Reforming™ demonstration unit, which successfully completed over 3,000 hours of trials in Houston, Texas and Ulsan, South Korea.

The unit uses Syzygy's Rigel Reactor to reform raw biogas into syngas without combustion, setting a new benchmark for efficiency in SAF production.

Traditional SAF pathways require either costly renewable natural gas upgrades or high market prices supported by subsidies to remain viable.

Syzygy's process bypasses these hurdles by processing biogas directly from anaerobic digesters or landfills with minimal preparation, eliminating the need for CO2 separation or pipeline infrastructure.

""This demonstration plant achieves our first major step in expanding SAF production and transforming energy,"" said Best. ""We'll continue refining the system in Houston while advancing new commercial projects globally.""

Olivia Palamountain reports

As the aviation industry scrambles for solutions to its environmental challenge, European and Asian carriers are embracing aircraft modifications inspired by shark skin.

Vueling has become the first European airline to partner with Australian technology company MicroTau to explore its ""shark skin"" Riblet Modification Package, while All Nippon Airways (ANA) has expanded its use of similar AeroSHARK technology to passenger aircraft. This makes it the first airline worldwide to operate the system on both cargo and passenger Boeing 777s.

The technology mimics the microscopic texture of shark skin, which appears smooth but is actually covered in tiny grooves called riblets that help reduce drag as the animal moves through water.

Applied as a film to aircraft exteriors, these riblets can improve fuel efficiency by up to 4% according to MicroTau, whilst ANA has verified approximately 1% savings with the AeroSHARK system developed by Lufthansa Technik and BASF.

""The possibility of implementing MicroTau's cutting-edge technology across our aircraft once it is certified will mark an important milestone in Vueling's journey toward sustainable aviation,"" says Franc Sanmartí, director of sustainability at Vueling.

ANA, which began operating a Boeing 777 Freighter with the technology in September 2024, has now launched commercial operations of its first passenger aircraft equipped with AeroSHARK. The airline plans to expand the technology across other aircraft of the same type.

The riblet modifications require no structural changes to aircraft and can be retrofitted to existing fleets. Lufthansa Technik currently holds certifications for AeroSHARK modifications on various Boeing 777 types, with approximately 28 long-haul aircraft already operating with the technology worldwide.

by Rajesh Kumar Singh, Shivansh Tiwary and Tim Hepher (Reuters) Airlines face challenges with affordable greener fuel supplies; IATA estimates $4.7 trillion cost for net zero by 2050

Global airlines wrapped up a two-day summit on Tuesday (June 3, 2025) sticking to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but voicing fresh worries about the availability of greener fuels and new planes.

The International Air Transport Association, which represents about 350 airlines, said hitting the target would cost carriers $4.7 trillion, or $174 billion a year - at least some of which is likely to be passed on as higher fares.

...

On Tuesday, (IATA Director General Willie) Walsh said there had been no talk of any delay in the target at this week's annual meeting in New Delhi.

The industry's sustainability efforts are largely centred around plant-based sustainable aviation fuels. But with current supplies covering just a fraction of airlines' fuel needs, carriers urged governments and energy firms to do more.

""The oil companies are obviously not producing (enough) SAF,"" said IATA's Chief Economist Marie Owens Thomsen.

The energy industry insists enough SAF is available in Europe for the time being after a spate of investments, with some executives and analysts saying markets are oversupplied.

""Contrary to what some are saying we believe we have an oversupply situation currently in the SAF market,"" Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Renewable Products Commercial, at SAF producer Neste (NESTE.HE), opens new tab told Reuters.

Nyberg said he believed the issue was more to do with price, as the cost of ingredients for SAF means it is currently around three times more expensive than fossil jet fuel.

But Walsh said many airlines around the world were unable to procure SAF without importing it over large distances, which would defeat the aim of reducing emissions.

...

Airlines see higher profits in 2025, cushioned from the worst effects of global trade tensions by falling prices of traditional jet fuel.

Rob McLeod, head of energy risk solutions at Hartree Partners, urged airlines to use the savings from fuel costs to invest more in SAF to help address concerns over funding the transition.

Abstract

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will play a critical role in decarbonizing the aviation industry. Among SAF production pathways, alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) stands out for its scalability, supported by abundant feedstock availability and a well-established bioethanol industry. However, significant reductions in SAF carbon intensity (CI) require the use of future feedstocks (e.g., cellulosic) whose adoption is hindered by high capital costs for feedstock processing and ethanol upgrading. Here, we evaluate the financial viability and carbon intensity implications of integrating cellulosic SAF production with petroleum-derived jet fuel production through co-processing and the ATJ pathway. Three levels of integration are evaluated: (i) standalone as a benchmark, (ii) co-located, and (iii) repurposing. Results show the CI of miscanthus-derived SAF demonstrates an 83.8% [76.2 to 100%] reduction relative to jet fuel. Meanwhile, co-processing, when sharing outside battery limit (OSBL) units and process units, brings down the capital cost for SAF production by 46.3% and results in a lower minimum fuel selling price (MSP) of 6.46 USD·gal-1 [5.80 to 7.62 USD·gal-1] including the opportunity cost from intervention to the petroleum refinery. Global sensitivity analyses reveal MSP is negatively correlated with the co-processing ratio. Overall, this work provides insights into the potential of SAF co-processing in advancing the transition to low-carbon aviation future.

Plans for the now shelved biorefinery were first revealed by UPM at the start of 2021.
UPM’s alternative strategies for biofuels production Dialer said that the company was currently evaluating options to debottleneck and increase output at its 44 million-gallon-per-year Lappeenranta biofuels plant – the company’s sole biofuel – producing facility, located next to the UPM Kaukas pulp and paper mill.
Broader challenges for biofuels investments in Europe UPM is one of several biofuels producers that have either paused or cancelled plans to develop new facilities in Europe, while many plants have also closed in the past couple of years.
In July, the company cited project delivery challenges and its need to ensure future competitiveness amid current market conditions as the reasons for its decision.","The announcement comes amid wider reports of general market uncertainty in the European biodiesel space, as producers struggle to operate profitably against a backdrop of consistently high feedstock prices.

“The complexity of a multi-feedstock greenfield investment leading to comparatively high capital (CAPEX) and operating (OPEX) costs, combined with a market that demands competitive production economics, would compromise the long-term business case and expected returns,” a UPM spokesperson told Fastmarkets on Tuesday.

Background and delays in UPM’s biofuels refinery plan

As previously reported by Fastmarkets, the proposed 500,000-tonne-per-year biofuels refinery, which would use advanced feedstocks, was earmarked to be one of Europe’s biggest biorefineries, with the capability to produce advanced biofuels as well as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Despite the announcement, UPM remains “committed to the biofuels business and believe[s] that biofuels markets will provide lucrative business options for UPM,” Harald Dialer, executive vice president of the company’s Biorefining and Technology arm, said.

But the executive added that any future investment “will have to perform against long-term profitability and pay-back expectations” and confirmed that UPM does not currently have any firm plans for “growth investments”.

Plans for the now shelved biorefinery were first revealed by UPM at the start of 2021. But, in 2022, the company indicated that the final investment decision for the facility would likely be delayed until the following year. This was then subsequently pushed back to 2026, after the company was expecting to complete its testing and evaluation of the project.

UPM’s alternative strategies for biofuels production

Dialer said that the company was currently evaluating options to debottleneck and increase output at its 44 million-gallon-per-year Lappeenranta biofuels plant – the company’s sole biofuel – producing facility, located next to the UPM Kaukas pulp and paper mill.

“We don’t foresee one major investment, but a series of gradual optimization steps over time,” Dialer said, adding that UPM is confident that it can increase production capacity onsite.

Broader challenges for biofuels investments in Europe

UPM is one of several biofuels producers that have either paused or cancelled plans to develop new facilities in Europe, while many plants have also closed in the past couple of years.

In 2024, Shell announced a temporary pause of the on-site construction of its 820,000-tonne-per-year biofuels plant also in the Netherlands at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam.

In July, the company cited project delivery challenges and its need to ensure future competitiveness amid current market conditions as the reasons for its decision.

Next, Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, is blaming governments and fuel producers for aviation’s slow process in reaching its climate goals, writes Climate Reporter Darin Graham.

Walsh said the European Union, in particular, has failed to provide the support needed to increase the production of sustainable aviation fuel. Walsh added that companies such as BP and Shell have cut back or delayed their investments in green fuel. The European Union’s current policy requires airlines to use at least 2% sustainable aviation fuel in their fuel mix by 2030.

Fuels Europe said producers have rapidly scaled SAF output and lowered costs.

Finally, Starwood Hotels founder Barry Sternlicht says established hotel chains are facing growing pressure from independent brands, reports Senior Hospitality Editor Sean O’Neill.

Sternlicht, who sold Starwood to Marriott for 13 billion dollars in 2015, said newer brands are much easier to launch via social media. Sternlicht added that successful hotel brands must differentiate themselves and that hospitality remains fundamentally about service quality.

Sternlicht has officially rebranded his latest hotel management company as Starwood Hotels, reviving the name of the company he founded in 1991.

According to Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA), the collaboration aims to accurately determine the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of SAF produced from Indian sugarcane feedstock via the Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) pathway.

""The success of the Government of India's Ethanol Blending Programme has proven the sugar industry's ability to deliver climate impact at scale while supporting rural livelihoods. SAF is the next big step -- where India can lead as Asia's foremost supplier,"" ISMA Director General Deepak Ballani said.

The partnership is key to unlocking new markets, creating green jobs, and driving a just, science-led energy transition, he said.

With the immense potential of India's sugar industry to produce the world's lowest carbon intensity SAF through the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway, India is well-positioned to emerge as a regional hub for SAF production.

Overall estimates indicate a production potential of 19-24 million tonnes annually, underscoring the need for swift, on-ground implementation through stakeholder-driven partnerships like this, industry body said.

With India targeting a 1 per cent SAF blending mandate by 2027, increasing up to 5 per cent by 2030 under CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), this partnership underscores a shared commitment to sustainability and the reduction of aviation emissions -- an area widely acknowledged as among the most challenging to decarbonise, it said.

""However, the absence of an officially accepted carbon intensity value for the Indian sugarcane-to-SAF conversion process via alcohol to jet pathway presents a significant barrier -- limiting the eligibility of Indian biomass feedstock under CORSIA,"" it noted.

Both frameworks play critical roles in addressing aviation’s carbon emissions but operate at different levels: the EU-ETS targets emissions within the European Union, while CORSIA aims to manage global emissions from international aviation. There remains much uncertainty surrounding the compatibility of these two carbon pricing mechanisms.

Our report analyzes the potential synergies and challenges of these two mechanisms for decarbonizing aviation, considering their effectiveness in reducing emissions, their geographical scope, and their impact on the industry. By exploring their alignment and potential conflicts, this report provides insight into how these systems can work together to achieve meaningful decarbonization in the aviation sector.

Post-pandemic, carbon emissions in aviation have rebounded, nearing pre-crisis levels. Despite efforts to prevent a further decline, emissions from international flights continue to grow. However, there exist effective tools that can curb both short- and long-term carbon impacts in the sector.

EU ETS: Pricing carbon to drive sustainable aviation

The EU-ETS is a market-based mechanism that places a price on carbon emissions. Aviation was incorporated into the EU-ETS in 2012, meaning airlines operating within the EU are required to buy allowances for their carbon emissions. The system works by capping the total number of emissions and allowing airlines to buy and sell allowances, thus incentivizing them to reduce emissions cost-effectively. Over time, the cap is reduced, driving down emissions and decarbonizing aviation.

CORSIA: Offsetting carbon on a global scale

Carbon offset programs are an effective way to impact aviation now, not later. CORSIA, adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is a global framework aimed at limiting the growth of carbon emissions from international aviation to 2019 levels. It requires airlines to offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from verified projects that reduce or remove carbon from the atmosphere. CORSIA started with a pilot phase in 2021 and is expected to ramp up over time.

Our Capgemini Invent report examines the efficiency and compatibility of these two carbon-pricing mechanisms. We believe they offer the sector substantial gains while decarbonizing aviation. But it is important to understand the different levels at which the two schemes operate, which disparities exist, and where the two overlap.

Numerous smaller organizations would also be affected by the elimination of the clean energy tax credits.
“Schools, churches, nonprofits, municipalities, libraries, and others will lose access to affordable, reliable clean energy options,” says Angermeier.
In addition to the Democratic caucus, several Republican senators have raised issues with the OBBBA, which include the full-scale elimination of clean energy tax credits.
“Local voices can still make a difference and ask their senators to stand up for these critical investments in clean energy.” Virginia Sens.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 includes provisions that could jeopardize billions of dollars in Virginia green energy projects.

Charlottesville-headquartered Southern Environmental Law Center reports federal agencies have put more than $5 billion into 350 clean energy projects in the commonwealth since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. The private sector has also made significant investments in clean energy efforts, with $2.3 billion supporting 99,614 jobs in Virginia.

That investment was bolstered, at least in part, by clean energy tax credits that are now on the chopping block in the sweeping plan that has moved to the U.S. Senate. Notable credits terminated or phased out by the House version of the bill include the advanced manufacturing production credit, clean fuel production credit, and clean electricity production and investment credits.

Each credit significantly cuts costs for investors in clean energy, with the advanced manufacturing production credit applicable to components used for solar energy, wind energy, inverters, electrode active materials, specific battery components, and some critical minerals. The clean fuel production credit, which went into effect at the beginning of 2025, incentivizes the domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel and other fuels as determined by emissions factors.

“The effective repeal of these clean energy tax credits will hamstring clean energy progress, innovation, and job growth that we’re seeing in the South,” said SELC Senior Legislative Associate Bonnie Angermeier at a May 20 media briefing. “Energy developers, municipalities, and communities have been depending on these credits to move their projects forward, and the effective repeal of the credits will create business uncertainty and halt that clean energy progress.”

If passed as-is, the bill could have long-term impacts on Virginia’s economy and drive up costs for consumers, according to Angermeier.

“From a business standpoint, the bill creates severe uncertainty in clean energy markets, increases costs for utility-scale solar and wind projects, and makes projects unworkable,” she says, adding that the bill “will halt forward-looking progress in Virginia in its tracks. If this bill becomes law, Charlottesville-area residents will likely see increases to their utility bills, and job losses in their communities when projects are shuttered.”

The nonprofit is tracking potential impacts to projects across the commonwealth, including the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project from Dominion Energy, Charlottesville’s primary energy provider.

Upon its anticipated completion in 2026, the project is slated to be “the largest commercial offshore wind project and able to power over 600,000 homes.” However, funding for expansions and related projects has come into question.

Numerous smaller organizations would also be affected by the elimination of the clean energy tax credits. “Schools, churches, nonprofits, municipalities, libraries, and others will lose access to affordable, reliable clean energy options,” says Angermeier. “For instance, the historic Wesley Union [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion Church plans to continue using the tax credits to add energy storage, but this will be made extremely difficult, if not impossible, by this bill.”

The Charlottesville First United Methodist Church filed for a refund through the same program earlier this spring, according to the Virginia Independent. Solar panels were installed on top of the church in August 2024.

While the current version of the legislation is expected to be dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate, it is unclear if language slashing clean energy investments and tax credits will make it into the final version of the bill. In addition to the Democratic caucus, several Republican senators have raised issues with the OBBBA, which include the full-scale elimination of clean energy tax credits.

To pass the Senate, the legislation will need support from at least 50 of 53 Republican senators if all Democratically aligned members vote against the bill.

In an April 9 letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican Sens. Lisa Murkow­ski, John Curtis, Thom Tillis, and Jerry Moran all expressed support for energy tax credits. In addition to the four Republican senators in favor of keeping the tax credits, others have voiced concern about changes to Medicaid, food stamps, and the debt ceiling.

“Even though the bill passed the House, it’s not too late for Virginians to weigh in. As this moves to the Senate, they should be very concerned about how this bill will affect energy bills and hurt the local economy and jobs,” says Angermeier. “Local voices can still make a difference and ask their senators to stand up for these critical investments in clean energy.”

Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner publicly criticized Republican efforts to rollback clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act in a May 20 statement, voicing concern about the long-term effect on Virginia’s economy. “Rolling back these investments would not only endanger these jobs but also hinder our progress toward a more sustainable and affordable energy future,” said Kaine and Warner. “We must protect the investments that are creating jobs and lowering costs for Virginians. The Republican plan puts our economic future at risk.”

The Senate debate over the legislation was ongoing at press time.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions.
Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said: “While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs.
CORSIA was launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016 to address carbon emissions from international flights.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels. Although SAF usage needs to vastly increase, the growing cost to airlines is proving to be an obstacle, according to the IATA.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said:

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

Both the EU and UK’s SAF-focused mandates went live on 1 January. In Europe, this resulted in the cost of SAFs doubling, due to the associated compliance fees implemented by SAF producers and suppliers.

For the expected one million tonnes of SAF purchases required to meet European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion, with compliance costs estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices, according to the IATA.

Walsh continued:

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”

The IATA has urged governments to create more effective policies that support clean energy production – like SAFs – while decreasing support for fossil fuels, while also ensuring the success of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by making Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines.

CORSIA was launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016 to address carbon emissions from international flights.

To support the global development of SAF, the IATA previously launched a SAF registry, which is managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO). It introduced a more transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in line with existing regulations, such as the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS).

In addition, the IATA’s SAF Matchmaker aims to facilitate SAF procurement by aligning airline SAF requests with suppliers.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 05:56:15.885686
