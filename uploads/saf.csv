Climate technology start-up Aether Fuels and Aster on November 11 signed a cooperation agreement to develop the Project Beacon facility which is expected to produce up to 50 barrels a day – or 2,000 tonnes of fuel annually – when completed in 2028.

It will be located at Aster’s refining hub on Pulau Bukom, which the chemical, energy and infrastructure solutions company took over from Shell in April.

Sustainable aviation fuel is jet fuel made from renewable or waste-based sources that produce lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil jet fuel.

Finnish energy giant Neste operates a refinery in Tuas South that can produce up to one million tonnes of such fuel from waste materials like used cooking oil and animal fats annually.

Aether Fuels’ technology uses industrial waste gases and biomethane to produce the fuel, which achieves a more than 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional jet fuel, according to the company. This approach is not as readily available as the technology used by Neste.

With aviation responsible for a significant portion of global carbon emissions—approximately 2.5%—the pressure to find viable alternatives to traditional jet fuel has never been more urgent. As global air travel demand is projected to double by 2040, the study emphasizes that adopting sustainable aviation fuels could be pivotal in mitigating the aviation sector’s environmental impact.

The research, conducted by a team of experts from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment, proposes that sustainable aviation fuel derived from municipal solid waste could cut greenhouse gas emissions by an impressive 80-90%. This reduction is in stark contrast to the conventional jet fuels that dominate the market today. The study presents a compelling case for this transformative fuel source, focusing on the industrial processes of gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis as methods to convert everyday waste materials into a viable jet fuel alternative.

Municipal solid waste comprises a myriad of elements, including organic matter, plastics, and metals. Traditionally, this waste has faced disposal challenges, often ending up in landfills or incineration facilities that contribute to various environmental issues, including land degradation and air pollution. As urban areas grapple with shrinking landfill spaces and increasing waste generation, the transition to converting waste into liquid fuels represents a dual opportunity: creating cleaner energy solutions while addressing waste management crises.

The life cycle analysis conducted by the researchers utilizes real-world data pertaining to the gasification processes. Their findings indicate that the conversion of municipal solid waste not only lowers greenhouse gas emissions dramatically but also reveals the complexities associated with the efficiency of the gasification technology. Despite the significant positive outcomes, they found that only about one-third of the input carbon could be effectively converted into usable jet fuel due to inherent challenges in gas composition. However, the study also points toward potential enhancements in efficiency, suggesting that the integration of carbon capture technologies or the inclusion of green hydrogen could significantly improve output.

One of the most notable aspects of this research is its global implications. The United States has already outlined ambitious goals, aiming for the production of up to 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels annually by 2050. This initiative will be propelled by strong financial incentives designed to encourage industry participation and innovation. Similarly, the European Union is set to enforce regulations requiring departing flights to progressively incorporate an increasing share of sustainable aviation fuels, starting from 2% in 2025 and escalating to an astonishing 70% by 2050.

The researchers evaluated various scenarios to understand how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. In the most promising scenario, the global accumulation of municipal solid waste could yield up to 50 million tons (approximately 62 billion liters) of jet fuel, significantly slashing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. However, they caution that erratic waste management practices could reduce these projected benefits substantially. Conversely, should efficient waste processing and conversion be implemented, particularly with green hydrogen integration, the potential production could skyrocket to 80 million tons annually, enough to meet 28% of global jet fuel requirements and curtail emissions by an impressive 270 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.

From an economic standpoint, this research underscores the tangible benefits that airlines could experience by shifting toward municipal solid waste-derived jet fuels. With various carbon pricing policies such as the CORSIA program implemented by the International Civil Aviation Organization, airlines would stand to save substantially under these initiatives, especially when considering government support and subsidies aimed at fostering a more sustainable aviation sector.

As the industry faces pressure to innovate and reduce emissions, the findings of this study provide a roadmap for future developments in sustainable aviation fuels. The lead author of the study, Michael B. McElroy, a distinguished environmental studies professor at Harvard, emphasizes the necessity of collaboration among stakeholders. From governments to fuel producers, airlines, and aircraft manufacturers, a synergistic approach will be crucial to scaling production and ultimately decreasing costs.

Designed to initiate discussions on sustainable aviation fuel production methods, this research also calls for increased awareness of waste’s potential as a resource rather than a liability. By reimagining municipal solid waste, this transformative approach sets the stage for an aviation sector that is not just cleaner but also more economically sustainable. It raises a critical question about how society views waste—which is often regarded as a problem— suggesting instead that it could be re-envisioned as a valuable asset in the fight against climate change.

Furthermore, this study highlights the broader social and environmental implications of utilizing municipal solid waste. It positions cleaner jet fuel production within the context of global environmental goals, such as achieving zero waste in urban areas, conserving land, and generating cleaner energy sources. With the effects of climate change already apparent, catalyzing investment in this research domain could encourage a much-needed realignment of how societies manage waste and energy.

In conclusion, as the aviation industry navigates the complex requirements of sustainability amidst rising emissions, the shift towards municipal solid waste-derived sustainable aviation fuels opens up new avenues for environmental stewardship and economic opportunity. The collaboration outlined by researchers may not only unlock the full potential of this innovative fuel pathway but could also inspire a global movement towards rethinking waste management practices.

Increased SAF Use

At Chicago, FedEx will initially receive one million gallons of blended fuel from Air bp, while Miami will see deliveries of about three million gallons from AEG.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, FedEx chief sustainability officer, in a company statement.

Broader U.S. Adoption

The development follows Neste’s recent expansion of its partnership with United Airlines to supply SAF to Houston, Newark, and Washington Dulles airports. The partnership builds on previous deliveries in Chicago and San Francisco.

“Introducing sustainable aviation fuel for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone,” said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley.

U.S. producers including Valero and Montana Renewables have recently increased capacity, while distributor Avfuel has expanded its SAF supply networks to eight locations nationwide. State programs in California, Oregon, Washington, and others provide ongoing incentives as federal grant funding incentivizing the fuel decreases.

SAF adoption faces major hurdles where cost gaps between it and traditional fuels exist. Although funds and legislative measures look to address this issue, it is still a major roadblock, particularly where legislation does not play a strong role in local markets. Shell, for instance, cited the cost gap in its decision to halt work on a major European plant in September.

SAF Funds and Global Legislation

Internationally, several recently formed funds and legislative measures look to accelerate adoption.

A partnership between Breakthrough Energy Ventures, oneworld alliance, and several individual member airlines launched an investment fund initially worth $150 million in September that aims to expedite SAF commercialization.

The numbers bear this out: in 2024, global air traffic, measured in Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK), grew more than 10%(link is external) year-over-year, exceeding the pre-pandemic peak of 2019. So far this year, RPKs are up 5%(link is external), with international flights 7% higher and Asian airlines reporting an increase of almost 10%.

Clearly, the strong relationship between RPK growth and global GDP growth continues to hold, with the former expanding several percentage points faster every year. The COVID-19 pandemic that challenged our industry so brutally a few years ago, now looks like a blip. This gives us confidence in our prognosis that the market for aero engines, our particular business line, is set to double over the next two decades.

We believe this will remain the case despite growing pressure on the aviation sector, which is responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, to decarbonize. Some critics are even calling for an outright reduction in air travel to reduce emissions, such as the Swedish-inspired ‘flygskam’ or ‘flight shame’ movement. The reality, though, is that the most effective way to reduce emissions is for a profitable industry to continue to invest in increasing efficiency as well as into low-carbon technology.

Already, the introduction of geared turbofan engines™, high-pressure ratio core engines and very high-bypass ratio engines has significantly improved fuel efficiency, leading to a double-digit reduction in fuel consumption with each new generation of engines. The next step is to blend sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), produced from used cooking oil and biowaste, with traditional kerosene to power today’s engines. And longer term, the industry is working on electric and hydrogen-fueled propulsion systems, though these will be limited to smaller, short-haul aircraft – at least initially.

Grounded in partnerships

Our task at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aero Engines, Ltd. (MHIAEL) is to contribute to the aviation sector’s growth and sustainability by helping to design and build the most advanced and efficient engines possible. In a business that requires a lot of upfront investment and R&D and then faces operational risks over the many years that an engine flies, the only way to succeed is in partnership.

That is why MHIAEL is much more than a supplier. We are either a risk and revenue sharing partner (RRSP) or an outright joint venture (JV) partner in all of the engine programs in which we participate. In the case of Pratt & Whitney’s PW1100G-JM engine series, which powers the Airbus A320neo family – the world’s most popular narrowbody aircraft – we are part of a JV that includes five companies from the US, Germany and Japan.

Our collaboration with Rolls-Royce, which currently stretches over three Trent engine programs for widebody planes, including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner as well as the A330neo and A350XWB, is structured as a series of RRSPs.

Across these programs, revenues and, indeed, risks are shared in proportion to each partner’s share, with Japan’s three ‘Heavies’ – Kawasaki Heavy Industries, IHI and MHIAEL – often accounting for around a one quarter share. In addition, each company designs and builds a part of the engine.

Our focus is on what I like to think of as the ‘heart of the engine’: the combustors and combustion chamber, where fuel is mixed with high-pressure air and ignited to create the high-temperature exhaust gases that drive the turbine. The fact that we are part of MHI Group, the world’s leading manufacturer of large-scale gas turbines for power stations, is key to our ability to design and build these critical components. And we collaborate actively with colleagues at MHI’s Research & Innovation Center to ensure we retain our technological edge.

A factory on autopilot

Another strength is the heavy investment at MHIAEL’s main locations in Nagoya and Nagasaki, into both component production and our maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities – ensuring the highest standards and, hence, smooth approval from the world’s key aviation regulators.

Our new Nagasaki factory, completed five years ago, where we make the combustion chambers for the PW1100G-JM, is probably the most modern in the entire MHI Group. The 280-meter-long building is filled with machine tools – from high-speed lasers to high-pressure water jets – that can drill a thousand holes into the nickel alloy of a combustor with speed and precision. Each of the more than 50 machines is set up with the correct drill heads and parts by mobile robots that travel up and down the hall on rails.

The human supervisors, meanwhile, use their cellphones to monitor a machine’s operational status, how much of the monthly production target has been achieved and the day’s electricity consumption. They can check real-time raw material prices, order new supplies once the current stock drops below a certain weight, or chat about the most recent race result of their colleague Ryota Kondo, one of Japan’s top marathon runners.

We will continue to invest in and expand our facilities to support the growth we expect MHIAEL to achieve. Our confidence in the future is based not only on the underlying market expansion I have already discussed, but also on the fact that the newer engine programs we are part of – such as the PW1100G-JM – are only now starting to generate spare parts and maintenance revenue. This is the most profitable element of such a program and since such programs can extend for 40 years, our MRO business is set for steady growth.

A third reason to be optimistic is that we have won larger work shares on the more recent engine programs and, based on our technological and service track record, we expect that trend to continue.

China has set an ambitious vision for the future of its aviation industry, aiming to revolutionize air travel with the use of green hydrogen and eco-friendly aviation fuel by 2030. The country’s National Energy Administration (NEA) is focusing on utilizing renewable energy to fuel the production of these sustainable aviation fuels, aiming to transform the aerospace sector into a more eco-conscious and sustainable industry. With aviation’s growing role in carbon emissions globally, China’s strategy is a response to the need for more sustainable solutions in the industry, ensuring its leadership in eco-friendly technologies on the global stage.

The Role of Green Hydrogen in Aviation’s Future

One of the most significant components of the NEA’s five-year plan is the push for green hydrogen. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable electricity through the process of water electrolysis, is a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuels. By splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules, green hydrogen can serve as a low-carbon fuel, powering everything from heavy industries to transport vehicles, and even airplanes. This hydrogen can also be used in the production of green ammonia and green methanol, which are essential for fertilizers and shipping. For aviation, this could mean a sustainable fuel option that reduces the industry’s reliance on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the sector’s carbon reduction goals. The scalability of green hydrogen production makes it a key candidate for meeting the aviation sector’s energy needs in a sustainable manner.

Offshore Wind Energy: Key to Fueling Sustainable Aviation

Offshore wind energy is expected to play a key role in China’s transition to green aviation. The NEA has recommended that coastal regions explore the potential of offshore wind to produce green hydrogen, an emerging technology with the potential to revolutionize both energy production and fuel supply for aviation. By harnessing the abundant wind resources along China’s coastline, the country aims to create a sustainable supply chain for green hydrogen and eco-friendly aviation fuel, thereby reducing the aviation sector’s carbon footprint. This initiative is expected to reduce the industry’s dependency on traditional fuels and significantly decrease carbon emissions, helping China meet its climate goals.

Addressing Energy Surplus with Eco-Friendly Aviation Fuel

As China’s renewable energy capacity grows, the issue of curtailment – where excess wind and solar energy cannot be absorbed by the grid – has become more pressing. To address this, the NEA is working to ensure that surplus energy is directed towards the production of green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. By channeling excess energy into eco-friendly fuel production, China aims to create a more efficient energy system and contribute to the decarbonization of the aviation sector. With excess solar and wind power that often goes unused, China is looking to create a sustainable and efficient energy ecosystem by transforming this surplus into valuable resources for the aviation industry, reducing both waste and emissions.

China’s Position as a Leader in Sustainable Aviation

The NEA’s strategy aligns with global efforts to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and increase the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). By prioritizing green hydrogen and other eco-friendly fuels, China is positioning itself as a leader in the global push for more sustainable air travel. This vision reflects China’s broader decarbonization goals and sets a clear path for the future of aviation, not only within the country but across the globe. As other nations look to reduce aviation emissions, China’s plans serve as an example of how large-scale adoption of green hydrogen and SAFs can support the transition to a carbon-neutral aviation industry. By advancing these technologies, China aims to set the standard for a cleaner, greener aviation future.

The future of renewable energy could lie in a more efficient process that transforms corn into methanol.

Supported by Minnesota Corn, University of Minnesota Professor Paul Dauenhauer is leading a project that aims to make full use of corn’s glucose polymers through inorganic catalysis.

Currently, corn ethanol production yields about three gallons of fuel per bushel. However, traditional fermentation methods consume a third of the glucose in yeast metabolism, releasing CO2 as a byproduct.

Dauenhauer proposes using inorganic catalysts instead, allowing 100 percent conversion of corn glucose into methanol.

“Methanol has a universality to it,” Dauenhauer explained. “Using existing technology you can make methanol into jet fuel. You can also make clean burning diesel fuel, and you can make polyethylene polymers—plastics.”

His team is testing metal catalysts to find the most efficient and cost-effective method for large-scale production. The project aims to boost fuel yields by 50 percent while preserving essential corn coproducts like fiber and oil for livestock feed.

Methanol-based fuels could play a key role in reducing carbon emissions. Dauenhauer highlighted, “The benefit of using dimethyl ether in a diesel engine versus conventional diesel is it burns really cleanly.” The potential for corn-derived methanol to supply the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market is also under study.

The research continues through 2028, focusing on process refinement and assessing the economics of converting ethanol plants into methanol facilities.

Minnesota Corn is funding other ethanol innovation projects, including efforts to run diesel engines on high-ethanol blends and turn ethanol with captured CO2 into sustainable jet fuel. These advances mark a major step toward a cleaner, more flexible bioenergy future.

In a report released Tuesday, global consulting firm Accenture highlighted key findings on the net zero transition. It found that, of the world’s largest companies (G4000), 89% are “connecting decarbonization efforts to business value.” Of these companies, one-third have set net zero targets across Scopes 1, 2, and 3. However, only 16% are on track to meet these targets, representing a minor 4% of G4000’s global emissions. The largest 2,000 companies (G2000) have increased net zero target setting from 27% to 41%. Accenture emphasizes decarbonization as a key differentiator in the global race for competitiveness. The report reads: “Even as the global consensus on net zero becomes more fragmented, decarbonization has moved firmly into the realm of business strategy.” Companies committed to decarbonization and meeting net zero targets should look to ESG solutions for guidance.

Ørsted to become first energy company to reach decarbonization targets

Ørsted has officially reduced its carbon emissions by 98%, making it the first company in the world to reach its 2025 decarbonization target. Additionally, 99% of the energy company’s energy production comes from renewable sources. The company reduced its reliance on fossil fuels by closing coal-fired plants, electrifying its transportation fleet, divesting from oil and gas activities, and investing heavily in offshore wind and other renewables. Ingrid Reumert, Ørsted’s Senior Vice President for Global Stakeholder Relations, said, “Decarbonisation is at the heart of Ørsted. We were founded on a promise to deliver green, affordable, and secure energy to governments around the world, and over the past years, we’ve built 18,5 GW of renewable energy. In parallel, we’ve delivered on our own green transformation.” Companies that wish to follow Ørsted’s path should consider ESG tools to stay on track.

EU and UK to begin carbon market link negotiations

A spokesperson for Denmark stated on Wednesday that EU countries have agreed to begin negotiations with the United Kingdom to link their carbon markets. Beginning January 1, the European Union will impose a carbon border fee on cement, steel, and other imports. The UK government has claimed that the new tariff will cost UK industries around 800 million pounds (over $1 billion) annually. The link is intended to reset relations between the EU and the UK following Brexit. While this link will allow countries on both sides to avoid carbon border tariffs, it is unlikely to go into effect before the EU’s January 1 start date.

China to expand renewable energy use, looking to sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen

China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) aims to use excess wind and solar output to explore new renewable energy projects. In the new five-year plan, China hopes to expand industrial bases for sustainable aviation fuel, green ammonia, green methanol, and green hydrogen. A document outlining the 2026-2030 plan highlights the use of renewable energy, such as offshore wind, to produce green hydrogen and other new energy sources. As industry accounts for around 60% of China’s electricity use, renewables are critical for decarbonization goals. Currently, solar and wind can sometimes generate more electricity than the grid can accept. In an effort to stop this phenomenon, known as curtailment, the government aims to channel this energy into alternative uses.

Co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme, part of the ATI Programme, the Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS) project brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London and Heathrow.

The benefits of SAF for reducing end-to-end CO2 emissions from fuel are well understood, and SAF is expected to play a key role in aviation’s decarbonisation journey. However, in-flight measurements behind aircraft have also shown SAF’s potential to reduce the number of ice crystals in contrails and therefore the potential climate impact of these thin clouds of ice particles that can form behind aircraft.

The amount of SAF currently available is only a small proportion of aviation’s overall fuel requirements. It is typically mixed with conventional fossil fuel, resulting in wide-scale deployment at very low SAF blend ratios. However, SAF use is expected to increase in the UK with the introduction of the SAF mandate which came into force at the start of the year and will see 10% of SAF in the UK fuel in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

Constantly changing weather means different flights cause contrails at different times and locations, yet most of the potential climate impact comes from only a small proportion of flights. This creates an opportunity for smart SAF use targeting those flights expected to form persistent contrails. The QRITOS project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, at one of the world’s busiest airports. It will do this by combining data from British Airways flight trials, advanced modelling and satellite observations to monitor contrail formation following this targeted SAF usage.

The project aims to show that we can prioritise particular flights for SAF, focusing on where it can deliver the greatest environmental benefit and maximise the effectiveness of the current levels of supply.

The Non-CO2 Programme focuses on addressing challenges with reducing non-CO2 emissions from aircraft, as outlined in the ATI’s Non-CO2 Technologies Roadmap. The funding programme is delivered by the Aerospace Technology Institute, Department for Business and Trade (DBT) and Innovate UK, in partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

Industry Minister Chris McDonald said: “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation.

“We’re bolstering our support for the aerospace industry through our modern Industrial Strategy – giving business the confidence it needs to invest in UK advanced manufacturing and delivering on growth as part of our Plan for Change.”

Concluding in April 2027, the two-year project will also enhance forecasting methods, advance understanding and modelling of contrail formation, and develop verification methods based on satellite data.",,N,,2025-11-12 14:56:42.516231

Jet Fuel From City Waste,Kellie Nault,,,,,https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2025/11/next-frontier-clean-flight-jet-fuel-city-waste,"One path forward is sustainable aviation fuel, a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops.
But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.
A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-90% compared with conventional jet fuel.
The study examined how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel under several scenarios.
Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs.","Aviation currently contributes about 2.5% of total global carbon emissions, and with air travel demand expected to double by 2040, cutting those emissions has become a pressing priority. One path forward is sustainable aviation fuel, a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops. But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.

A new study in Nature Sustainability points to a promising breakthrough: using municipal solid waste as a reliable, low-emission, cost-effective feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

Researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment evaluated municipal solid waste-based jet fuel produced through industrial-scale gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-90% compared with conventional jet fuel. The main technical hurdle lies in scaling up gasification systems for widespread use.

“Unlike road transport, which is quickly shifting toward electrification, there’s no silver-bullet solution for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,” said Jingran Zhang, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-China Project who is supported by the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard. “Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today’s engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.”

Municipal solid waste as a feedstock

Municipal solid waste includes organic matter like food scraps and paper as well as plastics and metals. Traditionally, much of this waste has been landfilled or incinerated, which consumes land or can contribute to air pollution. As landfill space shrinks and waste generation rises, converting municipal solid waste into liquid fuels could conserve land, cut emissions, and produce cleaner energy to help cities move toward zero-waste goals.

The Harvard study explores the largely under-researched potential of municipal solid waste-based jet fuel using real-world data on Fischer-Tropsch gasification technology. The researchers analyzed key emission sources, calculated greenhouse gas impacts, and identified ways to boost efficiency. They found that while the process significantly lowers emissions, only about 33% of input carbon is converted into fuel due to gas composition mismatches. Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing.

Global implications

Many countries are ramping up efforts to make aviation more sustainable by adopting cleaner fuels. In the United States, the government aims to produce up to 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels annually by 2050, supported by strong financial incentives. In the European Union, new regulations will require all departing flights to gradually increase their share of sustainable aviation fuels, catapulting from 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050. On a global scale, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA program requires operators to offset emissions growth, which they can do by buying eligible offsets or by using sustainable fuels.

The study examined how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel under several scenarios. In the most practical case, global municipal solid waste could yield around 50 million tons (62 billion liters) of jet fuel globally, cutting aviation’s greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 16%. If waste management and conversion systems are inefficient, the benefits drop substantially. However, if green hydrogen is integrated into the process, production could reach 80 million tons per year, which is enough to supply up to 28% of global jet fuel demand and reduce emissions by as much as 270 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

In Europe, the projected output would already exceed the European Union’s jet fuel-blending targets while remaining compliant with sustainability standards. Economically, the study suggests that adopting municipal solid waste-based jet fuels could save airlines money under carbon pricing systems like CORSIA, particularly when government incentives and subsidies are factored in.

Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs. This underscores the urgent need for strong policy action and financial incentives to scale up supply.",https://seas.harvard.edu/themes/custom/seas/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-12 10:57:08.163913

The band rates for economy passengers are S$1, S$2.80, S$6.40 and S$10.40 (€0.66, €2.42, €5.53 and €8.99).
However, CAAS says: “The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made.” The SAF tax will also be levied on private jets.
Flying from Singapore in your Gulfstream G-IV, for example, will cost you between S$100 (€86) and $1,040 (€899) depending on distance.","Singapore has claimed a world first with the introduction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel levy (SAF) from next year, with rates depending on class of travel and distance flown.

The tax will apply on tickets sold from 1 April 2026 for flights departing from 1 October next year and will affect anyone flying from Singapore. It is designed to fund the amount of SAF needed to meet the 1% target Singapore has set for 2026 and varies on distance travelled.

The amount paid depends on four geographical bands; Band 1 covers southeast Asia and Band 2 most of Asia and Australia plus Papua New Guinea. Band 3 covers Europe, Africa, Central and West Asia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands, while Band 4 is the Americas.

The band rates for economy passengers are S$1, S$2.80, S$6.40 and S$10.40 (€0.66, €2.42, €5.53 and €8.99). The rates are not that punitive and there is good news for those flying in premium economy, as it will be rated the same as economy. Another bonus is that transit passengers are exempt.

However, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) says: “The SAF Levy for Premium Cabin (business and first class) is four times that for the Economy Cabin for the same geographical band,” so this increases the top rate to S$41.60, more than €35.

It could have been worse; as the authority originally estimated the basic levy for a Singapore-London flight at S$16, or €13.83. However, CAAS says: “The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made.”

The SAF tax will also be levied on private jets. Flying from Singapore in your Gulfstream G-IV, for example, will cost you between S$100 (€86) and $1,040 (€899) depending on distance.

CAAS says all revenue will go directly towards the purchase of SAF and environmental measures. Its director-general, Han Kok Juan, adds the levy “provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub”.

He argues: “We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

Singapore has set a 1% SAF target for 2026, with a goal to raise this to 3 to 5% by 2030, so there is a risk the levy may increase in future.

Until now, countries have shied away from imposing green levies, while airlines like Lufthansa have made SAF contributions voluntary.

So, could other countries follow Singapore? Most are aware that anything that makes flying more expensive will not be well-received by voters.

This week, UK Transport Minister Heidi Alexander told a conference that demand for flying “was only going in one direction” and that the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, due to become law next spring, would include safeguards so that “passengers see little-to-no change in the price of a ticket”.

However, Singapore, may have opened the door to making green levies acceptable, particularly if they are not too much of a burden on the average traveller – to begin with, at least.",https://www.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2175448985-1024x767.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:57:38.753748

This industry has come a long way in the past 50-plus years and has seen myriad new technologies and techniques. Some thrived, some survived and others fell away. Alongside DDGS, corn oil became ubiquitous while other promising coproducts and processes didn’t quite get off the ground. But ethanol producers’ appetite for growth has always been healthy.

Starting on page 12, we explore the evolution of dry fractionation. Once drawing the full industry’s attention, the technology hit roadblocks in economic feasibility, as producers faced high costs and low margins. Some of the more promising fractionation technologies, however, set the stage for, or even fully morphed into, new front-end diversification processes that could find a better fit in our modern biorefineries. Tech companies have adapted wet-mill technologies and explored hammer mill alternatives to achieve value-added systems offering flexibility and increased yield.

Diversification can also come without plant expansion. Chippewa Valley Ethanol Co., historically a standout in innovation and process improvements, continues to forge ahead with corn kernel fiber cellulosic ethanol, decarbonization and efficiency upgrades. Some technologies—such as gasification of corn stover to produce syngas blended with natural gas for energy production—have come and gone with evolving markets and energy prices, while others have proven beneficial longer term—such as low energy distillation. Find out more about CVEC’s diversification strategies, starting on page 18.

Technology experts are innovating beyond traditional coproducts such as corn oil and DDGS, forging new paths for advanced food protein, feed additives, new textiles, fibers, biopolymers and commercial-grade pigments and even cosmetics. It’s done through precision fermentation, with one featured modular technology designed to operate alongside an ethanol plant using leftover fermentation yeast to produce microbial proteins and food-grade yeasts.

The deliveries, which started in October, build on FedEx's first major US SAF rollout at Los Angeles International Airport earlier in 2025, the company said Nov. 10.

The move underscores the company's broader push to integrate lower-carbon fuels across its aviation network as it targets sourcing 30% of its fuel from alternative sources by 2030.

""Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,"" Karen Blanks Ellis, FedEx's chief sustainability officer and vice president of environmental affairs, said. ""While supply still lags demand, we're encouraged by early signs of increased global SAF production this year.""

At Chicago O'Hare, FedEx will receive around 1 million gallons of neat SAF blended to at least 30%, supplied by Air bp. FedEx said existing fuel infrastructure and supportive state policies made O'Hare a ""logical next step"" in its alternative fuel strategy.

At Miami International Airport, FedEx began taking delivery of roughly 3 million gallons of blended SAF, also at a minimum 30% blend, supplied by AEG.

At the same time, policy decisions in Washington can increase market access, spur demand and ensure fair competition. This new Market Intel series will examine six priority policy areas - trade, biofuels, whole milk in schools, interstate commerce, transparent input markets and prioritizing U.S.-grown produce - and how each can help strengthen the farm economy and rural communities.

In this article, the first of two exploring opportunities in biofuel markets, we examine permanent year-round E15 authorization. In the next installment, we will turn to the growing sustainable aviation fuel market, biodiesel, tax incentives that support biofuel production and the potential impact of small refinery exemptions on these evolving markets.

Few markets tie together energy security and farm profitability as closely as ethanol. For more than two decades, ethanol has provided a reliable outlet for U.S. corn, strengthened domestic fuel supplies and saved consumers money at the gas pump. Around the world, nations are turning to ethanol to bolster their own energy security, and global consumption has more than doubled since the early 2000s. This continued growth highlights the important role of American-made ethanol in meeting fuel demand.

Ethanol

Ethanol currently uses about 5.6 billion bushels of corn each year, roughly 33% of total U.S. corn production. The standard gasoline blend contains 10% ethanol (E10), and in 2025 the national average blend reached about 10.2%. Some states, including top ethanol producers like Iowa and Minnesota, utilize higher blends such as E15 (15% ethanol) and E85 (85% ethanol) in flexible-fuel vehicles. However, the reach of these blends is limited by regulatory restrictions, particularly the seasonal limitation on E15 sales during the summer months.

E15 Uncertainty Stalls Growth

Each summer, federal limits on fuel volatility restrict the sale of E15 in many parts of the country. The rule stems from the Clean Air Act. In 1978, the EPA waived the requirements for E10 but left E15 subject to tighter standards even though it performs just as cleanly. E15 can reduce harmful tailpipe emissions by roughly 46% compared to non-ethanol gasoline, ethanol burns cleaner and represents a step toward more sustainable fuel consumption. To provide temporary relief, the Environmental Protection Agency has used emergency authority to issue nationwide waivers allowing summer E15 sales. In April 2025, EPA approved such a waiver for the second consecutive year. However, emergency waivers must be reissued each year, creating uncertainty for fuel retailers and consumers. Without a permanent policy, retailers are less likely to invest in E15 infrastructure and marketing.

This uncertainty comes as ethanol demand overall faces broader headwinds. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that motor gasoline use will decline over the next decade, even under optimistic scenarios. National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) finds that if blend rates remain near a 10.5% average, domestic ethanol use could fall from about 14.2 billion gallons in 2025 to 13.1 billion gallons by 2035, roughly 400 million fewer bushels of corn used for ethanol. This reduction reflects the EIA’s forecast for lower U.S. motor gasoline consumption over the next decade, driven by more fuel-efficient vehicles, increased electric-vehicle adoption, and slower growth in overall driving miles.

Year-Round E15 Authorization Would Speed Up Demand

Nationwide, year-round E15 authorization presents the most straightforward path to preserve existing ethanol demand and create new growth. Even a modest increase in the national blend rate could have a measurable impact. According to NCGA, a 1% increase in the average ethanol blend rate would add 1.36 billion gallons of ethanol, equal to about 486 million bushels of corn. A 5% increase, to move from E10 to E15, would translate to 6.8 billion gallons of ethanol, or roughly 2.4 billion bushels of corn a year.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Analysis/MarketIntel/MI-Graphics/_socialwFacebook/249676/MI_2025-E15.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 08:56:17.370264

The two-year project, known as Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), is co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI).
It brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport to study how smarter deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, could reduce the climate impact of contrails.
“At British Airways, we believe sustainable aviation fuel is central to the future of flying,” said Tom Byrne, the airline’s Head of Net Zero and Environment.
“This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation,” he said.","Rolls-Royce is leading a new UK research initiative aimed at finding more effective ways to use sustainable aviation fuel to reduce both carbon and non-carbon emissions, the company stated.

The two-year project, known as Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), is co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). It brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport to study how smarter deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, could reduce the climate impact of contrails.

While SAF is already recognised for its potential to cut carbon emissions compared with fossil jet fuel, studies have shown that it can also reduce the number of ice crystals that form in aircraft contrails. According to Rolls-Royce, fewer and thinner contrails could lessen aviation’s wider climate impact.

Alan Newby, Director of Research and Technology at Rolls-Royce, said “SAF will not only play a vital role in decarbonising aviation, but has also been shown to reduce certain non-CO2 emissions. This project will demonstrate smarter ways of using SAF which could unlock additional value through reducing non-CO2 climate effects as well.”

Because contrails are only formed under specific weather conditions, most of the climate effect is caused by a relatively small number of flights. The QRITOS project aims to determine whether SAF can be prioritised for those flights most likely to produce persistent contrails, using flight trials, atmospheric modelling, and satellite data collected at Heathrow.

Marcin Dutka, Environmental Sustainability Technologist at Rolls-Royce and project manager for QRITOS, said “Measurements have already shown that fuel composition can influence contrail properties. This project aims to demonstrate how contrail climate impact might be reduced by targeting SAF at flights predicted to form persistent contrails.”

British Airways is contributing operational data from its fleet. “At British Airways, we believe sustainable aviation fuel is central to the future of flying,” said Tom Byrne, the airline’s Head of Net Zero and Environment. “Through the QRITOS project, we’re exploring how SAF can go beyond reducing carbon emissions to also help minimise the climate impact of contrails.”

Heathrow Airport is also participating. Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy, said “As SAF continues to scale it is important to take a closer look at how we can use it to deliver the greatest climate benefit. As one of the world’s busiest airports we’re proud to participate in this project to demonstrate how targeted SAF use could help to address non-CO2 emissions.”

The research team at Imperial College London will develop new computational models and satellite imaging tools to monitor contrail formation. Associate Professor Sebastian Eastham said “We will develop and trial advanced computational contrail modelling and satellite image analysis techniques, with the goal of performing both prediction and near real-time assessment of the effectiveness of targeted SAF deployment for contrail warming reduction.”

Industry Minister Chris McDonald described the project as an example of collaboration between government and business. “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation,” he said.

According to the ATI, QRITOS will conclude in April 2027 and aims to improve forecasting methods, advance understanding of contrail formation, and develop new ways to verify environmental outcomes using satellite data.",https://ukdjassets-b4d.kxcdn.com/34bd6acbb37094e43de8c481b94ca2cc_/turbinerollsroyce1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:56:13.097070

“With FedEx flights from Miami heading all over Latin America and the Caribbean every day, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” says Luiz R. Vasconcelos, President, FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and demonstrates to our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal; it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we’re embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and actively contributing to the corporation’s global sustainability strategy.”

Under current fuel standards, neat, or unblended, SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels. However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Through aircraft modernisation and other fuel-saving initiatives, FedEx avoided 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, saving the company $400 million.

By doing so, Singapore is positioning itself as a global leader in eco-friendly aviation.

With the aviation industry being a major contributor to global emissions, this move is part of Singapore’s broader strategy to make air travel more sustainable. While the levy is small, it reflects the country’s commitment to creating a cleaner and more responsible aviation sector, inspiring other global hubs to follow suit.

How the Green Fuel Levy Works

The green fuel levy will be applied as a fixed charge on flight tickets, depending on the class of travel and flight distance. This levy will support the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—a renewable fuel made from sustainable sources like used cooking oil, algae, and waste biomass. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF can cut carbon emissions by up to 80% throughout its lifecycle, making it a vital part of the aviation industry’s path to decarbonization.

Here’s how the levy will break down:

Economy and Premium Economy Passengers: The levy will range from S$1 (around ₹68) for regional flights to S$10.40 (roughly ₹700) for long-haul flights to destinations like the Americas.

Business and First-Class Passengers: These travellers will contribute between S$4 (approximately ₹270) and S$41.60 (about ₹2,800), depending on the distance of their flight and the fuel consumption.

Cargo Flights: For cargo shipments, the levy will be based on weight, ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram (roughly ₹0.68 to ₹10/kg).

While the levy is not a significant increase in travel costs, it plays a key role in financing the transition to a more sustainable aviation future.

Key Dates and What Travellers Need to Know

The green fuel levy will apply to all flights departing Singapore starting in October 2026, but it will be effective for tickets issued from April 1, 2026 onward. Passengers who book their tickets before April 2026 will not be charged the levy, even if their flight departs after the official start date.

Only passengers flying out of Singapore will be affected, while transit passengers passing through Changi Airport without departing will not incur the levy. The charge will appear as a distinct line item on passengers’ tickets, ensuring transparency and clarity.

Singapore’s Commitment to Sustainable Aviation

Singapore’s introduction of the green fuel levy is part of a broader strategy to ensure that the country plays a leading role in the sustainable aviation sector. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set a target for sustainable aviation fuel to comprise 1% of total jet fuel consumption by 2026, with the goal to increase this to 3-5% by 2030.

This levy allows the government to ensure that the cost of adopting SAF is shared fairly by passengers rather than burdening airlines or taxpayers. By placing responsibility for funding sustainable fuel directly on those who benefit from aviation, Singapore is ensuring a model that is both financially sustainable and environmentally responsible.

What It Means for Passengers

For most passengers, the green fuel levy will not drastically affect their overall travel budgets. The levy is designed to be affordable, with charges ranging from ₹68 to ₹700 for economy passengers, depending on the flight length. For business and first-class passengers, the cost will be higher, reflecting the larger environmental impact of longer flights.

Though the levy is modest, it ensures that Singapore’s aviation industry remains a leader in sustainability. The charge will be clearly listed on tickets, making it easy for passengers to understand their contribution to cleaner skies.

A Global Example of Green Aviation

By introducing the green fuel levy, Singapore is setting a global standard for how the aviation industry can reduce its carbon emissions and move towards sustainable fuel alternatives. This levy represents a small but significant step in the country’s efforts to combat climate change while continuing to support the growth of global aviation.

As the first country to formally implement such a levy, Singapore is showing the world that aviation can be both economically viable and environmentally responsible. This initiative could serve as a model for other aviation hubs and governments looking to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

A New Era for Eco-Friendly Aviation

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has introduced the green fuel levy to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel. This is a cleaner alternative made from low-carbon sources such as used cooking oil and waste biomass. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, though it's still far costlier to produce.

To help cover this gap, every passenger departing from Singapore will pay a small, fixed contribution that goes toward SAF purchases. The amount depends on the flight distance and travel class:

Economy/Premium Economy: Between S$1 (around Rs 68) for short regional routes and S$10.40 (around Rs 700) for long-haul flights to destinations like the Americas.

Business/First Class: Between S$4 (around Rs 270) and S$41.60 (around Rs 2,800) for longer, more fuel-intensive journeys.

Cargo Flights: Levies range from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram (around Rs 0.68-Rs 10/kg) depending on distance.

Singapore’s green fuel levy: A step forward but harder work awaits To make low-carbon fuels a lasting part of the energy mix, the country must now focus on building up the supply side Summary: Singapore’s new green fuel levy marks a pivotal step in decarbonising transport. From 2026, all flights departing Singapore must use at least 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), rising to 3–5% by 2030. The levy, managed by CAAS, will fund SAF procurement and help airlines manage higher costs—sending a strong demand-side signal for low-carbon transition. But lasting progress hinges on the supply side. To avoid long-term dependence on imported SAF, Singapore must support local and regional biofuel production, incentivise R&D and innovation, and attract private capital through de-risked financing. Emerging biofuel players face high capital costs, limited economies of scale, and price volatility, yet circular business models—turning waste into fuel and by-products into value—can strengthen both sustainability and profitability. Regionally, ASEAN’s biomass-rich landscape offers a huge opportunity. Singapore can play a convener role, harmonising standards and enabling a cross-border biofuels market—anchoring its position as a trusted hub for sustainable finance, technology, and trade.

Singapore will introduce a fixed levy on all departing flights from 2026 to fund the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel. The measure aims for greener fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in its first year. Former Temasek chief executive Ho Ching defended the move after criticism from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), saying it is reasonable for airlines and passengers to bear the cost of reducing emissions rather than taxpayers. She described the levy as a practical approach for a small country with limited capacity to produce its own green fuel, one that could help stabilise prices and encourage investment in new production.

This policy adjustment could also support rapeseed oil demand, potentially offsetting downward pressure from this year’s larger crop as the market relied more heavily on HVO production, the report said.
Sources indicated this could apply retroactively for two years, potentially disqualifying some small- to medium-sized suppliers from selling to Germany and creating a premium in the German market.
The German policy change came as UCO markets faced additional pressure from increasing Chinese sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, a 24 October Vesper report said.
The removal of double-counting advantages will fundamentally alter the economics of UCOME production versus HVO processing,” Vesper wrote.","The German government had reached an informal agreement to end double-counting for advanced biofuels, including used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME), towards greenhouse gas (GHG) quotas, the 6 November report quoted industry sources as saying.

According to an internal memo from industry association VDB, the energy ministry expects a legal amendment to take effect on 1 January 2026, coinciding with the European Union (EU)’s RED III legislation implementation into German law.

The proposed change would have significant implications for used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME), which could become substantially less relevant in Germany’s biodiesel market, the report said.

Market sources had indicated this shift would likely increase demand for hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), Vesper wrote.

This policy adjustment could also support rapeseed oil demand, potentially offsetting downward pressure from this year’s larger crop as the market relied more heavily on HVO production, the report said.

Germany was also addressing supply chain concerns and the environment ministry had reached an agreement on “protection of trust” provisions, which would allow authorities to cancel certificates generated through fraudulent activity, including false declarations of biofuel imports, Vesper wrote.

Sources indicated this could apply retroactively for two years, potentially disqualifying some small- to medium-sized suppliers from selling to Germany and creating a premium in the German market.

“This possibly means that if this law is introduced, large buyers such as Shell will include clauses in their contracts transferring liability to suppliers for any potential fraud,” one market player was quoted as saying.

The Netherlands is pursuing similar reforms, according to the report.

The Dutch Emissions Authority had confirmed that UCOME would be treated as a fossil fuel if supplied to the maritime sector under the country’s upcoming RED legislation, the report said.

While UCOME would remain eligible for compliance in road transport and inland waterways sectors, bunkering demand for UCOME was expected to decline.

The German policy change came as UCO markets faced additional pressure from increasing Chinese sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, a 24 October Vesper report said.

China had approved three additional biofuel refiners for SAF exports, issuing quotas totalling 788,000-828,000 tonnes/year to Shandong Haike Chemical, Shandong Sanju Bioenergy and Bain Capital-backed EcoCeres, Vesper wrote.

According to a Reuters report, China has increased projected SAF exports to 1.2M tonnes this year, leading to increased competition for UCO feedstock.

European biodiesel producers now faced a strategic decision point, with the elimination of double-counting in Germany removing a significant economic incentive for UCOME production, while growing Asian demand for UCO feedstock had created additional supply constraints, the report said.

“For UCOME producers and biodiesel buyers, the next two months present a critical window to reassess supply strategies before the anticipated German policy implementation. The removal of double-counting advantages will fundamentally alter the economics of UCOME production versus HVO processing,” Vesper wrote.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/EU-Biodiesel-sized_2021-08-18-140551.jpg?mtime=1741101604,N,,2025-11-12 07:57:30.173402

Implications For Malaysian Travellers For Malaysians who often travel through Singapore, especially on long-haul routes, the new levy could mean slightly higher airfares.
Although the levy itself is modest, it may make Singapore flights marginally more expensive compared with similar routes departing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA).
Travellers looking to manage higher airfares can explore credit cards that offer air miles and travel perks to offset travel costs.","Passengers departing from Singapore’s Changi Airport will begin paying a new levy from October 2026 to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said the charge will range from SGD1 to SGD41.60 per passenger, depending on destination and travel class.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April 2026, for flights departing from 1 October that year. The additional fee will appear as a separate line on air tickets, and travellers on longer routes or in higher cabin classes will pay more.

Levy Rates By Destination And Cabin Class

CAAS has divided destinations into four geographical bands. Passengers travelling within Southeast Asia will pay the lowest amount, while those heading to the Americas will pay the highest.

Levy for passengers (SGD)

CAAS said travellers to Bangkok will pay SGD1 (about RM3.20) in economy or SGD4 in business class, while those heading to Tokyo will pay SGD2.80 and SGD11.20 respectively. Flights to London will see levies of SGD6.40 and SGD25.60 , while trips to New York will cost SGD10.40 and SGD41.60 .

These rates are lower than estimates made in 2024, when economy passengers were expected to pay up to SGD16 for long-haul flights. CAAS said prices of SAF have since moderated, allowing for a smaller surcharge.

When the Levy Will Take Effect

The rollout will give airlines and travellers time to prepare. The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore, nor to training, humanitarian, or charitable flights.

Tickets issued before April 2026 will not include the levy, even if travel occurs after October that year. The rates will remain fixed “for a few years” as Singapore targets having 1% of all jet fuel at Changi and Seletar airports derived from sustainable sources.

By 2030, that share is expected to rise to between 3% and 5%, depending on fuel availability and market conditions.

Existing Passenger Fees at Changi

The new SAF levy will be added on top of Singapore’s existing departure charges, which are already scheduled to rise over the next few years.

Existing departing passenger fees (SGD)

This means that by 2026, an economy passenger flying from Singapore to New York will pay a total of SGD75.60 in fees, while a business or first-class passenger will pay SGD106.80.

CAAS said these increases are needed to fund airport expansion projects and to offset rising operational costs such as energy and labour.

Implications For Malaysian Travellers

For Malaysians who often travel through Singapore, especially on long-haul routes, the new levy could mean slightly higher airfares. Many passengers from Johor and Kuala Lumpur use Changi Airport for international flights, particularly to destinations in Europe and North America that may not have direct connections from Malaysian airports.

For example, a traveller flying from Johor Bahru to Changi and onwards to London in economy class would face an additional SGD6.40 levy on top of Singapore’s standard fees. Business-class passengers on the same route would pay SGD25.60 more.

Although the levy itself is modest, it may make Singapore flights marginally more expensive compared with similar routes departing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). Airlines operating connecting flights between Malaysia and Singapore could also adjust their ticket pricing to reflect the higher overall cost.

According to regional aviation analysts, Malaysia may eventually consider adopting comparable measures, as countries face increasing pressure to align with global carbon-reduction targets under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Targeting a 2028 start of operations, the facility is expected to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) and bio-naphtha, according to a joint statement.

Feedstocks will include wastes such as used vegetable oils and animal fats, as well as residues from processed vegetable oils.

""Leveraging the synergy and strength of our partnership, the new biorefinery is one of Petronas’ key initiatives to deliver on our energy transition strategy through a holistic bio-based value chain and an expanded suite of cleaner energy solutions"", said Petronas executive vice president and chief executive for downstream Sazali Hamzah. ""This is in lockstep with Petronas’ larger aspiration to become an integrated energy leader in the next decade, serving the world’s energy needs, safely, reliably and sustainably"".

Euglena founder and president Mitsuru Izumo said, ""This project represents a global endeavor and a powerful step toward decarbonization and a more sustainable future, through enhanced clean energy supply capacity, particularly across the ASEAN region and beyond"".

""In our continued efforts to expand decarbonization solutions in response to climate change, we will continue to invest in research and development of microalgae, and advance our efforts toward the commercialization of algal biofuel"", Izumo added.

Stefano Ballista , chief executive of Eni biofuels arm Enilive, said, ""With Enilive’s biorefineries that are already operational in Italy and in the United States of America, and with new plants under construction in Italy and South Korea, the new biorefinery in Pengerang is a further and relevant step forward towards the achievement of a production capacity over five million tons per year and over two million tons of SAF by 2030, supporting the growing need for more sustainable mobility"".

Italy's state-backed energy major Eni has set goals to grow its biorefining capacity to over three MMtpa by 2028 and more than five MMtpa by 2030, with the potential to produce up to two MMtpa of SAF by 2030.

Eni's current biofuels production come from two Italian plants in Venice and Gela and a United States plant in Louisiana, operated under its 50 percent-owned joint venture St Bernard Renewables LLC, according to the company.

Earlier this year Eni began construction for a biorefinery project with LG Chem at the latter's Daesan Chemical Complex in South Korea.

Targeted for completion 2027, the plant will have an annual bio-feedstock processing capacity of about 400,000 metric tons and produce HVO and SAF, Eni said August 4.

Eni said last month it had launched the authorization process for an Environmental Impact Assessment to build another biorefinery and a chemical recycling plant in Sicily, after receiving approval from Italy's Environment and Energy Security Ministry.

Designed to produce up to 500,000 metric tons per annum of HVO diesel and SAF, the Priolo project will rise on the site of an Eni ethylene plant set to be decommissioned, Eni said in a press release October 9.

Eni said it will be its second biorefinery in Sicily, after the Gela plant, which began biofuel production 2019 after being transformed from a petrochemical site.

The Priolo biorefinery will be fed mainly by vegetable waste and oils and animal fats, Eni said.

On September 23 Eni said it had received approval from the ministry to convert several units at the Sannazzaro de' Burgondi refinery in Pavia into a biorefinery.

The refinery will continue traditional operations alongside a new processing capacity of 550,000 metric tons a year for biofuel feedstock, mainly waste and residues. Expected to start operations 2028, the biorefinery will have the flexibility to produce SAF and HVO diesel.

""The new Sannazzaro biorefinery will strengthen the site's strategic role in supplying traditional jet fuel and SAF to north-west Italian airports, via both the pipeline connection to Milan Malpensa airport and depots connected to the refinery near other airports"", Eni said.

""Through Enilive, Eni is already the second-largest producer of HVO biofuels in Europe, including both diesel and biojet (SAF)"", the company said.

Microsoft believes AI’s capacity to measure, predict and optimise complex systems will be fundamental in developing and scaling climate solutions.

Since 2020, Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund has directed over US$800m of a pledged US$1bn into a portfolio of 67 companies.

While the fund’s scope is broad, its investment direction shows an increasing focus on AI-driven strategies.

Examples include an investment in Vibrant Planet, which uses AI-powered geospatial analytics to help mitigate wildfire risk.

Another is Terradot, a start-up applying AI to enhanced rock weathering, which is a method for carbon removal.

Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) at Microsoft, sees AI as essential for progress despite the energy demands of the technology itself.

“The force creating this distance from our goals in the short term is the same one that will help us build a bigger, faster and more powerful rocket to reach them in the long term: artificial intelligence,” Melanie explains. “This is not hyperbole.”

AI’s role in hard-to-abate sectors

The fund directs capital towards sectors where decarbonisation is a major challenge, including steel and aviation.

Microsoft invested in Stegra’s commercial-scale facility in Sweden, which uses green hydrogen to produce steel with up to 95% fewer emissions than traditional methods.

Microsoft paired this with purchase agreements for steel to be used in its data centre equipment.

In aviation, Microsoft is backing the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The fund has supported Twelve’s carbon transformation technology and LanzaJet’s alcohol-to-jet process.

Microsoft also participated in a book-and-claim accounting model with Alaska Airlines, enabling the reporting of emissions reductions from SAF without requiring its physical delivery for specific flights.

These initiatives create complex systems and supply chains where AI could be used for future optimisation and efficiency gains.

“Through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, we invest in ambitious ideas and scalable technologies that create real impact,” says Brad Smith, Vice Chair (VC) and President of Microsoft.

Financing and scaling new climate models

A portion of the fund is dedicated to catalysing new markets and financing models. According to Microsoft, a financing gap often exists for nascent climate technologies, which can be too large for venture capital but too risky for traditional infrastructure investors.

Microsoft estimates this gap is between US$100m and US$180m per project.

To address this, the fund has committed more than US$100m to “first-of-a-kind” projects. It provided project finance for the Climeworks Orca plant, the first commercial direct air capture facility and supported this with a 10-year offtake agreement for 10,000 tons of CO₂.

In Nigeria, the fund backed Konexa’s development of renewable energy infrastructure for Heineken’s operations, aiming to create a replicable model for the country's power sector.

This strategy, which combines corporate investment with procurement and technology support, has attracted US$12bn in follow-on capital across the fund's portfolio companies, according to a report from Microsoft.

Measuring impact with data

To evaluate the success of its investments, Microsoft has worked with Rhodium Group to develop a framework that assesses both direct emissions reductions and the “catalysed” reductions that occur when new technologies are helped towards cost parity.

For emerging technologies like low-carbon steel, the fund reports that catalysed reductions could substantially exceed direct reductions.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a4df115508ce0c79a6f289138b9ba1ba:f447dc23fa486680c2ac4afd1a22b1ef/brad-smith.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:57:57.075900

""It’s not just about cutting emissions, it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport.""","The European Commission is moving to address the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the aviation and waterborne transport sectors.

Aviation alone produced 882Mt of CO₂ in 2023, according to the Air Transport Action Group.

In response, the Commission has adopted its communication on a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).

This establishes a roadmap to accelerate the energy transition in these critical industries, forming a key part of the EU Competitiveness Compass.

Fuelling the future of transport

The plan is designed to unlock capital and increase the production of renewable and low carbon fuels.

Its targets are aligned with the EU’s ReFuelEU aviation and FuelEU maritime regulations that are central to the energy strategy for transport.

The ReFuelEU aviation regulation promotes a greater uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This could include synthetic aviation fuels, advanced biofuels and recycled carbon aviation fuels to lower CO₂ emissions from air travel.

The FuelEU maritime regulation imposes limits on the yearly average greenhouse gas intensity of energy used by ships more than 5,000 gross tonnes calling at European ports.

To tackle air pollution, it also mandates that from 1st January 2030, passenger and container ships must use onshore power supply or other zero-emission technologies when docked.

Meeting the ambitious targets set by ReFuelEU and FuelEU will require an estimated 20 million tonnes of SAF and investments totalling €100bn (US$115.6bn) by 2035 to facilitate this energy transition.

Unlocking investment for new energy

Providing regulatory certainty is fundamental to attracting the necessary investment.

Through the STIP, the European Commission is signalling to the market that its targets are firm and that it will support the sector throughout this transition.

The plan's EU measures are expected to mobilise at least US$3.1bn by the end of 2027.

This includes several key funding streams:

InvestEU to mobilise at least US$2.1bn for sustainable alternative fuels by 2027

About US$320m via the European Hydrogen Bank to support hydrogen production for SAF and sustainable maritime fuel (SMF) by year-end

Around US$142m for research and innovation projects under Horizon Europe

A projected US$164m for synthetic aviation fuel projects and US$314m for maritime fuel projects through the Innovation Fund

In the medium term, the EU plans to establish an intermediary mechanism to connect fuel producers and buyers.

Singapore is set to impose a new charge for travelers flying out of the country, starting in 2026. The “sustainable aviation fuel levy” (SAFL) will be levied on passengers departing Singapore from 1 October 2026, with tickets for these flights being sold from 1 April 2026. This new charge will apply to all international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport and Seletar Airport, marking a significant step towards making aviation more environmentally friendly.

The levy is part of Singapore’s broader efforts to contribute to global sustainability goals by promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The country has long been a leader in aviation innovation, and this initiative seeks to make air travel cleaner by reducing the industry’s carbon footprint.

What Is the Green Fuel Levy and How Will It Affect Passengers?

The green fuel levy, which will be added to the cost of flight tickets, aims to support the aviation industry’s transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel and is made from renewable sources such as waste products, algae, and plant oils. The goal of the levy is to ensure that more airlines adopt SAF, thereby reducing the carbon emissions produced by air travel.

The new levy will vary depending on the destination and the class of travel. For example, passengers flying to nearby Southeast Asian destinations will pay as little as SGD 1 (approximately USD 0.75) per ticket. In contrast, those traveling to long-haul destinations such as North America will be charged up to SGD 41.60 (approximately USD 30) per ticket. Business and first-class passengers will face higher charges compared to economy passengers, reflecting the larger carbon footprint associated with premium classes.

While the levy is not excessively high, it will contribute to the broader goal of decarbonizing the aviation sector. The funds raised from the levy will be used to accelerate the adoption of SAF in Singapore and fund the development of sustainable aviation technologies. This marks a major step towards aligning the aviation sector with the Singapore government’s sustainability goals.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: A Necessary Step for Greener Aviation

The aviation industry is one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions. As countries around the world work to meet their climate targets, reducing emissions from aviation has become a critical priority. SAF is considered one of the most promising solutions to help reduce the sector’s carbon footprint. SAF has the potential to lower life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

However, SAF is still in its early stages of development, and its production is currently limited. The green fuel levy will help make SAF more financially viable and encourage airlines to adopt this eco-friendly fuel. Singapore’s government has already committed to making its air hub a leader in the global push for greener aviation. As part of this vision, the country aims to meet its goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the aviation sector by 2050.

This levy will also put pressure on other countries to follow suit and consider similar charges or incentives to encourage the use of SAF. As more nations implement policies that encourage the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels, the global aviation industry will move closer to its decarbonization goals.

What Travelers Need to Know About the Levy

For travelers, the introduction of the green fuel levy means that the cost of flying out of Singapore will increase, but by a relatively small amount. The levy will be clearly itemized on the flight ticket, ensuring that passengers are aware of the charge before they book their tickets.

Passengers flying to nearby destinations in Southeast Asia will only see a small increase in their ticket prices, while those traveling to further destinations like the Americas and Europe will pay a larger charge. The levy will apply to both direct flights and connecting flights that depart from Singapore. However, passengers who are merely transiting through Singapore will not be required to pay the levy.

For airlines, this levy will encourage them to make the transition to SAF. The funds generated from the levy will be used to develop more sustainable aviation technologies and make SAF more affordable and accessible. The government has committed to working closely with airlines, fuel producers, and other stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable aviation fuel.

A Step Towards Sustainable Travel

This move by Singapore represents a significant step towards achieving global sustainability in the aviation sector. The sustainable aviation fuel levy will not only help reduce the carbon footprint of air travel but will also encourage innovation in green technologies. It reflects Singapore’s commitment to becoming a leader in sustainable aviation, and the introduction of this levy will likely inspire other countries to consider similar measures.

While the levy may add a small cost to flight tickets, it will play an important role in creating a more sustainable future for aviation. The funds generated will help accelerate the development of SAF and other green technologies, which are essential for the future of air travel.

As the world moves towards a greener future, the introduction of the green fuel levy in Singapore is an important step that demonstrates the country’s leadership in sustainable travel. Travelers can expect a small increase in their ticket prices starting in 2026, but they can also feel good knowing that their contribution is helping the aviation industry move towards a more sustainable future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s2-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:58:17.571953

In a step towards sustainability, Singapore will introduce a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy from 1 April 2026, with the charges applying to flights departing from 1 October 2026. The levy aims to accelerate the adoption of greener jet fuel and reduce aviation emissions, marking a significant move towards the nation’s decarbonisation goals.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) shared in a press statement on 10 November that as longer flights consume more fuel, the SAF levy will be based on the distance travelled. All destinations from Singapore have been grouped into four geographical bands. For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

Here is the breakdown of the SAF levy geographical bands:

Geographical bandRegions & countries ISoutheast AsiaIINortheast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New GuineaIIIAfrica, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands, New ZealandIVAmericas

SAF levy for passengers

The SAF levy will apply on a per-passenger basis, with charges varying by geographic zones, travel distance, and cabin type:

Economy Cabin which includes Economy Class and Premium Economy Class, or

Premium Cabin which includes Business Class and First Class.

Premium Cabin passengers will pay significantly more under the SAF levy — about four times the Economy Cabin within the same travel band, which CAAS said reflects industry standards that account for the higher carbon footprint of premium seating. Airlines will collect the SAF levy and must display it as a as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold.

The SAF levy will only apply to 'Origin-destination passengers' — a passenger who departs from Singapore to another destination — and not those transiting through Singapore.

Geographical bandPassenger SAF levy (per passenger charge)Band I

Economy cabin: S$1.00

Premium cabin: S$4.00Band II Economy cabin: S$2.80

Premium cabin: S$11.20Band III Economy cabin: S$6.40

Premium cabin: S$25.60Band IVEconomy cabin: S$10.40

Premium cabin: S$41.60

CAAS had initially estimated the SAF levy for economy passengers to be around S$3, S$6, and S$16 to Bangkok, Tokyo, and London, respectively. The actual charges, however, are much lower — S$1, S$2.80, and S$6.40 respectively. The difference reflects the current lower cost of sustainable aviation fuel compared to when the original estimates were made.

SAF levy for cargo shipments

For cargo shipments, the SAF levy will be charged per kilogramme and will vary by distance, grouped into four geographical bands.

Certain flights — such as training flights or those for charitable and humanitarian purposes — will be exempt from the SAF levy.

All collected levies will go into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS, dedicated solely to purchasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and/or SAF environmental attributes (EAs), as well as covering related administrative costs.

To ensure transparency and value for money, the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) will oversee the procurement, allocation, and administration of SAF and EAs.

Commenting on the move, Han Kok Juan, Director-General, CAAS said:

""The introduction of the SAF levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub.""

""It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has introduced the green fuel levy to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel. This is a cleaner alternative made from low-carbon sources such as used cooking oil and waste biomass. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, though it's still far costlier to produce.

To help cover this gap, every passenger departing from Singapore will pay a small, fixed contribution that goes toward SAF purchases. The amount depends on the flight distance and travel class:

Economy/Premium Economy: Between S$1 (around Rs 68) for short regional routes and S$10.40 (around Rs 700) for long-haul flights to destinations like the Americas.

Business/First Class: Between S$4 (around Rs 270) and S$41.60 (around Rs 2,800) for longer, more fuel-intensive journeys.

Cargo Flights: Levies range from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram (around Rs 0.68-Rs 10/kg) depending on distance.

The levy officially begins in October 2026, but it applies only to tickets issued from 1 April 2026 onward. Travellers who book their tickets before April 2026 will not be charged the levy, even if their flight departs after implementation. The levy applies only to flights departing from Singapore. Transit passengers merely passing through Changi Airport will not have to pay for it. The fee will appear as a separate line item on air tickets for full transparency.

Why Singapore Is Introducing The Green Fuel Levy

As one of Asia's busiest air hubs, Singapore plays a key role in shaping aviation's future sustainability. The levy supports the country's target for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1% of total jet fuel use by 2026, with plans to increase this to 3-5% by 2030, depending on global supply and cost trends. Rather than burdening airlines or taxpayers, the government is spreading the cost fairly among air travellers who directly benefit from aviation. This ensures that Singapore's path to greener skies remains both financially viable and environmentally responsible.

The policy also offers predictability: airlines know how much to collect, passengers see the charge clearly, and the funds are dedicated solely to sustainable fuel procurement. It's a carefully designed model that other nations are likely to watch closely.

What The Green Fuel Levy Means for Travellers

For most passengers, the levy won't dramatically change travel budgets. However, it does reflect a meaningful shift in how the aviation industry is tackling its carbon challenge. Here's what travellers should keep in mind:

For economy travellers, the additional cost ranges from Rs 68 to about Rs 700, which is negligible compared to the total ticket prices. Business and first-class flyers will pay more, reflecting their larger share of flight emissions.

Tickets bought before 1 April 2026 won't include the levy, even for later travel dates.

The funds directly finance sustainable aviation fuel, helping make air travel more eco-friendly.

By asking travellers to share in the cost of cleaner skies, Singapore is setting a global benchmark for responsible aviation.","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-11/pnq0uvrk_changi-airport_625x300_12_November_25.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738",N,,2025-11-12 07:58:26.190481

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net-zero by 2050. This statistic isn’t just a number—it’s a mandate for transformation that I see reshaping the entire aviation ecosystem. In my work with global energy and transportation leaders, I’ve witnessed the quiet revolution happening behind the scenes. We’re at a pivotal moment where the aviation industry, responsible for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions according to the World Economic Forum, is fundamentally reinventing its energy foundation. The current state reminds me of the early days of renewable energy in other sectors—limited production capacity, high costs, but undeniable momentum building toward an inevitable tipping point. What we’re seeing now is just the beginning of a complete overhaul of how we power flight.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting work with aviation leaders is the massive gap between current SAF production and what’s needed to meet climate targets. As noted by McKinsey & Company, current SAF production accounts for less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption, despite growing demand from airlines and corporate travelers. The reality is that scaling production isn’t just about building more facilities—it’s about creating entirely new supply chains, securing consistent feedstock, and navigating complex regulatory environments across different regions. I’ve sat in boardrooms where executives grapple with the chicken-and-egg problem: without guaranteed demand, investors hesitate to fund large-scale production facilities, but without sufficient supply, airlines can’t commit to meaningful SAF adoption. This creates a systemic bottleneck that requires coordinated action across multiple stakeholders.

Challenge 2: The Cost Competitiveness Conundrum

The economic reality of SAF presents another significant barrier. According to Deloitte research, sustainable aviation fuel currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel, creating a substantial financial hurdle for widespread adoption. In my experience advising airline executives, this cost differential creates a competitive disadvantage for early adopters unless mechanisms are in place to share the burden across the value chain. The Harvard Business Review notes that while corporate sustainability commitments are driving some demand, the premium price of SAF makes it challenging for airlines to absorb these costs without passing them to consumers. What I see happening is a delicate balancing act between environmental responsibility and economic viability—a tension that requires innovative business models and policy support to resolve.

Challenge 3: Technological and Infrastructure Limitations

The third challenge revolves around technological maturity and infrastructure compatibility. As PwC highlights in their energy transition reports, most current SAF production relies on limited feedstock options and conversion technologies that haven’t yet achieved commercial scale. From my perspective as a technology futurist, the infrastructure challenge extends beyond production to distribution and storage. Existing airport fuel systems weren’t designed for widespread SAF integration, and the “drop-in” nature of current SAF formulations—while beneficial for compatibility—limits innovation in next-generation fuel technologies. I’ve seen how this creates a conservative approach to innovation, where the safe bet of incremental improvement often outweighs the potential rewards of breakthrough technologies.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. Leading organizations are implementing several key strategies that I believe will accelerate SAF adoption.

First, strategic partnerships are becoming crucial. I’ve advised companies on forming consortiums that bring together airlines, fuel producers, technology providers, and corporate customers to share risks and rewards. These partnerships, like the one between Microsoft and Alaska Airlines that I’ve studied, create guaranteed demand that enables production scale-up while distributing costs across multiple stakeholders.

Second, technological innovation is rapidly advancing. Companies like LanzaJet are commercializing alcohol-to-jet technology, while others are exploring power-to-liquid pathways that use renewable electricity, water, and CO2 to create synthetic fuels. In my analysis, these second and third-generation technologies will dramatically expand feedstock options and reduce land-use concerns.

Third, policy mechanisms and carbon markets are creating new economic models. As the World Economic Forum reports, blending mandates in regions like Europe and tax incentives in the United States are helping bridge the cost gap while carbon offset programs are generating additional revenue streams for SAF producers.

Fourth, digital platforms are emerging to track, verify, and trade SAF certificates and environmental attributes. I’ve consulted with companies developing blockchain-based systems that provide transparent accounting of emissions reductions—a critical element for corporate sustainability reporting and regulatory compliance.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a picture of rapid transformation. According to BloombergNEF projections, SAF production capacity could grow from less than 0.5 billion liters today to over 30 billion liters by 2030 under optimistic scenarios. The International Energy Agency forecasts that SAF could account for 10% of aviation fuel demand by 2030 in their accelerated case scenario, representing a hundred-fold increase from current levels.

In my foresight exercises with industry leaders, I envision several breakthrough moments in the coming decade. By 2026, I predict we’ll see the first commercial-scale power-to-liquid SAF facility become operational, demonstrating the potential for carbon-neutral aviation fuel. By 2028, I anticipate that SAF will reach cost parity with conventional jet fuel in certain regions due to scaling effects, technological improvements, and carbon pricing mechanisms.

The market size projections are equally compelling. Accenture analysis suggests the global SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million today to over $15 billion by 2030, creating massive opportunities for innovators across the value chain. What excites me most is how this transformation will ripple through adjacent industries, creating new markets for agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and direct air capture technologies.

By 2030, I believe we’ll see regional SAF hubs emerge around major airport clusters, supported by dedicated renewable energy infrastructure and circular economy partnerships. The aviation fuel ecosystem of 2030 will look fundamentally different from today’s linear model, incorporating diverse feedstocks, multiple production pathways, and digital tracking systems that provide unprecedented transparency.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, sustainable aviation fuel will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream energy source that fundamentally reshapes aviation’s environmental footprint. The transformation will be driven by converging forces: regulatory pressure, technological innovation, corporate sustainability commitments, and growing consumer awareness. Airlines that successfully navigate this transition will gain competitive advantages through lower emissions profiles, strengthened brand reputation, and preferential access to increasingly scarce sustainable fuel supplies. The risks of delay are substantial—including regulatory non-compliance, stranded assets in conventional fuel infrastructure, and loss of market share to more agile competitors. The opportunity lies in building resilient, diversified fuel strategies that incorporate multiple SAF pathways and create value beyond mere compliance.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of flight is being rewritten today, not in distant laboratories but in boardrooms, policy forums, and innovation hubs around the world. What we’re witnessing is more than an energy transition—it’s the reinvention of one of humanity’s greatest achievements. As I often tell leaders in my keynotes: “The most sustainable fuel isn’t just what powers the aircraft, but the innovative thinking that powers the transformation.”

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel production reached over 600 million liters in 2023—a 200% increase from 2022, yet still representing less than 0.2% of total aviation fuel consumption. This statistic reveals both the explosive growth and the monumental challenge ahead. In my work advising global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed an industry at a critical inflection point. We’re no longer debating whether SAF will transform aviation—we’re grappling with how quickly and completely this transformation will occur. The World Economic Forum notes that aviation accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon emissions, making SAF adoption not just an environmental imperative but an economic necessity. What fascinates me most is how we’re approaching a threshold where technological innovation, policy alignment, and market forces converge to create unprecedented acceleration. Having consulted with airlines, fuel producers, and government agencies across three continents, I see patterns emerging that suggest we’re on the verge of a breakthrough moment that will redefine air travel as we know it.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Feedstock Scarcity Paradox

The most immediate bottleneck I’m observing across the industry isn’t technology or funding—it’s the fundamental limitation of sustainable feedstock. As noted by McKinsey & Company, current SAF production relies heavily on limited feedstocks like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, creating intense competition for resources that simply cannot scale to meet projected demand. In my consulting work with major European airlines, I’ve seen firsthand how this scarcity drives up costs and creates supply chain vulnerabilities. The Harvard Business Review recently highlighted that feedstock constraints could limit SAF adoption to just 5-10% of total aviation fuel by 2030 unless alternative sources emerge. What’s particularly concerning is how this scarcity creates a ripple effect—when one airline secures a long-term feedstock contract, it immediately disadvantages competitors and slows overall industry progress. I’ve sat in boardrooms where executives acknowledge that their sustainability commitments may be physically impossible to fulfill given current feedstock limitations.

Challenge 2: The Infrastructure Conversion Dilemma

The aviation industry faces a massive infrastructure challenge that many outside observers underestimate. According to Deloitte research, over 90% of existing airport fuel infrastructure requires significant modification to handle high-percentage SAF blends efficiently. Having consulted on fuel logistics projects in Asia and North America, I’ve witnessed how the “drop-in” nature of SAF creates a false sense of compatibility. While SAF can technically replace conventional jet fuel, the reality is more complex. Storage tanks, pipelines, and refueling equipment all need adaptation, and the capital requirements are staggering. PwC estimates that global aviation infrastructure upgrades for SAF compatibility could exceed $150 billion over the next decade. What’s particularly challenging is the coordination problem—airports, fuel suppliers, and airlines must synchronize their investments, creating a classic chicken-and-egg scenario that slows adoption. I’ve advised clients that the infrastructure challenge represents a greater barrier than production capacity itself.

Challenge 3: The Green Premium Economic Model

The economic reality of SAF creates what I call the “green premium paradox.” According to Accenture analysis, SAF currently costs 2-4 times more than conventional jet fuel, creating an unsustainable economic model for widespread adoption. In my work with airline CFOs, I’ve seen how this premium creates tension between sustainability goals and financial viability. The World Economic Forum notes that even with projected efficiency improvements, SAF is unlikely to reach price parity with conventional jet fuel before 2040 without significant policy intervention. What makes this particularly challenging is the competitive dynamics—airlines that aggressively pursue SAF face higher operating costs, potentially putting them at a disadvantage against less sustainable competitors. I’ve observed how this creates a collective action problem where individual rational decisions (minimizing costs) conflict with collective needs (decarbonizing aviation). The current patchwork of subsidies and mandates creates market distortions rather than sustainable economic models.

Solutions and Innovations

The solutions emerging give me tremendous optimism about our ability to overcome these challenges.

First, I’m particularly excited about the advancement of power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies that create synthetic fuels from green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. Major European energy companies are now scaling PtL facilities that could eventually eliminate feedstock constraints entirely. In my consulting work, I’ve helped organizations understand how these technologies create a virtuous cycle—using renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, capturing CO2 from industrial processes or directly from the air, and synthesizing carbon-neutral jet fuel.

Second, modular and distributed production models are revolutionizing SAF infrastructure. Rather than building massive centralized refineries, companies are developing smaller-scale production units that can be located near airports or even integrated into existing refinery infrastructure. I’ve advised several startups pursuing this approach, which dramatically reduces infrastructure conversion costs and creates more resilient supply chains. The World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative highlights how these distributed models could reduce infrastructure investment requirements by 40-60%.

Third, advanced financing mechanisms and offtake agreements are creating more sustainable economic models. Major corporations like Microsoft and Amazon are entering long-term SAF purchase agreements that provide producers with the revenue certainty needed to finance expansion. In my strategic planning sessions with airline executives, I’ve helped structure these agreements to balance cost concerns with sustainability commitments. These innovative financing approaches, combined with emerging carbon pricing mechanisms, are gradually closing the green premium gap.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of technology adoption curves and industry dynamics, I project that SAF will reach 10% of global aviation fuel by 2030 and 30% by 2040. McKinsey estimates the SAF market will grow from approximately $1 billion today to over $30 billion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate of 25%. What excites me most are the technological breakthroughs on the horizon—particularly in synthetic biology and catalytic processes that could dramatically improve conversion efficiency.

My foresight exercises with industry leaders suggest several “what if” scenarios that could accelerate adoption. What if major oil companies reallocate 20% of their conventional refining capacity to SAF production by 2030? What if carbon capture technology advances enable cost-effective atmospheric CO2 harvesting for fuel synthesis? What if electric and hydrogen aircraft begin displacing short-haul routes, freeing up SAF for long-haul flights where alternatives aren’t feasible?

I predict we’ll see the first SAF-powered transatlantic flight by a major carrier within two years, followed by rapid scaling as production increases. By 2030, I expect at least three major airports will operate exclusively on SAF, creating demonstration hubs that accelerate global adoption. The International Energy Agency projects that SAF could account for 65% of aviation’s carbon reduction by 2050, but I believe this is conservative—with the right policy support and technological acceleration, we could see 80% or higher.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

The next decade will witness the most dramatic transformation in aviation fuel since the jet age began. SAF will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream solution, driven by technological breakthroughs, policy support, and changing consumer expectations. The industry will overcome current scalability challenges through synthetic fuels and advanced bioengineering, while new business models will make sustainable flying economically viable. Airlines that embrace this transformation early will gain competitive advantage, while laggards face regulatory and reputational risks. The coming decade represents both an unprecedented challenge and the greatest opportunity in aviation history—to fundamentally reinvent how we power flight while preserving the connectivity that defines our modern world.

Ian Khan’s Closing

I often tell leaders that the future doesn’t happen to us—we build it through the decisions we make today. Sustainable aviation fuel represents one of those pivotal opportunities where our choices will echo for generations. As I’ve witnessed in my work with forward-thinking organizations, the companies that thrive in the coming decades will be those that see beyond immediate constraints to the possibilities ahead.

“In our early days, few travelers ever mentioned sustainability — most just wanted to support local communities,” she says.","According to a report issued earlier this year by the World Travel and Tourism Council, consumer interest into responsible travel doesn’t always translate to more planet-friendly bookings.

The study, ""Bridging the Say-Do Gap: How to Create an Effective Sustainability Strategy by Knowing Your Customers,"" found that barriers to booking more low-impact travel include cost and lack of awareness. The good news: This is an opportunity for travel advisors to play a vital role, by connecting clients with meaningful experiences that benefit local communities and protect the planet’s natural resources.

Susan Blume, founder and CEO of Personal Escape Travel, is among the advisors finding success by educating clients about travel with reduced environmental impacts. “Given the present economic climate, many guests prioritize cost initially,” she says. “However, after we inform them about businesses that provide both value and eco-friendly practices, they are eager to engage with those brands.”

Education is crucial, according to Blume. “A significant number of travelers remain uninformed about sustainable practices in tourism,” she says, noting that some do have ideas about what responsible tourism can mean. “The main issues they bring up revolve around overtourism and how locals perceive visitors. Additionally, some travelers wish to contribute to local communities, not only through financial means but also by investing their time and efforts towards environmental well-being.”

Finding the right partners is key for advisors looking to sell more of this type of travel, Blume adds. “As a travel consultant, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive understanding of suppliers and partners who demonstrate a real commitment to sustainability,” she says. “Once this knowledge is acquired, personally engaging with the product, resort or destination is crucial. Such firsthand experience will enable you to engage in a more genuine and informed dialogue with your guests.”

Blume’s vetting process includes finding suppliers with certifications from organizations including Oceanic Global, EarthCheck and Green Globe — and seeing what suppliers are doing in person. “We believe in visiting these destinations or resorts to witness firsthand the initiatives in place that combat greenwashing,” she explains, citing Sandals and Beaches resorts — use PADI-certified diving boats to aid coral reef restoration in the Caribbean — as examples of sustainability in action.

Responsible Travel Becomes Mainstream

Monika Sundem, CEO of Adventure Life, an Affluent Traveler Collection affiliate, has witnessed an evolution in how consumers perceive the concept of responsible travel. “In our early days, few travelers ever mentioned sustainability — most just wanted to support local communities,” she says. “Over time, we’ve seen growing awareness around things like habitat preservation, plastic reduction and carbon impact. It’s evolved from a niche concern into something more mainstream, though still secondary to the desire for a meaningful travel experience.”

Still, “most travelers don’t come to us asking specifically for a ‘sustainable vacation,’” Sundem said. “They just want a great trip — and they trust that we’ve already vetted who we partner with given our statements about responsible travel on our website.”

To sell clients on more mindful experiences, Sundem emphasizes the benefits. “True sustainability often enhances the experience: fresh local food, deep cultural connection and access to pristine wilderness are luxuries in their own right,” she states. “In the early days, this sometimes felt like an either-or choice, that you could either have luxury without sustainability, or a more 'rustic' experience with sustainability. While that dichotomy may still exist in some respects, the gap between those two options has narrowed drastically.”

Encouraging Mindful Travel

For Abbie Synan, a travel advisor with Fora, leading by example helps to encourage more low-impact bookings. “Many of my clients seek me out because of my style of travel,” she says. “By showing my own mindful travel experiences, it can inspire clients to incorporate more sustainable travel elements into their own itineraries.”

Synan advocates for “slow travel” and for beginning each client conversation with intentionality. “If they haven't thought about these concepts, I really encourage advisors to have that conversation at the beginning of the planning process,” she explains. “You'll find people are much more open to weaving more sustainable practices into their vacations.”

Supporting local communities is the easiest entry point to ethical travel, according to Synan. “Having a connection locally is a win-win for both the destination and the traveler,” she says. “Community-based tourism is a really approachable way into the conversation.”

She shares an example from Portugal’s Douro Valley, where she sent clients during the shoulder season to work with a small local tour operator who grew up in the region. “Part of their tour is a boat ride on the river, and we worked with a company that has an electric version of the traditional Rabelo boats,” she says. “We took a destination where overtourism has been a pain point and we traveled off season, we avoided tourism leakage by keeping our euros in the community and we helped the environment of the Douro region by taking a better means of transportation — all while not sacrificing the experience.”

Ideal Destinations and Suppliers

Sundem looks for authenticity when considering travel options that reduce environmental impacts. “We look for sustainability that’s built into their DNA — not just in written policies, but in the heart of how they operate,” she says. “Are they doing more to preserve culture, local community, habitat and reduce emissions than others in that region? If so, we will opt to work with them should we feel they are also a good fit for our ethos.”

Advisors can also spotlight airlines with strong initiatives — such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) programs — and destinations that are leading the way. Paris, for example, is transforming its infrastructure with an emphasis on walkability and green living, by prioritizing pedestrians and cyclists, expanding urban green spaces and promoting local and organic food. Meanwhile, Kittilä, Finland is a showcase for Visit Finland’s Sustainable Travel Finland program, which helps travel professionals create itineraries that minimize impact while maximizing local benefits.

One thing is certain, according to Synan: consumer attitudes about mindful travel will continue to evolve. “The conversation about ways to be a better traveler is nuanced, complex and a moving target,” she says. “We are learning more about things we can do as global citizens to continue to be curious about the world we all live in, explore new places and move from less harm to a more net-positive approach.”",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/TW_Elearn/Sales/Strategic_Content/Air_France_Sustainability_Lead_Resize.jpg?n=3030&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-11-12 02:56:17.187311

Questions & Answers When will the aviation fuel levy take effect?
The aviation fuel levy will take effect from October 2026.","Air travellers departing from Singapore will be subject to a sustainable aviation fuel levy starting October 2026. The levy, whose rates will vary between S$1 to S$41.60 (US$0.77 to US$31.92), applies to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, onwards for flights departing on or after October 1, 2026, as stated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.

Detailed Breakdown of the Levy

The exact levy amount is contingent on the travel class and destination. The destinations are divided into four geographical bands, with the levies increasing progressively.

Passengers travelling to destinations in Band 1, which encompasses Southeast Asia, will incur an additional charge of S$1 for economy or premium economy tickets and S$4 for business or first class tickets.

For Band 2, which includes Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea, travellers will face an added fee of S$2.80 for economy class and S$11.20 for business class.

Travellers to destinations in Band 3 – Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, and New Zealand – will incur additional levies of S$6.40 and S$25.60 respectively.

Lastly, passengers flying to the Americas, falling under Band 4, will be charged an extra S$10.40 for economy class and S$41.60 for business class.

Exceptions and Special Cases

Passengers merely transiting through Singapore will not be subjected to the above levies. For multi-stop flights, the fee will be determined by the next destination after departing Singapore.

Moreover, the levy will also extend to cargo, with rates ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram. This calculation will follow the same geographical bands as those used for passenger flights.

The levy will also be applicable to general aviation, which includes private, non-commercial flights, and business aviation, such as private jets and chartered flights.

Origins and Impact of the Levy

The levy was first introduced in 2024 as a component of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which aimed to achieve net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.

Han Kok Juan, the director-general of the aviation authority, emphasized the commitment of Singapore, as a global air hub and an International Civil Aviation Organisation council member, to its environmental responsibilities. He reiterated that the country would take necessary steps to contribute to the cause while maintaining the competitiveness of the Singapore air hub.

Unlike green fuel mandates or incentive programs prevalent in other countries, this levy operates on a “fixed cost envelope.” This means that regardless of fluctuations in sustainable aviation fuel prices in 2026, the levy will remain unchanged.

*******************************************************

​The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, attended the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, on November 11 (Belém time). He met with the Chinese delegation and delivered a speech at the China Pavilion's side event.

In the morning, Mr Tse, together with the Director of Electrical and Mechanical Services, Mr Poon Kwok-ying, and the Commissioner for Climate Change of the Environment and Ecology Bureau, Mr Arthur Lee, met with the head of the Chinese delegation, Mr Li Gao, to exchange views on the work of the country and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on climate change actions and green transition.

In the afternoon, Mr Tse attended the China Pavilion's side event, guided by the Department of Climate Change of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) and cohosted by the Environment and Ecology Bureau of the HKSAR Government, Friends of the Earth (HK) and the Hong Kong Financial Services Development Council. The side event, titled Converging Innovation in Hong Kong: Forging a Resilient City and a Global Green Finance Hub, focused on exploring Hong Kong's role, achievements, and strategies in addressing climate change. Key discussion areas include climate action, energy transition, green and sustainable finance, climate resilience enhancement, and strengthening regional and international co-operation frameworks.

In his opening speech, Mr Tse said that, to tackle climate change, Hong Kong stopped building coal-fired power plants in 1997 and reached its carbon peak in 2014. Greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by about a quarter now, compared to the peak in 2014. The per-capita greenhouse gas emissions fell nearly 30 per cent to below 4.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is about a quarter of that of the United States and 60 per cent of the European Union.

Mr Tse added that Hong Kong targets to reduce Hong Kong's emissions by half before 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. He shared that the HKSAR Government has put forward a four-pronged strategy in the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050: namely net-zero electricity supply, energy saving and green buildings, green transport, and zero waste landfilling. Related energy measures include stopping the use of coal for power generation by 2035, increasing the share of zero carbon electricity supply to over 60 per cent, and publishing the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong last year to build a framework environment to the local development of hydrogen in a prudent and orderly manner.

He said that Hong Kong is also progressing well in promoting green transport. Out of 10 newly registered private cars, seven are now electric. A public charging network based on super-fast charging technologies is being developed and an electric vehicle battery recycling facility will be put into operation next year.

On waste-to-energy, the first large-scale waste-to-energy facility is coming into operation this month and the second one is being tendered for completion by 2030. Hong Kong is also working with the Chinese Mainland to develop a production base for sustainable aviation fuel in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area as well as gearing up to develop Hong Kong into a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre.

Regarding green finance, Mr Tse stated that as an international financial centre and sustainable finance hub in Asia, Hong Kong can help channel international capital to support the green transition. He illustrated, with an example, that as of October 2025, the HKSAR Government has issued green bonds totalling an equivalent of about US$31 billion. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards was implemented to fully align with the global baseline set by the International Sustainability Standards Board.

Mr Tse expressed that international co-operation is critical for tackling the challenge of climate change. ""The low carbon green transition is a difficult journey, and yet it has opened up many new collaboration opportunities. Hong Kong looks forward to working hand in hand with all of you to build a climate resilient and sustainable future for our next generations,"" said Mr Tse.

Other guest speakers at the event included the President of the BRI International Green Development Coalition and former Vice Minister of the MEE, Mr Zhao Yingmin; the Chairman of the Council for Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development, Dr Lam Ching-choi; the Secretary General of ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, Mr Gino Van Begin; and Vice-Chairperson of Friends of the Earth (HK) Ms Ophelia Lin.

Mr Poon and Mr Lee also spoke at the roundtable forum of the side event to exchange views with other speakers on accelerating energy transition and achieving carbon neutrality. Dr Lam spoke at another forum session to exchange views with other speakers on the topic of Building Climate-Resilient Cities: Managing Climate and Health Risks.

To achieve an interim target to halve the peak emission before 2035 and carbon neutrality before 2050, the city’s Climate Action Plan 2050 has put forward a four-pronged strategy: to go for net-zero carbon electricity supply; to promote energy saving and green buildings; to promote green transport; and to achieve zero landfilling of wastes, which is necessary to reduce methane, said the secretary for environment and ecology.

By 2035, Hong Kong will stop using coal for power generation, increase raise share of zero carbon electricity supply to over 60 percent, stop selling conventional fueled private cars including hybrids, and stop landfilling of municipal wastes, he added.

Tse pointed out that the use of coal for electricity generation has been cut to about 15 percent, while around 60 percent of the electricity supply is by natural gas and 25 percent by nuclear, as of now.

Speaking about the progress on promoting green transport, he said, “Out of 10 newly registered private cars, seven are now electric. We are also developing a public charging network based on super-fast charging technologies. Furthermore, an electric vehicle battery recycling facility is coming into operation next year.”

The SAR has made tremendous efforts in the last three years to achieve zero landfilling, which has successfully reduced waste disposal by 10 percent, while quantities of material recycled have increased by 30 percent, according to the environment chief.

The first large-scale waste-to-energy facility is coming into operation in November, and the second one is being tendered for completion by 2030, he added.

While gearing up to develop itself into a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading center, the HKSAR is working with the Chinese mainland to develop a production base for sustainable aviation fuel in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area, he said.

“Our capital market offers a wide range of green and sustainable investment products. As of June 2025, over 200 ESG (environmental, social, and governance) funds were authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission, with assets under management over HK$1.1 trillion.”

In this context, the secretary mentioned that the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong last year amounted to around $43 billion, capturing around 45 percent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years.

As of October 2025, the SAR government has issued green bonds totaling about $31 billion equivalent denominated in Hong Kong dollar, Renminbi, euro, and US dollar, providing important benchmarks for potential issuers in Hong Kong and in the region.

Stressing the vitality of accurate, consistent and relevant information about sustainability-related matters, Tse said Hong Kong's Core Climate is currently the only carbon marketplace offering settlement in both Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi for international voluntary carbon credits.

“The low-carbon green transition is a difficult journey and yet has opened up many new collaboration opportunities,” he said, calling for international cooperation to tackle the challenge of climate change.

Among those attending the event were Secretary General of ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability Gino Van Begin, Chairman of the Council for Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development Dr Lam Ching-choi, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Sustainable Energy for All Stefano Marguccio, and Vice-Chairperson of Friends of the Earth (HK) Ophelia Lin.",https://www.chinadailyhk.com/upload/main/image/2025/11/12/3f5cf7da37d5e88f3ddb955fbf0bdb8b.png,N,,2025-11-12 00:56:17.117317

The levy will apply to Origin-Destination traffic, cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights departing Singapore from 1 October 2026, applicable for tickets or services sold from 1 April 2026.

The levy will be split into four bands:

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, New Zealand

Band 4: Americas

This will then be levied based on distance and class of service

Economy Cabin: comprising Economy Class and Premium Economy Class

Premium Cabin: comprising Business Class and First Class

The SAF Levy for Premium Cabin is four times that for the Economy Cabin for the same geographical band. The airline must collect the SAF Levy and display it as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold.

The SAF Levy will only apply to Origin-Destination passengers and not those transiting through Singapore.

So, what do the numbers look like?

Not that much in the grand scheme of a ticket – but still a chunk of cash.

Geographical Band Passenger SAF Levy (Per Passenger Charge) Economy Cabin Premium Cabin Band I

Southeast Asia S$1.00 S$4.00 Band II

Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea S$2.80 S$11.20 Band III

Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand S$6.40 S$25.60 Band IV

Americas S$10.40 S$41.60

The CAAS had previously estimated the SAF Levy to be around S$3.00, S$6.00, and S$16.00 for a passenger in economy class travelling direct to Bangkok, Tokyo, and London, respectively. The actual SAF Levy amounts for economy tickets to these same destinations are S$1.00, S$2.80 and S$6.40, respectively. The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made.

If you’re shipping cargo, expect this to go up per kilogram. For those who have a private jet, well, open your wallet, I think the term is. The table below shows you how much

Certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF Levy.

The SAF Levy collected will go into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS.

Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, said:

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

Yup. Another charge on your ticket

We’re all used to extra charges across our tickets, with little bits being tacked on.

For a lot of passengers (especially in Economy or Premium Economy), you’re not going to see a lot tacked onto your ticket. For even long-haul tickets, the additional taxes are not too much of a burden.

For those connecting through Singapore as a pit-stop, this is one cost you won’t have to deal with.

What will be a burden is if you bring your private jet to Singapore. But then money is an odd concept at that point, especially if you’re flying in your mobile place.

Thankfully, scientists have found a sustainable way to cut that contribution by turning everyday trash into jet fuel.

A study published in Nature Sustainability shows that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel could reduce pollution by 80-90% compared to conventional jet fuel. The findings support that one day, food scraps and packaging could power commercial flights.

Researchers from the U.S. and China found that trash-based jet fuel could account for 62.5 billion liters annually, enough to cut global aviation pollution by 16%, as Anthropocene Magazine reported.

""There is a wealth of organic waste deserving our attention,"" said research team member Michael McElroy, an environmental studies professor at Harvard University.

In addition to waste, the Nature Sustainability study also noted that integrating green hydrogen into the process could remove even more carbon, while the biggest hurdle is improving the gasification process, which has been a ""technical challenge.""

For cities already struggling with landfill waste, this breakthrough could turn that problem into a climate solution.

This isn't the only recent advancement in sustainable aviation technology. Scientists at Chalmers University in Sweden presented hydrogen-powered aircraft designs that could reduce fuel consumption. Meanwhile, aviation company Eviation introduced Alice, the world's first all-electric commuter plane, last year.

Choosing low-impact travel options helps support this transition. While no single solution can fully replace dirty-energy-producing fuel just yet, innovations such as waste-based sustainable aviation fuel and electric aircraft are taking us in the right direction.

Designed to incentivize the production of cleaner transportation fuels, this credit not only benefits fuel producers but has also started attracting interest from companies seeking to purchase credits under the transferability provisions of 26 U.S. Code Section 6418. Initially introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Clean Fuels Credit stands out as one of the few tax incentives that received an extension through 2029 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). As the regulatory landscape continues to shift, it is essential for companies to understand both the strategic advantages and the legal requirements associated with this incentive.

This article examines the critical features of the Clean Fuels Credit, assesses its practical impact for businesses, and highlights key legal considerations necessary for maximizing its value.

Clean Fuels Credit Qualifications

Section 45Z Clean Fuels Credits apply to qualified fuel produced between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2029. The value of the credit is directly linked to the fuel’s greenhouse gas emissions as compared to conventional petroleum fuels, meaning the fewer the emissions, the larger the credit a producer can earn.

Emissions for the 45Z credit are determined using the U.S. Department of Energy’s 45ZCF-GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies) Model. This model calculates the total greenhouse gas emissions generated throughout the entire lifecycle of the fuel, beginning with the cultivation of feedstock and ending with the combustion of the fuel itself. It considers variables such as transportation methods, agricultural techniques, and processing practices. The result is a carbon intensity (CI) score for each gallon of fuel produced. The lower the CI score, the higher the tax credit available to the producer. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues an annual table that specifies the CI values for various types of fuels, most recently published in Notice 2025-11. Apart from the expansion of the credit period, another noteworthy update under the OBBBA is the exclusion of emissions resulting from indirect land use changes (ILUC)—such as converting additional land to grow feedstocks for biofuels—from the emissions calculation for crop-based fuels, which can lower reported emissions and thereby increase potential credits for biofuel producers.

To qualify for the credit, a fuel must produce less than 50 kilograms of carbon dioxide per unit of energy, about half the emissions of traditional petroleum-based fuels. Meeting this threshold earns a base credit of 20 cents per gallon. However, fuels that achieve greater emissions reductions can earn even more, providing a strong incentive for innovation and cleaner fuel production. The maximum credit for standard biofuels is $1 per gallon (based on the emissions factor), while sustainable aviation fuel qualifies for an enhanced rate of up to $1.75 per gallon, reflecting its strategic importance for decarbonizing the aviation sector.

Eligibility for the 45Z credit is further determined by sales requirements. The fuel must be produced at a qualified facility and sold to an unrelated third party, either for use in blended fuel mixtures or directly in trade or business activities. Alternatively, if the fuel is sold to an unrelated party who then resells it at retail, the producer may still claim the credit.

Finally, there are strict sourcing requirements: all eligible fuel must be produced from feedstocks grown or produced exclusively in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. This condition supports domestic and regional agriculture, ensures supply chain transparency, and aligns the credit with North American climate and economic goals.

Legal Considerations for Sellers and Purchasers of Clean Fuels Credits

Whether you are producing, selling, or purchasing Section 45Z credits, meticulous attention to legal details is essential. Below are key considerations and best practices for all participants in this growing marketplace:

Compliance with Emissions Standards: The value and eligibility of Section 45Z credits hinge on accurate lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions calculations, performed using the 45ZCF-GREET model. All parties should ensure fastidious recordkeeping, including data on feedstock sourcing, production methods, and emissions modeling and verification. Well-documented pathways not only substantiate the credit claim but also provide essential protection in the event of IRS audits or transfer disputes.

Ensuring a Qualifying Sale: Eligibility for Section 45Z credits depends on specific statutory requirements, including that the fuel be sold to an unrelated party for prescribed uses. Transactional parties should ensure that contracts and sales documentation clearly establish compliance with these requirements. Careful contract drafting—including representations, warranties, and indemnities—can help manage risk and facilitate smoother credit transfers.

Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship Compliance: For purchasers and sellers aiming to access the full value of Section 45Z credits, compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship mandates for construction, alteration, or repair work at qualifying facilities is crucial. Comprehensive protocols and documentation supporting adherence to these labor standards can mitigate the risk of credit disallowance and enhance the marketability of credits.

Land Use and Regulatory Changes: Recent updates exclude indirect land use change considerations from federal lifecycle emissions calculations for crop-based fuels. However, state incentives and regulations may continue to treat ILUC differently. Ongoing monitoring of both federal and state policy developments is essential to ensure ongoing compliance and to optimize credit eligibility across jurisdictions.

Insurance and Verification: The Section 45Z market is still evolving, with many transactions taking place in a novel regulatory context. Tax insurance has become a popular mechanism for mitigating the risks of IRS challenges, modeling errors, or regulatory reinterpretations. Parties should consider tailored insurance solutions and work with experienced counsel and insurance professionals to structure transactions that protect their interests.

Change in Laws: The IRS and Department of Energy (DOE) are expected to issue ongoing updates to carbon intensity tables, technical guidance, and compliance requirements. All market participants should maintain flexibility in transactional documents to accommodate future regulatory changes and should regularly consult with legal advisors to remain aligned with the latest developments.

Conclusion

The Section 45Z Clean Fuels Credit offers considerable opportunities for both fuel producers and credit market participants. However, the program’s complexity and the evolving regulatory landscape require careful planning and diligent compliance. By proactively addressing these legal and operational considerations, participants can maximize credit value, minimize risk, and position themselves at the forefront of the clean energy transition.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15872_4946.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 02:57:03.851002

This new green tax is set to have a significant impact on passengers flying out of the city-state, marking an important move towards making aviation more sustainable. The tax will be implemented gradually, with full enforcement expected by October 2026.

What Is the SAF Levy?

The SAF levy is essentially a green tax that aims to promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel. Airlines will be required to pass on the cost of the levy to passengers, with the charge appearing as a distinct line item on ticket prices. The exact levy will vary depending on the class of service and the destination of the flight.

How Will the SAF Levy Be Structured?

The SAF levy will be structured according to four geographical bands, which group destinations based on their distance from Singapore. These bands will determine the surcharge added to passengers’ tickets. Each band has a different levy rate, with the highest surcharges applying to long-haul flights.

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$1

Business/First Class: SGD$4

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$2.80

Business/First Class: SGD$11.20

Band 3: New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, and the Middle East

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$6.40

Business/First Class: SGD$25.60

Band 4: North and South America

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$10.40

Business/First Class: SGD$41.60

How the SAF Levy Will Be Used

The money raised from the SAF levy will be put into a fund designed to purchase sustainable aviation fuel. This fuel is considered a more eco-friendly alternative to conventional jet fuel, as it reduces carbon emissions during flights. By creating this fund, Singapore aims to make air travel more sustainable and contribute to its green goals for the aviation industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has stated that the levy was designed based on the projected volume of SAF needed to meet the country’s 1% SAF target for 2026. The tax will also account for the price premiumof SAF over regular jet fuel and other associated costs. With global aviation contributing significantly to carbon emissions, Singapore’s decision to implement this green tax is part of its broader effort to reduce its environmental footprint and support the development of sustainable technologies.

Exceptions to the SAF Levy

The SAF levy will only apply to departing passengers, meaning those who are transiting through Singapore will not be subject to the tax. For example, passengers flying through Changi Airport on their way to a final destination in another country will not see the SAF levy on their tickets, even if they are changing flights in Singapore.

An important exception to this rule includes through-flights such as those operated by Singapore Airlines, flying from Australia to Europe, or flights like Qantas’ Kangaroo Routes (QF1/QF2) and British Airways’ BA15/BA16 services. These flights, which pass through Singapore but originate in other countries, will also be exempt from the levy. This distinction ensures that the levy only affects flights that begin their journey in Singapore, keeping the tax targeted and specific to local travel.

The Wider Impact of the SAF Levy on Passengers and Airlines

The introduction of the SAF levy could influence travelers’ decisions, particularly those flying in premium cabins. The surcharge for business and first class tickets will be significantly higher, with Band 4 routes seeing a levy of SGD$41.60for premium cabins. This could raise the cost of long-haul flights from Singapore to destinations in North America and South America, making it a more expensive option for travelers in higher classes.

For economy and premium economy passengers, the levy is relatively more modest, ranging from SGD$1 for Southeast Asia to SGD$10.40 for flights to the Americas. However, these fees will still add to the overall cost of air travel, which could lead to some passengers adjusting their travel budgets or reconsidering their travel plans.

For airlines, the levy introduces a new set of operational and marketing challenges. While the tax will be passed on to passengers, airlines will need to clearly communicate these charges in their pricing structure. This will require updates to ticket booking systems and possibly adjustments to how airlines market their fares, especially for premium service classes where the levies are more pronounced.

Moreover, the SAF levy will impact the aviation sector’s profitability, as the extra surcharge could affect demand, particularly on long-haul flights. However, airlines that are able to successfully integrate sustainable practices into their operations may benefit from the growing demand for environmentally conscious travel options. This shift toward green aviation could become a point of differentiation for airlines that focus on sustainability in their fleets and operations.

The Future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Its Role in Global Aviation

As the SAF levy becomes effective, it will help pave the way for broader adoption of sustainable aviation fuels in the industry. Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel. This is particularly important as the aviation industry faces increasing pressure from governments and global climate organizations to cut down on its carbon emissions.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7888-8.jpeg,N,,2025-11-11 22:56:29.182037

Outside of politics, AAT plans and manages charters for corporate executives, family offices, and former national leaders. Its operations staff coordinate aircraft, crew, and ground handling from takeoff to touchdown, partnering with security teams to manage multi-stop itineraries, VIP movements, and global missions.

The company also maintains a strong presence in the New York metropolitan area, working daily through LaGuardia (LGA), JFK, and Newark (EWR). “New York is one of the busiest private aviation markets in the world,” Gregg says. “We’re constantly moving clients in and out — CEOs heading to Wall Street meetings, families flying to warm-weather getaways, entertainers traveling for high-profile events.”

Each airport offers different advantages, and AAT helps clients choose the right mix of proximity, privacy, and logistics. And as public flight-tracking tools have made privacy harder to maintain, more high-net-worth travelers are choosing charter over ownership. “Privacy has become a big part of the conversation,” Gregg notes. “With aircraft data now public, charter gives clients flexibility and discretion that ownership can’t.”

Looking ahead, Gregg sees the next decade of private aviation shaped by sustainability, smarter technology, and service consistency. “Whether it’s sustainable aviation fuel, better trip tracking, or more seamless ground coordination, it’s about blending innovation with a human touch,” he says. “Our job is to make travel effortless — so our clients can focus on what really matters.”",https://metroairportnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Advanced-Aviation-Team-Gulfstream-G550.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 22:56:33.621670

The start of these fuel deliveries in October marked the company’s second and third deployments of blended SAF at a major U.S. airport in six months. In May, FedEx announced its first major U.S. SAF deployment at Los Angeles International Airport.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help to scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs of increased SAF production globally this calendar year.”

Chicago-O’Hare International Airport

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a blend to include a total of one million gallons of neat SAF at a minimum 30% blend from Air bp. With its first fuel delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at Chicago-O’Hare International Airport.*

“Existing fuel infrastructure and enabling policy conditions at the state level made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel procurement strategy,” Blanks Ellis added.

Miami International Airport

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started to take delivery of around three million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% blend minimum from AEG.

“With FedEx flights from Miami heading all over Latin America and the Caribbean every day, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, president, FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and demonstrates to our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we’re embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and actively contributing to the corporation’s global sustainability strategy.”

SAF: Part of a holistic aviation sustainability strategy

Under current fuel standards, neat—or unblended—SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels.^ However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives enabled FedEx to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in $400 million in savings for the company. In FY 2024, FedEx achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. Upping its ambition, FedEx has since expanded that goal to target a 40% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity by 2034.

Sustainable Flight: Fuel, Physics, Data explores how aviation’s path to net-zero hinges on three pillars: new fuels like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), physics-informed efficiency across aircraft and operations, and rigorous, trusted data. For business leaders planning 2026 strategies and events, the stakes are rising fast: regulations are tightening, stakeholder expectations are escalating, and capital markets are prioritizing measurable decarbonization. With ReFuelEU Aviation blending mandates starting in 2025 and scaling through 2050, and SAF economics evolving, the next two years will define advantage. This keynote reframes sustainable aviation as a board-level strategy challenge—one that demands evidence-based decisions, cross-industry partnerships, and Future Readiness, so organizations can move from inspiration to implementation.

Current Challenges (120-150 words)

Scale and cost of SAF: SAF delivers up to 80% lifecycle CO2 reductions compared to conventional jet fuel, but supply is tiny and prices are 2–4x higher than fossil jet fuel (IATA, 2024; McKinsey, 2023). IATA projects SAF production at roughly 1.5 million tonnes in 2024—about 0.5% of global jet fuel demand (IATA, 2024).

Physics constraints: Batteries have far lower gravimetric energy density than jet fuel (~0.9 MJ/kg for lithium-ion vs ~43 MJ/kg for Jet A), limiting fully electric long-haul viability for the foreseeable future; hydrogen introduces volumetric and cryogenic storage challenges that impact aircraft design and operations (NASA Glenn Research Center; ICCT, 2023).

Data unpreparedness: Most companies still lack the measurement rigor needed to steer decarbonization. Only 9% can measure their full emissions comprehensively, hindering credible targets and investment decisions (BCG, 2021). Aviation-related enterprises that can’t quantify abatement options risk stranded strategies and inefficient capital allocation.

Critical Questions for Leaders (80-100 words)

Are you seeking entertainment, or a solid, fact-driven approach to Future Readiness based on data?

The Future Readiness Solution (150-180 words)

A Future Readiness approach builds the capability to sense, decide, and act across fuel, physics, and data—consistently and at scale. It aligns strategy to verifiable metrics, embeds scenario planning around fuel pathways (SAF, hydrogen, hybrid-electric), and connects operations with capital allocation through marginal abatement cost curves. Leaders use data-driven decision making to prioritize interventions with the best risk-adjusted impact.

Build an aviation sustainability data backbone: integrate flight operations, fuel procurement, weather, and maintenance data; calculate route-level emissions and cost/benefit of interventions (e.g., continuous descent operations, winglet retrofits).

Operationalize SAF: secure offtake agreements, verify chain of custody via RSB/ISCC frameworks, and run controlled pilots on selected routes with transparent lifecycle accounting.

Govern with measurable outcomes: set physics-informed KPIs (fuel burn per ASK, load factor, contrail avoidance trials), review quarterly, and tie executive incentives to Future Readiness Score improvements.

This approach turns sustainability from aspiration into a repeatable operating system for performance.

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of total carbon emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. In my work with major airlines and energy companies, I’ve witnessed firsthand the urgent pressure to decarbonize air travel. The current sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production stands at a mere 0.1% of total jet fuel demand, creating what I call the “sustainability gap” – the chasm between ambition and current capability. The World Economic Forum reports that over 80 airlines have committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, yet the infrastructure to support this transition remains in its infancy. Having consulted with aviation leaders across three continents, I can tell you we’re at a critical inflection point where the decisions made today will determine whether we achieve sustainable flight or remain grounded by outdated energy paradigms.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Capacity Crisis

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting work is the staggering gap between SAF demand and production capacity. McKinsey & Company analysis reveals that current global SAF production capacity of approximately 500 million liters annually represents less than 0.2% of the 300 billion liters of conventional jet fuel consumed each year. I’ve sat in boardrooms where airline executives express genuine concern about meeting their 2030 sustainability targets given this production deficit. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that SAF production needs to increase 150-fold by 2030 to meet industry commitments, creating what I describe as the “greatest scaling challenge in modern energy history.” The reality is that building new production facilities takes 3-5 years and requires billions in capital investment – time and resources that many organizations simply don’t have.

Challenge 2: The Cost Competitiveness Dilemma

In my analysis of SAF economics, the cost differential remains a fundamental barrier to widespread adoption. Deloitte research indicates that SAF currently costs 2-4 times more than conventional jet fuel, creating what I call the “green premium paradox” – where sustainability aspirations collide with economic reality. I’ve advised airlines facing the impossible choice between financial viability and environmental responsibility. The Harvard Business Review notes that even with carbon pricing mechanisms and government incentives, the economic case for SAF remains challenging for most carriers. This cost disparity creates a competitive disadvantage for early adopters and threatens to slow the entire industry’s transition. The brutal truth I share with clients is that until SAF achieves price parity, widespread adoption will remain elusive.

Challenge 3: The Feedstock Limitation Problem

The third critical challenge involves the fundamental question of feedstock availability and sustainability. Current SAF production relies heavily on limited feedstocks like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, which PwC analysis suggests can only supply a fraction of future demand. In my work with biofuel companies, I’ve seen how feedstock constraints create production bottlenecks that limit scaling potential. The World Economic Forum warns that without diversified feedstock sources, the SAF industry risks creating new environmental problems while solving existing ones. I’ve observed firsthand how the competition for sustainable biomass between aviation, maritime, and other industries creates what I term “the biomass battle” – a zero-sum game that could undermine the entire green transition.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. In my research and consulting, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that give me genuine optimism about the future of sustainable aviation.

First, power-to-liquid (PtL) technology represents what I believe will be the game-changer for SAF production. By converting renewable electricity, water, and captured CO2 into liquid fuels, PtL addresses both the feedstock limitation and scalability challenges. I’ve consulted with companies like Siemens Energy and Lufthansa who are pioneering these technologies, creating what I call “electric fuel” – essentially storing renewable electricity in liquid form for aviation use.

Second, advanced fermentation technologies using engineered microorganisms are revolutionizing bio-SAF production. Companies like LanzaJet are converting industrial waste gases into jet fuel through biological processes I’ve witnessed in operation. This approach not only utilizes waste streams but creates circular economic models that turn environmental liabilities into valuable assets.

Third, blockchain-enabled sustainability tracking is addressing the verification challenge. In my work with major airlines, I’ve helped implement distributed ledger systems that provide immutable proof of SAF’s environmental credentials. This creates trust in the supply chain and enables accurate carbon accounting – essential for both regulatory compliance and consumer confidence.

Fourth, government and industry partnerships are accelerating innovation through what I call “co-opetition” – competitors collaborating on pre-competitive research. The United States’ Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge and the European Union’s ReFuelEU initiative are creating the policy frameworks and investment necessary to drive the industry forward.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of current trends and technological trajectories, I project that the SAF industry will undergo a transformation more dramatic than most industry leaders currently anticipate. According to BloombergNEF forecasts, global SAF production capacity is expected to reach 20 billion liters annually by 2030, representing a 40-fold increase from current levels. However, I believe this projection underestimates the acceleration we’ll see as new technologies reach commercial scale.

My foresight exercises with Fortune 500 energy companies suggest that by 2030, we’ll see SAF account for at least 10% of global aviation fuel consumption, driven by three key breakthroughs: synthetic biology enabling new feedstock pathways, artificial intelligence optimizing production efficiency, and quantum computing accelerating catalyst development.

The financial implications are staggering. Accenture analysis indicates that the SAF market could represent a $30 billion annual opportunity by 2035, creating what I describe as “the green fuel gold rush.” I’m already seeing venture capital and corporate investment flooding into this space, with over $5 billion committed to SAF projects in the past 18 months alone.

In my “what if” scenario planning with airline executives, we’ve modeled a future where SAF achieves cost parity with conventional jet fuel by 2032 through technological innovation and economies of scale. This would trigger what I call “the great fuel switch” – a rapid transition that could see SAF dominate the aviation fuel market by 2040.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, I believe sustainable aviation fuel will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream energy source that fundamentally reshapes global aviation. The transformation will be driven by technological breakthroughs in synthetic fuel production, policy support from governments worldwide, and growing consumer demand for sustainable travel options. The airlines that invest in SAF infrastructure and partnerships today will gain significant competitive advantages, while laggards risk being left behind in what I predict will be the most dramatic industry transformation since the jet engine itself. The opportunities for innovation, investment, and leadership in this space are unprecedented.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of sustainable aviation isn’t just about cleaner fuel – it’s about reimagining human mobility in harmony with our planet. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The most sustainable energy is the energy we don’t use, but until we achieve that ideal, sustainable aviation fuel represents our bridge to a cleaner future.”

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel production reached over 600 million liters in 2023—a remarkable 200% increase from 2022, yet still representing less than 0.2% of total aviation fuel consumption. In my work with major airlines and energy companies, I’ve witnessed firsthand the paradox we’re facing: unprecedented momentum coupled with daunting scalability challenges. The World Economic Forum projects that aviation emissions could triple by 2050 without significant intervention, making SAF not just an environmental imperative but a business survival strategy. What fascinates me most about this industry’s current state is that we’re no longer debating whether SAF will happen—we’re grappling with how quickly it can scale while maintaining economic viability. Having consulted with organizations navigating this transition, I see 2024 as the year where strategic decisions made today will determine market leadership for decades to come.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Feedstock Scalability Paradox

The most pressing challenge I’m observing in my consulting engagements is what I call the “feedstock scalability paradox.” As noted by McKinsey & Company, current SAF production relies heavily on limited feedstocks like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, creating an inherent ceiling on growth. The Harvard Business Review recently highlighted that even if we diverted all global used cooking oil to SAF production, we’d only meet about 1% of aviation’s fuel needs. I’ve worked with airlines that secured offtake agreements only to discover their suppliers couldn’t source sufficient feedstock at competitive prices. This isn’t just a supply chain issue—it’s a fundamental constraint that could derail the entire SAF transition if not addressed strategically. The reality is that we’re competing with other industries for the same limited sustainable resources, creating price volatility that makes long-term planning exceptionally difficult for aviation leaders.

Challenge 2: The Green Premium Economic Model

The second critical challenge revolves around what Deloitte identifies as the “green premium”—the significant cost differential between conventional jet fuel and SAF, typically ranging from 2-5 times higher. In my strategic sessions with airline executives, I’ve seen how this premium creates a fundamental business model tension. While corporate sustainability commitments drive demand, the economic reality often forces difficult trade-offs between environmental goals and profitability. Accenture research shows that even with growing corporate travel sustainability programs, the willingness to pay premiums remains limited. What makes this particularly challenging is that SAF costs aren’t expected to reach parity with conventional fuels until massive scale is achieved—creating a classic chicken-and-egg problem. I’ve advised organizations struggling with how to absorb these costs without compromising competitive positioning, and the solutions are far from straightforward.

Challenge 3: Infrastructure Transition Complexity

The third challenge that deserves more attention is the infrastructure transition complexity. According to PwC’s analysis, the existing aviation fuel infrastructure—from pipelines to storage facilities to airport fueling systems—was designed for conventional fuels, creating significant compatibility and logistics challenges. In my work with airport authorities and fuel suppliers, I’ve seen how the physical realities of infrastructure create invisible barriers to adoption. The World Economic Forum notes that blending limitations, separate storage requirements, and transportation constraints add layers of complexity that many organizations underestimate. What’s particularly challenging is that infrastructure investments require long-term certainty about SAF adoption rates, while adoption rates depend on infrastructure availability—another circular dependency that demands strategic intervention.

Solutions and Innovations

The exciting part of my work as a futurist is identifying the breakthrough solutions emerging to address these challenges. I’m seeing three particularly promising innovations gaining traction:

First, advanced feedstock technologies are revolutionizing scalability. Companies like LanzaJet and Fulcrum BioEnergy are pioneering waste-to-fuel pathways that can utilize municipal solid waste and other non-food feedstocks. I recently consulted with an energy company implementing gasification technology that can process multiple waste streams simultaneously, dramatically expanding the potential feedstock base.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. As the European Commission’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative recognizes, PtL fuels produced from green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide offer virtually unlimited scalability without feedstock constraints. I’m working with several forward-thinking organizations that are positioning themselves in the green hydrogen ecosystem, recognizing that early movers will capture significant value.

Third, digital fuel management platforms are addressing the economic and infrastructure challenges. Blockchain-enabled fuel tracing systems, like those being piloted by major airlines, provide transparency that justifies premium pricing while ensuring regulatory compliance. Meanwhile, AI-powered logistics optimization helps manage the complex blending and distribution challenges, reducing costs and improving efficiency.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of current trajectories and technological breakthroughs, I project that the SAF industry will experience exponential growth between now and 2034. According to BloombergNEF, SAF production capacity is expected to reach 25 billion liters annually by 2030, representing a 40-fold increase from current levels. However, I believe this underestimates the acceleration we’ll see as new technologies reach commercial scale.

My foresight exercises with industry leaders point to several key milestones: By 2026, I predict we’ll see the first commercial-scale PtL facilities coming online, fundamentally changing the scalability equation. By 2028, I expect SAF costs to decline to 1.5-2 times conventional jet fuel as production scales and technologies mature. Most significantly, by 2032, I project that SAF will account for at least 10% of global aviation fuel consumption, driven by regulatory mandates, corporate sustainability commitments, and technological breakthroughs.

The financial implications are staggering. Goldman Sachs Research estimates that the SAF market could represent a $2 trillion cumulative investment opportunity through 2050. What’s particularly compelling from my perspective is that the companies positioning themselves in the SAF value chain today—from technology providers to feedstock innovators to logistics specialists—are building what could become the energy giants of tomorrow.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, I believe sustainable aviation fuel will transform from a niche product to a mainstream energy source, fundamentally reshaping the aviation industry’s environmental and economic landscape. The companies that thrive will be those that approach SAF not as a compliance requirement but as a strategic opportunity. We’ll see new business models emerge, new partnerships between unlikely players, and new technologies that make today’s challenges seem quaint. The risk isn’t in moving too fast—it’s in moving too slowly and missing the window to establish leadership in this rapidly evolving space. The organizations that master the SAF transition will not only reduce their environmental impact but will build significant competitive advantage in an increasingly sustainability-conscious market.

Ian Khan’s Closing

In my two decades of studying technological transformations, I’ve learned that the most significant breakthroughs happen when necessity meets innovation—and that’s exactly where we are with sustainable aviation fuel today. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The future belongs to those who see possibilities before they become obvious.”

For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.
The aircraft operator will collect the SAF levy and must display the SAF levy as a distinct line item on the air-cargo contract.
Certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF levy.

The amount of the SAF levy is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1 percent SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending and delivery.

As longer flights consume more fuel, the SAF levy varies based on the distance traveled.

For simplicity and ease of administration, all destinations from Singapore are grouped into four geographical bands.

For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

The SAF levy for origin-destination cargo shipments is set on a per-kilogram basis and varies based on the distance traveled, categorized by the four geographical bands.

The aircraft operator will collect the SAF levy and must display the SAF levy as a distinct line item on the air-cargo contract.

The SAF levy for general- and business-aviation flights is charged on a per-aircraft basis and varies based on the distance traveled, categorized by the four geographical bands, and the aircraft’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) codes A-F for aircraft wingspan, which serve as a proxy for aircraft size.

Certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF levy.

The SAF Levy collected will go into a statutory SAF fund managed by CAAS.

The fund will be used solely for the purchase of SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes (EAs) and to cover associated administrative costs.

The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) will manage the procurement, allocation and administration of SAF and EAs, to get best value for money and ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of the fund.

CAAS will continue to engage airlines, aircraft operators and other industry stakeholders in the coming weeks and work with them on implementation.

“The introduction of the SAF levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,” said Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS. “It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost, which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

ICAO has set a long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050.

As a member of the international civil aviation community and an ICAO council member, Singapore is committed to working towards that goal and will do so in a practical manner, advancing both sustainability and competitiveness of its air hub, not one at the expense of the other, CAAS said.

In 2024, CAAS launched the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which sets out Singapore’s balanced approach to the long-term, sustainable growth of Singapore’s aviation sector.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_0d66842a64c645098fc2457f61ae9d5a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_982,h_655,al_c,q_85/80995f_0d66842a64c645098fc2457f61ae9d5a~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-11 18:56:34.385128

Your leftovers may one day help power airplanes. Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign have developed a way to transform food waste into a clean, high-energy fuel capable of powering commercial jets — without requiring any changes to aircraft engines.

From kitchen waste to jet fuel

In a study published in Nature Communications, agricultural engineers detailed how they converted discarded food from processing plants into bio-crude oil using a process known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). This method mimics how the Earth naturally forms fossil fuels over millions of years — only it does it in hours, using heat, water, and pressure.

The resulting oil is then refined into jet fuel through a two-step cleaning and upgrading process. First, impurities such as salts and moisture are removed. Next, the oil undergoes catalytic hydrotreating — a process that strips away unwanted elements like nitrogen and sulfur. The team found that a cobalt–molybdenum catalyst was particularly effective for refining the oil into the specific hydrocarbons required for aviation fuel.

The finished product passed tests set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration, meeting all the technical standards for commercial jet fuel. “This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” said project lead Yuanhui Zhang. “We take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product.”

Closing aviation’s emissions gap

Aviation accounts for about 7 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Electric batteries can power small aircraft, but not long-haul jets, since jet fuel carries about 50 times more energy per kilogram than current lithium-ion technology.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — derived from renewable or recycled sources — could reduce flying emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional kerosene. The new food-waste-based version adds another potential feedstock to that growing list, offering a way to cut both emissions and waste.

Scaling the solution

For now, the breakthrough is proof of concept. Producing enough food-derived jet fuel to supply commercial fleets will require major industrial investment and infrastructure. “Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in,” Zhang said.

If scaled successfully, the method could offer a circular solution for one of aviation’s toughest environmental challenges — turning yesterday’s leftovers into tomorrow’s takeoff fuel.

(NASDAQ: GEVO) delivered a major earnings surprise for the third quarter of 2025, posting results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and highlighted a sharp turnaround in its financial performance.

Record Revenue Growth and Strong Financial Recovery

For Q3 2025, Gevo reported revenues of $43.6 million, far above analyst forecasts of $37.03 million, and a dramatic increase from about $2 million during the same period last year. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) came in at a loss of $0.03, beating the expected loss of $0.04.

Most notably, Gevo achieved a positive adjusted EBITDA of $6.7 million, marking its second consecutive quarter of profitability. This was a major improvement compared to a loss of $16.7 million a year ago, reflecting improving operational efficiency and higher cash flow from its facilities.

The company ended the quarter with $108 million in cash, ensuring a strong liquidity position as it continues investing in growth projects.

North Dakota Facility Powers Carbon and Ethanol Gains

Gevo’s North Dakota operations were the cornerstone of its quarterly success, contributing $12.3 million in operational income. This performance was driven by efficient low-carbon ethanol production, carbon sequestration, and robust sales of clean fuel and voluntary carbon credits.

During the quarter, the site achieved several operational milestones:

Produced 17 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol

Generated 46,000 tons of protein and corn oil co-products

Sequestered 42,000 tons of carbon dioxide

Produced 92,000 MMBtu of renewable natural gas (RNG)

Gevo’s Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) system has now stored over 560,000 metric tons of CO₂ since its launch in June 2022, making it the world’s first ethanol dry mill to achieve commercial-scale carbon storage.

The company also capitalized on Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs), selling all its remaining 2025 credits worth $30 million, bringing total CFPC sales for the year to $52 million. This reflects Gevo’s ability to monetize carbon-linked incentives effectively.

Carbon Credit Expansion Strengthens Revenue Mix

Gevo is rapidly scaling its carbon revenue streams. In Q3 2025, the company signed a multi-year offtake agreement expected to generate around $26 million in Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) credit sales over five years, with the potential to increase volumes.

By the end of 2025, Gevo expects carbon co-product sales to grow to $3–5 million, up from $1 million in Q2. The company projects that long-term annual carbon revenues could exceed $30 million as it optimizes its carbon accounting and trading systems.

Gevo’s carbon credits are certified under the Puro.Earth standard, ensuring over 1,000 years of permanence, among the most durable forms of carbon removal on the market. Its customers include Nasdaq and Biorecro, signaling growing confidence from corporate buyers in Gevo’s durable carbon removal capabilities.

Strategic Focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the main pillar of Gevo’s long-term strategy. Through its proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, the company converts renewable ethanol into low-carbon jet fuel, helping airlines decarbonize air travel.

Gevo plans a Final Investment Decision (FID) by mid-2026 for its upcoming ATJ-30 plant, a project designed to scale synthetic SAF production at its North Dakota site. Once completed, the plant could play a central role in meeting the aviation sector’s growing SAF demand.

SAF Market Forecast

The global SAF market is expanding rapidly. In 2025, the market was valued at about $2.25 billion but is forecasted to soar to $134.57 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of over 57 percent, according to industry estimates. This surge is driven by regulatory mandates, green aviation goals, and policies like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative.

Gevo’s integrated approach linking SAF production, ethanol output, and carbon monetization aligns perfectly with the industry’s transition toward net-zero aviation. As the company scales ethanol production to 75 million gallons annually, it expects a substantial boost in SAF output and carbon credit revenues.

Carbon Capture and Policy Incentives Drive Future Growth

The company capitalizes on the intersection of clean fuel policy, carbon markets, and technology innovation. By sequestering carbon at its ethanol facilities, the company captures and sells verified carbon credits while also producing renewable fuels that qualify for federal incentives.

With growing policy support and rising carbon prices, Gevo is positioned to benefit from both market-based carbon trading and tax credit monetization. The Section 45Z clean fuel credits, in particular, provide strong financial incentives that enhance the company’s margins and encourage further expansion.

As governments tighten emission standards and airlines commit to net-zero targets by 2050, the demand for SAF and durable carbon credits will continue to rise. Gevo’s technology and operations are built to meet this challenge while maintaining commercial viability.

Investor Confidence and Stock Performance

Following its strong Q3 2025 results, Gevo’s stock rose over 4 percent in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s growth trajectory. The stock trades around $2.12 per share with a market capitalization of about $513 million.

Investors are increasingly viewing Gevo as a clean-energy growth stock, citing:

The association also urged the EU to consider further incentives for the production and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF); recognizing the need for the development of viable solutions to decarbonize travel.

GBTA also asked for the recognition of the business travel sector as a key driver of progress in future EU travel and tourism policy initiatives, including the Sustainable Tourism Strategy that will be released next year.

With the European Commission’s announcement of a major investment plan to accelerate high-speed rail across the EU — including proposals to establish interoperability and data-sharing requirements for cross-border services — GBTA highlighted the importance of making rail a viable option for business travel, with better access to content, multimodal connections and clarity of refund and journey continuation rules.

These developments directly align with business travel imperatives: shorter transit times, improved connectivity between key business hubs and more reliable options to substitute flights with rail where feasible. GBTA views the modernised rail-network agenda as a major step toward a more efficient, sustainable travel environment for corporate travellers.

Suzanne Neufang, CEO of GBTA, said: “Business travel is a vital driver of economic growth, international collaboration and innovation. Our meetings in Brussels reflect GBTA’s long-standing commitment to shaping a policy environment that supports traveller mobility, sustainability and modernisation. We look forward to continued dialogue and partnership with EU leaders to ensure the business travel sector remains resilient and forward-looking.”

The GBP2 billion SAF plant is relocating from its Billingham site in Teesside to a neighbouring larger site in Seal Sands, just 500m from its original location.
“The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in SAF production,” said Alfanar UK Country Head, Noaman Al Adhami.
“Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world.
“We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms.","Global engineering firm, Alfanar, has confirmed plans to move its Lighthouse Green Fuels sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant to a new site in Teesside.

The GBP2 billion SAF plant is relocating from its Billingham site in Teesside to a neighbouring larger site in Seal Sands, just 500m from its original location. The new site will offer closer access to key infrastructure, including carbon capture and storage facilities, and has additional space for expanded on-site processing. It will also facilitate seamless integration of the SAF into the network once online. This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.

“The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in SAF production,” said Alfanar UK Country Head, Noaman Al Adhami.

“Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world. This relocation drives further operational and supply chain efficiencies and means we are better placed to increase production capacity in the future once the first phase of the project is underway.”

The project which is due to come online in 2030 aims to convert 1.5 million tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass feedstocks, including forestry, sawmill and agricultural residues in line with the UK SAF mandate, into more than 180 million litres of second-generation SAF. This is the equivalent of offsetting carbon emissions of 4,500 transatlantic flights from London to New York.

Commenting on Alfanar’s investment in Teesside during a visit to the engineering firm’s HQ on Monday 10 November, Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, said: “Teesside is leading the charge in the industries of the future and Alfanar’s GBP2 billion investment to build the world’s largest SAF plant is a clear signal of that leadership.

“We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms. Having a project of this scale built right her shows what we already know – that Teesside has the people, skills and drive to deliver groundbreaking projects like this.”",https://www.regionalgateway.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alfanar-Teesside-.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 16:02:27.056887

Innovation with a foundation to reestablish ethanol production in Minnesota while enabling Gevo to focus on advancing next-generation renewable fuel technologies that support the global transition toward a low-carbon economy.","Gevo, Inc., a leading renewable fuels and sustainable chemicals company, has officially announced the completion of its sale of Agri-Energy, LLC — a wholly owned subsidiary — to A.E. Innovation, LLC. The transaction marks a significant strategic step for Gevo as it continues to refine its portfolio and focus on core technology and innovation-driven projects. The deal includes the transfer of Agri’s ethanol production facility, which has an annual capacity of 18 million gallons, along with a portion of the adjacent property located in Luverne, Minnesota.

The sale represents a carefully planned divestment of a non-core asset by Gevo, yielding immediate and long-term financial benefits. The company has received $2 million in upfront cash from A.E. Innovation and is set to collect an additional $5 million in future cash installments. Importantly, the divestiture will also save Gevo approximately $3 million per year in idling and maintenance costs, improving operational efficiency and liquidity.

Despite selling the ethanol facility, Gevo has strategically retained ownership of its isobutanol-related production assets at the Luverne site. The company continues to hold approximately 30 acres of land, which include the critical infrastructure needed for the production of renewable isobutanol — a specialty product that serves as a key feedstock for chemicals, racing fuels, gasoline, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The retained assets allow Gevo to maintain its innovative fermentation technologies, capable of producing nearly 1 million gallons of low-carbon isobutanol annually.

On the buyer’s side, A.E. Innovation, a Minnesota-based agriculture-focused investment group, plans to revive ethanol production at the Luverne facility. The plant has been idle since March 2020, primarily due to market disruptions and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A.E. Innovation’s strategy involves not only restarting ethanol output but also transforming the site into an innovation hub. The company intends to make the facility accessible to other technology developers and clean-energy startups seeking to test, pilot, or scale new production methods within the biofuels and renewable chemicals sectors.

For Gevo, this transaction reinforces its broader corporate strategy of channeling resources toward high-value, technology-intensive operations. By retaining its proprietary isobutanol production systems, the company preserves its competitive edge in low-carbon fuel and chemical solutions, while freeing capital from non-essential assets. The sale also aligns with Gevo’s vision to expand its sustainable fuel production capabilities through scalable technologies and strategic partnerships.

Overall, the completion of the Luverne facility sale represents a mutually beneficial outcome — providing A.E.

Construction of the plant will commence in 2026, with COD in 2028. I have written before that SAF seems to be the most valuable fuel when measured in $ per MMBTU terms. Yet there's only that much UCO available to produce SAF via the prevalent HEFA pathway. The world will soon need to move to other feedstock to produce the required amount of SAF as more and more countries implement SAF mandates. Eg Singapore will target a 1% SAF blend for all departing flights from 2026, rising to 3-5% by 2030. Aether's Aurora technology can create sustainable fuels from any feedstock that can be converted to CO, CO2, and/or CH4. Feedstock flexibility is a key advantage. The company doesn't do the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) conversion. Instead, it focuses on the parts before and after FT, ie an electrified & intensified syngas generation, and an intensified upgrading of FT hydrocarbons. See Aether’s website for more details - https://lnkd.in/gW2Rt5B8 For Project Beacon, the feedstock will be industrial waste gases and biomethane and this will be turned into CORSIA certified SAF. The biomethane supply chain in the region is something Singapore hopes it can catalyse. Feedstock can of course also come from the gasification of the abundant biomass waste in Southeast Asia. Offtakers for Aether's SAF can be Singapore Airlines Group (for which Aether has a MOU - https://lnkd.in/gUUTyyrd) or perhaps CAAS in its procurement of SAF for the national blend mandate.

Airlander 10 is a new type of hybrid aircraft that uses a combination of aerostatic lift, aerodynamic lift, and vectored thrust, with a 10 tonne payload and 4,000 nautical mile maximum range. The initial Airlander 10 will be powered by four diesel engines, providing an emissions reduction of up to 90% when compared with comparable capacity aircraft. Integrating ZeroAvia’s hydrogen-electric propulsion will deliver full zero-emission in-flight operations carrying 100+ passengers, as well as reduced maintenance costs.

ZeroAvia’s first generation 600kW hydrogen-electric powertrain – ZA600 – has already passed several regulatory milestones, secured hundreds of pre-orders and signed up launch customer airlines who are working to embed the system into more traditional fixed-wing aircraft for lower cost and more environmentally friendly flight. The company has conducted flight testing of a prototype on board a 19-seat aircraft.

With ample space for hydrogen storage in the hull, the Airlander represents an excellent option for adopting the first generation of certified hydrogen technologies that are already close to market entry: hydrogen storage, low temperature PEM fuel cell power generation and electric propulsion systems that are well advanced in the certification journey. This partnership will build on HAV’s earlier R&D work to explore electric propulsion for Airlander.

As part of the agreement, the companies will also study the potential applicability of ZeroAvia’s hydrogen-electric technology to future larger aircraft developed by Hybrid Air Vehicles, and assess planned Airlander 10 operations to define the hydrogen fuel infrastructure requirements.

Tom Grundy, Hybrid Air Vehicles, said:

“ZeroAvia has led the development of hydrogen-electric propulsion systems and made impressive progress commercially, technically and with regulators. Our intention has always been to offer our customers a fully zero-emission variant of the Airlander, for efficiency and environmental reasons, and this partnership with ZeroAvia will help us in this direction.”

Val Miftakhov, Founder & CEO, ZeroAvia said:

“Airlander is another exciting airframe for line-fit of our powertrains as it can open up a whole new market in air travel due to its range, efficiency and ability to operate from almost anywhere. Like ZeroAvia, Hybrid Air Vehicles is an aerospace innovator with exciting manufacturing and growth plans for the UK that can deliver hundreds of well-paid jobs in different regions in the UK.”

This reduces exposure to UCO price volatility and feedstock scarcity - two binding constraints on global SAF scale-up.","Aether Fuels, a sustainable fuels technology company, has announced its partnership with Aster to develop the first next-gen, commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant in Southeast Asia, in Singapore. The facility will produce up to 2,000 tons per year of CORSIA-certified sustainable fuel per year by 2028, made from industrial waste and biomethane, with an expected 70% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions versus conventional jet fuel.

This plant is central to Singapore’s ambition to become a global SAF hub as airlines respond to emerging SAF blending mandates. It addresses the critical supply crunch limiting global SAF scaling: a lack of available ingredients needed for SAF.

Current SAF production is heavily dependent on used cooking oil (UCO) and other HEFA feedstocks, and with exports under pressure, the market is nearing a tipping point where demand exceeds supply. At the same time, CORSIA-eligible offsets are running low, making it harder for airlines to meet near-term emissions compliance.

Aether’s process broadens the feedstock pool, without competing for food or land, to include forestry, agricultural and industrial waste, which are abundant in Southeast Asia. This reduces exposure to UCO price volatility and feedstock scarcity - two binding constraints on global SAF scale-up.",,N,,2025-11-11 11:01:49.054850

The Project Beacon facility will be developed by climate technology start-up Aether Fuels and Aster, and produce up to 50 barrels a day – or 2,000 tonnes of fuel annually – when completed in 2028.

It will be located at Aster’s refining hub on Pulau Bukom, which the chemical, energy and infrastructure solutions company took over from Shell in April.

Aster and Aether Fuels, which inked their partnership on Nov 11, did not disclose their investment amount.

Before this, Aether Fuels – which has counted Temasek-owned Xora Innovation as its lead investor since 2022 – had a pilot plant in the United States.

The technology that Aether Fuels uses to produce the green aviation fuel yields 20 per cent more fuel while requiring only half as much investment in equipment compared with producing sustainable fuel using waste oils, according to Mr Conor Madigan, the company’s founder and chief executive.

The technology is also flexible as it can use various other raw materials.

Construction will begin in the second half of 2026, and the facility will employ 24 staff once operational.

A second, larger plant is also being planned in parallel with the initial facility. It can produce 1,000 barrels of the fuel per day, said Mr Madigan. This translates to an annual production of 330,000 tonnes.

Sustainable aviation fuel is jet fuel made from renewable or waste-based sources that produces lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil jet fuel.

Finnish energy giant Neste

operates a refinery in Tuas South

that can produce up to one million tonnes of such fuel from waste materials like used cooking oil and animal fats annually.

Aether Fuels’ technology uses industrial waste gases and biomethane to produce the fuel, which achieves a more than 70 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional jet fuel, according to the company . This approach is not as readily available as the technology used by Neste.

Sustainable aviation fuel is widely regarded as the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry, which contributes to 2.5 per cent of global carbon emissions, as it does not require aircraft modification or new airport infrastructure. The fuel is blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel before use.

The greener fuel is almost four times more expensive than fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Mr Madigan said that in August, sustainable aviation fuel cost between US$2,700 (S$3,517) and US$2,800 per tonne, compared with between US$700 and US$800 per tonne for conventional jet fuel.

He said Aether Fuels aims to narrow this price gap, although costs will still depend on factors beyond its control, such as the price of hydrogen and renewable energy, which is needed for production.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to form 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at the Changi and Seletar airports in 2026. On Nov 10, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced that from October 2026, passengers and cargo on departing flights from Singapore

will be subjected to a levy to fund

purchases of sustainable aviation fuel to meet this target.

In February 2025, SIA Group signed a memorandum of understanding with Aether Fuels to potentially buy the fuel for five years when Aether begins commercial production. The sustainable aviation fuel will be blended with regular jet fuel before being supplied to selected airports served by SIA and its subsidiary, Scoot.

In September 2024, JetBlue signed a non-binding agreement with Aether to potentially buy fuel when commercial production begins.

Speaking at Aster and Aether Fuels’ signing ceremony, Economic Development Board chairman Png Cheong Boon said the partnership reflects the ongoing transformation taking place in Singapore’s energy and chemicals sector.

He said the energy and chemicals sector accounts for about a quarter of Singapore’s manufacturing output and contributes 3 per cent to the country’s gross domestic product, making it one of the largest manufacturing sectors.

Singapore wants the industry to go green in step with global trends, and the Aster-Aether Fuels partnership aligns with the country’s vision for the industry and “helps steer the industry towards that goal”, he added.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/18685fca61ef00958f9cd347ca3dc93e325b3039b9910bac131f35e12920f851,N,,2025-11-11 09:56:20.593078

Ben Sampson: Hello, I’m Ben Sampson, editor of Aerospace Testing International, the world’s leading magazine dedicated to the application of testing, evaluation, and inspection in the aerospace industry.

Welcome to this episode of the Testing Talk Podcast from ATI

Sustainable aviation fuel SAF has risen up many people’s agenda’s again in aviation – as the number one way to reduce the sector’s emissions. I thought it would be a good time to speak to an expert about SAF from a technical point of view.

Francesco di Sabatino, who is a group leader in the Combustion for Power and Propulsion Group at the Southwest Research Institute is that expert. He and his researchers have just completed a test program comparing the performance and emissions of SAF, efuel and Jet A to each other, and plan to make the results public.

He has some early insights to share from the comparison and some thoughts on how we could enhance SAF to make it more appealing to aircraft operators that I think you will find interesting.

So now – wherever you are and whatever you are doing – it’s time to listen back to my interview with Francesco di Sabatino from the Southwest Research Institute.

Ben: Hello. I’m here today with Francesco Di Sabatino, who is from SWRI in Texas. Thanks for joining me today, Francesco. What’s the weather like in Texas? I bet it’s warm and sunny.

Francesco: Hello, Ben. Thanks. Thanks for having me. Yeah, yeah, it’s still kind of sunny, a little bit chill in the morning, We’re expecting a little bit of cold weather. but it’s getting very nice.

Ben: Great. We’re here to talk today about a project that you’ve recently done for SWRI, a research project. First, could you just tell me a little bit about yourself and about SWRI? Where the company sits? What it does? What you do for them?

Francesco: Sure. So I am a group leader here at Southwest Research Institute. I lead the Advanced Combustion for Power and Propulsion group. As the name says, we do a lot of stuff related to power and propulsion, mainly in the field of combustion. Southwest Research Institute is a non-profit organization, a research institution that’s been around for more than seventy years, always here in San Antonio. That is kind of in the center of Texas, more or less.

Southwest really does everything from deep sea to deep space. This is our model really. So we develop submersibles for the for the Navy, I believe, as well as spacecraft for NASA. Combustion is just a part of all this stuff. We really do a lot of a lot of different things.

And Southwest Research Institute lives in what we call the Valley of Death. So from TRL seven to eight. We help our clients to develop a product or we develop products for our clients to bring to commercialization. We do not sell any products. We do research for clients or the government.

Ben: So you’re not really blue skies research so much. It’s more research and testing which is closer to industry. Right?

Francesco: Correct. Although, we do have a very small part of our Institute that does basic research or science. But we mostly work with industry. Yes.

Ben: And now you’ve recently done a project about sustainable aviation fuel, which compared it to, e-fuels and normal jet fuel. Can you just talk me through that, what you did and why you did it? What you were trying to find out?

Francesco: Sure. So I’ve been exposed to sustainable aviation fuel before joining Southwest Research Institute, and I wanted to continue that research here as well, mainly because it showed me that there is a lot of like work that has to be done on SAF, right?

There are companies producing SAF, but the amount of information available in the literature is very limited. Mainly because all these companies are very protective of their products. So for engine testing the data available is very, very limited because lots of large OEMs don’t really want to share.

So the overarching idea was really to try to produce a data set that could be used by everybody in the world, to maybe help them develop new fuels. Or if they’re working on engine testing, as a starting point for that. When I started looking inside our Institute at who was working on SAF, I found groups working on SAF production as well as characterization, like for ASTM certification. I put together all these people to try to develop a project to produce a very complete data set to release to the public.

And that’s what we’ve achieved. We produced our own SAF that we then blended with Jet A and we characterized this blend. Plus we characterized commercially available SAF as well as commercially available Jet A, then we tested all three fuels in our jet engine. We measured engine performance and emissions, both gaseous and particulate. We noticed some interesting stuff, that will be published very soon in a paper. But again, the focus really is on producing a data set that can be used by anyone.

Ben: So you identified a lack of data and knowledge about SAF within industry, and you’ve attempted to fill that gap by producing your own fuels and then testing them all in-house. Right?

Francesco: Yes.

Ben: Okay. Fantastic. Alright. So can you tell me a little bit more about the production? Let’s talk about the testing in a moment, I mean, we’re interested in the results. But producing that amount of fuel, how did you go about that? You’re producing SAF and e-fuel, which is fuel from water, isn’t it? Using electrolysis?

Francesco: It can be, there can be a lot of different sources. So unfortunately, I cannot really talk about that technology because its proprietary, but I can guide you through the steps that we followed.

To start with we got a feedstock from a client that generously dontated it. Even getting a feedstock is not simple. It’s not something you can find online, for example, It’s very rare. Then we, hydrotreated that feedstock. And we produce liquid fuel out of that. We add the hydrogen and heat, and we have a Catalytic process. All of these remove the impurities of oxygen and other things that can be in the original feedstock.

After that we do isomerization. We try to improve the quality of the fuel. Because whatever you get from the first step is not the right quality. These processes improve quality until you get to the distillation, and that’s where you actually get the kind of quality that you need for putting it into a jet engine.

So that’s the process we followed. And, let me tell you it’s not a cheap process. Especially if you do it on a small scale. It’s expensive

Ben: Yeah, that was my question there, actually. But do you need a lot of fuel to do this?

Francesco: No, we don’t need a lot. We can do tests in our system with less than a barrel of fuel. So, fifty-five gallons, fifty gallons. So we didn’t have to produce a lot. Our blend ended up being around 15%, and 85% Jet A. So we didn’t really need a lot, but even that small amount was quite expensive because, we’re not producing the fuel at scale. We do have that capability. But we’re not doing it for that project. But, yeah, if you produce a small scale, it’s usually expensive.

Ben: So let’s talk a bit about the testing. I mean how did you do the testing? What tests did you put the different fuels through? How how did you ensure that you could compare the data sets from each fuel?

Francesco: Yes. So of course there are many ways that you can do these tests. We investigated different ways and had to settle with the one that was feasible for us. It might not be the best way of comparing the fuels, but that was working for us.

So the reality was that we were comparing different engine throttle conditions, so fixed throttle and just seeing how the engine does with the different fuels. Again there are other ways. This was the way we decided due to several limitations with our system.

We tested the three fuels one after the other. After each test we actually purge all the lines and try to purge the lines inside the engines with nitrogen as well as. We measured engine performance based on air flow rate through the engine, the rotational speeds of the compressor and turbine and pressure and temperature along the engines such as compressor discharge, turbine inlet and turbine outlet temperature, things like that.

We also measured gaseous emissions in terms of CO, CO2, oxygen, if you want to call that an emission, and NOx and sulfur oxides. We also measured particulate matter, volatile and non-volatile, specifically soot. and we also did a quite interesting analysis of soot particles. We put the soot particles we collected on specific filters then analyzed them with a scanning electron microscope. So we could go very into the details of the particulate and try to see exactly what the particulate looks like. Such as if there are any kinds of other components on the surface of the particle. So that’s what we’re done for testing.

Ben: What was the trickiest part? I mean, what was the cleverest part of the test to set up? Because you’ve got an engine running on a stand, right? A jet engine in the lab. Okay. And then, I mean, what was the trickiest part to get right or measure?

Francesco: Yes. I would say one thing was trying to get similar humidity levels, because humidity swings quite a lot here in Texas. But also trying to collect the exhaust gases very close to the engine was tricky for material compatibility. The gases were very hot as we were trying to collect them from the engine core and not from the dilution. So, to really have whatever was coming out from the combustor. And for that, we had to kind of design a custom-made probe that we installed just outside the engine.

Ben: Okay. So what? what did you find out ? Was there any differences or anything that surprised you between the emissions of each type of fuel?

Francesco: Honestly, lots of them were expected. So in terms of engine performance, we didn’t see substantial differences between the fuels. But again, that was expected because SAF blends are designed to be dropped in, so are designed to be somewhat similar to jet fuel.

What we observed in terms of emission was that sulfur emissions were much, much smaller compared to Jet A. That was kind of expected because the sulfur in the fuel comes from oil. So it’s present in the process to get jet fuel. while that’s not the case for SAF, right? There’s no sulfur to begin with, so sulfur levels to begin with in the fuel were very limited.

Another thing we observed is that soot particles where substantially less than expected, because the aromatics content was less for the SAF. We observed different, NOx emissions. That was somewhat unexpected. We are still working on trying to understand why that was the case. But we observed substantial difference between NOx, Jet A and SAF. So that’s a very interesting result, and we are still investigating why that is the case.

Unfortunately, our system didn’t have a lot of access to the actual combustion process, because it happens inside the engine. So we are we have limited information about what is going on with the combustion itself, where the NOx is formed. So that’s why it’s taking a little longer to understand why we have these differences in NOx.

Ben: You had an e-fuel you were testing as well. Are you describing the e-fuel as SAF? And was there any differences between the fuel that you made?

Francesco: So compared to the commercially available stuff that we bought on the market, there was some small differences. But the end product is very similar. Right? It’s not like we are getting something that is jet fuel like, it is jet fuel. So we were not expecting a substantial difference.

Ben: So in terms of the composition of this fuel and the composition of the emissions and particulates that you’re getting. You’re really just seeing environmental benefits at this level.

Francesco: Correct. But I would say I want to add one thing. I think here we really have a kind of an opportunity. Right. Because right now we are trying to create SAF to be exactly like jet fuel. But we practically have full control on the composition of the fuel. So why not produce this fuel in such a way that can enhance the performance of the engine? Maybe you will end up with like less fuel consumption. So overall you get lower emissions and more efficiency. I know that this is may not possible at the moment for safety reasons. but there is an opportunity here and I think, we should look at that in the future and say, okay, maybe we should move away from trying to be exactly the same as a Jet A and try to generate a fuel that has better performance.

Ben: How might you do that?

Francesco: I mean, you can definitely control the chemical composition of your fuel, right? So you can change the performance and fuel is composed by major components such as alkanes, aromatics. I’m not a chemical engineer but I’m somewhat familiar with that. You can change the relative percentages to get better performance. However, we’re probably like several years, maybe decades away from that. But I just want to highlight that, we are looking into making something that is same as Jet A, but maybe we should look at something that is better than Jet A.

Ben: So will you be doing any follow up studies or research ?

Francesco: So yes, we will. I cannot really talk about the details, but we have follow-up studies next year, 2026. And we are also establishing a more structured program here at Southwest to keep working on stuff like this all together. The various groups that participated will maybe in the future be organizing a workshop here on site, and try to bring people from the various aspects of SAF, like production, characterization and testing on site, put them in the same room and try to come up with good results there.

Ben: So what’s the main message? The main implication? That you would say there is no real difference between these types of fuels for airplane operators?

Francesco: In terms of performance yes, there is no main differences. Right. But that’s by design, right? That’s how the SAF has been designed in past years in terms of mission. There is a difference for the environment, right? So we definitely should keep pushing them. I think I forgot to mention, we don’t have an explanation for this at the moment, but also the smell of burning stuff and burning Jet A was different. There was much less smell from burning it than burning Jet A. So that’s also a good thing for the airport, and for whoever lives around the airport.

But the message here is really, we need to keep working on stuff. We need to keep developing data sets that can be used by everybody. I’m really advocating for sharing data, because to me, that’s the only way of getting to a point that you can demonstrate that this stuff is valuable and it gives less emissions. So it’s good for everybody.

Ben: Thanks, Francesco. It’s a really interesting study, and I’m pleased we’ve been able to catch up about it. I just got a one or two final questions really about the more general landscape of the industry.

Francesco: Yeah,

Ben: There’s some tough questions that perhaps are beyond me and you answering over the next couple of minutes at least. But I just wouldn’t mind your thoughts on them if that’s okay. I mean there are some barriers to the introduction of SAF, that aren’t perhaps engineering-related. I mean, I’m talking here mainly about the cost and incentives to scale up. Do you see SAF in general for the industry as a practical way to reduce emissions? Do you think it’s a good idea that we can do?

Francesco: Yes. I think we should look at all technologies, and see which one is the most valuable.

From my experience SAF seems to be the only way right now. The other options, for example, hydrogen dibt seems to be very feasible at this stage. SAF is exactly the same as Jet A, and we know how to use Jet A. We know how to handle SAF, so it seems to be the way.

However, in my opinion, we need to create a market for SAF and the market is not really there yet. That’s one of the reasons why the price of it is very high. Even getting a new production facility is extremely expensive. If there is no market for the SAF its because we’re not creating it, then there’s no way we’re going to use it. The market can be created by incentives from the government. For example in Europe there are mandates for that. That’s one way. But without a market for SAF it’s going to stay too expensive and airlines won’t be able to afford it. If they are able to afford it, then the customer will have to pay for it. And I don’t know if people are willing to pay maybe two or three times the cost of the ticket for SAF.

Ben: So going back to what you just said about at the moment we’re trying to match as a drop in fuel. Do you think there’s real scope to make SAF even better than jet fuel? You know, that could be a way to tempt people to use it.

Francesco: Yes. That could be one way. Sure. I think that’s, that’s a good idea. However again because of the cost it probably won’t be competitive anyway. So again I think it’s good to make it. But we should make it better. But we should also think about the cost of making it.

Ben: Just finally, do you think there’s any, you mentioned some of the ASTM standards that you were working towards. And do you think do you think there’s anything different that they could do to help it?

Francesco: I know. I think it’s very difficult. Because safety is paramount. There’s nothing more important than safety for an aircraft. And that’s sticking for a very long time. So the industry has been risk averse since it was born. So I think the combination of all these things makes things go slowly, but maybe it’s a good thing they are going slowly, right? Because then we are sure that we’re going to get a product that is safe and can be used properly. But this safety also comes with this cost. So again, it’s all about balance with these factors.

Ben: But studies like yours help to increase awareness that the fuel can be used and is harmless in aircraft. And, well, it’s harmless in aircraft and with environmental benefits beyond normal jet fuel.

Francesco: Yes, correct. That’s my idea as well. Right. To just to show the benefits, to show this with real measurements, proper measurement that shows the emissions are less with the same performance. That’s one of the main goals of the project.

Ben: So will the data be freely available at some point?

Francesco: Yes. It’s going to be open source. As soon as the paper is published. We are going to also publish it on our website and all the other things. So people, will we have free access to it.

Ben: You know what? That will be not to put pressure on you.

Francesco: Yeah it’s a very large paper. So it takes time.

Ben: All right. Great. Okay. Well, Francesca, thank you again for your time and talking me through the project that you’ve just done. It’s very interesting. I’m sure our listeners or our readers will find it very interesting, too. So. Yeah. Great. Bye

Francesco: Thank you.

Ben: Bye.

Aviation represents 2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is extremely hard to decarbonize. One potential solution is sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) made from renewable feedstocks. But some of these feedstocks come with their own problems – biofuel crops can displace natural ecosystems or food crops, for example.

That has produced a surge of interest in making fuel from various forms of waste. “There is a wealth of organic waste deserving our attention,” says study team member Michael McElroy, professor of environmental studies at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Using these wastes as feedstocks could reduce the cost of the decarbonization transition for hard-to-abate sectors.”

Municipal solid waste is a great potential feedstock because there’s already a collection system for it and it’s abundant all year round. But trash-based fuel hasn’t been the subject of much research. The new analysis is the first to use real-world data from commercial facilities involved in various production steps to calculate the potential of this approach at a global scale.

Making fuel from trash is challenging because the material is so heterogeneous. That means more steps and more energy used for manufacturing and refining the fuel. Still, the international team of U.S. and Chinese researchers calculated that globally, more than 62.5 billion liters of trash-based jet fuel could be produced each year. Incorporating it into the aviation fuel supply would reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the industry by 16%.

The initial step of turning solid waste into a mix of gases emerged as particularly tricky. “Gasification technology remains a core technical challenge in biomass energy development,” says study team member Ming Zhao, professor of environmental engineering at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. “Its reliability and efficiency are crucial to the sustainability of green fuel synthesis, and progress on low-carbon fuels, whether methanol or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, depends on advancing this process.”

But researchers are working to improve gasification and other processes involved in making SAFs. In a separate study, researchers at the University of Illinois developed a new method for making jet fuel from food waste, which comprises the largest share of municipal solid waste in many areas (2).

It’s pretty easy to turn food waste into a high-energy liquid fuel through a process known as hydrothermal liquefaction. The problem is that this biocrude oil has a varied chemical composition, but the jet fuel needs to be uniform and extremely precise.

The researchers tested dozens of chemical catalysts for refining the biocrude and hit upon one containing the elements cobalt and molybdenum that can do the job in a single step, resulting in jet fuel that meets current industry standards.

While the result could be fine-tuned further, the researchers say it is the first food-waste-based jet fuel that could be used directly in airplanes without needing to be blended with fossil-based jet fuel.

The food-waste biocrude could also be refined into gasoline and diesel fuel, the researchers say. But while both food waste and municipal solid waste could be part of the solution to SAFs, neither is sufficient to replace conventional jet fuel completely – a sobering reminder of just how much fuel airplanes (and other fossil-based forms of transportation) burn.

Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise; unlike road transport, aircraft cannot realistically switch to electric or hydrogen propulsion at scale in the near term. That makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) — and the next generation of synthetic SAFs (eSAF) — the most viable path for deep emissions cuts this decade.

SAFs can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% while working seamlessly with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. Yet despite this potential, SAFs today represent only around 2% of European jet fuel use. While the current supply is sufficient to meet demand, high production costs remain a significant barrier.

Conventional jet fuel trades currently at roughly US$600/t, compared with around US$2000 for SAF and US$7500 for eSAF. Producers need firm investment decisions now to expand capacity by 2030, but airlines remain cautious about long-term offtake agreements at these prices.

“No single fuel will dominate aviation in the decades ahead,” says Axel Vanmeulder, Renewable Fuels Expert. “Even in the most optimistic scenarios, fossil fuels remain part of the mix. But sustainable aviation fuel is by far the most viable option for the sector in the next twenty years.”

Overcoming the barriers to SAF adoption

The bottlenecks are clear and interconnected:

Feedstock limits: bio-based SAFs derived from used cooking oils, food waste, and other residues will reach their practical limits between 2030 and 2040. Beyond that, scaling eSAF production using renewable hydrogen and captured carbon will be vital. This makes early planning for synthetic fuels essential to avoid future shortages.

Price gap: SAF today costs roughly three times more than fossil jet fuel, and eSAF is currently more than 10 times as expensive, making long-term offtake agreements difficult to secure.

Investment risk: producers face multi-billion-dollar capital commitments years before revenues flow. Without credible offtake deals or policy certainty, projects remain financially unviable.

Policy instability: airlines and producers need predictable, long-term frameworks. Sudden changes in mandates or incentives can delay projects and reduce investor confidence.

Credibility: “Supply chains need watertight certification and audits,” notes Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of greenwashing — like palm oil being passed off as waste oil — the entire market risks losing trust.

“The cost gap is the biggest barrier. Jet fuel today trades around US$600/t, SAF is about US$2000, and synthetic SAF is closer to US$7500. Airlines are hesitant to sign long-term offtake agreements at those levels and with these price gaps, yet without them producers can’t move forward with investment decisions.

“Feedstocks like used cooking oil and food waste can only take us so far — they’ll reach their limits by 2030 – 2040. That’s why synthetic fuels, made from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon, are already being written into future mandates.”

Regulation: driving change and creating demand

Regulation is now the sharpest lever for transformation. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF blending, rising from 2% in 2025 to 6% by 2030¹, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050¹. Within this framework, a sub-mandate requires eSAF to reach 1.2% of total supply by 2030 — a critical measure for synthetic fuel growth. This sharp increase could flip today’s surplus into a shortage unless projects are financed and built in advance.

“The step-up in 2030 is significant,” Axel Vanmeulder explains. “In Europe, the SAF mandate jumps from 2% to 6% overnight. That could turn today’s oversupply into a shortage if projects aren’t built now.”

In the UK, the forthcoming SAF Mandate follows a similar trajectory, beginning at 2% in 2025 and climbing to 10% by 2030², with future rises to 22% by 2040². The UK’s alignment with Europe ensures a consistent market signal across two major aviation regions.

Globally, the CORSIA scheme (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) developed by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), requires airlines to offset emissions above 2019 levels³ on international flights. Though less demanding than EU rules, CORSIA establishes a global baseline, ensuring that airlines cannot ignore their emissions.

“CORSIA is a global floor — it ensures airlines can’t ignore their emissions on international flights. European mandates go further, but CORSIA makes carbon pricing and fuel transition unavoidable for every carrier worldwide.”

Beyond Europe, countries including China, Singapore, and India are developing their own SAF mandates — signalling that the transition is global and irreversible. Harmonised standards will be critical to reduce complexity and costs for airlines operating internationally.

Corporate momentum: industry taking flight

Major airlines and energy producers are already demonstrating that SAF is viable today:

Lufthansa Group is using SAF derived from used cooking oils and waste residues, achieving lifecycle emission cuts of around 80%.

JetBlue Airways has secured regular SAF supplies at key US airports, supported by corporate partners sharing the cost premium.

United Airlines has launched a dedicated investment fund to scale future SAF production.

In the UK, the RAF is deploying renewable HVO fuel across its operations4 — proof that sustainable fuels can deliver both performance and carbon reductions.

These examples show that with policy clarity, investment, and collaboration, SAF adoption is already creating tangible operational and environmental benefits.

Government and industry collaboration: lessons from fusion

Large-scale coordination between governments and industry can accelerate the deployment of breakthrough energy technologies. A prominent example outside aviation is the international nuclear fusion project, where over 20 countries are collaborating in a multi-billion-dollar experiment5 to demonstrate a proof of concept.

This demonstrates the potential for global cooperation to overcome technical and financial barriers, a model that could be applied to scaling SAF. Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.

Challenges and market realities: learning from setbacks

While SAF adoption is critical, the sector faces economic and operational hurdles. Shell’s decision to cancel its Rotterdam biofuels plant provides a stark example. The facility was planned to produce up to 820 000 t of biofuels, half intended for SAF from waste cooking oils and animal fat, but after technical delays5 and market reassessments, the project was deemed “insufficiently competitive” and scrapped.

This highlights the complex interplay of cost, investment risk, and policy stability. Even technically viable projects can fail if SAF prices are too high, if airlines delay offtake agreements, or if government incentives are unclear. The consequences are significant: delayed projects reduce near-term SAF supply, potentially jeopardising Europe’s ReFuelEU 2030 targets, and signal to investors that high-capital projects require stronger policy backing.

The Shell example reinforces the need for predictable, long-term frameworks, coordinated action, and financial mechanisms like Contracts for Difference. Without these, the SAF transition risks slowing just when demand is set to increase sharply.

Policy tools to bridge the cost gap

To reach ReFuelEU’s 2030 targets, producers must begin building large-scale plants now. Yet financing remains difficult without predictable regulation or price support. Policy shifts or delayed mandates could trigger shortages just as demand accelerates.

“Contracts for Difference are one of the most effective tools available,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “They give producers confidence to build multi-billion-dollar plants today by bridging the gap between the high cost of production and what airlines are willing to pay in the future.”

Government-backed instruments like Contracts for Difference and carbon price guarantees can de-risk investment by ensuring stable revenues. Without such mechanisms, projects will struggle to reach final investment decisions — putting 2030 supply goals at risk.

Maintaining credibility and momentum

As the SAF sector scales, maintaining market integrity is essential. Rigorous certification and transparent auditing must underpin every link in the value chain to prevent reputational damage and ensure real emission reductions.

“Credibility is everything,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of weak certification or greenwashing, the entire market loses trust.”

Looking ahead: building an energy transition in motion

Pilot programmes are already demonstrating SAF’s technical viability, while rapid innovation in hydrogen-based and synthetic fuels is expanding future feedstock options. The transition must now move from pilot to scale.

Over the next decade, SAF will be central to global flight decarbonisation. The challenge — and opportunity — is ensuring policy, finance, and technology progress in lockstep.

CFP Energy and industry partners are calling for:

Consistent, long-term regulation that gives investors and airlines confidence.

Clear certification standards to protect market credibility.

Sustained investment incentives to bridge the cost gap.

“We need to treat this as an energy transition in motion, not one waiting to happen,” concludes Axel Vanmeulder.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced the introduction of a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy for all departing passengers, as well as outbound cargo shipments and general and business aviation flights.

The levy is due to come into effect on flights departing Singapore from 1 October 2026 and will be payable on all air tickets or other aviation services sold from 1 April 2026.

In doing so, Singapore will become the first country worldwide to introduce this type of surcharge in the name of sustainability.

The origins of the new SAF levy

In 2024, CAAS launched the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which set out Singapore’s approach to the long-term, sustainable growth of Singapore’s aviation sector.

Under the Blueprint, CAAS said it intended to work with aviation stakeholders to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

In February 2024, as part of that strategy, the CAAS unveiled its plan to introduce a new levy aimed at decarbonising airline operations. Specifically, the levy is being introduced to support the country’s goal of having 1% of all jet fuel used at the city-state’s Changi and Seletar Airports come from SAF by 2026.

This figure is planned to increase further to 3-5% by 2030, depending on “global developments and the wider availability and adoption” of SAF.

How is the levy to be calculated?

The quantum of the SAF levy is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1% SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending, and delivery.

As longer passenger flights consume more fuel, the SAF levy varies based on the distance travelled. For simplicity and ease of administration, all destinations from Singapore are grouped into four geographical bands.

For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore. The bands include the following county groups –

Band 1 – Southeast Asia

Band 2 – Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea

Band 3 – Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands, New Zealand

Band 4 – Americas

The SAF Levy for passengers will be set on a per-passenger basis and varies based on the distance travelled (as classified by the four geographical bands). It will also be set according to cabin of travel, with economy and premium economy class as one group (“Economy”), while business and first class travel are also clubbed together (“Premium”).

According to CAAS, the SAF levy for the Premium cabins will be four times that for the Economy cabins or the same geographical band, for calculating the carbon emissions of passengers in different cabins of travel.

For example, the levy on a flight to a Southeast Asian destination will be S$1 in the Economy category, versus S$4 for a Premium ticket on the same route. On the longest Band 4 flight, a passenger will pay a levy amount of S$10.40 against the $41.60 paid by a Premium passenger.

Airlines have been instructed by CAAS to collect the SAF levy themselves at the point of ticket sale and must also display the SAF levy as a distinct line item on the passenger’s ticket price summary.

The CAAS notes that the SAF levy will only apply to passengers who are travelling on origin-to-destination flights and not those simply transiting through Singapore.

CAAS had previously estimated the SAF levy to be around S$3.00, S$6.00, and S$16.00 for a passenger in economy class travelling direct to Bangkok, Tokyo, and London, respectively.

The actual SAF levy amounts for Economy tickets to these same destinations are now to be charged at S$1.00, S$2.80, and S$6.40, respectively. The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made, said the CAAS.

SAF levy for cargo shipments

It is not just passenger flights that will be affected by the new levy. Origin-destination cargo shipments are also set to be affected, with the levy being charged on a per-kilogram basis and varying based on the distance travelled, again using the four geographical bands set out above.

The aircraft operator will collect the SAF levy from the customer and must display the SAF Levy as a distinct line item on the air cargo contract. Sample rates show that the charges to be imposed vary from S$0.01 per kilogram on a Band 1 flight, through to S$0.15 per kilogram for a Band 4 flight.

Business and general aviation flights are also affected

The SAF levy for general and business aviation flights is charged on a per-aircraft basis and varies based on the distance travelled, categorised by the four geographical bands.

The amount is also calculated as a function of an aircraft’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) official codes (A-F) for aircraft wingspan, which serve as a proxy for aircraft size.

The levies to be charged will vary from S$40 for a six-seat Cessna C404 Titan flying to a Band 1 destination to S$1,950 for a Gulfstream 6000 travelling between Singapore and a Band 4 destination.

However, the CAAS advises that certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF levy.

How the SAF levy will be collected

All the funds collected through the imposition of the SAF levy will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS. In turn, the fund will subsequently be used solely for the purchase of SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes, said CAAS, and would and to cover the associated administrative costs.

“The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) will manage the procurement, allocation, and administration of SAF and EAs, to get the best value for money and ensure transparency and accountability in the use of the fund,” said a CAAS statement.

“CAAS will continue to engage airlines, aircraft operators, and other industry stakeholders in the coming weeks and work with them on implementation,” the statement added.

Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, said, “The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub.”

“It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost that is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses, and the public time to adjust.”

Passengers may not pay the whole levy

However, operating airlines may likely swallow some of the impact of the new levy being charged, to ensure that their flights from Singapore remain competitive.

Thus, although the levy may be S$10.40 on an economy flight to the US, the passenger is unlikely to bear this whole charge on their ticket price.

Instead, airlines may well adjust their base fares to keep the overall cost of tickets competitive, thereby absorbing some, if not all, of the levy. It is also worth noting that in the case of frequent flyer award tickets and other complimentary ticket types, the SAF levy will still apply and is likely to be picked up in full by the passenger, as with any other tax or surcharge.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_1504285675_Editorial_Use_Only-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-11-11 12:56:16.102513

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander told the Airlines 2025 conference in London on Monday that “the goal of SAF is to get more people in the skies, not price them out” by making air travel more sustainable.
“We simply cannot raise living standards, remove barriers to opportunity and deliver net zero without a thriving and sustainable aviation sector.” Alexander argued: “The demand for flight is only going in one direction.

“Initially focusing on London, it will streamline how airspace change proposals are handled, paving the way not just for additional flights, but for new technology such as air taxis and drones.”","The government has pledged the cost of incentives to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will mean “little or no change” to the cost of airfares.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander told the Airlines 2025 conference in London on Monday that “the goal of SAF is to get more people in the skies, not price them out” by making air travel more sustainable.

She said the government’s Revenue Certainty Mechanism for SAF producers would “ensure more UK SAF projects get off the ground” but insisted: “It includes safeguards so that airlines pay a fair market price for fuel and passengers see little to no change in the price of a ticket.”

The government launched a consultation on proposals for the mechanism last month. However, that made clear the costs would be passed “through the supply chain and on to consumers”.

Alexander listed a series of government promises to the industry, recalling that when she addressed the Airlines UK annual dinner in February, she “made clear the government’s ironclad commitment to aviation” and said: “Judge us on what we do.”

She noted the government had given the go ahead to “airport projects from London to Yorkshire” and claimed: “A new runway at Heathrow [is] closer than ever before.”

The transport secretary suggested: “In this government you finally have a partner you can trust.”

She insisted: “I’ve not got my fingers in my ears when CEOs talk to me about the UK’s competitiveness, reducing your cost burden or smoothing the transition to greener flight.

“We’re single-minded in our desire to remove those barriers holding you back.

“We simply cannot raise living standards, remove barriers to opportunity and deliver net zero without a thriving and sustainable aviation sector.”

Alexander argued: “The demand for flight is only going in one direction. If the UK is to seize its share of a growing global aviation market, then my job is to create the conditions for you to compete, to grow and to secure a more sustainable future.”

She said: “It beggars belief that for years the issue of capacity in London and the Southeast was kicked into the long grass.

“This government could have sat on its hands while claiming this was too difficult or too politically contentious. But we weren’t prepared to let that happen.

“It’s why I gave the green light to Luton’s expansion in April, followed by Gatwick’s north runway in September, sending a clear signal this government is taking the brakes off growth. Just a few weeks ago, I announced an update on Heathrow’s expansion.”

She promised “a decision on a third runway within this parliament”, saying the government’s ambition is for “flights taking off on a new runway by 2035” and insisted: “We’ll waste no more time getting major infrastructure projects off the ground.”

Alexander noted she is currently considering two schemes for expanding Heathrow and said: “I’ll decide on a single scheme review very soon.”

She also pledged to move as fast as possible on UK airspace modernisation, insisting: “I will ensure the UK Airspace Design Service is set up before the end of the year.

“Initially focusing on London, it will streamline how airspace change proposals are handled, paving the way not just for additional flights, but for new technology such as air taxis and drones.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/380/Heidi-Alexander1.webp,N,,2025-11-11 09:57:01.961175

When Alfanar evaluated its Lighthouse Green Fuels project it discovered the former INEOS Nitriles site in Seal Sands offered everything the initial plot lacked. The new location is only five hundred metres away but brings deeper quays, rail sidings and ample space. From feedstock pre-treatment to final fuel storage every stage will now sit within one integrated boundary. That design choice minimises truck movements and accelerates construction schedules.

Production Highlights

Phase one will process one point five million tonnes of forestry, sawmill and agricultural residues every year. The result will be more than one hundred eighty million litres of certified second generation Sustainable Aviation Fuel. When blended into airline tanks the supply offsets the carbon footprint of about four thousand five hundred transatlantic trips between London and New York. Because the plant sits close to a developing carbon capture pipeline, operators expect a two hundred percent lifecycle emissions reduction compared with conventional kerosene once sequestration begins.

Non-Obvious Insight

Locating the pretreatment units alongside the reactor provides a useful thermal advantage. Waste heat from the gasification stage can dry incoming biomass, lowering total energy demand and shielding the business model from volatile gas prices. This simple piece of engineering integration often hides in technical drawings yet delivers meaningful cost savings over decades.

Community Impact

Local leaders forecast thousands of high quality jobs in construction, operations and maintenance. Crucially, the initiative will anchor a new regional supply chain for biomass logistics, equipment fabrication and carbon management, further diversifying the Tees Valley economy.

Conclusion

Palm Oil’s Sustainability Advantage Palm oil’s efficiency makes it difficult to overlook.","Step into the future of energy and you may find an unlikely player at the heart of it: palm oil. Once viewed largely as an agricultural commodity, palm oil is now a cornerstone of renewable energy and industrial innovation. At the center of this transformation stands Indonesia, the world’s largest palm oil producer, whose unmatched capacity is powering clean energy programs and industrial growth across Asia.

Powering the Energy Transition

Palm oil is at the center of Indonesia’s biofuel revolution. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) noted that the country produced 18.5 billion liters of biodiesel in 2023 under its B35 program, which requires a 35 percent palm component in diesel. Expansion to B40 is already in preparation, ensuring stronger integration of biofuels into the national energy mix.

The global impact is evident. S&P Global Commodity Insights projects biodiesel mandates to increase palm oil demand by nearly 10 percent in 2025. For countries like Pakistan, which spends billions annually on petroleum imports, Indonesian biodiesel represents a credible alternative to strengthen energy security and reduce dependence on volatile fuel markets.

Beyond biodiesel, palm oil is being explored as a base for advanced biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). With global airlines under pressure to cut carbon emissions, palm oil’s role in powering aviation could emerge as a critical frontier for renewable energy innovation.

Expanding Industrial Frontiers

Palm oil’s industrial applications extend well beyond fuels. Bioplastics derived from palm oil are gaining traction as countries restrict single-use plastics. Palm-based polymers are being developed into packaging, automotive parts, and medical devices, offering biodegradable alternatives to petrochemicals.

The oleochemical industry, which uses palm oil to manufacture surfactants, detergents, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, is expected to grow at 7 percent annually until 2030, as per Grand View Research. Oleochemicals derived from palm oil are now a key raw material for renewable chemicals, enabling industries to decarbonize supply chains.

Lubricants represent another growth frontier. Research published on ResearchGate shows palm oil’s superior viscosity and biodegradability compared to mineral oils, making it a sustainable substitute for industries reliant on machinery and transport. In economies where agriculture and manufacturing dominate, palm oil–based lubricants not only lower dependence on petroleum imports but also contribute to emissions reduction targets.

Emerging applications include palm-based resins for construction, adhesives for packaging, and feedstock for hydrogenated biofuels, further proving palm oil’s versatility across industrial sectors.

Palm Oil’s Sustainability Advantage

Palm oil’s efficiency makes it difficult to overlook. Yale University’s Environmental Leadership & Training Initiative highlights that producing a tonne of palm oil requires four to ten times less land than soybean, sunflower, or rapeseed. This efficiency translates into lower resource pressure, strengthening palm oil’s positioning as a sustainable industrial input.

Indonesia has also invested heavily in climate-resilient production and replanting programs, making sustainability a competitive differentiator in global markets where buyers increasingly seek responsibly sourced materials.

Indonesia’s Volume Advantage

Indonesia dominates global supply. USDA data shows the country produced 46 million metric tonnes of crude palm oil in 2024, over 58 percent of the world’s total. This surplus enables Indonesia to meet domestic biodiesel goals while continuing to supply international markets, a flexibility its regional peers lack.

Bioenergy Times reported that Indonesia’s expanding biodiesel programs could absorb up to 12 million kiloliters of palm oil in 2025, nearly one-third of its biodiesel feedstock output. Despite rising domestic demand, Indonesia’s production scale ensures continued export availability. For major importers like Pakistan and India, this ability to balance internal demand with external commitments provides critical supply security.

Building Strategic Partnerships

Trade relationships between Indonesia and its import partners already yield significant benefits. But the real opportunity lies in extending these partnerships beyond traditional commodity trade.

South Asia’s energy resilience and industrial growth are increasingly tied to Indonesian palm oil. Future growth areas include investment in biodiesel blending facilities, the development of palm oil refinery infrastructure, and joint ventures in oleochemical and bioplastic manufacturing. Each of these sectors contributes directly to industrial modernization, green technology adoption, and employment creation, while reducing dependence on petroleum-based imports.

For Pakistan, deeper collaboration could mean moving from being solely an importer of crude palm oil to a co-investor in refining, advanced biofuel facilities, and downstream industries. Access to Indonesian expertise in processing and biodiesel technology would strengthen local capacity, while Indonesia benefits from reliable long-term demand and regional strategic alignment.

Entering Palm Oil’s Next Chapter

Palm oil is entering a new era, one where it is as central to energy and industry as it once was to agriculture. Indonesia, with unmatched scale and proactive policies, is leading this transition.

Engagement with Indonesian palm oil is about securing renewable energy options, building industrial supply chains, and fostering sustainable economic growth. As global biodiesel demand accelerates and industrial applications expand, from biofuels to bioplastics, Indonesia stands ready to provide both the volume and the reliability that partners require.

Palm oil has moved beyond raw commodity status to become tomorrow’s industrial foundation, with Indonesia at the forefront of this transformation.",https://gapki.id/en/dir-site/uploads/2025/11/palmoil_industry_sun_jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 08:56:56.729539

The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Foundation’s 2025 Sustainability Acceleration Challenge reveals that while more organizations are tracking and managing travel emissions, adoption of low-carbon solutions continues to lag.

The annual benchmark, developed with Accenture, gathered input from 285 corporations representing a combined business travel spend of $22 billion. The results, released during the GBTA + VDR Europe Conference in Hamburg, show a 20% increase in participation compared with 2024, signaling rising engagement. Yet the overall maturity score across companies improved only marginally—from 1.3 to 1.4 on a five-point scale—indicating slow progress in embedding sustainability within global travel programs.

Modest gains amid rising participation

The GBTA Foundation reported that smaller companies with travel budgets under $5 million have made notable strides in advancing sustainability initiatives, while larger programs exceeding $500 million in annual spend have regressed. The Financial, Banking and Insurance sector leads with a maturity score of 1.9, followed by Professional Services and Consulting at 1.7. These industries account for a significant portion of emissions tied to business travel.

Areas showing the most improvement include Sustainable Travel Policies, which rose from a 1.8 to 2.2 score, and Carbon Budgets, up from 0.5 to 0.7. Reporting and target-setting have also become more standard practice, with more firms integrating these mechanisms into their travel programs. However, tools that directly shape travel decisions—such as carbon fees or online booking tool (OBT) features designed to encourage greener choices—have shown little to no progress.

“Year two of our benchmark shows real engagement and growing commitment. But despite progress, greater urgency is needed,” said Delphine Millot, Senior Vice President, Advocacy and Sustainability, GBTA, and Managing Director, GBTA Foundation. “To future-proof business travel, companies must accelerate adoption of sustainable procurement practices and carbon management strategies to send a real signal to the market.”

Where companies are falling short

Despite growing awareness, the benchmark highlights three critical areas that require acceleration: influencing travel behavior, unifying demand for sustainable suppliers, and investing in emissions abatement technologies. Supplier sustainability assessments have increased, but more advanced measures—such as adopting GBTA Sustainable Procurement Standards or embedding sustainability clauses in contracts—remain static at a score of 1.2. Limited guidance and technology gaps continue to slow progress.

Investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) has grown modestly, with 15% of corporations purchasing SAF certificates in 2025, up from 12% last year. While this trend points to increased interest, adoption remains far from mainstream. GBTA encourages firms to use its SAF Corporate Connect program to support implementation and share best practices across the sector.

“The GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge provides a roadmap for the future,” said Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg, Global Travel & Aviation Sustainability Lead, Accenture. “With more companies participating, we’re seeing where the industry is moving forward, and where further collaboration can close the gap between ambition and action.”

According to GBTA, regional performance varied. Global and Asia-Pacific travel programs recorded slight improvements, while European and North American firms saw marginal declines, reflecting the influence of regulatory and economic uncertainty on travel policy advancement.

Recognizing leaders and innovators

To highlight progress, GBTA introduced the inaugural Acceleration Awards and Leaderboards recognizing companies that demonstrate leadership and measurable improvement in travel decarbonization. Winners include Kearney, BDO LLP, Parexel, University of California, IKEA, and Nokia across various global, regional, and industry categories. BDO LLP was named Europe’s Regional Leader for its sustainability-driven travel initiatives.

“BDO LLP are participating in the Acceleration Challenge to showcase our leadership in sustainable travel,” said Verity Phillips-Davies, Travel Manager at BDO LLP. “By innovating and advocating for impactful solutions, we aim to inspire industry-wide change and demonstrate how strategic engagement can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of business travel.”

Millot added: “These companies exemplify the leadership, innovation, and collaboration needed to transform business travel for a net-zero future. Their commitment to measurable progress shows what’s possible when sustainability becomes an integral part of corporate travel strategy.”

The GBTA Foundation continues to expand resources to help organizations transition from awareness to implementation through its Sustainable Business Travel Transition Pathway and new training on Sustainable Procurement Standards.

(NASDAQ: GEVO), a pioneer in bio-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is positioning itself at the forefront of this transition with its ATJ-30 jet fuel project. The company's third-quarter 2025 financial results and strategic roadmap suggest a clear-eyed focus on leveraging its Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology to capture a significant share of the rapidly expanding SAF market. With a projected $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA once operational, the ATJ-30 project represents both a financial milestone and a strategic bet on the future of low-carbon aviation.

Strategic Momentum in Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Gevo's ATJ-30 project is a cornerstone of its long-term strategy to capitalize on the surging demand for SAF. The U.S. bio-based SAF market is projected to grow from $420.04 million in 2024 to $4.77 billion by 2032, driven by airline commitments to carbon neutrality and regulatory tailwinds, according to a

. Over 90% of airlines now aim for at least 2% SAF use by 2025, creating a structural tailwind for producers like Gevo, according to the same OpenPR report.

The company's ATJ technology, which converts ethanol into renewable jet fuel, is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend. By leveraging its existing ethanol production infrastructure and corn supply chains, Gevo aims to achieve cost advantages over competitors. CEO Dr. Patrick Gruber emphasized that the ATJ-30 project, pending a Final Investment Decision (FID) by mid-2026, could add $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA once operational, as reported by

. This figure assumes robust demand from airlines and governments seeking to meet decarbonization targets, as well as successful integration of Gevo's production network, as noted in the same StockTitan report.

Carbon Credit Monetization: A Dual Revenue Stream

Gevo's financial flexibility is further bolstered by its aggressive monetization of carbon credits. In Q3 2025, the company generated $52 million from Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs) under the 45Z tax credit program, as reported by

. Additionally, a multi-year Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) offtake agreement is expected to yield $26 million over five years, according to the same Finimize report. These non-operational revenue streams are critical for funding capital expenditures and reducing reliance on volatile commodity markets.

The strategic value of carbon credits extends beyond immediate cash flow. By converting emissions reductions into tradable assets, Gevo aligns its business model with global sustainability frameworks. This approach not only enhances profitability but also strengthens its appeal to institutional investors prioritizing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria. As the U.S. government introduces new incentives for bio-based SAF adoption, Gevo's ability to scale carbon credit monetization could become a key differentiator in a competitive market, according to the OpenPR report.

Path to $150M Adjusted EBITDA: Risks and Realities

While the $150 million EBITDA target is ambitious, several factors could accelerate or hinder its realization. On the positive side, Gevo's Q3 2025 results demonstrated operational resilience, with $6.7 million in Adjusted EBITDA and $108.4 million in cash reserves, as reported by StockTitan. The company's focus on cost reduction and carbon co-products is also improving its balance sheet, according to Finimize. However, challenges remain.

First, the ATJ-30 project's success hinges on securing the FID by mid-2026 and obtaining a DOE loan guarantee extension, as Finimize noted. Delays in regulatory approvals or capital constraints could derail timelines. Second, the SAF market, while growing, is still nascent. Gevo must navigate pricing pressures and competition from emerging players like LanzaJet and SkyNRG, as reported in the OpenPR report. Finally, the conversion of carbon credits into cash depends on stable policy environments and market demand for carbon offsets-a variable that could shift with political cycles.

Conclusion: A High-Stakes Bet on the Future of Aviation

Gevo's ATJ-30 project encapsulates the dual forces of innovation and risk in the renewable energy sector. By targeting $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA, the company is betting on its ability to scale production, secure strategic partnerships, and monetize carbon assets in a market poised for explosive growth. While execution risks are significant, the alignment of industry trends, regulatory support, and Gevo's technological expertise suggests that this target is not merely aspirational-it is a calculated gamble on the future of sustainable aviation.

For investors, the key question is whether Gevo can maintain its strategic momentum while navigating the complexities of capital-intensive expansion. If the company succeeds, the rewards could be transformative-not just for its bottom line, but for the broader transition to a low-carbon economy.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1762829608080.jpg.png,N,,2025-11-11 08:57:11.945854

Construction of the plant, dubbed “Project Beacon”, will commence in 2026. It will begin commercial operations in 2028. The plant will be located at Aster’s refining hub on Pulau Bukom, which it took over from Shell in April.

The move comes amid a deal spree by Aster – a joint venture between Indonesia’s Chandra Asri and commodities trader Glencore.

Besides the Bukom refinery, the company also recently purchased Singapore’s Esso petrol stations and the Jurong Island assets of Shell and Chevron Phillips Singapore Chemicals.

Aster chief financial officer Andre Khor said that the sustainable aviation fuel plant is aligned with the deep-tech focus of its unit, Aster Ventures.

“The thesis driving up the investment is that… we are looking at deep tech to help address core industrial (needs), as well as next-generation energy solutions that are adjacent and synergistic with our energy, chemicals and infrastructure assets on the ground,” he said.

Khor was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the deal signing, held at Temasek Shophouse on Tuesday (Nov 11).

Project Beacon will use Aether’s proprietary technology to convert industrial waste gas, as well as biomethane, into sustainable aviation fuel.

This is a first for the region. Incumbent producers of this fuel, such as Neste, typically tap used cooking oil to produce it.

Aster will provide Aether with the waste carbon feedstock for fuel production, as well as renewable power, utilities and site support.

The output will be certified by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, a global initiative to decarbonise the aviation sector.

“Tonnes of interest”

Project Beacon will produce up to 50 barrels of fuel a day, or 2,000 tonnes a year. This comprises 1,600 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel and 400 tonnes of sustainable naphtha.

There will also be 24 full-time jobs created for the operation of the plant, said Aether’s founder and chief executive Conor Madigan. The startup separately plans to grow its Singapore headcount to 30, from two at present.

Based in Singapore and Chicago, Aether was incubated and funded in 2022 by Xora, a deep-tech venture firm backed by Temasek.

Speaking to The Business Times at Tuesday’s event, Madigan noted that there is a shortage of used cooking oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Aether aims to overcome this problem through its technology, which allows the fuel to be made from waste gases and other forms of waste carbon. With Project Beacon, the input will be gases from Aster’s refining processes.

“(That) allows us to get the feedstock we need in a super-steady stream and consistent flow… And so it really makes this project super simple. We have a rock solid feedstock supply, and it allows us to demonstrate a route to making fuels that we think is quite scalable,” he said.

In February, Singapore Airlines signed an agreement with Aether to potentially source sustainable aviation fuel from the startup.

Asked if the carrier will purchase the fuel from Project Beacon, Madigan would only say: “It is our intention that the offtake for this plant will be to a major airline. We hope to provide updates on that down the line.”

He also noted that there is “tonnes of interest throughout Asia” for offtake, especially as more governments mandate the use of the fuel.

Singapore, for instance, aims for sustainable aviation fuel to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Gevo topped revenue forecasts with $42.71 million in the third quarter of 2025, notching its second straight period of positive adjusted EBITDA and ramping up future plans through a fresh carbon credit agreement and expansion into green jet fuel.

What does this mean?

Gevo, the biofuels firm, logged sales that beat analyst expectations by over $3 million, with steady operations at its North Dakota and renewable natural gas facilities helping deliver another positive adjusted EBITDA. The company’s recent multi-year carbon credit deal will add $26 million over five years, boosting its efforts to diversify income and reinforce balance sheet strength. Selling its Agri-Energy subsidiary trimmed annual costs by $3 million, keeping things leaner. While Gevo still reported a net loss of $7.58 million and operating costs at $46.4 million, its roadmap to profitability looks clearer as it eyes a mid-2026 decision on a new alcohol-to-jet fuel plant and aims to hit $100 million in adjusted EBITDA by scaling up carbon co-products and trimming expenses.

Why should I care?

For markets: Positive signals fuel sector momentum.

Gevo’s stronger-than-expected numbers and upbeat analyst sentiment set it apart from much of the renewable fuels sector, where many companies are still rated 'hold.' The stock’s median 12-month price target sits at $2.63—a solid premium to recent trading levels—reflecting faith in Gevo’s diversification, tight cost controls, and push into sustainable aviation fuels as airlines step up their climate goals.

The bigger picture: Green fuel ambitions grow as industry evolves.

With major airlines and governments seeking more sustainable aviation fuel, innovations like Gevo’s alcohol-to-jet technology are quickly gaining steam. Carbon credits and growing co-product revenue streams are giving biofuel companies new ways to drive profits, positioning them at the center of both the global energy transition and business growth.

According to the SBTi, the new draft aims to enable more companies to set net zero goals by “making science-based climate action more accessible and actionable,” while simultaneously balancing the need to maintain alignment with global climate goals. Among the key changes introduced in the new draft is “a menu of options for companies to drive down their carbon footprint,” according to SBTi CEO David Kennedy, including multiple pathways allowed for target setting for direct emissions reductions, and clearer rules for the use of instruments such as carbon credits to reach decarbonization goals.

The SBTi was founded in 2015 with the goal to establish science-based environmental target setting as a standard corporate practice. The organizations’ key functions include defining and promoting best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science, providing technical assistance to companies who set science-based targets, and providing companies with independent assessment and validation of their emissions reduction targets. To date, nearly 12,000 companies have set science-based emissions reduction targets with the SBTi, or made commitments to do so.

The organization’s flagship first Corporate Net-Zero Standard was published in 2021, and the SBTi announced plans early last year to update the standard.

In March 2025, the SBTi released its initial draft of the new V2 standard, and launched a consultation into a series of the changes introduced, including proposals to add allow multiple methods for reaching emissions targets, require explicit Scope 2 (purchased energy) emissions targets, require large companies to set Scope 3 value chain emissions goals. The initial draft also included a consultation on options to address residual emissions on the pathway to net zero, including the introduction of interim carbon removal targets, as well as formally recognizing companies which are investing in Beyond Value Chain Mitigation (BVCM).

Following feedback from the first draft’s public consultation and expert working groups, the SBTi’s new draft further develops and refines the proposals, including an update to the key ambition for companies, changing from “Companies shall publicly commit to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050,” to “Companies shall set an ambition to transition their operations and value chains to align with the goal to be net-zero by no later than 2050,” with the SBTi noting that the new language avoids confusion from the word “commitment,” focusing instead on “the company’s overarching intention to reach net-zero by 2050.”

For direct operations Scope 1 emissions, the new draft introduces 3 approaches for target setting – including reducing emissions on a linear pathway to net-zero, increasing the share of low-carbon activities over time, and implementing Asset Decarbonization Plans to decarbonize assets based on technological readiness. The draft also adds some flexibility and clarity to Scope 2 target setting requirements, including maintaining requirements for all companies to set near-term targets, but making long-term targets optional for smaller companies, specifying criteria for near-term targets, adding mechanisms for limited amounts of electricity, heat, steam and cooling to be excluded from the near-term targets, and improved criteria for purchasing low carbon electricity.

The proposed updated standard’s Scope 3 approach focuses on addressing priority emissions sources that can have the greatest impact, while allowing flexibility, with the SBTi noting that value chain emissions have formed one of the most significant barriers to companies’ setting of science-based targets. The new draft increases focus from the initial draft on targeting the highest-priority emissions in the near-term while exclusions for lower-impact activities and areas where influence is limited, while also introducing three options for Scope 3 target setting – including “emissions intensity,” “activity alignment,” and “counterparty alignment” – noting that the options “reflect the diversity of value chain emissions and the different mitigation strategies companies use across their value chains.”

One of the key changes in the new draft is the formalization of the integration of the use of environmental attribute certificates (EACs), such as carbon credits or energy and commodity certificates, while including strict conditions. For example, Scope 2 targets can include matching using low-carbon electricity EACs that are purchased in the same region as the company’s electricity consumption, while Scope 3 targets may use EACs on a limited basis where direct supplier engagement or physical traceability is not feasible.

The SBTi’s new draft standard also adds a new recognition mechanism aimed at incentivizing companies by highlighting early, voluntary action to address ongoing emissions, introducing a “leadership” category, which includes large companies addressing 100% of their ongoing scope 1-3 emissions, or smaller companies addressing 100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

Additionally, the new draft also includes new requirements for large companies (or Category A companies, which include large companies in all countries and medium-sized companies in high-income countries), including a requirement for the publication of credible transition plans within 12 months of target validation, as well as to address an increasing portion of ongoing emissions, or those not yet reduced on the pathway towards net zero by 2050, from 2035 through a portfolio of carbon removals.

Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise; unlike road transport, aircraft cannot realistically switch to electric or hydrogen propulsion at scale in the near term. That makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) — and the next generation of synthetic SAFs (eSAF) — the most viable path for deep emissions cuts this decade.

SAFs can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% while working seamlessly with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. Yet despite this potential, SAFs today represent only around 2% of European jet fuel use. While the current supply is sufficient to meet demand, high production costs remain a significant barrier.

Conventional jet fuel trades currently at roughly US$600/t, compared with around US$2000 for SAF and US$7500 for eSAF. Producers need firm investment decisions now to expand capacity by 2030, but airlines remain cautious about long-term offtake agreements at these prices.

“No single fuel will dominate aviation in the decades ahead,” says Axel Vanmeulder, Renewable Fuels Expert. “Even in the most optimistic scenarios, fossil fuels remain part of the mix. But sustainable aviation fuel is by far the most viable option for the sector in the next twenty years.”

Overcoming the barriers to SAF adoption

The bottlenecks are clear and interconnected:

Feedstock limits: bio-based SAFs derived from used cooking oils, food waste, and other residues will reach their practical limits between 2030 and 2040. Beyond that, scaling eSAF production using renewable hydrogen and captured carbon will be vital. This makes early planning for synthetic fuels essential to avoid future shortages.

Price gap: SAF today costs roughly three times more than fossil jet fuel, and eSAF is currently more than 10 times as expensive, making long-term offtake agreements difficult to secure.

Investment risk: producers face multi-billion-dollar capital commitments years before revenues flow. Without credible offtake deals or policy certainty, projects remain financially unviable.

Policy instability: airlines and producers need predictable, long-term frameworks. Sudden changes in mandates or incentives can delay projects and reduce investor confidence.

Credibility: “Supply chains need watertight certification and audits,” notes Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of greenwashing — like palm oil being passed off as waste oil — the entire market risks losing trust.

“The cost gap is the biggest barrier. Jet fuel today trades around US$600/t, SAF is about US$2000, and synthetic SAF is closer to US$7500. Airlines are hesitant to sign long-term offtake agreements at those levels and with these price gaps, yet without them producers can’t move forward with investment decisions.

“Feedstocks like used cooking oil and food waste can only take us so far — they’ll reach their limits by 2030 – 2040. That’s why synthetic fuels, made from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon, are already being written into future mandates.”

Regulation: driving change and creating demand

Regulation is now the sharpest lever for transformation. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF blending, rising from 2% in 2025 to 6% by 2030¹, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050¹. Within this framework, a sub-mandate requires eSAF to reach 1.2% of total supply by 2030 — a critical measure for synthetic fuel growth. This sharp increase could flip today’s surplus into a shortage unless projects are financed and built in advance.

“The step-up in 2030 is significant,” Axel Vanmeulder explains. “In Europe, the SAF mandate jumps from 2% to 6% overnight. That could turn today’s oversupply into a shortage if projects aren’t built now.”

In the UK, the forthcoming SAF Mandate follows a similar trajectory, beginning at 2% in 2025 and climbing to 10% by 2030², with future rises to 22% by 2040². The UK’s alignment with Europe ensures a consistent market signal across two major aviation regions.

Globally, the CORSIA scheme (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) developed by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), requires airlines to offset emissions above 2019 levels³ on international flights. Though less demanding than EU rules, CORSIA establishes a global baseline, ensuring that airlines cannot ignore their emissions.

“CORSIA is a global floor — it ensures airlines can’t ignore their emissions on international flights. European mandates go further, but CORSIA makes carbon pricing and fuel transition unavoidable for every carrier worldwide.”

Beyond Europe, countries including China, Singapore, and India are developing their own SAF mandates — signalling that the transition is global and irreversible. Harmonised standards will be critical to reduce complexity and costs for airlines operating internationally.

Corporate momentum: industry taking flight

Major airlines and energy producers are already demonstrating that SAF is viable today:

Lufthansa Group is using SAF derived from used cooking oils and waste residues, achieving lifecycle emission cuts of around 80%.

JetBlue Airways has secured regular SAF supplies at key US airports, supported by corporate partners sharing the cost premium.

United Airlines has launched a dedicated investment fund to scale future SAF production.

In the UK, the RAF is deploying renewable HVO fuel across its operations4 — proof that sustainable fuels can deliver both performance and carbon reductions.

These examples show that with policy clarity, investment, and collaboration, SAF adoption is already creating tangible operational and environmental benefits.

Government and industry collaboration: lessons from fusion

Large-scale coordination between governments and industry can accelerate the deployment of breakthrough energy technologies. A prominent example outside aviation is the international nuclear fusion project, where over 20 countries are collaborating in a multi-billion-dollar experiment5 to demonstrate a proof of concept.

This demonstrates the potential for global cooperation to overcome technical and financial barriers, a model that could be applied to scaling SAF. Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.

Challenges and market realities: learning from setbacks

While SAF adoption is critical, the sector faces economic and operational hurdles. Shell’s decision to cancel its Rotterdam biofuels plant provides a stark example. The facility was planned to produce up to 820 000 t of biofuels, half intended for SAF from waste cooking oils and animal fat, but after technical delays5 and market reassessments, the project was deemed “insufficiently competitive” and scrapped.

This highlights the complex interplay of cost, investment risk, and policy stability. Even technically viable projects can fail if SAF prices are too high, if airlines delay offtake agreements, or if government incentives are unclear. The consequences are significant: delayed projects reduce near-term SAF supply, potentially jeopardising Europe’s ReFuelEU 2030 targets, and signal to investors that high-capital projects require stronger policy backing.

The Shell example reinforces the need for predictable, long-term frameworks, coordinated action, and financial mechanisms like Contracts for Difference. Without these, the SAF transition risks slowing just when demand is set to increase sharply.

Policy tools to bridge the cost gap

To reach ReFuelEU’s 2030 targets, producers must begin building large-scale plants now. Yet financing remains difficult without predictable regulation or price support. Policy shifts or delayed mandates could trigger shortages just as demand accelerates.

“Contracts for Difference are one of the most effective tools available,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “They give producers confidence to build multi-billion-dollar plants today by bridging the gap between the high cost of production and what airlines are willing to pay in the future.”

Government-backed instruments like Contracts for Difference and carbon price guarantees can de-risk investment by ensuring stable revenues. Without such mechanisms, projects will struggle to reach final investment decisions — putting 2030 supply goals at risk.

Maintaining credibility and momentum

As the SAF sector scales, maintaining market integrity is essential. Rigorous certification and transparent auditing must underpin every link in the value chain to prevent reputational damage and ensure real emission reductions.

“Credibility is everything,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of weak certification or greenwashing, the entire market loses trust.”

Looking ahead: building an energy transition in motion

Pilot programmes are already demonstrating SAF’s technical viability, while rapid innovation in hydrogen-based and synthetic fuels is expanding future feedstock options. The transition must now move from pilot to scale.

Over the next decade, SAF will be central to global flight decarbonisation. The challenge — and opportunity — is ensuring policy, finance, and technology progress in lockstep.

CFP Energy and industry partners are calling for:

Consistent, long-term regulation that gives investors and airlines confidence.

Clear certification standards to protect market credibility.

Sustained investment incentives to bridge the cost gap.

“We need to treat this as an energy transition in motion, not one waiting to happen,” concludes Axel Vanmeulder.

We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”","Singapore’s Ministry of Transport’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAAS) announced that it will be implementing a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy for travelers and cargo on all departing flights, starting in April 2026.

Fees will range from S$1.00 (USD$0.77) for an economy-class passenger on a short-range flight to S$41.60 (USD$31.95) for a business-class passenger on a Americas-bound flight.

The new SAF levy follows the launch by CAAS in February 2024 of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, outlining a series of key actions aimed at decarbonizing Singapore’s aviation sector with goals to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% by 2030, and to achieve net zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050. The blueprint included a requirement for all departing flights from Singapore to use SAF, beginning at 1% from 2026, and expected to increase in following years.

When it launched the blueprint, CAAS said that use of SAF is anticipated to contribute nearly two thirds of the emissions reductions required for the sector to reach net zero by 2050.

The introduction of the levy forms part of the blueprint’s initiatives aimed at building an SAF ecosystem. The levy is based on the distance travelled by the flight, and the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1% SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending, and delivery

While CAAS had originally estimated the levy for economy class passengers to be S$3.00, S$6.00, and S$16.00 for flights to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively, the actual fee to be charged will be substantially lower – at S$1.00, S$2.80, and S$6.40 to each destination, respectively – due to the lower cost of SAF since the estimates were released early last year.

The new system will also introduce levies on cargo on a per-kilogram basis, also based on distance travelled, as well as on business aviation flights on a per aircraft basis, based on aircraft type and distance travelled. A Gulfstream G650 flying to London, for example, would be charged a levy of S$1,200.

According to CAAS, the levies collected will go into a statutory SAF Fund, which will be used solely for the purchase of SAF and SAF environmental attributes, and to cover related administration costs.

CAAS General Director Mr Han Kok Juan said:

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Airport-Singapore2.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 05:56:39.496342

Singapore will soon introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy of up to S$41.60 (around $31.95 or Rs 3,690) per passenger beginning next year, marking a significant step in its efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that the levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing from October 1, 2026. Passengers transiting through Singapore will be exempt from the charge. Under the new system, the amount of levy will vary depending on travel class and route distance. Economy and premium economy travellers will pay S$1 for short-haul trips within Southeast Asia and S$10.40 for flights to the Americas. Business and first-class passengers will be charged four times that amount, reported Bloomberg. Cargo flights will also face a separate fee, calculated by weight. The funds raised through this levy will support the centralised purchase of sustainable aviation fuel — typically produced from waste oils or agricultural feedstock — as part of Singapore’s plan to achieve an SAF adoption rate of 3–5% by 2030. According to CAAS, a drop in SAF costs has allowed the levy to remain lower than earlier projections, which had estimated rates between S$3 and S$16. Singapore becomes the first country in the world to impose a passenger-based green fuel tax — a move especially notable given its position as a major global aviation hub. Changi Airport is on track for a record year, with passenger traffic expected to surpass its pre-pandemic peak of 68.3 million in 2019. Although aviation contributes only around 1.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, as per the European Commission cited by Bloomberg, the industry continues to face significant challenges in cutting emissions due to limited SAF availability and high production costs. The International Air Transport Association noted that while global SAF production doubled last year, it still accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel volumes. Singapore’s announcement coincides with the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, where nearly 200 countries are discussing measures to strengthen global climate action.

The Green Route inaugural flight took place on Thursday, 6th November, at Suvarnabhumi Airport in the presence of key representatives from both the public and private sectors.

Attendees included Vietnamese ambassador to Thailand Pham Viet Hung, Ambassador of Vietnam to Thailand; Panya Chupanit, director-general of the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning, Ministry of Transport; and Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand director-general Manat Chavanaprayoon among others.

TAT governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool remarked at the event: “TAT commends VietJet Thailand for its leadership in integrating sustainability into commercial aviation. This milestone demonstrates how the aviation sector can play a pivotal role in promoting responsible travel and supporting Thailand’s national target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. It is a meaningful step towards building a low-carbon society and strengthening Thailand’s position as a regional leader in sustainable tourism.”

This maiden flight makes Vietjet Thailand the country’s first low-cost carrier service on this route powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This initiative also underscores Thailand’s commitment to sustainable tourism and supports the aviation industry’s transition towards cleaner, low-carbon operations across ASEAN.

Putting the sustainable tourism agenda forward

Kiatphaibool added that TAT continues to advance sustainable tourism through initiatives such as the Thailand Tourism Awards, CF-Hotels, Sustainable Tourism Acceleration Rating (STAR), and the Krabi Prototype project.

These programmes guide tourism operators towards greener practices and reinforce TAT’s mission to position Thailand as a trusted, value-driven destination for responsible travellers.

The Green Route collaboration between VietJet, and PTT OR exemplifies how cross-sector partnerships can drive sustainable mobility and enhance Thailand’s reputation as a leader in sustainable travel and low-carbon tourism.

Integrating sustainability into commercial aviation

Under its Fly Green programme which aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, VietJet Thailand became the country’s first low-cost carrier to use SAF on commercial routes.

The Bangkok–Phu Quoc-Bangkok service marks the airline’s second Green Route, following the Bangkok–Da Nang debut in 2024.

Developed in partnership with PTT OR and Bangkok Aviation Fuel Services (BAFS), the initiative reflects VietJet’s long-term strategy to reduce emissions and achieve a five-percent SAF blend across all flights by 2030.

Each SAF-powered flight can cut approximately 250 kilograms of CO₂ and reduce up to 80 percent of total emissions, contributing to the airline’s target of lowering more than 153,000 tonnes of CO₂ within six years.

According to Vietjet Thailand CEO Woranate Laprabang, the airline’s integration of SAF into its regular operations reflects its commitment to balancing business growth with environmental responsibility, while empowering passengers to contribute to reducing carbon emissions through their travel choices.

He added that this collaboration demonstrates how synergy between the aviation and energy sectors can accelerate the transition towards a greener and more sustainable future for the industry.

Produced from renewable and waste-based materials such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and biogas, SAF meets ASTM D7566 international standards and performs identically to conventional Jet A-1 fuel without compromising safety or efficiency.

Thailand has strong potential for SAF production due to its abundant bio-based resources and growing circular economy infrastructure.

Strengthened public–private collaboration will be crucial to scaling production, improving cost efficiency, and supporting both national and regional carbon-reduction goals.

Vietnam remains one of Thailand’s most important short-haul markets, with over 600,000 Vietnamese visitors expected in 2025. Vietnamese travellers continue to favour Thailand for its leisure, wellness, and cultural offerings while exploring new destinations. TAT plans to strengthen this market through ongoing collaboration with airlines and digital travel partners, including the Thailand Summer Blast campaign and the Krabi Prototype initiative, which spotlight sustainable routes and certified operators under CF-Hotels and the Thailand Tourism Awards.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2025/11/1a4e9877-vietjet-thailand-green-route-flight-to-phu-quoc-3.webp,N,,2025-11-11 05:56:49.063857

Shaping new agreements and solutions to accelerate ZEV and infrastructure deployment, including 26,000+ heavy, medium and light electric vehicles and approximately 200 MW of renewable energy capacity in India, Mexico, and Brazil;

Driving the business case for electrification use cases and supporting policy and standards integration in Europe;

Co-design future mobility solutions with cities to ensure half of the world population has access to sustainable and people-centered and affordable solutions;

Securing coherent policy frameworks, harmonized standards, and effective market-based mechanisms to accelerate transport decarbonization across modes, including the adoption of alternative fuels required in the maritime and aviation sectors.

Decarbonization is within reach, and businesses are showing the pathway

Transport is responsible for ~ 23 % of global energy‑related CO₂ emissions, making it one of the largest and fastest‑growing drivers of climate change. To align with the Paris Agreement, the sector must cut emissions by approximately 25 % by 2030.

Despite historical increases in global energy transition investments last year, led in great part by transport electrification, BloombergNEF highlights these must accelerate as they currently only represent 37% of what is required to get on track with the Net Zero Scenario.

To make this transition a reality, we need to address several use cases across transport modes and shape solutions that address specific market needs, while ensuring a just transition and protecting natural ecosystems.

This means deploying zero-emission vehicles supported by appropriate charging infrastructure, smart and flexible grids and digitalization to achieve seamless integration and operational efficiencies. Complementing electrification, Alternative Fuels like Hydrogen, Biofuels, and RNG are crucial to fill gaps where electrification falls short and ensure decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like shipping and aviation. This multi-use case and multi-technology landscape presents decarbonization challenges such as integration, fragmented planning and uncertain investments.

The good news is that the technologies are available, and businesses have been backing the transition with significant investments, showing that the transition is feasible and full of opportunities.

Clean transport remains one of the fastest growing areas of investment in the energy transition as EV adoption surges, more infrastructure is built, and shipping and aviation activity picks up.

– Colin McKerracher, Head of Clean Transport at BloombergNEF

According to WBCSD’s Business Breakthrough Barometer 2025, 91 % of business leaders say they have maintained or increased investments toward net-zero over the past year. This demonstrates both commitment and confidence in the available decarbonization technologies and digital solutions.

Governments and companies must collaborate across regions to bridge implementation and investment gaps

While global investment in electrified transport reached USD $757.4 billion in 2024 and the driving force behind growth in the global energy transition, investments are still insufficient to meet the scale and pace required for global transport decarbonization. The transport landscape remains fragmented and unpredictable, hampering scaled adoption and threatening global decarbonization goals.

Companies working towards decarbonization often face systemic challenges that slow down their progress. These include unclear transition roadmaps and varying market maturities, supply and demand gaps, diverse transportation and mobility needs, lack of integration in multi-fuel landscapes, and knowledge gaps.

Bridging these gaps requires collective action across the transport and mobility value chains and across regions, including:

Clarifying technology breakthroughs that can rapidly scale and benefit climate, people, and nature, and strengthening the business case for their adoption by unlocking operational efficiencies and addressing risks.

Removing roadblocks and aligning on standards and mechanisms that promote capital flow into clean transport.

Driving regional action to foster ecosystem collaboration and enable tailored solutions design.

The road to sustainable mobility is about building better infrastructure, stronger partnerships, and a shared vision for the future of movement. At Toyota, we believe innovation thrives when businesses, governments, and communities work together to create mobility systems that are inclusive, efficient, and carbon neutral. Our goal is to help every journey contribute to a more sustainable world.

Businesses collaborate in emerging markets to scale Zero Emission Vehicle and charging infrastructure deployment

Since COP27, members of Zero Emission Vehicle Emerging Markets Initiative (ZEV-EMI), in partnership with ZEVTC and the Road Transport Breakthrough Agenda, have been shaping regional public-private partnerships to boost ZEV and infrastructure adoption, focusing on accelerating private investments and required policies in selected road corridors and urban areas.

As part of the regional efforts, they have been shaping new agreements and solutions to accelerate ZEV and infrastructure deployment, including 26,000+ heavy, medium and light electric vehicles and approximately 200 MW of renewable energy capacity in India, Mexico, and Brazil.

India partnership

As part of the India country partnership, established at COP27, companies are driving investments towards 8000 electric trucks and an equivalent of 1500 charge points and 78MW of Renewable energy sources by 2030. In 2025, they put forward an innovative leasing-led model designed to address the issue of segregated vehicle ownership by leveraging aggregated demand for clean transport and de-risking investments at scale. As limited charging infrastructure remains a key constraint, businesses guided the development of a national data-sharing platform . The platform enables evidence-based planning and targeted infrastructure investments thanks to the collection of fleet and operational data.

Fujitsu is proud to contribute to India’s ZEV-EMI initiatives, leveraging our offering called Software Defined Vehicle to optimize EV infrastructure. This data-driven approach has already achieved a 70% reduction in per-delivery charging time and 13% reduction in fuel costs for fleet operators. We believe national data-sharing platforms and innovative leasing models are crucial to overcoming infrastructure limitations and de-risking investments. Fujitsu will continue to apply its digital expertise to integrate mobility, energy, and urban planning data, accelerating the transformation towards a sustainable transport infrastructure.

Mexico partnership

As part of the Mexico country partnership, established at COP28, companies are driving investments towards 17000 light and heavy-duty electric vehicles and an equivalent of 1350 charge points and 60 MW of Renewable energy sources by 2030.

At COP30, the collective action and investment alliance is now announcing efforts to (i) establish an e-truck pilot in Northern Mexico, aiming to deploy at least 15 electric trucks and build up to six megawatt-scale rapid charging hubs and (ii) address infrastructure and operational cost gaps to improve vehicle Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and further scale adoption of light duty vehicles and charging infrastructure across Mexican cities. This follows a collaboration with Arcadis and TRATON to evaluate implementation and cost gaps, supported by the release of a TCO Evaluation Tool that helps companies better assess the business case for EV fleets.

The TCO tool for Mexico represents a major step forward in helping companies make data-driven investment decisions toward fleet electrification. By providing a clear, comparable view of context specific costs and benefits across technologies, we are supporting the Zero Emission Trucks transition.

– Greg Steele, Global President, Mobility, Arcadis

Mexico is a key focus market for our decarbonization roadmap. Through strong partnerships and innovative tools, we’re identifying viable pathways to accelerate the transition to low-emission transport and demonstrate that sustainability and business efficiency can go hand in hand.

– Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer, Philip Morris International

The ZEV Mexico Partnership shows how ambition can be turned into implementation. By working together toward an e-truck pilot in northern Mexico and accelerating the scale-up of electric vehicles in urban centers, this coalition is demonstrating how collaboration and targeted efforts can drive real progress. These investments will not only reduce emissions but also unlock innovation and sustainable growth across Mexico’s transport sector. WBCSD will continue to help drive real progress and looks forward to working with members and partners to advance a zero-emission future.

Brazil partnership

As part of the Brazil country partnership, established at COP29, companies seek opportunities to scale investments in transport decarbonization. At COP30, in partnership with CALSTART, Smart Freight Centre, ICCT, WRI Brasil, Scania, Amazon and C40, they are announcing the e-Dutra coalition to transform Brazil’s mobility future.

The initiative has begun deploying electric trucks and chargers along the Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo corridor, with the intention to reach 1,000 trucks operating daily by 2030. By integrating lessons learned about vehicle performance, route optimization, and the practical requirements for large-scale commercial charging networks, e-Dutra is set to accelerate the rollout of reliable, high-capacity charging stations. Additionally, by aggregating large-scale commitments from shippers and logistics providers, the coalition creates a predictable demand signal which de-risks investments in charging infrastructure.

With our Brazilian brand Volkswagen Truck & Bus as a co-leader of the e-Dutra Coalition, TRATON is proud to work alongside our partners to transform Brazil’s road freight into a zero-emission future. By deploying electric trucks and developing the charging infrastructure along the Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo corridor, we are creating a scalable model that will accelerate the adoption of sustainable transport across the country.

– Andreas Follér, Chief Sustainability Officer, TRATON Group

As the battery revolution continues to unfold, electrifying road freight transport is a critical step in the energy transition of supply chains. But it requires collaboration across the entire ecosystem including private companies, regulators, and infrastructure providers. The Laneshift e-Dutra initiative shows how cross-sector cooperation can accelerate this transition and deliver tangible benefits to the communities along Brazil’s most important freight corridor.

– Morten Bo Christiansen, Head of Energy Transition, A.P. Moller – Maersk

The e-Dutra corridor is a landmark for sustainable freight and a powerful example of what collaboration can achieve. Decarbonizing transport is not only essential for the climate – it’s also a major driver of innovation, competitiveness, and growth. This coalition demonstrates how companies, government, and partners can turn ambition into action through investing in zero-emission trucks and charging infrastructure, through which Brazil is setting a new benchmark for climate leadership. WBCSD is looking forward to supporting the initiative and help accelerate the systemic transformation of transportation in Brazil and beyond.

– Diane Holdorf, Executive Vice President, WBCSD

Corporates strengthen efforts to scale ZEV and infrastructure deployment in Europe

At COP30, businesses are joining forces under the new ZEV European Coalition to drive regional dialogues and shape opportunities for scaling implementation and investments in ZEV & charging infrastructure deployment.

The European Commission-led Green Deal, Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) and Clean Transport Corridor Initiative (CTCI) are driving crucial opportunities for accelerated investment and implementation in European green corridors.

The WBCSD ZEV European Coalition (ZEV EC) will seek to reinforce these efforts, targeting the deployment of tens of thousands of EV, charging units and Renewable Energy Sources across the region, and call for integrated and clear policies and standards that will drive electrification.

Businesses and cities come together to prepare for Future Urban Mobility

Urban mobility accounts for 40% of passenger’s global transport CO2 emissions, and passenger and freight demand are projected to double by 2050. Cities face mounting pressure to address three core challenges:

how to reduce their ecological impact (reducing GHG emissions, air pollution and optimizing energy use);

how to deliver inclusive, accessible mobility;

how to make sustainable mobility attractive and economically viable for users and operators.

In 2025, WBCSD members continue to drive the co-design of the future mobility solutions that are sustainable, accessible, and collaborate with cities to shape affordable solutions. These dialogues will shape actionable roadmaps through 2026 and beyond.

Urban mobility is at the heart of a sustainable future. At Volkswagen Group, we are driving the transformation toward cleaner, smarter, and more connected mobility solutions, where every journey contributes to a better quality of life for all. By systematically developing our portfolio by fostering solutions like MOIA’s autonomous and shared mobility services, we’re turning this vision into reality—making sustainable, accessible transportation an everyday experience.

– Dirk Voeste, Chief Sustainability Officer, Volkswagen Group

Digitalization and AI will be essential to efficiently plan urban mobility systems, optimizing infrastructure and network investments, and allowing for operational efficiencies. Since 2019, mobility sector companies at WBCSD have developed value chain frameworks to scale sustainable mobility services, demonstrating how public-private collaboration based on data exchange can accelerate and optimize deploymentof charging infrastructure, drive more efficient and user-centric mobility, or enhance transport resilience.

Our multi-fuel bus pilot with Rybnik demonstrated how granular data-driven fuel optimization can strategically manage fuel mixes (Hydrogen and, ICE) to reduce GHG emissions while increasing resilience. This initiative, highlighting the power of digital collaboration and integrated transport systems for better investment decisions and urban mobility, offers crucial insights for logistics (HGV fleets) to achieve economically viable and environmentally responsible decarbonization.

A timely transition cannot happen without global frameworks to scale low carbon fuels for maritime and aviation

Beyond road transport, the maritime, aviation, and rail sectors together account for around 25% of global transport emissions.

The “beyond road” sector faces complex challenges to decarbonize, including a lagging business case for alternative fuels, prohibitive prices, a lack of integration across value chains and regional roadmaps, and low standardization of recognized emissions accounting standards slowing demand for industry solutions.

The energy transition that the shipping industry is undertaking is challenging, yet the technology is ready with dual fuel vessels already operating. We see several technological and fuel pathways ahead, including liquified biomethane, biodiesel, and alcohols such as e- and bio-methanol where we have our largest offtake agreement starting production already next year. As with other transport sectors, the energy transition of shipping requires action and support from an entire ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.

– Morten Bo Christiansen, Head of Energy Transition, A.P. Moller – Maersk

Scaling the maritime sector’s net-zero transition will demand USD $2.6 trillion by 2050, USD $2 trillion of which is for zero-emission fuel production. Meeting the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) long-term aviation decarbonization goals will require approximately USD $3.2 trillion by 2050, with USD $19–45 billion alone needed by 2030 to scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

European aircraft maker Airbus, which has a significant presence in India, has also pitched for bringing corporates' spending on the airlines' voluntary Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) programmes under the government's CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) framework.

Advt

Globally, the requirement for SAF is estimated at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) Development, Sustainability Organisation at Airbus, said a voluntary scheme for SAF will be an ""opportunity for airlines to differentiate and to propose something new to their corporate customers first, then to cargo customers and eventually to private customers"".

India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and Indian carriers have placed orders for more than 1,700 aircraft. As part of sustainability efforts, the government will soon be coming out with a SAF policy.

Elaborating on the value proposition of having the voluntary SAF programmes, Manhes told PTI in an interview in the national capital that the idea is about selling business travel experience with not only good seats and meals but also with a ""lower carbon footprint"".

In the context of the airlines' grouping, IATA's view that SAF blending mandates without incentives is a ""no-go area"", Manhes opined that creating voluntary demand for SAF will not result in market distortion.

He observed that airlines are reluctant to opt for SAF schemes without incentives because they will incur more costs as the fuel itself comes at a higher cost.

Advt

""Voluntary demand is not a market distortion. It is an add-on,"" he noted.

India aims to have 1 per cent blending of SAF in jet fuel by 2027, 2 per cent blending by 2028 and 5 per cent blending by 2030. SAF can be used as a drop-in fuel in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

Manhes said the idea is to help airlines in India to develop a mechanism and products for voluntary SAF programmes, and then make sure that the demand materialises.

""If a corporate can fulfil its CSR obligation, even partially through SAF purchase, then the incentive is obvious,"" he added.

Under the Companies Law, a certain class of profitable corporates are required to shell out at least two per cent of their three-year average annual profit towards CSR activities in a financial year.

Manhes also said that feedstock collection for SAF will be a huge opportunity for collateral socio-economic benefits, and that applies to India like any other country.

India has more than 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue. Utilisation of feedstock for SAF production is also expected to help farmers increase their income.

A recent study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, said that India can emerge as a significant centre for sustainable aviation fuel production in South Asia, and the country's potential biomass feedstock for the fuel is projected to be 100 million tonnes by 2030.

""Regulations, targets, mandates, whatever you call it, will not get us to where we need to be to reach net zero in 2050... You need voluntary demands, "" he emphasised.

Long seen as one of the most promising routes to decarbonising flight, SAF has historically struggled with scalability, cost and complexity.

However, in a lab at the University of Alberta, a young researcher believes those barriers are finally beginning to fall.

The research, conducted under the supervision of Prof. David C. Bressler, focuses on advancing the lipid-tohydrocarbon (LTH) process for renewable fuel production.

PhD student Bernardo Souto and his colleagues at the Biorefining Conversions and Fermentation Laboratory (Bressler’s lab) have been working hand-in-hand with analytical technology giant PerkinElmer to unlock a new way of producing renewable jet fuel.

The collaboration, which began under the Alberta Biojet Initiative (ABI), has led to a major breakthrough in how wa

ste fats and oils can be converted into high-quality, ready-to-use aviation fuel. “It’s an incredibly exciting time,” said Souto at the start of his discussion with the magazine’s editor.

“Our process takes lipids from virtually any source, animal fats, used cooking oil, even algae, and converts them directly into hydrocarbons suitable for jet engines.

“The best part is that it’s cleaner, cheaper and more efficient than many existing methods.”

A collaboration born from challenge

The partnership between PerkinElmer and the University of Alberta began in earnest in 2019, when the ABI was launched as a $7 million (€6 million) collaboration involving Natural Resources Canada, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Prairies Economic Development Canada, Alberta, Future Energy Systems, the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences at the University of Alberta, Edmonton International Airport, and FORGE Hydrocarbons, which is the industry and commercialisation partner.

The goal: to develop and demonstrate technologies capable of producing sustainable aviation fuel from Canadian feedstocks. At that time, Souto’s research group, led by Prof. Bressler, was already known for its pioneering work in lipid conversion – transforming oils and fats into renewable hydrocarbons.

However, as their experiments grew more complex, so did their analytical needs. “We had the technology, but we needed precision,” Souto explained. “We were generating hundreds of compounds in our reactions, and we needed to identify and quantify every one of them accurately. That’s when PerkinElmer came in.”

Working closely with PerkinElmer’s engineers and technicians, the Bressler’s lab team helped design and optimise a suite of advanced analytical instruments, including gas chromatographs, thermal analysers and elemental analysers, specifically tailored for renewable fuel research.

PerkinElmer was very supportive giving the department good price reductions, allowing the team not only to push their research further, but to showcase how such analytical innovation could accelerate the wider biofuels sector. “They really helped us bridge the gap between laboratory curiosity and industrial application,” Souto continued.

“By giving us access to cutting-edge tools, we could understand our feedstocks, track every product and evaluate our yields in real time.”

From laboratory bench to industrial scale

What began as a proofof- concept in 2003 has since matured into a fullscale demonstration.

Over two decades of development, the Bressler’s lab team has advanced from tiny microreactors producing millilitres of fuel to pilot-scale systems capable of generating 20 kilograms per hour.

Each step has refined the process, and each scale-up has been guided by careful analysis.

The underlying technology, now patented and licensed to FORGE Hydrocarbons, a Canadian spin-off company from the university, offers a compelling new route to SAF. FORGE is currently constructing its first commercial plant in Sombra, Ontario, designed to produce renewable diesel and later expand to sustainable jet fuel production.

What makes the FORGE LTH Process unique is its feedstock flexibility and simplicity.

Traditional SAF pathways, such as the widely used hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) route, depend on expensive catalysts and high-purity feedstocks.

In contrast, the FORGE LTH Process relies primarily on temperature and pressure to break down complex lipids into usable hydrocarbons, eliminating the need for catalysts or hydrogen during the renewable diesel stage. For sustainable aviation fuel production, only small amounts of hydrogen are later introduced to improve fuel properties while maintaining a low carbon profile. “It’s what we call a ‘feedstock-agnostic’ process,” Souto explained.

“It doesn’t matter if the oil comes from plants, animals, or microorganisms, we can use it.

“It also doesn’t need to be pristine. Even waste or low-quality fats can be turned into clean, drop-in fuels that are chemically similar to diesel or jet fuel.” This simplicity has powerful implications for scalability and cost reduction.

The PerkinElmer effect

PerkinElmer’s technical collaboration and support were instrumental in advancing the analytical component of our SAF research.

Their instruments have given the researchers a clearer view of what happens inside the process, helping them understand and optimise the chemistry in unprecedented detail. “In the early days, analysing a single gas sample required several instruments and additional time to obtain a full picture,” Souto recalled.

“We needed to use several instruments to get a full picture. Thanks to the new system we developed with PerkinElmer, we can now complete the same analysis more efficiently and with greater accuracy.”

The collaboration has also produced an online gas chromatograph capable of sampling directly from the process. This innovation allows researchers to monitor chemical changes in real time.

“It means we can literally see what’s happening inside the process at the push of a button,” said Souto.

“That’s a huge leap forward for optimisation. It helps us connect process conditions to the chemistry, and the chemistry to the final product.” This ability to obtain rapid, high-resolution data has dramatically improved research efficiency.

“When you’re running pilot plants, you’re generating hundreds of samples a day,” Souto noted.

“You can’t afford to spend hours analysing each one. The speed and reliability we’ve achieved have made a massive difference.”

From waste to wings

While the past focus was on renewable diesel, the Bressler’s lab ultimate goal is clear: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The demand for SAF is rising rapidly as airlines and governments set aggressive decarbonisation targets. Aviation currently accounts for around 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that demand for jet fuel will double by 2050.

“If we want to fly more without worsening emissions, we need alternatives,” Souto said.

“We don’t have to replace fossil fuels entirely, but we do need to meet growing demand with sustainable options.”

Souto envisions a future where modular SAF production units can operate directly at airports, using locally available waste oils to produce fuel on site. “Imagine collecting used cooking oil from a city’s restaurants and converting it into jet fuel right at the airport,” he said.

“That’s the kind of decentralised model that FORGE Hydrocarbons is deploying.”

The potential advantages of the process extend beyond cost and logistics. Unlike HEFA fuels, which often lack aromatic compounds necessary for jet engine performance, the FORGE LTH Process naturally produces a broader spectrum of hydrocarbons, including aromatics, that can make the resulting fuel more compatible with current aviation standards.

“In theory, our fuel could be used without blending,” Souto suggested. “That’s what we’re testing now – ensuring it meets ASTM specifications for drop-in use.”

Scaling up for the SAF era

The team’s progress so far is impressive. More than 100 pilot campaigns have been conducted, amounting to over 2,000 hours of continuous operation.

The renewable diesel produced already meets Canadian fuel quality standards, and work is now underway to finalise testing for SAF certification. The transition from renewable diesel to aviation-grade fuel is not just a chemical step, but a regulatory one.

Every new SAF pathway must pass rigorous ASTM testing to ensure compatibility, safety and performance.

Souto’s team is now focusing on the fine-tuning required to meet those standards, analysing molecular profiles, and ensuring consistent quality across feedstocks.

“This is where PerkinElmer continues to be critical,” said Souto. “We’re studying how different feedstocks behave and how composition affects the end product. The goal is to tailor the process so we can control the properties we need.”

The University of Alberta’s research does not stop there. The team is also exploring how reaction parameters can be optimised for energy efficiency and carbon reduction, potentially opening doors to on-site SAF production at regional airports or refineries.

FORGE Hydrocarbons, meanwhile, is moving ahead with its commercial deployment.

Once the Ontario plant is fully operational, it will represent one of Canada’s most advanced renewable fuel facilities and a proof point for a process that could reshape the market.

The future of flight, fuelled by partnership

Looking ahead, Souto believes that collaboration between academia and industry will remain vital to progress.

“We’re always facing new challenges,” he said. “That’s the nature of research. But the partnership with PerkinElmer allows us to tackle them faster, to develop new tools, new methods, and ultimately better fuels.”

For PerkinElmer, the collaboration is equally rewarding, demonstrating how advanced analytical science can accelerate clean energy innovation. The company now uses the Alberta lab as a demonstration site, showcasing to other researchers and industry partners how cutting-edge instrumentation can drive real-world breakthroughs.

Each year, Dr Bressler and Souto present their findings as part of PerkinElmer’s seminar series, sharing lessons from their SAF journey and highlighting how analytical precision translates into cleaner skies.

A cleaner horizon

As airlines, governments and fuel producers worldwide push towards net-zero, the need for viable, scalable SAF solutions has never been greater. The FORGE LTH Process could well be one of the keys to meeting that challenge.

By combining scientific rigour, industrial insight and the power of partnership, Souto and his colleagues are proving that the future of flight does not have to come at the expense of the planet.

“We’re not trying to reinvent aviation,” Souto concluded. “We’re just making it sustainable – one drop of fuel at a time.”

During a keynote to aviation leaders at the Airlines 2025 conference in London, UK Country Head of Alfanar Noaman Al Adhami also unveiled a new dedicated brand and website for LGF which is wholly owned by Alfanar.

The £2bn LGF project will convert 1.5m tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass feedstocks –including forestry, sawmill, and agricultural residues in line with the UK SAF Mandate – into more than 180m litres of second-generation SAF every year, offsetting the equivalent carbon emissions of 27,000 short-haul flights.

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location. It offers closer access to critical infrastructure, including rail and shipping links, and enables the entire conversion process to take place on one site, from feedstock pre-treatment to storage.

It is also even closer to carbon capture and storage infrastructure, providing the opportunity for seamless integration into the network when online. This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.

Delhi's police commissioner said the blast happened at 18:52 local time, when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light before it exploded. The owner of the car has been arrested, it was reported.

""I rushed out with my children and saw several vehicles on fire, body parts all over,” a witness, who lives near the scene of the explosion, told The Associated Press.

""We are exploring all possibilities and will conduct a thorough investigation, taking all possibilities into account,” Home Minister Amit Shah said.

CCTV footage from cameras in the area will form part of the investigation.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced on Monday (10 November) the introduction of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April next year and begins for flights departing Singapore from 1 October 2026.

Airline passengers departing from Singapore will have to pay a levy ranging from $1 to $41.60 per ticket, depending on their travel destination and travel class. ""As longer flights consume more fuel, the SAF levy varies based on the distance travelled,"" said CAAS in a press note. ""For simplicity and ease of administration, all destinations from Singapore are grouped into four geographical bands.""

Band 1: Southeast Asia ($1 for Economy / $4 for Premium).

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea ($2.80 for Economy / $11.20 for Premium).

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand ($6.40 for Economy / $25.60 for Premium).

Band 4: the Americas ($10.40 for Economy / $41.60 for Premium).

Aemetis also provided an update of biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects.

During an earnings call, Aemetis Chairman and CEO Eric McAfee reported that the company’s RNG business significantly increased biogas production capacity at the end of the third quarter with a new multi-dairy digester that came online in September. That facility increased RNG capacity by more than 30%. According to McAfee, Aemetis remains on track to have more than 500,000 MMBtus of RNG capacity in place by the end of 2025, increasing to 1 MMBtus by the end of 2026. Aemetis is currently operating or building digesters to process waste from 18 dairies.

The California Air Resources Board earlier this year approved Low Carbon Fuel Standard pathways for seven of Aemetis’ dairy digesters, with an average carbon intensity (CI) score of -384 gCO2e/MJ. “These pathway approvals increased our LCFS credit revenue by 160% for these dairies starting in the third quarter of this year, compared to dairy digesters with the -150 default pathway score while pathways are pending approval,” McAfee said, noting four additional LCFS pathways are currently under review at CARB.

McAfee confirmed that the company’s RNG facilities qualify for the Section 48 energy investment tax credit. RNG output also qualifies for 45Z clean fuel production tax credits. “Collectively, molecule revenues, LCFS credit sales, D3 [renewable identification number (RIN)] sales and the sale of 45Z production tax credits are expected to generate strong positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of this year and expanding operating cash flow in 2026, as new dairy RNG production comes online 45Z calculations are issued by the Department of Energy and LCFS credit prices continue to rise,” he said.

Regarding operations at the Keyes ethanol plant, McAfee reported that the mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) system is completing equipment fabrication. On-site construction is expected to begin during the fourth quarter of 2025 and be complete during the second quarter of 2026. The MVR system is expected to reduce natural gas consumption at the ethanol plant by 80%, according to McAfee.

The Keyes plant reduced ethanol production during Spring 2025 in order to optimize ethanol margins. McAfee said the facility ramped up production during the third quarter due to higher ethanol demand and improved margins. Higher production is expected to continue during the fourth quarter.

Aemetis also operates a biodiesel subsidiary in India, which is targeting an initial public offering (IPO) in early 2026. McAfee said the company is actively seeking to expand into biogas and ethanol production in India.

In addition, Aemetis is working to develop the Riverbank biorefinery, a 90 MMgy SAF and renewable diesel facility in California, along with CCS capacity. According to McAfee, the company continues to engage in active discussions on financing structures for the Riverbank project, and is waiting further clarity on the 45Z production credit and biofuel mandates to support project financing. For the adjacent CCS project, Aemetis has completed initial site and installation work for its CO2 characterization well. The data obtained from the next phase of drill will support the company’s Class VI permit application.

Aemetis sold 14.7 million gallons of ethanol during the third quarter of 2025, down from 15.5 million gallons sold during the same period of 2024. For the first nine months of the year, ethanol sales reached 42.6 million gallons, down from 44.4 million gallons sold during the same period of last year.

The financing will support policy and institutional measures that facilitate implementation of Brazil’s Ecological Transformation Plan in sustainable finance, energy transition and green and resilient infrastructure.

Announcing the investment, Jin Liqun, President and Chair of the Board of Directors, AIIB, said Brazil’s reform program “couples policy ambition with practical market reforms,” adding that “AIIB’s support will help channel more private capital into sustainable finance, accelerate the energy transition, and build climate-resilient infrastructure—delivering tangible benefits for people, nature and the economy.”

“Through this CPBF, Brazil and AIIB are demonstrating that climate action and development go hand in hand,” said Tatiana Rosito, Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Finance and AIIB Alternate Governor for Brazil. “This partnership is helping us turn policy into progress – creating markets for sustainable finance, advancing carbon market and blended-finance mechanisms such as Eco Invest Brasil, driving the energy transition, and recognizing nature as essential infrastructure for a resilient future.”

Under the CPBF, reforms are organized across sustainable finance, energy transition, and green and resilient infrastructure—three pillars that together direct public and private capital toward low-carbon growth and biome regeneration; promote competitive, sustainable bioenergy with robust value chains; and enhance the resilience of critical natural assets and infrastructure. Expected results include establishing governance for a national carbon market, mobilizing private resources for sustainable infrastructure and forest conservation, producing low-GHG sustainable aviation fuel, deploying early-warning systems for extreme heat, and strengthening forest and mangrove restoration.

The project applies AIIB’s operational policies for CPBF and will complement policy loans of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. Semi-annual program reviews will track prior actions and results, consistent with the Program’s agreed framework.

This initiative builds on AIIB’s previous analytical work – including its Nature as Infrastructure Report (2023), which reframes natural ecosystems as core infrastructure assets, and its Infrastructure for Planetary Health Report (2025), which integrates infrastructure investment with human, environmental and climate health outcomes.

But for travellers who are price-conscious, this may push them to choose another country to fly from, said Ms Kong, 55.

The Australian, who typically visits family here before continuing her travels to other parts of Asia and Europe from Changi Airport, has taken six business class flights out of Singapore for work and leisure so far in 2025.

Speaking to The Straits Times from Sydney, where she is based, she expressed surprise at Singapore’s decision to impose a levy at a time when people are increasingly conscious about costs and uncertain about the economic outlook.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on Nov 10 announced that passengers flying out of Singapore from October 2026 will

pay a levy of between $1 and $41.60

that will go towards the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel. The levy paid will vary based on flight distance and class of travel.

It will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights leaving Singapore from Oct 1 that year.

Passengers in economy or premium economy class will pay between $1 and $10.40, depending on their destination.

Those who fly business or first class will pay between $4 and $41.60.

The travellers ST interviewed said that while the levy amount is not significant enough to change their travel habits, it is another fee added to the already-high cost of air travel.

Ms May Ng, 37, said she is resigned to paying the charge since there is no choice.

The personal assistant, who travels with her husband and two daughters in economy class, flies out of Singapore up to four times a year, usually to destinations within Asia.

While Ms Ng believes that adopting sustainable aviation fuel is good for the environment, “who wants to pay more?” she asked.

Still, the amount is not large enough to change her family’s travel plans or encourage her to book tickets earlier to avoid paying the levy.

Passengers who book their tickets before April 1, 2026, will not have to pay the levy, even if they are travelling after Oct 1, 2026.

Ms Claudine Ho, an administrator in the medical industry, flies up to 10 times a year.

The 53-year-old, who takes a mix of economy and business class flights, said more can be done to help travellers understand the importance of sustainability by making it relatable to the layperson, so that travellers can understand the reason behind imposing the levy.

Another frequent traveller, Mr Julius Toh, sees the levy as yet another example of the rising cost of living.

However, the 55-year-old bar owner, who travels up to eight times a year for work and with family within Asia and to Europe, said most travellers would probably not notice it.

A spokesman for national carrier Singapore Airlines told ST that the charge aligns with SIA Group’s commitment to gradually increase its use of sustainable aviation fuel.

He said it will continue to work with partners, including government agencies and fuel suppliers, to accelerate the development and commercialisation of green jet fuel.

Mr Sheldon Hee, regional vice-president for the Asia-Pacific at the International Air Transport Association, said the industry body for airlines welcomes the “lead time for the implementation and the industry consultations to clarify the implementation details”.

The timing of the levy roll-out – for tickets sold from April 2026 for flights departing from October that year – is based on industry feedback, giving airlines and passengers time to adjust, CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said on Nov 10.

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, calculated on a per-kilogramme basis.

It will also vary based on the distance travelled.

A spokeswoman for DHL said the global logistics company is reviewing the details of the levy, and assessing the impact on its operations and customers.

Agustín Reyna, Director General of BEUC, said:

It is excellent news airlines have agreed to stop luring consumers with green promises following our complaint to the European Commission. It was high time airlines stopped painting flying as a sustainable option. Paying ‘green fares’ to plant trees can never guarantee to suck aircraft emissions out of the air.

The EU’s recommendations made clear that sustainability claims and ‘green’ terminology can only be used if backed up by comprehensive targets, strategies, and timelines. Announced on the eve of COP30, the agreement sends a strong message to all airlines, and highlights how much more needs to be done for aviation to make realistic steps towards decarbonisation and overall sustainability.

Join us at Aerospace Tech Week 2026 to discuss how to make the skies sustainable.

Often made from biomass waste or cooking oils, small percentages of sustainable aviation fuels are already blended with conventional kerosene fuels, with the aviation industry and travelers pushing towards larger integration.
The current corn-based sustainable aviation fuel production method chemically modifies ethanol to make aviation fuel through a process called Alcohol-to-Jet.
""A variety of factors need to be considered when planning how to produce large quantities of sustainable aviation fuels from CO₂.
Starting with CO₂ from corn ethanol fermentation promises the fastest path to scaling up this new industry,"" said Sick.","Manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel with CO₂ byproducts of ethanol production could reduce carbon intensity by more than 80% compared to fossil fuels.

The CO2 released from corn during ethanol production could actually be a valuable, underutilized resource for producing aviation fuel rather than a waste byproduct, according to a study published in the SAE International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, Energy, Environment, & Policy.

Unlike the CO₂ from coal plants or cement kilns, which requires a lot of energy to capture, fermentation to produce ethanol releases very pure streams containing 85% CO₂ by volume or higher. As the corn plants sequestered CO₂ from the air, capturing the CO₂ released from fermentation and using it as fuel would reuse CO₂ without adding more to the atmosphere.

""It is exciting to explore whether this 'waste' stream can actually become a significant asset, turning inefficiency into advantage and accelerating the real-world application of emerging technologies,"" said Stephen McCord, a research scientist in mechanical engineering at U-M and lead author of the study.

With aviation producing over a gigaton of fossil CO2 emissions annually, sustainable aviation fuel produced from non-fossil carbon stocks can help reduce these emissions. Often made from biomass waste or cooking oils, small percentages of sustainable aviation fuels are already blended with conventional kerosene fuels, with the aviation industry and travelers pushing towards larger integration.

The United States produced 15.6 billion gallons of ethanol in 2023, releasing 48 megatons of CO₂, offering a route to produce sustainable aviation fuel at scale. With several different ways to make sustainable aviation fuel from bioethanol, the research team compared pathways to determine the ones with the lowest environmental impact.

""We hope to inform future development and policy by highlighting which routes are most promising for reducing aviation's carbon footprint using existing waste resources,"" said Volker Sick, former Director of the Global CO₂ Initiative and the DTE Energy Professor of Advanced Energy Research at U-M and senior author of the study.

The current corn-based sustainable aviation fuel production method chemically modifies ethanol to make aviation fuel through a process called Alcohol-to-Jet. Although it has a high fuel yield of 90%, this route only reduces carbon intensity by about 4.5% to 20% compared to kerosene jet fuel.

The research team compared this method to two CO₂-based routes. Both methods begin by converting captured CO₂ into syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H₂). The gas fermentation route uses syngas to create ethanol as an intermediate step, then uses Alcohol-to-Jet to produce fuel. The Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis route instead feeds syngas into a reactor, synthesizing the long-chain liquid hydrocarbons that make up jet fuel.

A life cycle assessment found both approaches outperformed conventional methods, with Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis projected to reduce carbon intensity by up to 90% while gas fermentation was projected to reduce it by 84%.

When considering existing bioethanol facilities and workforce skills, gas fermentation followed by Alcohol-to-Jet came out on top as the path with the smoothest transition despite a slightly lower carbon intensity reduction.

""A variety of factors need to be considered when planning how to produce large quantities of sustainable aviation fuels from CO₂. Starting with CO₂ from corn ethanol fermentation promises the fastest path to scaling up this new industry,"" said Sick.

As a follow-up, the research team assessed the economic competitiveness of these two pathways to understand which would operate best in real-world conditions and which could be deployed quickest in the US.

With electrification and hydrogen both facing significant technical and practical obstacles for long-distance air travel, hydrocarbon fuels will likely remain essential for aviation in the foreseeable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2019/ethanol.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 14:00:06.366061

The facility will convert used cooking oil and waste-based feedstocks into certified sustainable aviation fuel meeting international standards. Phase I will produce 125 million litres per year around 18 percent of the UAE’s 2030 target, while Phase II will double capacity to 250 million litres per year, supporting regional exports and contributing up to 36 percent of the nation’s SAF goal.

The planned investment for phase I is $200 million and additional $100 million for Phase II, making a total investment of $300 million. The project represents a major contribution and step forward in the UAE’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap 2030 and Net Zero 2050 Agenda.

First introduced at Adipec 2024 in alignment with the nation’s vision to expand sustainable fuel production, Mena Biofuels has since progressed from concept to implementation, moving decisively towards execution. Over the past year the company has completed a comprehensive feasibility study validating the project’s economic viability and set the foundation for progressing the project to realisation. The project has secured the lease of land, adjacent to Mena Terminals, from the Government of Fujairah, appointed Dynatron FZE, a UAE engineering consulting firm, to act as Project Manager, completed detailed topographic and hydrological surveys carried out by UAE based consulting firms, and selected an internationally recognized technology provider for the process to convert waste-based feedstocks into certified sustainable aviation fuel. Robert Wright, former CEO of the European Biofuels Association, has been contracted to provide advice on policy and regulation matters, and MUC Engineering – Fujairah Branch has been appointed to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment study as well as provide Project NOC consulting services.

At Adipec 2025, Mena Biofuels advanced its commercial implementation through the signing of strategic offtake MoU in the presence of Suhail Mohamed Al-Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, with Emirates Petroleum Company PJSC (Emarat), a pioneer in the UAE’s oil and gas industry. In addition, it is the intention to sign a similar MoU at the upcoming Dubai Air Show. The agreements set the foundation for UAE production of sustainable aviation fuel, marking a key step in advancing the nation’s SAF Roadmap 2030 and Net Zero 2050 objectives.

Building on this momentum, Mena Biofuels has launched the first of two Engineering, Procurement, and Construction and commissioning (EPCC) tender for the Fujairah SAF facility, inviting qualified international and regional contractors with proven experience in renewable fuel and industrial projects to participate. The first EPCC package will cover the receiving, storage, and distribution facilities for feedstock, SAF, and by-products, establishing the project’s logistical backbone. Within Q1 2026, Mena Biofuels will issue the second EPCC tender, covering the SAF refinery process units and associated infrastructure, marking a major step toward full-scale implementation of the UAE’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel plant. The project continues to move from vision to execution, positioning the UAE as a regional hub for sustainable aviation fuel production and ensuring SAF supply from Fujairah to the UAE, GCC, and international markets.

Ali Khalifa Al Shamsi, Chief Executive Officer of Emarat, said, “Building a home-grown SAF ecosystem requires investors, technology and distributors pulling in one direction. With Emarat’s agreement with Mena Biofuels, intent becomes supply: accelerated volumes from Fujairah, certified and locally produced, giving airlines a credible path to decarbonise. By backing a UAE-built SAF stream in FOIZ, we are creating domestic capacity that carriers can count on—advancing the SAF Roadmap 2030 and the nation’s Net Zero 2050 ambition while keeping value, jobs and know-how in the UAE.Twelve months from concept to implementation sends a clear signal that the UAE is serious about sustainable aviation fuel, and Emarat is committed to turning that momentum into dependable offtake and real emissions reductions.”

Captain Salem Al Afkham, Director, Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ), said: “The launch of the UAE’s first SAF plant here in Fujairah marks a defining milestone for both the Emirate and the Nation. As the first project of its kind in Fujairah and the UAE, it reflects our shared commitment to the Net Zero 2050 strategy and the transition toward more sustainable energy sources. We are proud to be part of this achievement, which represents a new chapter in Fujairah’s energy journey. This project moves Fujairah closer to its strategic ambition of diversifying its energy mix beyond conventional hydrocarbons and into cleaner, higher-value fuels. It also aligns with the emirate’s and the UAE’s vision of fostering in-market value creation — bringing together investment, innovation, and industrial capacity to build long-term economic and environmental resilience.

As this and similar projects take shape, FOIZ continues to evolve from one of the world’s top three oil storage and bunkering hubs into a fully integrated energy ecosystem — one where processing capacity and advanced technologies are leveraged to convert feedstocks into higher-value, more sustainable fuels. This transformation strengthens Fujairah’s role as a vital contributor to the region’s clean-fuels landscape and underscores our ongoing commitment to supporting the UAE’s broader energy transition.”

“We are proud to see Mena Biofuels progress from announcement to implementation in just one year,” said H.E Mohamed Saeed Al-Raqbani, Chairman of Mena Biofuels. “This project directly supports the UAE’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap 2030 and embodies our commitment to advancing clean energy through industrial investment and strategic partnerships.”

“By leveraging Fujairah’s infrastructure and aligning with the UAE’s SAF Roadmap, Mena Biofuels is aiming to become a regional leader in clean aviation fuel,” added Gati Al-Jebouri, Chief Executive Officer of Mena Biofuels.","https://imgengine.khaleejtimes.com/khaleejtimes-english/2025-11-10/n5a2a5rl/Mena.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&format=auto&ogImage=true&mode=crop&rect=0,0,4160,2773",N,,2025-11-10 13:01:23.382439

Zach Nunn on the harms of the ""catastrophic"" Schumer Shutdown and ...",Matthew Foldi,,,,,https://washingtonreporter.news/p/interview-rep-zach-nunn-on-the-harms,"“We’ve got a Head Start program that does phenomenal work, particularly for little kiddos and young families,” Nunn said, discussing a facility that he recently visited.
In my home state of Iowa, half of soybeans go to export markets.” Trump, Nunn said, has “done two things.
Rep. Zach Nunn: We’ve offered a very clean pathway to end the shutdown.
Rep. Zach Nunn: Well, first and foremost, we’ve gone out to our first responder groups across the 3rd District in Iowa.
Rep. Zach Nunn: Every single day of September, October, and now going in November, has been ruined by the Schumer shutdown.","While the Schumer Shutdown has devastated Americans across the country, Rep. Zach Nunn (R., Iowa) has spent the past few weeks meeting with constituents who have been devastated by what he categorized as the Democrats’ “partisan, extreme primary politics” that have ground America to a halt.

The Washington Reporter previously covered Nunn’s latest tour of Iowa’s 3rd District; now Nunn, in his latest interview with the Reporter, shared his thoughts on how Democrats are abandoning their roots in states like Iowa and how President Donald Trump scored a major win for farmers, manufacturers, and rural Americans during his most recent trip to Asia.

Nunn, a self-described “common sense conservative” who represents one of the most competitive districts in America, painted a bleak picture of how the Schumer Shutdown has devastated districts like his.

The “harvest is ongoing. The Department of Agriculture’s offices are closed. We’ve got guys who are having their hardest farm year ever, and it’s coming on the back of the fact that the president has gone above and beyond to try and open up new markets, particularly in Asia, for things like soybeans, corn, and beef. All good news.”

“But,” Nunn noted, “this also come off the heels of four years of the Biden administration being a complete failure on moving forward with domestic production as well. That’s things like biofuels, including E15, 45Z tax credits, really looking at the sustainable aviation fuel. These are two things that farmers are looking for now, and until we can win just five holdouts the Democratic caucus, Democrats have decided to hold the entire country hostage, hold the Midwest hostage on this issue.”

The other issue that Nunn focused on was cuts to SNAP and WIC. Nunn, who was “at both the food bank that collects all this and the food pantry that distributes all this,” has seen the consequences firsthand.

“We have seen record requests coming in from Iowa families who don’t know whether they should save their money to fill up the minivan, save their money to fill up the refrigerator, or save their money because they have no idea when they’re going to get paid again,” he explained. “I just talked to TSA guys on this and a number of them are on SNAP. They’re barely making it by in their front line position that protects us all, but now they’re also in the third missed pay period. This is putting a real stress on men and women who are being asked to show up on shift to protect all of us.”

Nunn explained that the consequences extend to Head Start programs as well, even though several in Iowa had not suffered from the shutdown.

“We’ve got a Head Start program that does phenomenal work, particularly for little kiddos and young families,” Nunn said, discussing a facility that he recently visited. “We’re talking about two, three, and four year olds that I spent time with, hearing it directly from both the staff at Head Start, the educators, as well as the parents who, if Head Start, runs out, not only do they not have WIC, they do not have SNAP, but now they can’t even go to work because they don’t have the opportunity for child care. It’s a triple strike for these families, and they’re going to be out big time if these programs aren’t able to be funded.”

But there are also unintended consequences that policymakers had clearly been ignoring, and he saw that firsthand when he met with law enforcement officers.

“When it comes to our sheriffs and our county law enforcement here, these guys are seeing an uptick in the number of challenges that are coming from domestic situations related to not getting the assistance that families need, and it puts a lot of stress on the community, particularly a rural community, when it doesn’t have a food bank up the street, but it depends on things like SNAP and WIC to take care of kiddos, to take care of senior citizens, so these are the unintended consequence of a shutdown, but it’s the totally foreseeable result of bad policy management in D.C,” Nunn explained.

“When Washington doesn’t pay its bills with taxpayer dollars that we sent from Iowa, Iowans end up getting hurt by this,” he added.

While a deal seems imminent that could end parts of the shutdown, Nunn stressed that “the longest shutdown in government history [is] a shutdown of choice by the Democrats, a shutdown that’s never happened over a simple clean funding bill.” He called it “a reflection of a Democratic Party that has not only lost touch with its roots in places like Iowa, but it is clearly putting partisan, extreme primary politics ahead of the entire country.”

While most federally elected Democrats were content to abandon the communities that Nunn spent the shutdown visiting, Trump struck major deals across the world.

Nunn said that Trump’s Asia trip in particular is welcome relief for his district.

“For farmers, manufacturers and, candidly, for rural America, this is huge,” Nunn said. “For the last four years, under the Biden administration, we went from trade parity to a $50 billion trade deficit just in the ag sector alone. In my home state of Iowa, half of soybeans go to export markets.”

Trump, Nunn said, has “done two things. He’s done, first of all, not just a great deal with China to get them to open back up, but he’s worked the entire region, everywhere from Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, specifically, a 95 percent reduction on tariffs for Iowa ag, in the course of 24 hours. This is huge. This is what we need. We need Iowa farms to be successful, because they can’t just be the big farms that can sell overseas. It’s got to be the hometown farms that can have a market for this.”

The other aspect, which he has discussed with both the White House and with the Treasury Department, is that “we’ve got to have the opportunity to have a better domestic market here for being able to sell our commodities,” he said. “That’s everything from our beef market to our biofuels market. And I’m happy to say the administration is hearing us on that, and that is something that helps out not just rural America be successful, but it drives down the cost of food and fuel for the entire country.”

“Affordability in all of its aspects is going to come in those two areas, where, if we can drive down the cost of people being able to purchase goods at a cheaper and feed their families at cheaper rate, we’re moving in the right direction,” Nunn said.

Below is a transcript of our interview with Rep. Zach Nunn, lightly edited for clarity.

Washington Reporter:

Congressman Nunn, can you walk us through how the past several weeks of unprecedented and historic obstruction from your Democratic colleagues is harming states like Iowa and districts like yours specifically?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

Let me just begin by saying I’m a common sense conservative, and I think that that goes a long way when I have one of the most competitive congressional districts in the entire state. We just had an election that showed that people were really frustrated with the dysfunction of D.C., and they want to see people who are going to be change agents delivering on things from affordability to housing to what we’re doing in the ag sector, particularly for both domestic and for the export market. Just this week, we spent a lot of time with farmers. This is the big thing. Harvest is ongoing. USDA, the Department of Agriculture, their offices are closed. We’ve got guys who are having their hardest farm year ever, and it’s coming on the back of the fact that the president has gone above and beyond to try and open up new markets, particularly in Asia, for things like soybeans, corn, and beef. All good news. But this also come off the heels of four years of the Biden administration being a complete failure on moving forward with domestic production as well. That’s things like biofuels, including E15, 45Z tax credits, really looking at the sustainable irrigation fuel. These are two things that farmers are looking for now, and until we can win just five holdouts the Democratic caucus, Democrats have decided to hold the entire country hostage, hold the Midwest hostage on this issue. So that’s my farmer issue. The second issue that we’ve really talked to here are the folks who depend on farmers. That is young families and women and independent children. SNAP and WIC are having big time impacts. I’ve been out at both the food bank that collects all this and the food pantry that distributes all this. We have seen record requests coming in from Iowa families who don’t know whether they should save their money to fill up the minivan, save their money to fill up the refrigerator, or save their money because they have no idea when they’re going to get paid again. I just talked to TSA guys on this and a number of them are on SNAP. They’re barely making it by in their front line position that protects us all, but now they’re also in the third missed pay period. This is putting a real stress on men and women who are being asked to show up on shift to protect all of us. But Democrats, again, thought that their liberal, progressive base deserved first priority on Election Day, versus 350 million Americans. And Foldi, I’ll also highlight this; I’m in a +1 Democrat district. And I get that. I work with people who are Republicans, people who are independents, and people who are Democrats, but I am hearing across the board here from these folks that they blame the Senate for this. They see they’re on the same side here now as the air traffic controllers union, the teamsters union, the hardcore federal union guys who are saying that Senate Democrats need to pass what the House Republicans passed back in September because now it’s crushing their own workforce. They can’t even be out there lying trying to justify this thing anymore. This is hopefully a wake up call to folks that if Democrats have lost everybody, from, Fetterman to union workers in Des Moines, Iowa, they’re in real trouble.

Washington Reporter:

You were mentioning the election results; how do you think that those are going to impact the Democrats’ approach to ending the shutdown? And how do you think it’s changing your approach here as you think about how to get out of the shutdown?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

We’ve offered a very clean pathway to end the shutdown. It should have been done two months ago, and every day that goes by, it hurts more and more Iowans. That’s unacceptable. I’ve been so aggressive as to say it’s catastrophic, not just for our food banks, not just for our farmers, but for the 2,000 National Guardsmen from Iowa who are currently deployed to Iraq who are going to go through a second month without their pay, that is unacceptable, particularly as somebody who continues to serve and fight with our armed forces. This should never have happened. The second part of this is, I am afraid the Democrats are taking the wrong lesson away from this. There is a handful of folks who are on the far left who think that the success of a Democratic socialist communist in New York is an indication that holding America hostage is how they get the things that they’re crying about. But as we heard from Schumer himself, you don’t throw a tantrum and shut down the government when you don’t get your way. That’s what he said six months ago. Here we are, beyond six weeks and the man hasn’t been able to find an off ramp with his own base to get the government open, and so while Democrats on the far coasts are talking about how we can continue to leverage this independents, and what I would call old school Democrats back home in Iowa have said, this is enough, and it’s hurting people who are the least able to bear the brunt of the Democratic shutdown operation. And as a result, just like with union Democrats, just like with old school Democrats, they went over to Trump in waves, I think we’re seeing a second coming of this, at least in the Midwest, of folks who are done with the shutdown and they don’t see liberal elites taking them into consideration.

Washington Reporter:

I’m particularly curious what you learned from your law enforcement roundtable and your Drake University Head Start visit, because you already touched on the farmer aspect and the TSA aspect. How does the shutdown impact law enforcement in the Midwest and Head Start and university programs?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

Well, first and foremost, we’ve gone out to our first responder groups across the 3rd District in Iowa. That means meeting with multiple police departments and sheriff’s offices, as well as both our full time and our volunteer firefighters and EMS. For the volunteers, this is just crushing; all of their SAFER grants are now on hold, and this is major equipment purchases. I talked with the Crescent Fire Department that wants to buy a multimillion dollar fire truck that helps protect them, particularly during the harvest season, when we have a lot of heavy operations going on, and they need to be able to respond both with the ambulance and the hook and ladder truck, and they can’t get it. When it comes to our sheriffs and our county law enforcement here, these guys are seeing an uptick in the number of challenges that are coming from domestic situations related to not getting the assistance that families need, and it puts a lot of stress on the community, particularly a rural community, when it doesn’t have a food bank up the street, but it depends on things like SNAP and WIC to take care of kiddos, to take care of senior citizens, so these are the unintended consequence of a shutdown, but it’s the totally foreseeable result of bad policy management in D.C. When Washington doesn’t pay its bills with taxpayer dollars that we sent from Iowa, Iowans end up getting hurt by this. The other side of the story, which is really tragic here, is we’ve got a Head Start program that does phenomenal work, particularly for little kiddos and young families. We’re talking about two, three, and four year olds that I spent time with, hearing it directly from both the staff at Head Start, the educators, as well as the parents who, if Head Start, runs out, not only do they not have WIC, they do not have SNAP, but now they can’t even go to work because they don’t have the opportunity for child care. It’s a triple strike for these families, and they’re going to be out big time if these programs aren’t able to be funded. I’m happy to we’ve been able to lead some good legislation on this, getting our SAFER grants, our cops grants, and Head Start in Des Moines effectively supported. We’ve gone out of the way to make sure that we worked with the White House on getting our troops paid through October. But this is not forever, and while SNAP and WIC are going to be able to be extended, we’ve got to get to a solution. The longest shutdown in government history, a shutdown of choice by the Democrats, a shutdown that’s never happened over a simple clean funding bill, is a reflection of a Democratic Party that has not only lost touch with its roots in places like Iowa, but it is clearly putting partisan, extreme primary politics ahead of the entire country.

Washington Reporter:

Iowa and Oklahoma don’t have any federally elected Democrats. Over in Oklahoma, Stephanie Bice was telling me that the shutdown shows that Democrats don’t care about rural America. Is that what’s going on here?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

When two guys from an extreme leftist state like New York are more worried about if they are going to have to try and get the endorsement of the new communist Mayor than they are the guys like Fetterman, who basically said that Democrats need to get their shit together if they can’t help feed the people who are poorest in this country, not only are you no longer championing what Democrats say they’re going to do, but you’re hurting the people, regardless of political party, who are the Americans on the front line of facing a Thanksgiving without food, without fuel, and without a future.

Washington Reporter:

I was struck by your point on Trump earlier, and obviously he spent a lot of the shutdown getting trade deals while Democrats in D.C. were doing no deals. Can you give us a sense of how the Asia trip, for example, is being received, especially by farmers in your district and in your state?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

For farmers, manufacturers and, candidly, for rural America, this is huge. For the last four years, under the Biden administration, we went from trade parity to a $50 billion trade deficit just in the ag sector alone. In my home state of Iowa, half of soybeans go to export markets. And the president’s done two things. He’s done, first of all, not just a great deal with China to get them to open back up, but he’s worked the entire region, everywhere from Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, specifically, a 95 percent reduction on tariffs for Iowa ag, in the course of 24 hours. This is huge. This is what we need. We need Iowa farms to be successful, because they can’t just be the big farms that can sell overseas. It’s got to be the hometown farms that can have a market for this. And then the other aspect of this, and one of the areas where I’ve been very vocal with both the White House and with the Treasury Secretary, is that we’ve got to have the opportunity to have a better domestic market here for being able to sell our commodities. That’s everything from our beef market to our biofuels market. And I’m happy to say the administration is hearing us on that, and that is something that helps out not just rural America be successful, but it drives down the cost of food and fuel for the entire country. Affordability in all of its aspects is going to come in those two areas, where, if we can drive down the cost of people being able to purchase goods at a cheaper and feed their families at cheaper rate, we’re moving in the right direction.

Washington Reporter:

Do you think that people’s Thanksgiving plans are going to be ruined by Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

Every single day of September, October, and now going in November, has been ruined by the Schumer shutdown. Hakeem and Schumer has the opportunity to end this tonight. They’ve had 14 times to end it prior to this. And I’ll be very clear here, there are five individuals who make the decision for the entire country right now. Republicans have been clear in the House. Republicans have been clear in the Senate, and the majority of both chambers want this. But more importantly, the majority of Americans, regardless of party, want this. Five people can do the right thing. It’s up to them to decide whether families are going to get to have the Thanksgiving and the Christmas they deserve.

Washington Reporter:

The European Commission has reached an agreement with 21 airlines to revise or remove environmental claims deemed misleading, following a coordinated investigation by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network.

The agreement concludes months of dialogue that began after the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) filed a complaint in 2023, accusing major carriers of “greenwashing.”

EU secures agreement with airlines to end misleading environmental messaging

The airlines involved include Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, SAS, EasyJet, Norwegian, SWISS, TAP Air Portugal, Austrian Airlines, and Vueling. All have committed to eliminate or clarify claims suggesting that a specific flight could be made “carbon neutral” or “sustainable” through the purchase of offsets or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“Consumers are the firepower of our economy. Time and time again, Europeans have shown their readiness to contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future,” said Michael McGrath, Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law and Consumer Protection.

“It is now important that the industry match these efforts by ensuring transparency and honesty in environmental claims. Consumers deserve clear and accurate information about the true impact of air travel and the real efforts that can be made to increase sustainability.”

“This dialogue is an encouraging acknowledgement of the responsibility we share to provide consumers with truthful information and to work toward genuine improvements in reducing the environmental impact of aviation,” said Henna Virkkunen, Executive Vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy. “I welcome the commitment made by the airlines to change their practices.

What airlines must change in their messaging

The Commission and national authorities said that many airline marketing practices violated the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which prohibits vague or unverifiable environmental promises. Under the new agreement, carriers will:

Remove or reword claims implying individual flights can be carbon neutral through offset schemes or SAF purchases.

Avoid using generic language like “green,” “eco-friendly,” or “sustainable travel” without providing scientific evidence.

Clarify the actual share of SAF used and the lifecycle methodology behind emissions-reduction figures.

Provide transparent assumptions in flight-emission calculators and ensure comparisons are scientifically supported.

The Commission emphasised that this was a compliance commitment, not a fine, but warned that enforcement could follow if the airlines fail to update their marketing.

The KLM “greenwashing” case: a win for environmental groups

In March 2024, the District Court of Amsterdam ruled that KLM Royal Dutch Airlines misled consumers with sustainability-related advertising, marking the first successful greenwashing lawsuit against an airline.

Environmental group Fossielvrij NL filed the case in 2022 with legal backing from ClientEarth, targeting KLM’s “Fly Responsibly” campaign. The plaintiffs argued that the airline’s claims about offsetting and sustainable aviation fuel created a false impression that passengers could fly “responsibly” without contributing to climate change.

The court found that 15 out of 19 marketing statements were misleading or insufficiently substantiated, including language implying KLM’s flights were sustainable or that purchasing offsets or SAF could neutralise emissions. In its ruling, the court said KLM had painted “an overly rosy picture” of sustainable aviation fuel and overstated the effectiveness of its measures, as reported by The Guardian.

Although the court did not require corrective advertising, it ordered the airline to ensure future claims are concrete, transparent, and evidence-based. KLM removed the contested materials.

Other airlines under fire for sustainability claims

Other airlines have also faced challenges from environmental groups and consumer protection agencies over their sustainability claims, not only in Europe but in the US as well. However, the US courts have generally favoured airlines.

Austrian Airlines: “carbon neutral to Venice”

In Austria, consumer group VKI filed a lawsuit against Austrian Airlines over a 2023 campaign claiming passengers could fly “carbon neutral to Venice” thanks to SAF. The court ruled that the claim was misleading because the airline used only a small fraction of SAF—nowhere near enough to offset the flight’s actual emissions.

Ryanair: “Europe’s lowest emissions airline”

The UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Ryanair’s 2020 ads that described it as “Europe’s lowest emissions airline.” Regulators said the claim relied on outdated data and failed to account for other carriers.

Delta Air Lines: “world’s first carbon-neutral airline”

In the United States, Delta Air Lines is facing a proposed class-action lawsuit (Berrin v. Delta Air Lines Inc.) filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The suit alleges that Delta misled passengers by marketing itself as “the world’s first carbon-neutral airline.”

The plaintiff, represented by environmental counsel, argued that Delta’s carbon-neutral claim relied on offsets that were “manifestly and provably false.” The lawsuit claimed that Delta overstated the impact of its carbon offsets, many of which, it said, were overcredited or unverifiable. Delta denied wrongdoing and filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the advertising was aspirational and that carbon offsets were certified by third-party verifiers.

United Airlines: SAF and carbon offsets claims

Also in the US, a class-action lawsuit (Zajac v. United Airlines Inc.) accused the airline of misleading consumers about its use of sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsets. The Maryland court dismissed the case in 2024, ruling that it was pre-empted by the Airline Deregulation Act, which limits state-level consumer actions against airlines.

Europe requires proof of airline ‘green’ claims

The EU’s coordinated action on airlines follows broader regulatory reforms, not all of which have been successful. The Green Claims Directive, for example, was withdrawn in June of this year. It would have required companies to substantiate any environmental marketing statements with scientific evidence.

At the same time, regulatory requirements are providing firm numbers that airlines can cite in their messaging to specify their sustainability progress. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which took effect in 2024, requires European airlines to blend set proportions of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. Airlines can publish their current blend compared to the target percentage required.

Airlines’ sustainability messaging agreement is only the beginning

Consumer groups say the new airline commitments are only the start.

“It is great news that authorities from across Europe acknowledge consumers have been fooled by airlines’ greenwashing. It is unacceptable that airlines have freely lured consumers into offsetting their flight’s emissions, sometimes at a high price. One can never be sure that the trees planted to compensate a flight’s high emissions will capture the carbon back into the ground – if they are planted at all,” said Monique Goyens, BEUC’s Director General.

“The fact that European consumer protection authorities are calling on airlines to get their act together shows there’s a wind of change. Greenwashing is no longer acceptable, and the fact that aviation is one of the most highly polluting sectors makes it even more intolerable. Today’s crackdown on greenwashing is encouraging at a time when consumers are expected to shift to more sustainable lifestyles.”

The combined effect of regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and public pressure will reshape how airlines talk about sustainability. Airlines now know that marketing slogans like “carbon-neutral flights” or “fly responsibly” can expose them to legal liability. The agreement does not mean airlines should stop promoting their sustainability initiatives, but rather that they should communicate measurable, verified progress rather than aspirational claims.

The initiative, named Project Speedbird, represents a joint development between LanzaJet and British Airways. Fluor will recognise the undisclosed contract value in the third quarter.

Mike Alexander, group president of Project Execution at Fluor Corporation, characterised Project Speedbird as marking pivotal advancement in global efforts to decarbonise aviation. He stated that by accelerating adoption of sustainable fuel technologies, the project will help redefine the future of flight, with Fluor proud to bring engineering and design expertise to the visionary initiative.

The project will leverage LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology to transform second-generation ethanol, sourced from agricultural residues and woody biomass, into sustainable aviation fuel. British Airways will utilise this SAF to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 230,000 tonnes annually, equivalent to emissions from 26,000 domestic flights.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, stated that Project Speedbird represents the next commercial-scale facility in LanzaJet’s development portfolio, working closely with British Airways. He characterised it as an important step in continued scale-up of the company’s leading sustainable fuels technology. Samartzis noted that partnering with globally recognised engineering, procurement, and construction company Fluor Corporation demonstrates commitment to highest standards in project execution.

Located in Teesside, UK, the facility will produce more than 90,000 tonnes (30 million gallons) of SAF and renewable diesel annually. The site was selected for strategic location, advanced infrastructure, and access to skilled workforce.

Front-end engineering and design establishes detailed technical specifications, equipment selections, site layouts, and cost estimates supporting final investment decisions and subsequent detailed engineering for construction. FEED work bridges conceptual design and full engineering, procurement, and construction execution, addressing technical uncertainties and refining project scope.

LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology converts ethanol into jet fuel through catalytic processes producing hydrocarbons meeting aviation fuel specifications. The technology’s use of second-generation ethanol derived from agricultural residues and woody biomass addresses sustainability concerns about first-generation biofuels competing with food production.

British Airways’ commitment to offtake the facility’s SAF production provides commercial foundation supporting project financing. Long-term purchase agreements from creditworthy airlines enable project developers to secure debt financing and proceed with capital-intensive facility construction.

The 230,000-tonne annual emissions reduction represents substantial carbon abatement for British Airways’ operations, supporting the airline’s decarbonisation objectives. Aviation faces limited near-term alternatives to liquid fuels, making SAF a primary pathway for emissions reduction whilst maintaining existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Teesside’s selection reflects the region’s industrial heritage, existing energy infrastructure, port facilities, and workforce with relevant skills from petrochemical and process industries. The UK government has supported development of low-carbon industries in Teesside through various policy initiatives and funding programmes supporting industrial transformation.

The facility’s dual production of SAF and renewable diesel provides operational flexibility and revenue diversification. Renewable diesel serves road transport markets, providing additional offtake opportunities beyond aviation applications. Production processes for SAF and renewable diesel share technological similarities, enabling integrated facilities producing both products.

Project Speedbird advances UK objectives for developing domestic SAF production capacity supporting aviation sector decarbonisation whilst creating industrial jobs and supply chain opportunities. The UK government has established mandates requiring SAF blending in aviation fuel, creating policy certainty supporting production investments.

The 90,000-tonne annual SAF production capacity represents meaningful scale for European markets, where SAF availability currently falls well short of demand created by regulatory mandates and airline sustainability commitments. Commercial-scale facilities like Project Speedbird prove essential for closing this supply-demand gap.

Fluor’s role in FEED positions the engineering firm for potential EPC contract award following final investment decision, though FEED contracts don’t guarantee subsequent construction phase awards. The company’s project execution expertise in process industries supports complex facility development requiring integration of novel technologies with proven engineering practices.

LanzaJet operates the world’s first ethanol-to-SAF production facility in Georgia, United States, providing operational experience informing subsequent project development including Project Speedbird. Scaling from demonstration to multiple commercial facilities requires proven technology, experienced partners, and creditworthy offtake agreements—elements converging in the British Airways partnership.",https://storageterminalsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LJ-FPF-Approved-18-scaled-e1762763461613.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 13:01:48.047769

Train travel in North America will soon get a lot faster

Choosing electric rail travel over a direct flight can cut emissions by around 86% (though, as The New York Times reported, much of the rail network in America still runs on highly polluting diesel). But while Japan's Shinkansen ""Bullet Trains"" debuted high-speed rail in 1964 and France's TGV marked a global high-speed train revolution once it began rolling in the early 1980s, North American rail travel has languished on the wrong side of the tracks.

But railfans, rejoice! Amtrak partnered with Alstom to deliver its next-generation premium Acela trainsets along 457 miles of track in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor (NEC) in August 2025. Amtrak's trains can operate at top speeds of 160 mph versus today's fleet, which operates at top speeds of 150 mph, and connect Boston, New Jersey, and Washington, DC as part of a $2.45 billion investment in the NEC. Twenty-eight new trains will enter service through 2027. Elsewhere, high-speed train links operated by various bodies will soon follow between Portland and Vancouver, Las Vegas and Southern California, Miami and Tampa, Houston and Dallas, and, hopefully, San Francisco and Los Angeles-making future journeys faster and more relaxing.

By 2040, rush hour won't exist-thanks to self-driving electric vehicles

EVs and hybrid vehicles are mainstays of freeways, and mobility experts agree that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will transform travel. McKinsey's 2025 The Next Normal report ""The future of self-driving cars: Safer, smarter, and everywhere"" declares that by 2040, autonomous vehicles could be as commonplace as any household appliance-shaping how families organize their days, how cities are designed, and creating a driving experience that is smarter, safer, and all-around better. Hours spent watching the road could be used for video calling a friend, watching a movie, napping, or even working-all of which would make traveling during the daily commute and holiday period a little less painful.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are looking to a future approaching net zero

Long-haul trips account for 60% of aviation emissions and 69.3% of CO2 emissions from passenger travel. Rather than reinventing the wheel, airlines targeting IATA's ""net zero carbon by 2050"" goal are developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to power existing aircraft engines.

In 2022, Swedish airline BRA made history as the first to operate a regional commercial aircraft with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Supplier Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Used neat, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel use.

Fifty airlines are investing in SAF, and over half a million flights have used SAF to some degree, but the industry is not without its critics. Some SAFs contain biofuels derived from crops, which can put pressure on global food supplies and contribute to deforestation. But the promise of ""synthetic"" or ""e-fuels"" created by artificially combining hydrogen with ambient pollutant carbon dioxide is looking to a future where the SAF lifecycle approaches net-zero.

Air Company's AIRMADE® SAF, which it markets under the dramatic tagline ""Extinction ends here,"" is a fully formulated drop-in jet fuel that can be produced at scale with access to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and clean hydrogen (H₂). AIRCO has commercial partnerships with airlines, including JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic, and has been awarded multiple government contracts, including with NASA and the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit. If the technology holds up, it will change the conversation around fuel-based CO2 emissions for good.

Electric, hydrogen-powered, and supersonic aircraft promise to decarbonize and democratize air travel

Various technologies show promise for navigating the skies on short-, mid-, and long-haul trips. LA-based start-up Heart Aerospace's mission is to use sustainable, electrified regional aircraft to reduce emissions and make flying more accessible to more people around the world. Hydrogen-powered engines are a staple in space rockets, but challenging to apply in aviation, yet Airbus has bet big on hybrid hydrogen aircraft-its ZEROe aircraft concept is slated to launch by 2035.

And after the demise of Concorde, supersonic aviation is staging a comeback. Boom's sleek supersonic aircraft, Overture, has an aerodynamic, lightweight carbon-fiber design and new-generation supersonic engines that run entirely on SAF. In ""boomless cruise,"" the aircraft ensures there's no audible sonic boom using Mach cutoff physics, opening up overland routes. Boom has commitments from American Airlines and United Airlines, with the first aircraft due to be delivered in 2029, when passengers can fly from New York to San Francisco in four hours. In a few years, air travel time on some routes around the holidays and year-round could be halved.

Inspired by Star Trek, shuttles powered by ionic wind could enable us to boldly-and silently-go places we've gone before

Down the line, people might even take to the skies in a Star Trek-inspired, ionic wind-powered aircraft. In 2018, MIT engineers built and flew the first-ever plane with no moving parts-instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an ""ionic wind,"" a silent flow of ions that generates enough thrust to sustain steady flight.

In MIT News, Steven Barrett, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, explained how the aircraft was inspired in part by the futuristic shuttlecrafts in the Star Trek TV shows and movies he watched avidly as a child. The physical principle of electroaerodynamic thrust was first identified in the 1920s, but remained the realm of hobbyists until a jetlagged Barrett did some back-of-the-napkin calculations after an uncomfortable flight. In the near term, he believes ion wind propulsion systems could be used to fly silent drones. Long-term, he says, they might be paired with more conventional combustion systems to create more fuel-efficient, hybrid large aircraft, including passenger planes.

About the GBTA Foundation The mission of the GBTA Foundation, the US 501c3 charitable arm of the Global Business Travel Association, is to help the global business travel industry create a positive impact and better future for people and the planet.","Hamburg, Germany ─ The GBTA Foundation, the cause-led arm of the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), today released the second-year findings from its Sustainability Acceleration Challenge, a global benchmark assessing the state of corporate action to decarbonize business travel programs.

Input from 285 companies across the globe – representing an annual business travel spend of $22 billion USD – reveals that companies are still committed to tracking and managing carbon emissions from their employee travel programs, with measurable gains in maturity and more organizations joining the effort. Progress, however, remains limited in certain high impact areas, underscoring the need for faster, collective action to invest in low-carbon travel solutions.

Year two of our benchmark shows real engagement and growing commitment. But despite progress, greater urgency is needed. To future-proof business travel, companies must accelerate adoption of sustainable procurement practices and carbon management strategies to send a real signal to the market. Delphine Millot, Senior Vice President, Advocacy and Sustainability, GBTA, and Managing Director, GBTA Foundation

The 2025 results from the global benchmark developed in collaboration with Accenture were released today at the GBTA + VDR Europe Conference in Hamburg and can be downloaded here.

Key findings from the 2025 GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge include:

Participation continues to grow: 285 companies participated in the 2025 assessment, marking a 20% increase compared to 2024. Across the two years, participants represent approximately $31 billion in annual business travel spend and include one-quarter of BTN’s Top 100 corporate travel programs.

Incremental maturity gains: The global average score is now 1.4 compared to 1.3 in 2024 (out of a maturity scale from 0 showing “no activity” to 5 being “leading practice”), reflecting limited overall improvement.

Regional shifts: Global and APAC travel programs improved slightly, while regional and local programs in Europe and North America dipped marginally, likely due to regulatory changes and economic uncertainty.

Program size correlation: Smaller (<$5M) programs have made notable progress this year, while the largest (>$500M) programs have regressed overall, perhaps demonstrating that while companies under intense public scrutiny may be slowing their sustainability efforts, smaller companies may be using sustainability leadership as a way to differentiate themselves.

Leading industry sectors: The Financial, Banking and Insurance sector continues to lead (maturity score of 1.9 out of 5), followed by the Professional Services and Consulting sector (score of 1.7). These sectors traditionally have a large share of their emissions coming from their business travel programs.

Where companies are making progress:

Cost-positive sustainable practices are accelerating. Sustainable Travel Policies (2.2 score in 2025 versus 1.8 score in 2024) and Carbon Budgets (0.7 score in 2025 versus 0.5 score in 2024) show strong year-over-year improvement.

Reporting and targets setting are becoming standard. Reporting (2.7 score in 2025 versus 2.1 score in 2024) and Targets Setting (1.7 score in 2025 versus 1.4 score in 2024) are increasingly built into travel programs – although the largest companies show some regression.

Where acceleration is urgently needed:

Shaping travel decisions. Tools that influence booking choices – Carbon Fees (score of 0.4 in 2025) and OBT (online booking tool) Features (score of 2.4 in 2025), have stalled. Embedding these mechanisms is key to enforcing sustainable travel policies.

Sending a unified demand signal: While supplier sustainability assessments are increasing, advanced levers such as the GBTA Sustainable Procurement Standards and sustainability clauses in Contracting (score of 1.2 in 2025), show no movement – likely hindered by limited guidance and technology enablement.

Investing in emissions abatement: The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to decrease emissions from business travel is growing (15% of corporates purchasing SAF certificates in 2025, up from 12% in 2024), but adoption remains low. Corporates can leverage GBTA SAF Corporate Connect for best practices on SAF implementation.

The GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge provides a roadmap for the future. With more companies participating, we’re seeing where the industry is moving forward, and where further collaboration can close the gap between ambition and action. Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg, Global Travel & Aviation Sustainability Lead, Accenture

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location.
This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.
Alfanar UK country head, Noaman Al Adhami, said: “The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production.
Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world.","Global project development, manufacturing and engineering group Alfanar has confirmed a move to a larger, more enhanced site for its Lighthouse Green Fuels (LGF) SAF project. During a keynote to aviation leaders at the Airlines 2025 conference in London, UK Country Head of Alfanar Noaman Al Adhami also unveiled a new dedicated brand and website for LGF – LGF Projects Ltd – which is wholly owned by Alfanar.

The £2 billion (€2.28 billion) LGF project will convert 1.5 million tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass feedstocks – including forestry, sawmill, and agricultural residues in line with the UK SAF Mandate – into more than 180 million litres of second-generation SAF, offsetting the equivalent carbon emissions of 4,500 transatlantic flights from London to New York.

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location.

It offers closer access to critical infrastructure, including rail and shipping links, and enables the entire conversion process to take place on one site, from feedstock pre-treatment to storage.

It is also even closer to carbon capture and storage infrastructure, providing the opportunity for seamless integration into the network when online. This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.

Alfanar UK country head, Noaman Al Adhami, said: “The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production. Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world.

“This relocation drives further operational and supply chain efficiencies and means we are better placed to increase production capacity in the future once the first phase of the project is underway.”

Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, who visited Alfanar’s London HQ, said: “Teesside is leading the charge in the industries of the future, and Alfanar’s £2 billion investment to build the world’s biggest sustainable aviation fuel plant of its kind is a clear sign of that leadership.

“We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms. Having a project of this scale built right here shows what we already know - that Teesside has the people, skills and drive to deliver groundbreaking projects like this.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lighthouse-Green-Fuels-pic-Biofuel-10-11-768x432.png,N,,2025-11-10 11:00:24.624877

The start of these fuel deliveries in October marked the company’s second and third deployments of blended SAF at a major U.S. airport in six months. In May, FedEx announced its first major U.S. SAF deployment at Los Angeles International Airport.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help to scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs of increased SAF production globally this calendar year.”

Chicago-O’Hare International Airport

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a blend to include a total of 1 million gallons of neat SAF at a minimum 30% blend from Air bp. With its first fuel delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at Chicago-O’Hare International Airport.*

“Existing fuel infrastructure and enabling policy conditions at the state level made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel procurement strategy,” Blanks Ellis added.

Miami International Airport

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started to take delivery of around three million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% blend minimum from AEG.

“With FedEx flights from Miami heading all over Latin America and the Caribbean every day, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, president, FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and demonstrates to our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we’re embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and actively contributing to the corporation’s global sustainability strategy.”

SAF: Part of a holistic aviation sustainability strategy

Under current fuel standards, neat—or unblended—SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels.^ However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives enabled FedEx to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in $400 million in savings for the company. In FY 2024, FedEx achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. Upping its ambition, FedEx has since expanded that goal to target a 40% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity by 2034.

How has policy focus evolved in your markets since the pandemic?

Location cost for airlines have increased dramatically, particularly in Austria and Germany. In Vienna, for example, the increase between 2019 and 2024 nearly reached 80%! The German aviation tax rose 25% in May 2024 and January 1, 2025, aviation security fees increased up to 50%. The excessively high fees represent the main reason why air traffic recovery massively lags other European countries. This development is extremely worrying. Connectivity is essential for economic growth. According to earlier research conducted by IATA and Oxford Economics among EU countries, a 10% increase in the level of connectivity, relative to the GDP size, can increase long-run GDP by 1.1%.

In 2013, Germany ranked first among all European countries in terms of air connectivity – that is, passenger capacity weighted by the economic importance of all served destinations. Since then, both the United Kingdom and Spain have overtaken Germany.

Austria has also slipped in recent years. In 2014 it was ranked 27th, compared to 33rd in 2024.

Switzerland – comparable in size to Austria – ranked 22nd in 2014 and 2024.

It is important to stop and reverse these negative trends. The importance of air transport for societies and economies is vital. In Germany, around 400,000 people work directly in the aviation sector, 50,000 in Austria, 66,000 in Switzerland, and 8,5000 in Luxembourg. These are impressive figures! Air transport connects the world, building important bridges to other countries and cultures. It is also critical for trade, as the rapid transport of important production goods is an indispensable location factor.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents the main solution for the industry to deliver its Fly Net Zero 2050 commitment. What updates can you provide from your markets, notably on the required sufficient availability and ‘affordable’ pricing, as well as the book and claim system?

Since 1st January 2025 there has been a blending mandate of 2% SAF in Europe. The positive message is that the airlines will fulfill this mandate, despite the challenges of SAF inaccessibility in many airports, and high prices.

Germany has always showed a penchant for eSAF. A few months back, the world’s largest Power to Liquid (PtL) plant from Ineratec opened in Frankfurt. While this is promising, its yearly kerosene production does not suffice to operate a single flight from Frankfurt to Palma de Mallorca. Regarding eSAF, availability is scarce. Regulators must not ignore this fact. In Germany, a law in place requires a PtL sub-quota from January 1, 2026. Absurdly, airlines are thus legally obliged to buy a product which practically does not exist. A few weeks ago, the Federal Ministry of the Environment informed the aviation industry that the law would not be enforced – far too late.

Switzerland is also quite active in non-fossil SAF R&D – Metafuels/Evos and Synhelion, just to name two promising projects. The country has introduced the same SAF mandates as in the European Union, effective 1st January 2026.

The Austrian fuel producer OMV produces biogenic SAF in Vienna, and are currently building a large plant in Romania, where 250,000 tons of fuel will be produced annually from 2028, the delocalization being mainly cost-driven, with overall costs in Central Europe too high.

Despite excellent research and pioneering projects, industrial scale production will not see daylight in Central Europe. A “Book and Claim” of “SAF Accounting” system would facilitate SAF purchase anywhere worldwide for our airlines. It should be politically supported and quickly introduced.

In past years, we have been witnessing increasing greenwashing measures from Governments. What actions have you or will you put in place to counter this trend?

Germany and Austria have new governments in place since spring, both of which have a much better understanding of air transport and its benefits. However, half of parliament members are new, requiring us to expose and explain this value. IATA is known for fact-based discussions and industry expertise, offering extensive data and economic reports for leading politicians and key stakeholders. This includes policy recommendations developed for Germany and Austria, where our Association plays an active role as member of the governmental SAF working groups in support of the sustainable transition.

Germany is one of the largest aviation markets in Europe, yet it has underperformed in comparison to other major ones. How do you explain it, and what can be done to address this?

The location cost increase is extremely harmful, lowering airline competitiveness. Comparing 2024 with 2019 (pre-pandemic), domestic flight connections have plummeted an astonishing 50%. Outside major hubs such as Frankfurt and Munich, the situation is even more dire, reaching declines of up to 75%! Many airlines are withdrawing their aircraft from Germany to operate from more economically favorable locations instead. This is detrimental to connectivity and mobility in the country and is already leading to job losses. Aviation bears a very high tax burden that other transport modes do not have. In 2024 alone, the aviation tax amounted to more than €2 billion Euro.

Aviation needs fewer, not more, government-induced burdens to avoid further widening the gap with the competition. Specifically, this means:

abolition of aviation taxes in Austria and Germany. More taxes mean less value creation in the countries, and the endangerment of many thousands of jobs;

reduction of air traffic management costs;

reduction of security costs and other state location costs, to reach competitive levels again.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” said the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan at a press conference.
Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.
The announcement follows Singapore’s creation of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage fuel purchases using levy proceeds.","SINGAPORE, Nov 10 — Passengers departing from Singapore will soon be footing part of the bill for the country’s shift to greener skies, with a new levy of between S$1 (RM3.20) and S$41.60 to support the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), The Straits Times reported today.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced today that the charge will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights leaving Singapore from October that year.

The levy, which airlines must list as a separate line item on air tickets, will be based on flight distance and travel class — with business and first-class passengers paying up to four times more than those in economy.

For economy or premium economy travellers, the levy will range from S$1 for a flight to Bangkok to S$10.40 for one to New York. Those flying in premium cabins will pay between S$4 and S$41.60.

CAAS said the charges were lower than previously forecast due to a drop in green jet fuel prices.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” said the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan at a press conference.

The roll-out is timed to give airlines and travellers room to adapt, according to CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

“If you go out and buy a ticket today, the levy will not apply, even if you travel beyond October 1, 2026,” he said.

The fee will also not apply to transit passengers, training flights or humanitarian operations.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Despite volatile fuel prices, Han said the levy will remain fixed until the SAF target changes.

The levy will come on top of existing airport fees, bringing total charges for an economy passenger flying to New York to S$75.60 in 2026, and S$106.80 for a premium passenger.

Changi’s current S$65.20 passenger fee is set to rise gradually to S$79.20 by 2030 to help fund airport upgrades and higher operating costs.

The new charge will also apply to cargo shipments, private jets and chartered flights, with rates adjusted for aircraft size and distance.

The announcement follows Singapore’s creation of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage fuel purchases using levy proceeds. The fuel will be blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied at both of Singapore’s airports.

Under the country’s sustainable air hub blueprint launched in February 2024, the government and industry aim to cut airport emissions by 20 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.",https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2025/11/10/309079.JPG,N,,2025-11-10 09:17:07.015747

“The next generation of aviation is now real that people can see it.
The supply chain and the infrastructure around aerospace hasn’t recovered as quickly as anyone would have would have hoped.
Flying in formation At the same time, other aviation investors are clubbing together to invest in capital-heavy areas such as sustainable aviation fuel.
Sees.ai recently raised a £3.65m round from investors including Boeing and Hearst Ventures.","It is the best of times and the worst of times for aerospace innovation. On the one hand, the pace of innovation is rapid, with electric air taxis such as Joby moving closer to safety certification and drone developments accelerated by warfare. At the same time, airlines and aircraft manufacturers, still recovering from the after-effects of the covid pandemic, are working on precarious finances and are ill-placed to make heavy bets on their innovation arms.

“Aerospace is in that transformational stage,” says Nichola Bates (pictured, above), founder of XeleratedFifty, the innovation and investment group that recently spun out of aerospace company Boeing. “The next generation of aviation is now real that people can see it. We can see drones and air taxis flying around. It’s actually real. Financial investors are saying, ‘okay, now it’s ready for us’. I think we’re in that stage where these new things are growing, and there is potential to be really disruptive.”

But it is hard to focus on innovation when more immediate business issues need attention. “The recovery from covid has been a lot more difficult than expected. The supply chain and the infrastructure around aerospace hasn’t recovered as quickly as anyone would have would have hoped. All of that leads to a different focus. The fear around the bottom line becomes more acute,” says Bates.

Both JetBlue and Boeing have posted heavy losses – JetBlue reported a net loss of $208m in the first quarter of this year, while Boeing posted a loss of $11.8bn in 2024. Both companies’ innovation arms spun out to become independent operations earlier this year.

Bates took the startup accelerator and investment programme she had built at Boeing outside the organisation earlier this year, making it into a part of FiftyGroup, an investor in the industrial sector. The move came soon after JetBlue Ventures, headed by Amy Burr, spun out of US airline JetBlue, turning it into part of aviation investor Sky Leasing.

Flying in formation

At the same time, other aviation investors are clubbing together to invest in capital-heavy areas such as sustainable aviation fuel.

United Airlines Ventures set up a sustainable aviation fuel fund that has brought in money from more than 22 external investors, providing extra firepower and a measure of independence to the fund.

Another group of airlines linked to the Oneworld Alliance, including American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and International Airlines Group (IAG), parent company of British Airways, have jointly backed a $150m SAF fund that will be managed by venture capital firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

“Any individual airline’s CVC faces an uphill battle when investing in deeply technical sectors like SAF. Seed investments in this sector are completely a different proposition to something like software, they are much more capital intensive,” says Matt Ridley, director of sustainability and innovation at IAG.

“A single CVC team can’t hire 10 SAF specialists, but by investing together we can draw on a talent pool that effectively gives us that.”

Investing through an external fund run by a third party also allowed the investments in SAF, which require a long-term capital commitment, to be protected from short term priority shifts at the airlines.

“CVC investing can also be subject to pendulum swings, alternating between almost total independence and being closer to the core corporation. Having seven or eight airlines oscillating between different degrees of strategic and financial focus in the investments wouldn’t have allowed the same kind of long-term benefit. Investing through this fund insulates the decision-making on investments from those corporate swings,” says Ridley.

Taking a broader approach

While these moves — spinning out or investing together — have been responses to constrained budgets, they can also be an opportunity to broaden the scope of the investment team’s activities.

“The restrictions are gone now,” says Bates. Her team — which had a heavily hands-on approach in helping startups build and scale their businesses — had always fielded requests from companies in other sectors to deliver projects for them.

“There was such a crossover in the companies that we worked with, whether it was from the aerospace, oil and gas, or automotive sectors, we were always asked if we could do this for them. We could only do that if it was a strategic benefit to Boeing. Now we don’t have that restriction. We can work across different verticals, which is really positive.”

Bates and her team supported more than 40 startups in 14 countries while part of Boeing, including supporting Sees.ai, a company developing autonomous drone inspections for critical national infrastructure such as power lines, pipelines and railways. Sees.ai recently raised a £3.65m round from investors including Boeing and Hearst Ventures.

But now Bates is seeking to apply the model to other sectors such as energy, defence, space and shipping. “We’re looking for things that can be really transformational to these hard to disrupt industries,” she says. “The reality was that there are things that I could do at Boeing because of that profile, that platform, the access that [that brand] gives you. However, it needs to be bigger. It doesn’t happen with one organisation. It takes a community to come together, to really start pushing forward,” says Bates. “My dream for this was always that we build that neutral platform where organisations can come together.”

Benefits for outside collaborators

There are benefits, too, for the outside groups working with these corporate investors.

“For Breakthrough the benefit is that you have customers representing about a third of the 2024 SAF market in this fund and you get all the strategic benefits of that. The potential customers of SAF are all in this fund,” says Ridley.

Meanwhile, for London-headquartered Fifty Group, the addition of XeleratedFifty brings more early-stage investment capability to an organisation that has typically invested in much later-stage financing and large infrastructure projects that can take decades to realise.

“The LPs that they’re working with are all very excited about now having us support what they’re trying to do at earlier stages, helping them identify the innovation coming through. We are making sure that they’re innovative and challenging them with some of the things that we’re seeing in the portfolio. We’re holding their feet to the fire to say, here’s how the technology has changed the 10 years since you started this project,” says Bates.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/10/Nichola-Bates-airline-background.png,N,,2025-11-10 09:17:37.453657

The initiative, named Project Speedbird, represents a joint development between LanzaJet and British Airways. Fluor will recognise the undisclosed contract value in the third quarter.

Mike Alexander, group president of Project Execution at Fluor Corporation, characterised Project Speedbird as marking pivotal advancement in global efforts to decarbonise aviation. He stated that by accelerating adoption of sustainable fuel technologies, the project will help redefine the future of flight, with Fluor proud to bring engineering and design expertise to the visionary initiative.

The project will leverage LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology to transform second-generation ethanol, sourced from agricultural residues and woody biomass, into sustainable aviation fuel. British Airways will utilise this SAF to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 230,000 tonnes annually, equivalent to emissions from 26,000 domestic flights.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, stated that Project Speedbird represents the next commercial-scale facility in LanzaJet’s development portfolio, working closely with British Airways. He characterised it as an important step in continued scale-up of the company’s leading sustainable fuels technology. Samartzis noted that partnering with globally recognised engineering, procurement, and construction company Fluor Corporation demonstrates commitment to highest standards in project execution.

Located in Teesside, UK, the facility will produce more than 90,000 tonnes (30 million gallons) of SAF and renewable diesel annually. The site was selected for strategic location, advanced infrastructure, and access to skilled workforce.

Front-end engineering and design establishes detailed technical specifications, equipment selections, site layouts, and cost estimates supporting final investment decisions and subsequent detailed engineering for construction. FEED work bridges conceptual design and full engineering, procurement, and construction execution, addressing technical uncertainties and refining project scope.

LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology converts ethanol into jet fuel through catalytic processes producing hydrocarbons meeting aviation fuel specifications. The technology’s use of second-generation ethanol derived from agricultural residues and woody biomass addresses sustainability concerns about first-generation biofuels competing with food production.

British Airways’ commitment to offtake the facility’s SAF production provides commercial foundation supporting project financing. Long-term purchase agreements from creditworthy airlines enable project developers to secure debt financing and proceed with capital-intensive facility construction.

The 230,000-tonne annual emissions reduction represents substantial carbon abatement for British Airways’ operations, supporting the airline’s decarbonisation objectives. Aviation faces limited near-term alternatives to liquid fuels, making SAF a primary pathway for emissions reduction whilst maintaining existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Teesside’s selection reflects the region’s industrial heritage, existing energy infrastructure, port facilities, and workforce with relevant skills from petrochemical and process industries. The UK government has supported development of low-carbon industries in Teesside through various policy initiatives and funding programmes supporting industrial transformation.

The facility’s dual production of SAF and renewable diesel provides operational flexibility and revenue diversification. Renewable diesel serves road transport markets, providing additional offtake opportunities beyond aviation applications. Production processes for SAF and renewable diesel share technological similarities, enabling integrated facilities producing both products.

Project Speedbird advances UK objectives for developing domestic SAF production capacity supporting aviation sector decarbonisation whilst creating industrial jobs and supply chain opportunities. The UK government has established mandates requiring SAF blending in aviation fuel, creating policy certainty supporting production investments.

The 90,000-tonne annual SAF production capacity represents meaningful scale for European markets, where SAF availability currently falls well short of demand created by regulatory mandates and airline sustainability commitments. Commercial-scale facilities like Project Speedbird prove essential for closing this supply-demand gap.

Fluor’s role in FEED positions the engineering firm for potential EPC contract award following final investment decision, though FEED contracts don’t guarantee subsequent construction phase awards. The company’s project execution expertise in process industries supports complex facility development requiring integration of novel technologies with proven engineering practices.

LanzaJet operates the world’s first ethanol-to-SAF production facility in Georgia, United States, providing operational experience informing subsequent project development including Project Speedbird. Scaling from demonstration to multiple commercial facilities requires proven technology, experienced partners, and creditworthy offtake agreements—elements converging in the British Airways partnership.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-10 09:18:03.820947

The Tourism Authority of Thailand, in partnership with VietJet and PTT OR, has launched a groundbreaking Green Route flight between Bangkok and Phu Quoc, powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a significant step toward a more eco-friendly aviation sector in ASEAN. This collaboration is a direct response to the increasing global demand for sustainable travel solutions and Thailand’s ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. By introducing this SAF-powered service, Thailand is not only promoting responsible travel but also positioning itself as a regional leader in sustainable tourism. The Green Route flight aligns with the broader efforts of the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint, making this partnership a key milestone in the transition to low-carbon air travel.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has teamed up with VietJet Thailand and PTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited (PTT OR) to launch the first-ever “Green Route” flight connecting Bangkok and Phu Quoc. This marks a milestone in Thailand’s aviation industry as the inaugural service on this route is powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership underscores Thailand’s commitment to advancing sustainable tourism and supporting the aviation industry’s transition towards cleaner, low-carbon operations throughout the ASEAN region.

VietJet Thailand’s move to incorporate SAF into its operations sets a significant example for the aviation industry. By launching the Green Route, the airline demonstrates its commitment to sustainability and responsible travel. The collaboration aligns with Thailand’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050 and showcases how aviation can contribute to promoting responsible tourism. With the Green Route flight, Thailand takes a meaningful step towards a low-carbon society while positioning itself as a leader in sustainable tourism in the region.

The inaugural Green Route flight took off on November 6, 2025, from Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, with officials from the public and private sectors attending to mark the occasion. The ceremony included representatives from both the tourism and energy sectors, underscoring the cross-sector collaboration necessary to achieve long-term sustainability goals. By working together, these sectors are accelerating the transition to more environmentally responsible travel options.

VietJet Thailand’s Green Route flight is part of its “Fly Green” program, which aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. VietJet Thailand made history as the first low-cost carrier in the country to operate flights using SAF. The Bangkok–Phu Quoc route is the airline’s second Green Route, following the successful launch of the Bangkok–Da Nang route in 2024. This collaboration between VietJet, PTT OR, and Bangkok Aviation Fuel Services (BAFS) illustrates the airline’s long-term commitment to reducing emissions and embracing sustainable aviation practices.

The airline’s goal is to achieve a five-percent SAF blend across all its flights by 2030. The Green Route flights are a critical step toward reaching this target. Each SAF-powered flight on the Bangkok–Phu Quoc route will reduce CO₂ emissions by around 250 kilograms, resulting in a reduction of up to 80 percent in total emissions per flight. VietJet aims to cut over 153,000 tonnes of CO₂ within the next six years, contributing significantly to Thailand’s overall carbon-reduction goals.

VietJet’s Chief Executive Officer emphasized that the airline’s integration of SAF into its routine operations is a clear demonstration of its commitment to balancing business growth with environmental responsibility. He pointed out that this collaboration highlights the vital role that synergy between the aviation and energy sectors can play in accelerating the transition to greener, more sustainable travel. This initiative shows how strategic partnerships can help transform the aviation sector into a more sustainable industry, benefiting both businesses and passengers.

Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and biogas. It adheres to ASTM D7566 international standards, ensuring it performs just like conventional Jet A-1 fuel without compromising on safety or efficiency. SAF offers a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, with the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Thailand is well-positioned to become a leading producer of SAF due to its abundant bio-based resources and growing circular economy infrastructure. With continued public–private collaboration, the production of SAF can be scaled up to meet both national and regional carbon-reduction targets, while improving cost efficiency.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand continues to advance sustainable tourism by promoting initiatives like the Thailand Tourism Awards, CF-Hotels, and the Sustainable Tourism Acceleration Rating (STAR). These programs guide tourism operators toward adopting greener practices and reinforce TAT’s mission to position Thailand as a responsible destination for eco-conscious travelers. The Green Route initiative between VietJet and PTT OR exemplifies how cross-sector partnerships can drive sustainable mobility and help enhance Thailand’s reputation as a global leader in low-carbon tourism.

Vietnam remains one of Thailand’s most important short-haul markets, with over 600,000 Vietnamese visitors expected in 2025. Travelers from Vietnam continue to visit Thailand for its cultural, leisure, and wellness offerings. With a growing interest in new destinations, TAT aims to strengthen its presence in the Vietnamese market by continuing to collaborate with airlines and digital travel partners. This collaboration includes initiatives like the Thailand Summer Blast campaign and the Krabi Prototype project, which focus on highlighting sustainable routes and certified operators under CF-Hotels and the Thailand Tourism Awards.

At a briefing on 10 November, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said the new levy will be imposed on all passengers with tickets bought from 1 April 2026 for all flights departing from 1 October.

Singapore is the first in the world to impose a blanket levy on all departing flights, with the funds going towards bulk procurement of SAF.

The levy will cover not just passenger services but also cargo, as well as business and general aviation flights. It will also increase according to the distance travelled and cabin class of travel, states CAAS.

An economy-class (or premium economy-class) passenger travelling within Southeast Asia will pay a levy of S$1 ($0.77), while economy-class passengers travelling to the USA will pay an additional S$10.40.

Business- and first-class passengers travelling within Southeast Asia will be charged S$4, with the levy rising to S$41.60 for travel to the USA.

CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan says the levy is lower than previously indicated because the price of SAF has “moderated”.

“We are also giving time for passengers to adjust to the SAF levy,” Han says.

In 2024, the CAAS gave examples on how much the levy could cost: an economy-class passenger flying to Bangkok could pay S$3, while those flying to London could pay S$16.

For cargo flights, the levy will be imposed on shippers – instead of aircraft operators – with charges varying according to geographical distance. For example, for shipments to Northeast or South Asia, the levy stands at S$0.04 per kg.

CAAS says the levy for business and general aviation flights will be charged on a per-aircraft basis, based on distance travelled and aircraft size. Certain flights – including training and humanitarian flights – will not be subjected to the levy.

The imposition of the levy comes as Singapore targets a 1% uplift of SAF from 2026, with the aim of increasing it to between 3% and 5% in 2030.

In late-October, CAAS announced the setting up of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), a government-owned non-profit company that will oversee the acquisition and distribution of SAF, as well as implementation of the country’s SAF policies.

Han says Singapore’s procurement of SAF will be done with a fixed-cost envelopment model, where the levy – and the central funds – will be at a fixed rate regardless of the price of SAF.

Asked if the levy will be subject to regular review, Han points to the pricing model, noting: “[The] levy will be fixed in achieving this 1% [uplift] target, so we would… expect the levy to be fixed for [a] period of time. When [our uplift targets are] 3-5%… then the levy would have to be adjusted to achieve [the target].”",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/6/5/113765_singaporechangiairportandjewelaugust2024_923771.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 09:18:14.005944

But the 42nd ICAO Assembly, held in Montreal over two weeks and concluding in early October, saw ­sustainability take something of a back seat to ­security, safety and geopolitical issues.

That perhaps says much about the agreements that have already been reached within ICAO, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) for aviation to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

“For the last four assemblies, it’s really been ­focused on climate change and sustainability,” says Haldane Dodd, executive director of cross-aviation industry grouping the Air Transport Action Group.

“We had CORSIA agreed in 2016, we had the long-term goal agreed in 2022. Those have all been adopted,” he adds. “We want to make sure they don’t get watered down in an assembly like this or that we don’t see any sign from governments of pulling away from that.

“And we didn’t. In fact, we saw a lot of support for the work ICAO has been doing, both on the policy framework vision-side as well as the capacity building and assistance to states to make sure they were ready to face these big challenges.”

Notably, ICAO in its post-assembly communications on sustainable development highlighted ­“unprecedented unity”, noting that all member states supported environmental resolutions without any reservations for the first time.

Both Dodd and Asia-Pacific Airlines Association director general Subhas Menon flag the ­significance of China’s approach, given it has previously ­expressed reservations related to the LTAG and CORSIA resolutions.

“They agreed to discuss with ICAO states on ­implementing CORSIA as well as the long-term ­aspirational goal,” says Menon. “They have become very much more collaborative than they were in the past. So that was a very important development, with China being such a big market.”

Menon also took encouragement from the ICAO Assembly as a whole. “There was a reaffirmation of the long-term aspirational goal, recognition that production of SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] is still not enough, and that governments will have to come up with enabling policies, as well as ensuring that the other elements of the roadmap – like technology – should also be ramped up. And [there was] a recognition that supply chain problems are also a drag when it comes to environmental goals.

“We left in a good position because China joined the party and there was recognition of some of the problems we are facing as an industry.”

However, Aoife O’Leary, founder and chief ­executive of environmental NGO Opportunity Green – which has a focus on sectors where emissions are not yet coming down – was less impressed. “The lack of acknowledgement of climate reality I found really discordant,” she says. “It’s very ‘well we have CORSIA so we couldn’t possibly push it or do anything else’, meanwhile talking down any efforts coming from anywhere else.”

Unsurprisingly, given its importance to achieving net-zero and the challenges around ramping up production, SAF remains a key concern within the industry – particularly next generation SAF solutions. States had in November 2023 at ICAO’s third Alternative Aviation Fuels meeting agreed a framework targeting a 5% reduction in emissions from aviation by 2030, with this endorsed at the assembly.

However, IATA says that while it expects SAF ­production to double this year, that will still account for less than 1% of aviation fuel. “We’re disappointed at the progress that has been made in relation to the production of SAF. It’s not where we need it to be,” IATA director general Willie Walsh said ahead of the assembly.

“The demand exists, and I think the evidence for that is the number of airlines who have entered into agreements for the future purchase of SAF. But we need to see greater production.”

One fresh development was the launch of the Finvest ETAF portal on the eve of the assembly. This is an initiative between ICAO and the International Renewable Energy Agency aimed at accelerating production of SAF by helping connect project developers with potential financers.

“The message I had for the assembly… is the urgency of setting the right policy environment for us to do the scale-up in an expedited way,” Dodd says. “I’m not massively concerned about the 2030 timeframe. My concern is more for the 2030-2050 timeframe. That scale-up is going to have to be really steep in terms of SAF supply, so the next five years are really crucial to make sure you’ve got the right policies in place to set the trajectory for where we need to get to in 2050.”

MANDATES INTRODUCED

This year has seen the start of mandates in both the EU and the UK. This has begun with a 2% SAF requirement of total fuel this year, with the threshold levels in both schemes rising – and ­crucially including initial requirements around SAF that is not produced from hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), such as used cooking oil.

“This has led to a significant increase in fuel costs for airline operations in the EU and in the UK, but is not translated into a significant increase in the production of SAF,” complains Walsh.

IAG group sustainability officer Jonathon ­Counsell says: “We’re always very clear that ­mandates on their own will not deliver SAF investment. They ­create a demand signal, but you will not get ­investment on mandates alone. You do need ­complementary policy initiatives.”

South Korea in September announced the introduction of SAF requirements, which will make it mandatory for 1% of fuel on international flights to be SAF from 2027, rising to 3-5% in 2030. It is one of several countries in the region that have outlined SAF requirements. Menon though notes that such policies in Asia are “more about targets and governments coming up with the policies to provide the necessary SAF”.

INCENTIVE SCHEMES

Seoul’s SAF Blending Mandate Roadmap, for example, includes the creation of an industry-wide SAF Alliance to support development, as well as incentives and tax credits.

“We are seeing a lot more of that happening in the Asia-Pacific region,” says Menon.

CORSIA was one of the first major sustainability initiatives developed through ICAO, a global offsetting scheme agreed in the standoff when the EU pushed to include international aviation within its Emissions Trading System (ETS). When CORSIA was agreed, the EU limited the scope of aviation within its scheme to intra-European Economic Areas flights only.

Airline bodies have backed CORSIA as a means of avoiding a “patchwork” of regional schemes, but have flagged a lack of availability of CORSIA eligible emissions units (EEUs). IATA led the call for governments to issue letters of authorisation to help airlines access EEUs. IATA forecasts airlines will require between 146 and 236 million EEUs during CORSIA’s first phase from 2024-2026, but the current supply is limited to the 15.8 million credits made available by Guyana.

Environmental groups though criticise the ­effectiveness of CORSIA, which remains voluntary until 2027. Transport & Environment (T&E) and Carbon Market Watch issued analysis estimating that CORSIA will offset only 26% of EU aviation’s CO2 emissions by 2035 – because it is largely focused on aviation growth.

The effectiveness of CORSIA will come under renewed focus as the EU next year considers whether to extend the scope of aviation within its ETS to ­cover fights operating beyond Europe.

T&E and Carbon Market Watch argue that relying on CORSIA and not extending the EU ETS will cost Europe billions in lost revenues. Carbon Market Watch says its analysis shows a scope extension from 2027 could raise an extra €147 billion ($170 billion) by 2040.

ICAO says 130 states are now participating in ­CORSIA. However, that does not include key ­markets such as Brazil, China, India and Russia. And while there are more positive noises from China on ­CORSIA, there is unpredictability around the US ­approach under the Trump Administration.

Opportunity Green’s O’Leary questions whether the USA will actually implement CORSIA. “Under Trump I can’t imagine that scenario. For all the lobbying powers of airlines, I don’t think they are going to manage to get that through the US.” She says this adds to the reasons the EU should expand the scope of its ETS.

“Even though we have been talking about climate, which has been a public issue for at least 10 years, we haven’t done anything about aviation other than within Europe,” she says. “I’m hopeful that this time we might actually put international flights in the ETS. That is about a billion tonnes of CO2 a year, so a huge amount of emissions that you immediately start to regulate.”

Premium travel is also under the microscope after a group of countries, including Barbados, France and Kenya in 2023 established the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF). The task force has said it will conclude its work at November’s COP30 event in Belem, Brazil, with an announcement by its co-chairs on “options for implementing progressive international levies”.

US transportation secretary Sean Duffy, in a speech at the assembly, said that airspace was not something “to be monetised or leveraged as an economic cudgel”, adding that “new taxes and illegitimate user charges are not only at odds with ICAO principles” but would open up a domino effect of “disproportionate, unjust, or duplicative economic costs”.

These comments appear primarily directed at the GSLTF, opposition to which the USA outlined in a working paper submitted at the assembly – and which did not mention CORSIA.

Crucially, efforts to decarbonise aviation are set against political shifts in the net-zero debate, notably in the USA, whose Inflation Reduction Act policies have been lauded within the industry as a catalyst for sustainable aviation investment.

“There are some headwinds in this space and they are not just coming from governments,” says Dodd. “They are also coming from the traditional energy industry pulling back on their ­climate ­commitments. Some of the finance institutions have been pulling back on things they have been talking about on sustainability.

“We look at it from a fundamental perspective and that hasn’t changed. We know the science is telling us the climate is changing. We know as an industry we are going to continue to grow. So we need to have a response to that.”

ONGOING CONCERN

IAG’s Counsell adds: “The underlying problem doesn’t go away. This is not like a business fad. And I think it is very clear to us as a business that we will continue to address this problem. Politics is politics, it’s cyclical and we’ll ride through it. But you can’t deny the issue still needs to be resolved.”

While O’Leary is “pretty concerned” at the current political direction, she also believes these shifts are cyclical – pointing to it only being a few years since the Green Deal was the centrepiece of the European Commission legislative programme.

“For the climate, the science doesn’t change. So the longer we leave it, the worse it is. We are progressing – slowly, but surely. But we do need to speed it up,” she says. “I remain hopeful this is a phase and not a complete turn. But I guess that remains to be seen.”

How Oneworld-led initiative will fuel SAF advance

Moves led by Oneworld partners to establish an investment fund intended to kickstart development of next generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) signal that demand is there among airlines, executives say.

In September, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines announced they were cornerstone investors in the new fund, which is also supported by their Oneworld partners Cathay Pacific, IAG and Japan Airlines, plus Star Alliance member Singapore Airlines.

An initial $150 million allocation is being managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), a fund founded by Bill Gates and other business leaders to support less-pollutive energy technologies.

“[The initiative is about] making sure the next generations of technology are funded and available,” explains Oneworld director of sustainability and innovation Matt Ridley.

“This is an area Breakthrough has got 10 years’ experience of actually bringing technologies out of the university environment and then scaling them up,” he says. The airlines have already worked with BEV investments like propulsion developer ZeroAvia and SAF producer LanzaJet.

IAG group sustainability officer Jonathon Counsell points to the importance of tackling the longer-term supply of next-generation SAF, particularly given the feedstock limitations of first generation (1G) HEFA-based fuels.

“When we look out to 2050, industry targets are for around 70% SAF. It’s quite clear to us that only a relatively small proportion of that will come from 1G [SAF]. Therefore, you really do need to start catalysing development of 2G and 3G [SAF]. There’s no production of either of those anywhere today.”

Ridley adds: “I think it has already sent a message that airlines are serious about SAF, airlines are serious about backing the entrepreneurs and technologies that will bring this technology forwards. There are going to be others that join over the next few months… from Oneworld and from other areas.

“We’ve done the hard work putting the fund together, working on how it will work and what it will invest in. But this was never meant to be constrained to just Oneworld airlines – and I think Singapore Airlines joining really early on is testament to that.”",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/6/8/7/113687_a350airchinacairteamimages_555578.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 09:18:19.734814

Just as importantly, ministers drew a line: no burning food crops, only fuels from real wastes, residues or new electrofuels (e-SAFs).
The fuels industry says aviation could be the new home for UK-grown ethanol.
The UK has a real chance to lead in advanced aviation fuels, especially electrofuels made from renewable power and captured CO2.
With a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill out for consultation, now is the moment to hold the line.","For 20 years the UK government has talked itself in circles about aviation’s climate problem while emissions kept rising. When a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate was set last year, it looked like a breakthrough. From 2025, fuel suppliers must start blending in cleaner alternatives, with the share growing over time. Just as importantly, ministers drew a line: no burning food crops, only fuels from real wastes, residues or new electrofuels (e-SAFs).

This is one of the climate policies the UK can genuinely be proud of, so no wonder industry is already circling to tear it down. It aligned with public common sense: flying should be greener, but at the same time never compete with food on our plates. While protecting crops like wheat and oats from fuel tanks, it gave investors confidence that the UK was backing genuinely sustainable and advanced fuels. Brussels reached the same conclusion, banning food-based fuels – and promoting eSAFs – for exactly the same reasons.

And the kicker? It was working. In just six months, cleaner fuels hit 1.3 per cent of supply, in some months spiking to nearly 3 per cent. The 2 per cent goal for 2025 will be met without any weakening, just as car makers once claimed electric quotas were impossible, till they smashed through them under the ZEV mandate. The truth is clear: tough rules deliver.

But before the ink was even dry, parts of the aviation industry – led by the likes of British Airways and Boeing – joined forces with the oil lobby, including Shell pushing to weaken the rules by demanding inclusion of food-based biofuels. After 20 years of empty promises, the risk is clear: if the UK government bends now, real progress will be dumped in favour of greenwash in the skies. What stalls change isn’t technology; it is politicians caving in to special interests who are desperate to keep the era of fake fixes alive.

Loud voices in the aviation and fuels sector insist today’s safeguards are too rigid. They warn that sticking to genuine waste oils and residues risks bottlenecks and higher prices. They argue that letting British farmers grow crops for fuel on “marginal” land or as cover rotations would add flexibility, smooth volatility and “diversify feedstocks” until e‑fuels arrive in scale.

We’ve seen this story before. The last time governments fell for the biofuels pitch, food crops were poured into car fuel tanks and global prices skyrocketed. The World Bank and OECD highlighted the contribution of crop-based biofuels. The UN warned of food riots as millions were priced out of bread and cooking oil. Families paid the price once and the danger hasn’t gone away.

Saying, “but these would be British crops” is no defence. Markets don’t reward patriotic intentions. Even with a 19 per cent tariff, almost half the bioethanol burned on UK roads last year was imported from the US undercutting local producers. Now the UK‑US trade deal swings the door wide open to 1.4 billion litres of tariff‑free American ethanol, equal to all the road bioethanol the UK uses. The fuels industry says aviation could be the new home for UK-grown ethanol. But what’s stopping US agribusiness giants from taking over there too? Once crops are made eligible, you don’t control who floods the market. And that also risks imports from countries where biofuels drive deforestation.

This isn’t just an environmental risk – it’s an industrial one. The UK has a real chance to lead in advanced aviation fuels, especially electrofuels made from renewable power and captured CO2. Projects including those already planned in Teesside and Aberdeenshire, backed by tens of millions in government funding, could anchor hundreds of skilled jobs and boost energy security in an age of volatile geopolitics.

But all of that rests on one thing: policy certainty. Increasingly, net zero is being twisted into a weapon used by parts of industry not to drive ambition but to roll it back. The moment ministers water down the rules to make room for crop fuels, the signal to innovators is clear: don’t waste your time competing with the cheapest, dirtiest option.

This isn’t just about perception, it cuts straight to government credibility on new industries. Britain claims it wants to lead in clean technologies, pulling in global investment, creating green growth and future‑proof jobs.

If the UK blinks first and defaults to the cheapest option of burning food, it will send a simple message to investors: we’re not serious. A country that can’t defend its own cornerstone industrial policy – the SAF mandate – won’t lead the energy revolution; it will watch others seize the prize.

And while ministers preach leadership, they’re quietly signing off the biggest wave of airport expansion in decades: Gatwick’s second runway, Luton’s capacity boost, and Heathrow’s long‑debated third runway. By the 2040s, aviation is set to be the UK’s single biggest source of climate pollution. Expanding airports with one hand while weakening aviation policy with the other isn’t leadership; it’s sabotage dressed up as growth.

If ministers want Britain to lead aviation’s future, the choice couldn’t be clearer. With a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill out for consultation, now is the moment to hold the line. Why shy away from a new industrial revolution when this country has the talent and the technology to lead it? Ministers must resist pressure to dilute ambition by including outdated biofuels and instead back cutting‑ edge e‑SAF. If we want national pride, let’s earn it through being bold, energetic, and leading the way to a stronger, more prosperous future.",https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/11/10/adobestock_210884092_imresizer-800x418.jpg?1762771700,N,,2025-11-10 06:16:40.361633

The release of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) by the European Commission was noted as a momentous stride in acknowledging the imperative need to accelerate the decarbonisation of air transport. This formal recognition by a key regulatory body was deemed significant, as it addressed several enduring systemic weaknesses that had been observed within the European Union’s existing aviation sustainability framework. While the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expressed welcoming sentiments regarding this progression, a clear message was simultaneously conveyed: supplementary, robust action is still considered essential for the successful achievement of the industry’s net zero carbon emissions by 2050 goal.

It has been formally stated by Willie Walsh, the Director General of IATA, that the acknowledgement of market challenges stemming from initial design flaws in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates was appreciated. Specifically, the persistent and substantial price gap between sustainable and conventional jet fuels, coupled with the need for strong, tangible investment support, were highlighted as pivotal areas where the STIP demonstrated positive recognition. The proposed extension of SAF support under the EU ETS, the consideration of tradable SAF and Book-and-Claim mechanisms, the simplification of operator reporting procedures, and the planned improvement of access to sustainability certificates through the Union Database (UDB) were all identified as constructive developments. Furthermore, the advancement of dual conformance for SAF under both EU RED and CORSIA was regarded as a crucial step toward fostering global regulatory harmonisation. The goal of this harmonisation is to ensure that fuels certified under one system can be recognised under another, thereby streamlining international operations and reducing administrative burdens for aircraft operators. This focus on global alignment is considered vital, given the inherently international nature of air transport.

Catalyzing Supply: The Urgency of SAF Book-and-Claim Mechanisms

The European Commission‘s formal recognition regarding the considerable potential of mechanisms that facilitate tradable SAF certification, including various Book-and-Claim options, was a particularly encouraging development noted by IATA. These mechanisms are explicitly intended to directly address the critical supply barrier that currently constrains SAF availability across many European airports. The challenge is primarily geographical, as SAF production facilities are not uniformly distributed across the continent, leading to bottlenecks and inefficiencies in distribution. The implementation of such a system is acknowledged as a vital enabler for attracting necessary investments into SAF production facilities, as it decouples the physical delivery of the fuel from the environmental claim. Investors are granted greater certainty when a mechanism exists to monetize the environmental attributes regardless of where the physical fuel is uplifted.

Market Structure: Prioritising Demand-Side Considerations

A central tenet for the successful materialisation of the STIP involves the appropriate acknowledgement of the role played by aircraft operators as the ultimate end-users of SAF. Giving due and prominent consideration to their operational and economic issues is argued to be a top priority. Airlines are the commercial driver for SAF production, and their financial viability must be protected as they take on the considerable costs of the energy transition. For aircraft operators to effectively plan the seamless integration of SAF into their daily flight operations, a market characterized by predictability and clear price transparency is an absolute requirement. This stable market environment allows for long-term planning, hedging strategies, and secure procurement contracts, which are essential given the massive capital investment cycles and high operational costs within the aviation sector.

Fuel Diversity: Ensuring Technology-Neutral SAF Support

The issue of technological neutrality in SAF production support is considered a key factor in ensuring a diversified and scalable supply across Europe. While the STIP does acknowledge the role that biofuels can play, it has been observed that the document continues to unduly prioritize e-SAF, with the primary reasoning cited being perceived feedstock constraints. E-SAF, or electro-fuel, requires significant renewable electricity and captured carbon, representing a crucial long-term pathway, but the current production capacity is limited. This specific approach is viewed with concern by the industry, which argues for a broader perspective that capitalizes on all available, certified SAF technologies.

A recent report commissioned by IATA on feedstock availability has conclusively demonstrated that Europe possesses significant untapped potential for sustainable feedstocks. This available resource base includes substantial advanced residues and various waste streams that can be ethically and efficiently converted into high-quality biofuels. Therefore, a truly technology-neutral approach—one that actively supports both biofuels and e-SAF—is deemed absolutely essential. This dual focus is necessary to maximize the full potential of all available SAF pathways, as every variant will be required if the ambitious target of 500 Mt in 2050 is to be successfully reached. Biofuels, derived from waste fats, oils, and agricultural residues, offer a more immediate scalability solution that can bridge the gap until e-SAF production reaches maturity.

Path to Net Zero: A Call for Coherent and Timely Policy

The International Air Transport Association stands prepared to engage constructively with the European Commission to methodically address the identified policy gaps. The paramount objective of this collaboration is to ensure that the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is ultimately transformed into a coherent, fully investment-ready framework that can deliver the necessary market certainty and volume of SAF required. This is a crucial partnership, as regulatory certainty is the bedrock upon which billions in private investment will be committed.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Air-Travel-8.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 06:16:58.805888

The current levy applied is lower than previously projected.

For economy class, CAAS estimated in early 2024 that a S$3 levy applied to short-haul flights, a S$6 levy for medium-haul flights and S$16 for long-haul flights.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” the CAAS director-general, Han Kok Juan, told reporters, according to The Straits Times.

Adjustment period

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore.

The start date from April 2026 is to give consumers time to adjust.

Buying a ticket now for a trip planned for after Oct. 1, 2026 will not see the levy included.

Sustainable aviation fuel

Singapore is targeting sustainable aviation fuel to form 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026 and is set to go up to 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030.

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights, such as private jets and chartered services, departing Singapore.

The levy will be added on top of the S$65.20 fees that departing passengers pay when they start their trips at Changi Airport.

This fee applied during departure will increase from April 2027, reaching S$79.20 in April 2030, which is a 21 per cent increase.

Once operational in the second half of 2028, the facility will process up to 650,000 tonnes of renewable feedstocks annually to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO), and bio-naphtha. Feedstocks will include waste oils, animal fats, and residues from vegetable oil processing.

The project positions Malaysia as a key regional hub for advanced biofuel production at a time when Southeast Asia’s aviation and transport sectors are under growing pressure to decarbonize. The refinery will leverage PIC’s strategic location near major international shipping routes to distribute biofuels efficiently across Asia.

PETRONAS Executive Vice President and Downstream CEO Datuk Sazali Hamzah described the project as central to the company’s strategy of developing a “holistic bio-based value chain,” reinforcing PETRONAS’ ambition to become an integrated energy leader by the next decade.

For Enilive, the facility extends its global biofuel footprint, which already includes biorefineries in Italy and the U.S., and projects under development in Italy and South Korea. CEO Stefano Ballista said the new site would contribute toward Enilive’s target of over 5 million tonnes of bioproducts and 2 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2030.

Euglena’s President Mitsuru Izumo highlighted the venture as a milestone in the company’s broader efforts to commercialize algal biofuels and expand decarbonization solutions in the ASEAN region. He noted that the project’s evolution reflects the “rapidly changing energy landscape” and the shared goal of advancing a sustainable energy supply chain.

Located within the Pengerang Integrated Complex—Malaysia’s largest downstream oil and gas facility—the new biorefinery will benefit from established infrastructure, logistics, and feedstock supply networks. The investment underscores Malaysia’s broader push to attract green industry development while positioning Johor as a regional leader in clean fuels manufacturing.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” said the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan at a press conference.

The roll-out is timed to give airlines and travellers room to adapt, according to CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

“If you go out and buy a ticket today, the levy will not apply, even if you travel beyond October 1, 2026,” he said.

The fee will also not apply to transit passengers, training flights or humanitarian operations.

Those who fly in business or first class will incur a levy of $4 to fly to Bangkok, $11.20 to Tokyo, $25.60 to London, and $41.60 – the maximum amount – to New York.

Mr Han said the timing of the roll-out – for tickets sold from April 2026 for flights departing from October that year – is based on industry feedback, to give airlines and passengers time to adjust.

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore. It will also not be imposed on training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, CAAS said.

With the levy applying only to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, Mr Ng said: “If you go out and buy a ticket today, the levy will not apply, even if you travel beyond Oct 1, 2026.”

Levy won’t be raised, even if cost of fuel goes up

Singapore’s target is for sustainable aviation fuel to form 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026.

The goal is to raise this target to 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030, depending on global developments and the availability of the green jet fuel , which is mostly made from waste materials, such as used cooking oil.

It has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry, as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without costly modifications.

Mr Han said the levy amount will not change even if the price of sustainable aviation fuel goes up.

The amount will be relooked only when the current 1 per cent target is adjusted in future, he added.

The cost of sustainable aviation fuel is among the major barriers that have limited its widespread adoption. Such fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel.

Mr Ng said the volume of sustainable aviation fuel that Singapore buys will depend on the prevailing prices of such fuel. “We’ll buy what we can afford... (using) the levy we collect,” he added.

The levy amounts, said CAAS, were calculated based on the volume of fuel needed to meet Singapore’s 1 per cent target for 2026, and the projected price of the fuel.

Mr Han said on Nov 10 he is “very confident” that Singapore will be able to secure a supply of fuel to meet its 1 per cent target.

The levy will be applied on top of a total of $65.20 in fees that departing passengers who start their trips at Changi Airport already pay. This fee will go up in stages from April 2027, reaching $79.20 in April 2030 – a 21 per cent rise .

CAAS and airport operator Changi Airport Group said in November 2024 that the increase in fees is necessary to

fund infrastructural projects and offset rising costs

in areas such as energy and labour.

This means that when the levy kicks in, a passenger travelling to New York in economy or premium economy class will pay a total of $75.60 in charges in 2026 . A business or first class traveller on that flight will pay $106.80 in all.

Levy also applies to cargo shipments, chartered flights

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights – such as private jets and chartered services – departing Singapore.

The levy on cargo shipments is calculated on a per-kilogramme basis, and varies based on the distance travelled and according to the four geographical bands.

For general and business aviation flights, the levy is charged on a per-aircraft basis.

It will be determined by the aircraft’s wingspan, which serves as a proxy for aircraft size, CAAS said, and will be tiered according to the same four geographical bands.

The authority’s announcement on Nov 10 came nearly two weeks after it announced the

set-up of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company

(SAFCo), which will buy and manage a supply of sustainable aviation fuel for Singapore’s air hub.

The SAFCo will use the levy collected from passengers to buy the green jet fuel, which will be blended with traditional aviation fuel and used to refuel planes at Changi and Seletar airports.

Under Singapore’s sustainable air hub blueprint, launched in February 2024, the Republic will work with the aviation industry to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20 per cent from 2019 levels in 2030, and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0805a512a78effad6a9ab3af9b80db68f35f0f32bf19187d6f9525ca9d41391e,N,,2025-11-10 05:16:57.626581

The levy will apply to tickets sold from Apr 1, 2026, for flights departing from Singapore on or after Oct 1, 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement on Monday (Nov 10).

This means that if a ticket is bought before Apr 1 for a flight departing after Oct 1, the levy will not apply. Likewise, if a ticket is bought after Apr 1 for a flight before Oct 1, there will be no levy.

All destinations from Singapore will be grouped into four geographical bands:

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand

Band 4: the Americas.

Passengers travelling to Band 1 destinations will pay S$1 if travelling in an economy cabin, which includes economy class and premium economy, and S$4 for a premium cabin, which includes business class and first class.

Band 2 passengers will pay S$2.80 and S$11.20 for an economy cabin and a premium cabin, respectively.

Band 3 passengers will pay S$6.40 and S$25.60, and Band 4 passengers will pay S$10.40 and S$41.60 for an economy cabin and premium cabin respectively.

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore. For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

The announcement of the levy amounts comes after CAAS said last month that it had set up a new entity to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and secure a more affordable and stable supply for Singapore and the region.

Levies collected from passengers will go into a fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel.

The airline will collect the levy and must display it as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold, said CAAS on Monday.

LEVIES COULD BE REVISED AS SUSTAINABLE FUEL TARGET SHIFTS

CAAS had estimated last year that the levy would be around S$3, S$6 and S$16 for a passenger in economy class travelling to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.

The lower levy amounts announced on Monday reflect “the lower prevailing cost of sustainable aviation fuel compared to when the initial estimates were made”, said CAAS.

The levy amounts could be revised in future as Singapore’s sustainability fuel targets shift, said director-general of CAAS Han Kok Juan at a media conference on Monday.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

“When (the target) is 3 to 5 per cent, then the levy will have to be adjusted to achieve the 3 to 5 per cent,” said Mr Han.

“But insofar as we have set the target to 1 per cent (for 2026), the levy will be fixed regardless of the sale prices.”

He added that he expects the sustainable air fuel (SAF) levy to remain at the current level “for a few years”, before a review is done “some years down the road”.

When asked about the absolute volume of sustainable aviation fuel needed to hit the 1 per cent target, Mr Han said that the target will depend on the passenger volume for that period of time, and so an estimate cannot be provided now.

""The introduction of the SAF levy marks a major step forward in Singapore's effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,"" he said.

""It provides the mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub.""

LEVIES FOR CARGO SHIPMENTS, GENERAL AND BUSINESS AVIATION FLIGHTS

A levy for cargo shipments is being set on a per kg basis and varies based on the distance travelled, following the same geographical bands as for passenger flights.

For Band 1, the levy will be 1 cent per kg, for Band 2 it is 4 cents per kg, 9 cents per kg for Band 3 and 15 cents per kg for Band 4.

The aircraft operator will collect the levy and must display the levy as a distinct line item on the air cargo contract.

For general and business aviation flights, which are civil aviation flights that operate outside of commercial airline services such as corporate aircraft and private jets, the levies are broken down according to their geographical bands and the aircraft’s size.

For example, for small aircraft such as a Cessna 404 Titan, the operator has to pay between S$40 and S$390, depending on the geographical band.

For medium- to wide-body aircraft such as the A310-200 or the B767-300, the operator has to pay between S$380 and S$3,900.

For very large, long-haul wide-body planes like the A380 or B747-8, the levy will be between S$630 and S$6,500.

Training flights and those for charitable or humanitarian purposes will be exempt from the levy.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--IJ0szXXq--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-06-30t133925z_1_lynxmpel5t0nn_rtroptp_3_emirates-aviation.jpg?itok=ie7M5mPe",N,,2025-11-10 04:16:35.157333

For cargo, the levy ranges from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogramme.

First announced in 2024, the levy is part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint for how to reach net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.

At a media briefing on Monday, CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said: “As a global air hub and a council member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Singapore takes its environmental responsibilities seriously.

“We are taking firm, considered steps to play our part while maintaining the competitiveness of the Singapore air hub.”

The levy is higher for longer flights, as those consume more fuel. Destinations are categorised into four groups for simplicity and ease of administration, said CAAS.

For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be calculated based on the aircraft’s next immediate destination. Passengers transiting through Singapore will not face the levy.

For an economy or premium economy ticket, the levy ranges from S$1 for South-east Asia to S$10.40 for the Americas.

The levy for premium cabin travel – Business or First class – is four times that of economy class for the same area of travel. This is based on International Air Transport Association data for calculating carbon emissions of passengers in different cabins of travel, said CAAS.

These rates are lower than previous estimates by CAAS, as the price of sustainable aviation fuel has since decreased.

Airlines will collect the levy for passengers and aircraft operators will collect for cargo shipments. The levy must be displayed as a “distinct line item” in the air ticket or cargo contract, said CAAS.

Controlled cost

Besides commercial flights, the levy also applies to general and business aviation. General aviation refers to flights for private, non-commercial purposes including leisure; business aviation includes private jets or charters.

For these flights, the levy amount depends on the destination and size of the aircraft.

For example, a small aircraft like the Cessna 404 Titan flying to South-east Asia has to pay a levy of S$40, while a very large aircraft like the Airbus A380 flying to the Americas has to pay a levy of S$6,500.

Certain flights, such as training flights or those for humanitarian purposes, will not face the levy.

The levies collected will go into a fund for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel or related offsets, and to cover associated administrative costs.

Unlike green fuel mandates or incentives used elsewhere, the levy works on a “fixed cost envelope”. It has been calculated based on the price of sustainable aviation fuel needed to supply one per cent of total fuel use for flights departing from Singapore.

“For example, in 2026, if (sustainable aviation fuel) prices were to change, the levy that we’ve announced earlier will remain unchanged,” said Han.

“If the sustainable aviation fuel prices are higher than what we have estimated, what it means is that we will be achieving slightly less than the one per cent target,” he added – as less fuel can be purchased using the previously estimated levy collected.

“The fixed cost envelope approach is important because it allows us to manage the cost, and it allows us to provide certainty to aircraft operators as well as to passengers. They know how much they are paying when they buy a ticket.”

CAAS will not review the levy annually, but will do so in the future after deciding on updated sustainable aviation fuel targets, said Han.

Singapore’s one per cent target for sustainable aviation fuel will rise to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030, subject to global developments and wider adoption of the fuel, he noted.

Turkey declared its desire to host the COP31 climate talks in June 2023 and, until now, Australia has insisted it had “overwhelming” backing for its bid.","Australia and Turkey are locked in a Mexican stand-off over hosting next year’s United Nations climate change summit.

The Albanese government wants to stage COP31 in Adelaide, but Turkey’s entry as a candidate has put increasing pressure on the leaders’ segment of COP30, which starts this week in the Brazilian city of Belém, to settle on a host.

The Herald’s advice to the Albanese government: walk away now.

These climate change conferences theoretically have the serious and noble intent of saving the planet, but high-minded ideals have been swamped by a crass commercialism that exists simply to drum up investment. They have been turned into trade shows and public relations opportunities.

The COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 is a case in point. Meant to be a serious gathering of world leaders and their negotiators, it was as though hijacked by a grotesque mix of rent seekers, hangers-on and political wannabes.

The vast majority of the 30,000 attendees did not need to be there. And some who did attend displayed a remarkably tin ear for climate change, with some 400 choosing to arrive by private jet. Then Prince Charles, a longstanding campaigner for the environment, was one of them, flying in from Rome, with Buckingham Palace assuring the media that he flew on a private jet using sustainable aviation fuel.

Australia began campaigning to host the COP after the Albanese government won office. The bid has been seen as a mechanism to increase Australia’s impact on climate diplomacy and strengthen ties with Pacific neighbours threatened by climate change and courted by China. The conference also allows Labor to display its climate change credentials as the Coalition continues to bicker on the issue.

Meanwhile, The Australian Financial Review reported that hosting the COP would cost $1 billion, citing government sources, and cabinet is known to be divided on the potential benefits and costs.

Belém is the 30th conference under the UN framework convention on climate change since it was signed at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and will focus on the developing world over the next two weeks. Even if delegates manage to sort out the impasse between Australia and Turkey, it will probably be too late.

Previously, host nations have had a couple of years to organise and rally international support for the sort of outcomes they hope will flow from the conference.

Turkey declared its desire to host the COP31 climate talks in June 2023 and, until now, Australia has insisted it had “overwhelming” backing for its bid. But Canberra cannot secure hosting rights unless Turkey withdraws, and it is now being forced to recalibrate its pitch to stage the conference at five minutes to midnight.

Even if Turkey threw in the towel, the short run-up makes it difficult for Australia to adequately prepare. And without all our ducks in a row, there is potential for embarrassment.

Better to let Turkey have it. It is clearly no longer worth the cost or the effort.

Clariant will supply catalysts for feed purification and its highly active MegaMax™ for methanol synthesis

MUNICH, November 10, 2025 - Clariant, a sustainability-focused specialty chemical company, today announced its collaboration in Repsol’s pioneering methanol plant in El Morell near Tarragona, Spain. The Ecoplanta project will be the first of its kind in Europe to convert municipal waste into renewable methanol. The facility will operate using Enerkem’s advanced waste gasification process, supported by a range of Clariant’s syngas purification catalysts and its highly active MegaMax methanol synthesis catalysts. Scheduled for completion in 2029, the plant will use 400,000 tons of non-recyclable solid municipal waste annually to produce 240,000 tons of methanol.

Georg Anfang, Vice President Syngas and Fuels at Clariant Catalysts, commented, “We are proud to collaborate with Repsol and Enerkem in the prestigious Ecoplanta project to support Europe’s energy transition. Leveraging our decades of innovations in methanol synthesis catalysts, Clariant is uniquely positioned to drive the large-scale deployment of low-carbon methanol technologies that will play a decisive role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries.”

Michel Chornet, CEO of Enerkem, added, “We are excited to contribute to the Ecoplanta project and set an inspiring example for others on the path to decarbonization. Our technology not only enables large-scale production of low-carbon methanol and the reduction of waste in landfills but also avoids substantial greenhouse gas emissions. According to estimates, abatement will be equivalent to 3.4 million tons of CO2 in the first 10 years of operation.”

Founded in 2000, Enerkem is a global technology provider enabling the production of low-carbon fuels and chemicals from waste. Its solutions tackle the challenges of waste management and decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors, such as aviation, marine transportation, chemicals and off-grid energy.

Clariant’s catalytic technologies are perfectly suited to the Ecoplanta process. After gasification of municipal waste, the trap and guard catalysts will be used to efficiently remove all types of impurities, such as metals, halogens, and sulfur species. The purified syngas will then be converted to methanol using the MegaMax series catalysts. Due to its high activity, the catalyst can optimize methanol yield while significantly reducing operating costs. MegaMax also offers enhanced selectivity, which greatly reduces the formation of by-products and thus improves the sustainability and economics of bio-methanol production.

Renewable methanol offers a highly adaptable pathway to support decarbonization across a broad range of industries. It can be utilized as a drop-in fuel for maritime and road transportation and as a feedstock for chemical and sustainable aviation fuel production.

The company is guided by its recently launched Strategy 2030, marking a full year of an ambitious plan. CEO for Asia Pacific, Ken Lee, explains that the strategy focuses on harnessing key strengths such as a robust and resilient network, deep industry know-how, and a dedicated workforce. Simultaneously, it emphasizes proactive investments in infrastructure, digital transformation, and sustainability in order to capture opportunities in high-growth sectors.

Strategic Highlights

Strategy 2030 outlines five primary areas of growth: capitalizing on geographic advantages, targeting life sciences and healthcare, focusing on new energy, bolstering e-commerce, and enhancing digital sales. Additionally, it introduces a new “fourth bottom line” aimed at making DHL the preferred choice for green logistics, reflecting the company’s commitment to leading in low-carbon logistics.

DHL’s investments in infrastructure, including expanding air hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur as well as modernizing the Air Hong Kong fleet, aim to increase resilience, enhance capacity, and offer seamless connectivity across its global network. These tangible improvements are reinforced by innovations in digital technology, robotics, automation, and strategic partnerships to increase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage and develop carbon-neutral facilities. These efforts have led to DHL being recognized as the first-ever Sustainability Advocate of the Year at the 2024 Payload Asia Awards.

Resilience amidst Global Trade Dynamics

Global trade continues to be influenced by changing supply chain patterns, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty. However, DHL maintains a robust position as a logistics leader and trade enabler, underpinned by three core strengths: a complete portfolio spanning air, road, and ocean transportation; a presence in over 220 countries and territories; and a seasoned, committed workforce.

Lee acknowledges the uncertainty of the current trade environment but stresses DHL’s ability to navigate it, citing their agility and flexibility in adapting to shifting customer demands and trade regulations. This resilience bolsters DHL’s capacity to make bold, forward-looking infrastructure investments across the region.

Expanding Hubs and Modernizing Fleet

DHL’s role as a trade facilitator involves assisting customers in expanding internationally. This necessitates a network of hubs and gateways at critical airports, backed by service centers and state-of-the-art ground facilities. In recent years, DHL has consistently invested ahead of demand to accommodate rising shipment volumes.

Significant developments include the second expansion of the Central Asia Hub in Hong Kong in 2023 to meet growing shipment demand within and outside Asia. DHL also opened an expanded gateway in Kuala Lumpur and upgraded its South Asia Hub in Singapore. These improvements cater to expected growth from e-commerce and the region’s increasing importance as a global trading partner.

Additionally, DHL has modernized its fleet, upgrading the Air Hong Kong-operated fleet with 14 new A330 freighters and retiring the older A300-600 aircraft. Lee notes that companies are increasingly requiring their suppliers to diversify sourcing options to minimize operational risks, and this is where DHL’s expertise comes into play.

Operational Excellence and Customer Flexibility

DHL’s success is not solely defined by its physical infrastructure. The company is also deeply integrating advanced digital technologies into its operations to streamline workflows, enhance service quality, and create a safer, more efficient working environment.

In warehouses, AI-based tools and robotics platforms are reducing travel distances for staff and speeding up robot integration. Automated guided vehicles transport shipments and cargo pallets safely, improving productivity while relieving employees from strenuous tasks.

The introduction of On-Demand Delivery (ODD) offers customers the flexibility to reschedule contactless deliveries at their convenience. This not only optimizes operational and cost efficiencies but also enhances the overall customer experience.

Green Logistics and Decarbonization

DHL Express’ commitment to sustainability is evident in its recognition as the first-ever Sustainability Advocate of the Year at the 2024 Payload Asia Awards. With a clear target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, DHL is advancing initiatives such as fleet electrification, carbon-neutral building design, and scaling of SAF adoption.

However, the scaling of SAF does pose its challenges. Lee acknowledges that supply has not yet reached economies of scale, which is why DHL is investing in SAF and other areas that can significantly reduce GHG emissions. DHL is also aiming to electrify two-thirds of its pickup and delivery fleet by 2030, although progress in some markets is limited due to the lack of mature charging infrastructure.

Future Growth and Employee Contribution

Looking ahead, DHL is focusing on 20 markets worldwide that exhibit strong geographic and economic advantages, two-thirds of which are in Asia. These markets are expected to benefit from increasing domestic and foreign investment, reshoring, and nearshoring strategies.

Life sciences and healthcare logistics remain a top priority, with DHL expanding its Health Logistics division and strengthening its pharmaceutical capabilities. Growth in e-commerce, particularly in emerging markets, also shows no signs of slowing down. “With more SMEs turning to e-commerce to engage more customer segments, we continue to put resources into capturing these opportunities,” Lee says.

Lee emphasizes that DHL’s ability to execute these ambitious plans relies on its people. Hence, the company offers training programs to ensure staff alignment with DHL’s culture and equips them with tools for continuous improvement. Emphasizing the importance of employee contribution, Lee encourages team members to contribute ideas and solutions, thereby fostering a sense of ownership over initiatives.

Shaping the Future of Logistics

Beyond its network, DHL engages with partners, regulators, and governments to strengthen the logistics ecosystem. Lee underscores the importance of public forums, workshops, and seminars to identify sector challenges and encourage collaboration. Despite global uncertainties, Lee remains optimistic, attributing DHL’s competitive edge to the strength of its group and its presence in many markets worldwide.

Taking to the skies in its unmistakable white and orange aircraft, EasyJet is celebrating 30 years since its first ever flight from Luton Airport to Glasgow.

Since 1995, the budget airline has massively grown its business and brand – in part thanks to the TV documentary Airline.

""Few recent moments in travel have been more important than the explosion of mass travel, brought about by the rise of budget airlines like EasyJet,"" said Cathy Adams, travel news features editor of the Times and Sunday Times.

Former EasyJet pilot George Hibberd said although the company has ""done some good by making flying a lot more accessible for the average person, unfortunately that has come at a cost"" to the climate.

So what are the airline's big milestones, and where is it heading in the coming decades?

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou founded EasyJet after carrying out research in the USA.

""I learned if you really want to make money in this area, you should start a low cost airline,"" he said.

He came up with the name by ""scribbling on a napkin"".

""I tried Stel-Air, CheapJet, Lite Jet, then the word 'Easy' came up and I thought, 'This is it',"" he said.

Making Luton Airport its base was ""a risky selection"" that paid off.

""Luton was considered in the middle of nowhere back then - we chose the cheapest of the London airports,"" he said.

Sir Stelios recalls the ""cold and wet November morning"" when EasyJet's first flight took off from Luton to Glasgow at 07:00 GMT on 10 November 1995.

At the time, the company owned one aircraft and employed 77 people.

Now it is the UK's largest airline with 356 aircraft, more than 1200 routes, and employs 19,000 staff – including 3,847 in Luton.

'Easy and simple'

Its fame grew through stunts such as the time its founder and friends boarded a rival's plane wearing EasyJet orange boiler suits, and the ITV series Airline.

""Letting the cameras in to a small airline - it was a free audience. That put EasyJet into every home in Britain,"" Sir Stelios said.

Jane Boulton, one of the stars of Airline, joked that the TV documentary led to the ""misconception that a lot of people missed their flight"".

""But it took a year to film six episodes.

""For the most part, we were having a great time with passengers – not telling people they'd missed their flight.""

She recalled the phone sales lines lighting up after each episode.

""Stelios is a very clever man, he couldn't have had a better marketing strategy,"" she said.

Ms Boulton remembers the heady days of working as EasyJet's check-in supervisor at Luton Airport.

""From the time the aircraft landed and took off again, we only had 20 minutes to get everybody off, people and bags back on, and refuel if necessary.

""Safety was always the priority. The passengers didn't know, but behind the scenes it was a hive of activity.""

She said the brand lived up to its name, as ""everything was easy and simple"".

""We didn't have printed boarding cards, we had plastic ones that we reused. It was much quicker to check in and board people.""

Ms Boulton said many other airlines were more ""prim and proper"", but EasyJet ""made it more casual"".

""We wore denim jeans and bomber jackets. I think they were the first of their kind.""

'Reshaped travel'

Cathy Adams said the rise of low-cost airlines like EasyJet had ""reshaped our expectations around travel"".

""I grew up in the EasyJet and Ryanair generation, where it was entirely normal to hop on £2.99 return flights to an obscure capital on the continent.

""Before budget carriers arrived, air travel was an elite pursuit for the very few, but now for millions it's possible to travel multiple times a year.""

MP for Luton South Rachel Hopkins agreed that cheap flights had ""made the opportunity to travel a real possibility for hardworking local people in Luton – when you could get a flight for less than a pair of Levi 501 jeans!""

Hopkins said it was ""a huge moment"" when EasyJet chose Luton as their base.

""They have grown significantly, becoming a key local employer in our town and providing thousands of job and apprenticeship opportunities,"" she added.

'Wrong flight path'

For all those celebrating, others are concerned that mass aviation has added millions of tonnes of excess carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

George Hibberd, 32, left his job as an EasyJet pilot to co-found Safe Landing, a community of aviation workers concerned about climate change.

""Aviation has connected cultures all around the world, it's a true gift.

""I'm glad it's no longer a privilege to fly, but the majority of emissions are made by a small minority of very frequent fliers.

""The direction the industry is going is on the wrong flight path,"" he said.

EasyJet emitted eight million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2024 – more than the total emissions of Albania or Sierra Leone.

It has launched a plan to reach net zero by 2050, admitting its ""operations are negatively contributing to climate change"".

However, Mr Hibberd said it relied too heavily on unproven technologies, and that planned passenger growth would cancel out any success.

""They're getting more efficient, but if you plot it against the projected growth overall, [emissions are] going up and up.""

He added that EasyJet's net zero pathway graph was ""quite misleading"".

""That downward line looks like their total emissions, but it's actually the 'emissions intensity' which is per passenger.""

Captain David Morgan, EasyJet's chief operating officer and one of their pilots, said: ""It's widely known that aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, because of the energy you need to power a commercial aeroplane.

He said the airline, which runs almost 2,000 flights per day in the summer, hopes to continue growing.

Having opened a new base in Southend in 2025, it will open ones in Newcastle and Marrakech in 2026.

""We're always looking to what's next, what places are popular - such as North Africa and Iceland. Markets are emerging all the time.

""Our mission is to be Europe's most loved airline,"" he said.

Currently, air and sea transport is largely fossil-fueled and accounts for more than one-quarter of all EU transport emissions. The Commission estimates that around 20 million metric tons of alternative fuels such as biofuel will be required by 2035 to meet green targets in those two sectors, which will require an extra investment of around 100 billion euros ($115 billion). The latest proposals will provide an additional 3 billion euros' worth of funding.

""The package is about strengthening Europe's competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future,"" said Apostolos Tzitzikostas, commissioner for sustainable transport and tourism. It showed, he continued, ""the Commission's firm commitment to scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels in aviation and waterborne transport.

""Success will depend on close cooperation among member states, industry, financiers and civil society to turn this challenge into a strategic opportunity for Europe.""

The Euronews website reports that from 2035 onwards, EU airports should have 20 percent of their fuel supply coming from sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, which takes in products derived from things like used cooking oil or agricultural waste. Five percent needs to be another variant called eSAF, a type of synthetic fuel made from renewable electricity and others.

By the year 2050, the green share of aviation fuel should be 70 percent, of which half should be eSAF, but despite more than 40 projects of eSAF production being at various stages of planning, none is yet at a stage where a decision can be made about investment, and progress towards those targets is behind schedule.

The maritime sector is currently working towards a short-term target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 to 2025 by two percent, and by 2050, the figure is 80 percent.

Jim Corbett, the World Shipping Council's environmental director for Europe, said his group welcomed the investment, adding that it ""sets out a framework for financing to unlock investments and scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Now the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization"".

Sotiris Raptis, secretary-general of the European Community Shipowners' Associations, also responded positively, saying that the addition investment in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, or STIP, was ""putting investments in clean fuels at the center of the competitiveness agenda"", which could enable his group's decarbonizing ambitions to become reality.

""These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net-zero,"" he added.

FedEx (FDX): Valuation Through an Operations Lens After Moves in Sustainability and AI

FedEx has been busy. Early adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), upgrades to AI-driven operations, and a disciplined response to regulation are showing up in performance metrics and market sentiment.

The stock gained 9.2% in the past month and 14.9% over the last quarter. It's still down 4.4% year-to-date, but the three-year total shareholder return sits near 59.5%-clear payoff for patient holders despite short-term noise.

A widely followed view pegs fair value at $267.71 versus a recent close of $262.09-about 2.1% under. It's a tight gap, which says the market is watching execution more than headlines.

The Operating Levers Behind That Valuation

Structural cost-out: The DRIVE program targets $2.2B of savings in FY '25 and $4B versus the FY '23 baseline. That compounds into net margin gains if the cuts stick.

AI in the workflow: Smarter sortation, dispatch, ETA accuracy, and exception handling reduce rework and cost per stop. The bigger the network, the bigger the payoff from small accuracy improvements.

Sustainable aviation fuel: Early SAF adoption hedges against carbon costs and future rules. It also pressures competitors to catch up on fuel strategy and supplier contracts.

Regulatory posture: Proactive alignment with emissions and safety standards lowers surprise costs and keeps the network fluid under shifting rules.

What the Numbers Imply

Fair value marker: $267.71 vs. $262.09 suggests modest upside if cost savings flow through and volumes stabilize.

Margin setup: Structural reductions (not just headcount) are the difference between a one-off quarter and a durable reset. DRIVE points to the latter.

Sensitivity: Yields, fuel, and network utilization do most of the valuation work now. A slight miss on utilization can erase 2% quick.

Metrics Ops Leaders Should Track (and Act On)

On-time performance by lane and product (priority vs. economy).

Cost per stop and cost per piece (ground vs. air).

Sort productivity per labor hour and peak vs. off-peak variance.

Linehaul and aircraft utilization; empty miles and mix shift.

SAF blend percentage and per-gallon premium vs. conventional jet fuel.

Fuel surcharge lag and recovery rate.

Automation uptime (sorters, vision systems, robotics) and mean time to repair.

Exception rate, first-attempt delivery rate, and rework percentage.

Cycle time through major hubs and dwell time on trailers/containers.

Execution Risks (and Practical Mitigations)

Soft freight demand: Flex staffing, cross-training, and dynamic linehaul plans. Tie labor hours to real-time volume signals.

Key account churn: Quarterly ""red list"" reviews, executive coverage on top 20 contracts, and shared forecasting with customers.

AI model drift: Monitor feature drift, A/B guardrails, and rollback playbooks. Track ETA error bands, not just averages.

SAF supply and price volatility: Dual-source, long-dated contracts, and blend flexibility by lane.

Labor and safety: Ergonomics, near-miss tracking, and incentive structures that reward throughput without cutting corners.

Cyber and network resilience: Segment critical systems, run tabletop outages, and measure recovery time to SLA.

Operator Playbook: Convert Strategy Into P&L

Lock in DRIVE gains with standard work, checklists, and weekly variance reviews by site.

Put AI where it pays now: forecasting, dynamic routing, sortation sequencing, and exception prevention.

Clean the data: unique IDs, scan compliance, and event time-stamping. Bad scans cost more than slow conveyors.

Shift the air-ground mix with lane-level profitability, not averages. Kill sacred routes if they miss hurdle rates.

Stand up a control tower: one view of network health, with alerts tied to actions-not just dashboards.

Make SAF a sourcing program, not a press release. Blend targets, contracts, and unit economics in the same plan.

Why This Matters for Valuation

At a 2.1% discount to a widely cited fair value, the market is saying ""prove it."" The proof is operational: capture the $2.2B FY '25 savings, hold service levels, and keep capex disciplined.

If those hold while demand stabilizes, the spread can close. If freight stays soft or a major contract rolls off, the gap can widen fast.

What to Watch Next Quarter

Sequential change in cost per stop and sort productivity.

ETA accuracy and exception rate trend during peak windows.

Air-to-ground mix shift and utilization improvements in core lanes.

SAF blend percentage and any disclosed fuel cost deltas.
