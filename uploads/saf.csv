I. GLOBAL

Conference of the Parties 30th annual meeting (COP30) plan to further global investment in climate action

From November 10 to November 21, 2025, nearly 200 countries participated in the United Nation’s (UN) 30th annual climate meeting, COP30 held in Belém, Brazil. For the first time since its convening in 1995, the United States was absent from the COP. Leaders from each country in attendance agreed on a few notable climate action initiatives, such as the Mutirão Decision and the Gender Action Plan, as reflected in the final outcomes report. The Mutirão Decision addresses financing and investment in climate-based initiatives, including calling for the tripling of adaptation finance by 2030 compared to 2025 levels. Two key provisions of this decision are the Global Implementation Accelerator, which aims to help countries implement adaptation plans, and the Belém Mission to 1.5, which is a platform designed to “foster enhanced ambition and international cooperation across mitigation, adaptation, and investment.” The Mutirão Decision also addresses the role of trade in climate action by calling for a dialogue with the World Trade Organisation, United Nations Trade and Development, and International Trade Centre to consider the “opportunities, challenges and barriers in relation to enhancing international cooperation related to the role of trade.” The Gender Action Plan contains provisions meant to address the ways in which climate change, as the UN Women organization states, “is not gender neutral.” This document aims to serve as a tool for governments, policymakers, and private parties that provide climate finance and anticipates that these parties will consider the unique risks women and girls experience from climate change and advance “gender-responsive climate policies,” including in the following areas: capacity-building and knowledge sharing, participation and leadership, implementation, and monitoring and reporting. Notably, criticism of COP30 was that while discussed, no agreement on the transition away from fossil fuels or halting of deforestation was adopted in the final text.

Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co. (Glass Lewis) publish updated proxy voting guidelines

On November 25, 2025, ISS published its 2026 U.S. Benchmark Policy Changes, which are effective for meetings on or after February 1, 2026. ISS made several changes related to executive compensation, non-employee director compensation, capital structures, and environmental and social shareholder proposals, among others. In particular, ISS’s U.S. policy updates include a change in approach to shareholder proposals: rather than generally recommending votes “for” certain environmental and social shareholder proposals, ISS will now make recommendations on a case-by-case basis. This change applies to proposals requesting disclosure of climate change-related risks; greenhouse gas emissions; diversity policies, initiatives, or workforce data; supplier or human rights policies; and political contributions and trade association policies and activities. The 2026 updates also make certain changes to the factors that ISS will consider when determining its voting recommendations for these proposals. As rationale for these changes, ISS cited feedback from clients, declining shareholder support, the changing regulatory landscape, changes in company practices, and improvement in company disclosures in the past few years. ISS’s global approach to these proposals has been and continues to be to generally recommend votes on a case-by-case basis considering a variety of factors focusing on whether “implementation of the proposal is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value.”

Glass Lewis recently published its 2026 Benchmark Policy Guidelines (GL 2026 Guidelines). The GL 2026 Guidelines include updates regarding pay-for-performance methodology, mandatory arbitration provisions in governing documents, amendments to a company’s governing documents, and shareholder proposals. With regard to shareholder proposals specifically, the GL 2026 Guidelines removed language indicating that Glass Lewis may “in certain very limited circumstances” recommend votes against members of a company’s governance committee if Glass Lewis believes that the company has omitted a shareholder proposal via the Rule 14a-8 no-action request process in such a way that exclusion “is detrimental to shareholders.” Instead, the GL 2026 Guidelines refer to recent changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) changed approach to shareholder proposals and note that Glass Lewis is monitoring the “SEC’s ongoing changes and their ramifications” and may update its voting guidelines “prior to or during the 2026 proxy season should its approach to these matters change or regulatory developments warrant such an update,” while noting that the “basic premise” of Glass Lewis’s policy is that “shareholders should be afforded the opportunity to vote on matters of material importance.” The GL 2026 Guidelines also removed discussion related to oversight of environmental and social issues, including language that indicated Glass Lewis would recommend votes against members of the board, in favor of shareholder proposals, and/or against management proposals if companies “have not provided for explicit, board-level oversight of environmental and social matters and/or when a substantial environmental or social risk has been ignored or inadequately addressed.”

The GL 2026 Guidelines have retained Glass Lewis’s policy regarding board diversity, including a reference to its March 2025 “Supplemental Statement on Diversity Considerations at U.S. Companies.” As described in our March 2025 ESG Update, while Glass Lewis’s policy expects diversity on companies’ boards (generally expecting 30% gender diversity and at least one director from an underrepresented community) and disclosure of individual or aggregate demographic information for directors, when recommending votes against a director related to diversity, Glass Lewis will offer clients two recommendations: “one that applies [the] Benchmark Policy approach as articulated in [the] 2025 Benchmark Policy Guidelines for the US Market, and one that does not consider gender or underrepresented community diversity as part of the recommendation.” However, this approach may evolve in light of the Executive Order discussed below.

II. UNITED KINGDOM

The Transition Finance Council launches its second public consultation

On November 3, 2025, the Transition Finance Council published new drafts of (i) the Transition Finance Guidelines (Guidelines); and (ii) the Implementation Handbook. It also published a Consultation Question and Update and launched a corresponding second public consultation on the drafts. This follows a first consultation that closed last September, as a result of which the drafts were updated to revise the universal factors so they are more streamlined and better capable of assessment, map the guidelines to the Net Zero Investment Framework, and clarify the relationship between entity-level transition finance consistent with the Guidelines and green and sustainability-linked bonds and loans, amongst others. The consultation is open until January 30, 2026 and welcomes feedback from a range of stakeholders, including corporate entities and asset owners and managers.

The UK Government publishes amendments to the draft packaging waste regulations

On November 3, 2025, the UK Government published the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging and Packaging Waste) (Amendment) Regulations 2025 (Amended pEPR Regulations). The pEPR Regulations require businesses that supply packaging or packaged goods to cover the costs of managing household packaging waste and providing disposal information, intended to ensure that a portion of packaging is recycled and verified. The Amended pEPR Regulations will enable the appointment of a producer responsibility organisation (PRO) to take on key operational functions, allow producers to offset food-grade plastic packaging waste against their disposal cost obligations in certain circumstances, and aim to remove loopholes and improve clarity. Such amendments are due to come into force on January 1, 2026.

Other highlights:

On November 5, 2025, HM Treasury published its new financial inclusion strategy, setting out a national plan across six pillars to remove barriers to financial participation and build financial resilience. The strategy covers digital inclusion, access to banking, savings, insurance, and credit, tackling problem debt, and financial education, with review after two years. On November 28, 2025, the House of Commons Treasury Committee launched an inquiry into HM Treasury’s financial inclusion strategy and issued a call for evidence. Submissions are due by January 12, 2026.

On December 1, 2025, the Financial Conduct Authority published CP25/34 consulting on proposed regulation of ESG ratings providers, including requirements on transparency, governance and systems and controls, conflicts of interest, and stakeholder engagement. Responses are due by March 31, 2026, with final rules expected in the fourth quarter of 2026 and regulation applying from June 29, 2028.

On December 3, 2025, the Prudential Regulation Authority published PS25/25 confirming updates to its climate-related risks supervisory expectations, replacing SS3/19 with SS4/25. Changes include clarifying proportionality, recognizing litigation risk, clarifying the six-month review period, allowing integration into existing governance and risk registers, and a proportionate approach to climate scenario analysis.

III. EUROPE

Omnibus update: Omnibus trilogue in full swing as European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) revisions and reporting reliefs advance

Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD): After trilogue negotiations began on November 18, 2025, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU have now reached a political agreement on key elements of the Omnibus Simplification Package. The Council and the European Parliament have already confirmed the compromise. The final text still needs to be approved by the Council of the EU and will enter into force twenty days after its publication in the Official Journal. For further details please see our client alert.

Meanwhile, the European Commission’s “quick fix” Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1416 was published, providing transitional relief for Wave 1 companies. The regulation postpones certain ESRS disclosure requirements for the 2025 and 2026 financial years and extends phase-in provisions for complex topical standards such as biodiversity and social disclosures. This will allow Wave 1 companies to refrain from expanding their sustainability disclosures while the Omnibus Simplification Package is still under negotiations.

ESRS: On December 3, 2025, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) submitted its final technical advice on its draft of simplified ESRS to the European Commission, building on the Exposure Draft published on July 31, 2025 and the EFRAG Sustainability Reporting Board’s internal vote in late November 2025. The new ESRS aim to, among other things, simplify the materiality assessment, provide a stronger emphasis on usefulness of information, significantly reduce data points, and increase interoperability with the International Sustainability Standards Board. For further details, please see our latest client alert on this topic.

The European Commission indicated that it intends to review the draft and prepare its delegated act revising the original ESRS in the first half of 2026, with the applicability date of the new ESRS to be confirmed in the delegated act. The introductory wording in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1416 seems to suggest that the revised standards will only start to apply for the reporting period of financial year 2027.

EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) update: European Parliament adopts proposal to postpone and simplify the EUDR

Following a provisional political agreement between the Council of the EU and the European Parliament on December 4, 2025, the European Parliament adopted the agreed upon amendments on December 17, 2025, which include, among other things, the following:

All businesses will have one additional year to comply with the EUDR. Large operators and traders will be in scope starting December 30, 2026, and small operators starting June 30, 2027.

The EUDR’s due diligence requirements will be simplified, obliging only businesses who first introduce the relevant product into the EU market, and reducing obligations for micro and small primary operators which would now only have to submit a one-off simplified declaration.

Next, the text must be endorsed by the Council and published in the Official Journal of the EU. For the amendments to enter into force as intended, the final text must be published before the end of 2025. If not, the current EUDR deadlines will continue to apply.

In this context, a recent joint industry letter should also be noted, which expressed concerns about reopening or delaying the EUDR, emphasizing that many companies have already invested substantially in compliance preparation and warning that a postponement could undermine regulatory certainty and the EUDR’s environmental objectives.

Decision of Regional Court Berlin on climate neutral claims

In line with a recent decision from the German Federal Court of Justice, the Regional Court Berlin similarly held in a decision dated October 16, 2025 that a company’s climate neutral claims were misleading, as they were lacking disclosure of the extent of reductions and offsetting. Simply referring to offsetting measures was considered insufficient. Further, the court held that it is necessary that companies communicate about the scope, nature, and effect of their reduction measures. The ruling is not binding yet.

European Commission proposes new product categories and lighter disclosures under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)

On November 20, 2025, the European Commission released its proposal to amend the SFDR. The proposal aims to improve the identification and analysis of sustainability-focused investment products after a comprehensive review of the SFDR by the European Commission showed that, among other things, the current framework produces overly long and complex disclosures and increases the risks of greenwashing and mis-selling.

To address these issues, the proposal introduces three new categories for funds based on their sustainability or transition characteristics: Sustainable, Transition, or ESG Basic. The new categories are defined by the industries and activities a financial product must exclude from its portfolio and by its positive contribution, with at least 70% of the portfolio required to follow an ESG strategy aligned with the product’s category. Furthermore, the European Commission plans to reduce disclosure obligations for financial market participants, particularly streamlining product-level disclosures, by focusing on available, comparable, and meaningful data tied to the new fund categories.

Other highlights:

The EU Ombudsman has identified a series of shortcomings in the European Commission’s process to launch its “Omnibus” initiative, pointing to “maladministration” by the European Commission and criticizing, among other things, the lack of public consultation.

The European Parliament and the Council of the EU have reached a provisional agreement to introduce a new binding target in the European Climate Law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040.

Currently, 18 of the 30 EU Member and EEA States have transposed the “Stop-the-Clock” Directive into national law, including Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. An overview of the current transposition status of the CSRD into national laws and the “Stop-the-Clock” process under the Omnibus Simplification Package can be found here.

IV. NORTH AMERICA

U.S. officials and enforcers scrutinize proxy advisory firms’ influence over shareholder voting

On December 11, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Labor to take various actions “to end the outsized influence of proxy advisors that prioritize radical political agendas over investor returns.” The Executive Order specifically calls out ISS and Glass Lewis and alleges that that they “control more than 90 percent of the proxy advisor market.” While having no immediate impact on ISS and Glass Lewis, the Executive Order heightens the regulatory scrutiny of and pressure on proxy advisory firms’ practices and on the actions of their clients. For more information, see our client alert.

On November 12, 2025, media reports indicated that the Federal Trade Commission has opened a civil antitrust investigation into ISS and Glass Lewis, focusing on whether the firms’ practices constitute unfair methods of competition and how their recommendations impact shareholder votes, including on environmental and social shareholder proposals. The investigation reportedly examines the firms’ market position and competitive conduct in providing research, analysis, and voting advice to institutional investors.

On November 20, 2025, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a complaint against ISS and Glass Lewis, alleging violations of state consumer protection and antitrust laws. According to the filing, the two firms “constitut[e] up to 97 percent of the market for proxy voting advice,” giving them “an astronomical impact on the American economy and corporate culture.” The complaint asserts that ISS and Glass Lewis have “used this enormous influence to push their own dogmatic agenda” and “controversial ideological mandates” rather than prioritize shareholder value. The filing also alleges coordinated conduct between ISS and Glass Lewis, asserting that the firms “agreed to move in lockstep, preventing competition and ensuring that neither will face competitive pressure.” The Attorney General seeks injunctive relief, damages, civil penalties, and other relief.

SEC Commissioner signals continued focus on “materiality only” in sustainability reporting

On November 21, 2025, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda delivered remarks at the U.S.–Japan Symposium organized by Harvard Law School’s Program on International Financial Systems. He stressed that sustainability or ESG-related disclosures should be required only when they are “financially material,” stating that non-financial policy metrics such as environmental policy issues should be reserved for environmental regulators, not financial regulators. Commissioner Uyeda reiterated that under the current U.S. disclosure framework, issuers must report climate or sustainability information only if it materially affects their business, financial condition, or operating results. He cautioned that imposing broader ESG mandates on corporate disclosure or stewardship regimes risks turning disclosure obligations into instruments for advancing “policy aspirations” and that doing so could blur the line between investor-relevant information and broader regulatory or political goals. The Commissioner’s remarks are consistent with prior comments, including those summarized in our May 2025 update.

Federal agencies advance deregulatory actions across water, wildlife, offshore leasing, and clean energy programs

Various federal agencies have continued to advance deregulatory actions, including the following:

On November 17, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps proposed a rule that would limit federal authority over wetlands and streams under the Clean Water Act by redefining key terms that affect the definition of “waters of the United States.” The proposed rule is intended to “cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act.” If finalized, the rule could significantly reduce the number of wetlands and bodies of water subject to federal permitting. The proposal is open for public comment until January 5, 2026.

On November 19, 2025, the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced four proposed rules that would reduce Endangered Species Act protections by reinstating aspects of the regulatory framework as they existed in 2019 and 2020. As summarized in the DOI’s announcement, the proposed rules revise “procedures and criteria used for listing, reclassifying, and delisting species on the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and designating critical habitat,” reinstate prior definitions and processes related to interagency cooperation, eliminate the “blanket rule” in favor of species-specific protections for threatened species, and return to the 2020 approach to “consideration of the economic impact, the impact on national security, and any other relevant impact of designating any particular area as critical habitat.” The proposed rules are open for public comment until December 22, 2025.

On November 20, 2025, the DOI announced a proposal for a new offshore leasing program that would authorize as many as 34 lease sales across approximately 1.27 billion acres of federal waters in Alaska, the Gulf of America, and the Pacific coast. The DOI announcement stated that the plan aims to “open new opportunities for offshore investment and job creation, reinforce America’s role as a global energy leader, and help ensure a stable and secure energy supply well into the future.” The proposal is open for public comment until January 23, 2026.

On November 20, 2025, the Department of Energy announced an organizational realignment that eliminates the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and replaces them with a new entity called the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation. The realignment aims to reflect the “priorities of expanding American energy production, accelerating scientific and technological leadership, and ensuring the continued safety and readiness of the Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile.”

Other highlights:

On November 25, 2025, Senator Ted Cruz introduced the Stop TSP ESG Act to “prevent professional asset managers who manage federal employee retirement funds from using those taxpayer dollars to push Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies through corporate shareholder votes.” The announcement clarifies that the bill is concerned primarily with proxy voting by BlackRock Capital Advisers and State Street Global Advisors.

On November 27, 2025, the Canadian federal government and the province of Alberta signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to “strengthen energy collaboration and build a stronger, more competitive, and more sustainable economy.” The MOU suspends the planned federal oil and gas emissions cap and exempts Alberta from the federal Clean Electricity Regulations and instead commits Alberta to advancing the development of a bitumen pipeline, negotiating a new carbon pricing agreement, and supporting development of “the world’s largest” carbon capture and storage project.

On November 18, 2025, Canadian Minister of Finance and National Revenue François-Philippe Champagne introduced Bill C-15 to the Canadian House of Commons for first reading. Among other things, if enacted, the bill would amend the greenwashing provisions under the Competition Act by removing “the requirement that the substantiation of representations about the environmental benefits of businesses or business activities must be done in accordance with internationally recognized methodology.”

On November 18, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit enjoined California’s new climate-related risk reporting law pending an appeal by a coalition of leading business organizations challenging its constitutionality in the ongoing legal proceeding, and on December 1, 2025, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) responded to the injunction by posting an enforcement advisory stating it would not enforce the law “against covered entities for failing to post and submit reports by the January 1, 2026, statutory deadline.” For more details, see our blog post here.

On December 9, 2025, CARB published its first proposed regulations for California Senate Bills 261 (on climate-related risk reporting) and 253 (on greenhouse gas emissions reporting) and issued a Staff Report explaining their proposed approach. A 45-day comment period will open December 26, 2025 and end February 9, 2026. This will be followed by a public hearing on February 26, 2026 at 9 a.m. PT to consider approving the regulations.

On November 18, 2025, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance announced that it will not respond to most Rule 14a-8 no-action requests or express any views on companies’ intended reliance on any basis for excluding shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 for the 2025–2026 proxy season. For more details, see our client alert.

On December 3, 2025, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released a prepublication of its proposed new corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for light-duty vehicles for model years 2022 through 2031. The proposal also includes several significant revisions to the CAFE program. For more details, see our client alert.

V. APAC

Taiwan aligns sustainable bond framework with global standards

From November 24, 2025, Taiwan’s sustainable bond regime fully incorporates blue and biodiversity bonds under its green bond framework, aligning with the 2025 ICMA Green Bond Principles. Eligible categories include marine conservation, biodiversity protection, water resource conservation, waste recycling or reuse, development of renewable energy and energy technology, and other climate change adaptation projects or projects approved by the Taipei Exchange (TPEx), with several successful issuances already in the market. TPEx is actively encouraging issuers to explore these instruments as demand for nature-linked financing grows ahead of COP30 in Brazil.

Hong Kong issues record HKD 10 billion multi-currency digital green bonds with tokenized central bank money

On November 11, 2025, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government announced that it successfully priced its third batch of digital green bonds (HKD, RMB, USD, and EUR) under the Government Sustainable Bond Program, raising around HKD 10 billion (~USD $1.28 million), marking the world’s largest digital bond offering to date and the first digital bond offering that integrates tokenized central bank money (e‑HKD and e‑CNY) as a settlement option. The four tranches were priced on November 10 as follows: HKD2.5 billion (2-year, 2.5%), RMB2.5 billion (5-year, 1.9%), USD $300 million (3-year, 3.633%), and EUR300 million (4-year, 2.512%). The subscriptions across four currency tranches exceeded HKD130 billion from a broad base of global institutional investors. Proceeds will be used to finance or refinance projects under the HKSAR Government’s Green Bond Framework, reinforcing Hong Kong’s strategy to scale green and sustainable finance and position itself as a leading digital assets hub.

Key ESG initiatives unveiled at Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Capital Markets Forum

On November 6, 2025, the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), a high-level grouping of capital markets regulators from 11 ASEAN jurisdictions, introduced several key ESG-related initiatives, including an updated version of the ASEAN Simplified ESG Disclosure Guide for Small and Medium Enterprises, which has been refined to provide guidance to SMEs in preparing ESG disclosures, a roadmap for the development of interoperable, high-integrity carbon credit markets in the region, and an updated version of the ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, which serves as a reference point to guide capital and funding toward activities that help promote sustainability in the region.

Other highlights:

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore has announced a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy for passengers, cargo, and business aviation flights departing Singapore. The levy, which takes effect for tickets sold from April 1, 2026 and flights from October 1, 2026, will range from S$1 to S$41.60 per passenger and S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kg for cargo, with proceeds funding SAF purchases and related costs.

Allan Kilavuka has stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of Kenya Airways. The airline appointed Captain George Kamal, its current Chief Operating Officer, as interim CEO to lead a transition period that will culminate in the appointment of a permanent successor. Management said Kilavuka took end-of-term leave ahead of the official expiration of his contract.

Kilavuka joined the helm of the national carrier in 2019 and led the airline through one of the most difficult periods in its history. During his tenure, Kenya Airways confronted the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and implemented cost-cutting measures and strategic initiatives aimed at preserving operational viability. This restructuring phase coincided with growth in revenue, passenger traffic and cargo volumes.

In 2024, the airline, which had long struggled with heavy debt and relied on support from the Kenyan state, returned to profitability for the first time in more than a decade. The company said a 10% increase in capacity supported a 4% rise in traffic, bringing total passengers carried during the year to 5.23 million.

George Kamal, who brings more than 29 years of leadership experience in the aviation sector across the Middle East and Africa, now takes charge in an environment still shaped by structural challenges. A key priority remains the return to sustainable financial balance. Despite the recovery recorded in 2024, Kenya Airways posted a pre-tax loss of 12.17 billion Kenyan shillings, or about $94.5 million, in the first half of 2025.

Investment enables SAF production for more sustainable future flying, diversifies Hawaii’s fuels industry, strengthens energy independence, and supports agriculture

HONOLULU, Dec. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines today announced it has joined Par Hawaii to invest in pioneering the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Hawaiʻi using locally grown agriculture feedstock to reduce aviation carbon emissions.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawai’i, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawai’i, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific, through its Pono Energy, Inc. subsidiary, to study Camelina sativa (camelina) as a multi-purpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii’s launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaiʻi’s first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

“As Hawaiʻi’s airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy,” said Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. “Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaiʻi’s energy independence.”

“We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawai’i’s transportation needs,” said Ed Sniffen, director of the Hawai’i State Department of Transportation. “We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii, and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state’s clean energy goals.”

Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private resource company, will launch Pono Energy, Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens. This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawai’i by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

“Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawai’i to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels,” said Chris Bennett, Pono Pacific’s vice president of sustainable energy solutions.

“By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawai’i’s ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It’s a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture, and a win for the environment — an example of how Hawai’i can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions.”

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii’s earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaiʻi Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaiʻi’s year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy. Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawai’i’s cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026. Earlier this year, Par Pacific, parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawai’i Renewables, and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery’s processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

“In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn’t think we would be able to progress so quickly,” said Par Hawaii President Eric Wright. “With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it’s exciting to see the results of our team’s hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork.”

“We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,” added James. “This is an important milestone for our company and Hawai’i, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.”

Represented on a line graph, fossil fuels evoke the lower jaw of a crocodile’s open mouth sinking downward, with economic growth represented by the upper jaw rising. Said differently, it’s another way to think about decoupling economic growth from fossil fuel use and emissions.

The “Crocodile Economy” has already taken form in 49 countries, mostly concentrated in Europe and Oceania, the region represented by Australia and surrounding nations, according to a study published last year in the journal Nature. In new research out last week, the nonprofit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit estimates that countries representing 92 percent of the global economy have decoupled their emissions from economic growth in the 10 years since the Paris Climate Agreement.

Emerging economies will accelerate the pace of change by going directly to renewables as their energy needs grow, the business climate group Exponential Roadmap Initiative projects. “Emerging economies can skip carbon-intensive development altogether by leveraging today’s affordable clean technologies,” Katarina Wangler Björk, chief impact officer of Exponential Roadmap, and Owen Gaffney, co-founder of the climate-focused researcher coalition Future Earth Media Lab, wrote on the World Economic Forum.

“Even in the United States, energy-related CO2 emissions are ~20 percent lower than in 2005, while GDP has continued to rise,” Exponential Roadmap wrote in its October report, citing the U.S. government’s own data. Jonathan Watts of The Guardian added: “Donald Trump has tried to move the U.S. in the opposite direction, but his first term as president caused only a brief uptick in emissions. For most of the past two decades, U.S. emissions have been falling.”

Leading the pack in the U.S., the state of California demonstrates that decoupling emissions from growth is a matter of political will, not lack of technology. Due to the state’s longstanding pollution control efforts, California continues to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at rates faster than almost any other state while growing its economy.

“In California, we know that a healthy, clean climate and thriving economy aren’t zero-sum games. We can excel at both,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement this fall. The state cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent since 2000 while its economy grew 81 percent,, according to the governor’s office.

Most sustainability investors commit to stepping up the pace

Regardless of federal energy policy, the U.S. financial sector is “already behaving as if a fossil fuel phase-out is underway,” Ingmar Rentzhog, CEO and founder of the influential climate action organization We Don’t Have Time, wrote in Forbes over the weekend.

“Not through headlines or pledges, but through mandates, risk models, and capital allocation decisions that quietly reroute money away from assets with declining transition credibility,” Retzhog wrote, citing a new Morgan Stanley survey of sustainability-oriented institutional investors.

The survey included more than 900 investors that practice sustainable investing, or plan to do so. “Regionally, more than 90 percent of North American asset owners surveyed said they expect to increase the proportion of their assets in sustainable strategies in the next two years, slightly ahead of investors in Europe (82 percent) and APAC (85 percent),” Morgan Stanley found.

While the Morgan Stanley report did not distinguish between Canadian and U.S. investors, other surveys indicate a strong commitment to sustainability by U.S. investors and businesses in particular. Pitchbook’s Sixth Annual Sustainable Investment Survey published this fall, for example, showed strong interest in sustainable investment practices among U.S. fund managers, investment consultants and other financial professionals.

.“Among respondents, 72 percent say they currently incorporate ESG factors into their investment evaluation and management process,” Anikka Sophia Villegas, senior analyst of fund strategies and sustainable investing at PitchBook, wrote of the research for Morningstar. “Just 5 percent indicated that they used to, but no longer do.”

While those who responded to the survey remain engaged in sustainable investing, Pitchbook saw the number of survey responses drop sharply this year as business leaders are reluctant to articulate ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles in public. Skittishness over the “ESG” acronym predates this year. Companies began responding to a growing surge in anti-ESG backlash during the Joe Biden administration, a trend that has intensified in 2025.

Over the summer, EcoVadis published the results of a survey of 400 executives representing U.S. companies with more than $1 billion in revenue. While fewer companies are talking openly about ESG, 87 percent of executives told EcoVadis they maintained or increased their sustainability investments this year. “Technology remained a key focus area for investment, according to the survey, with 89 percent of respondents planning further ESG tech investments over the next 12 months,” reported Mark Segal, founder of the news organization ESG Today.

The inevitable rise of the Crocodile Economy

President Donald Trump declared an “energy emergency” upon taking office with the intention of supporting oil, gas and coal producers in the U.S. However, the new White House policy also explicitly supports several forms of renewable energy. The president tapped hydropower and biomass for support in his emergency declaration on Jan. 20, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright added geothermal energy in his first Secretarial Order issued in February.

In addition, the Energy Department has continued to support the development of new, long-duration energy storage systems and new marine energy devices that harvest electricity from the movement of waves, tides and currents.

While none of these renewables offer the present-day scalability demonstrated by wind turbines and solar panels, all of them have the potential to help accelerate the renewable transition in the near future. In particular, the geothermal industry is already deploying new drilling technologies to extend into new, previously untapped regions of the U.S.

The biomass sector also shows signs of scaling as activity in the domestic SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) industry ramps up. “Momentum is building fast,” the leading domestic SAF producer XCF Global noted in November. “Under the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030 — scaling to 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100 percent of domestic demand.”

That may seem somewhat optimistic, considering that SAF only accounted for about 1 percent of the global supply of jet fuel last year. Nevertheless, XCF Global is planning to expand its existing 40 million gallons-per-year SAF facility in Nevada to approximately 80 million gallons. The company has also partnered with the bio-waste gasification specialist Southern Energy Renewables and the carbon management firm DevvStream to evaluate the potential for an SAF facility in Louisiana to produce about 40 million gallons per year.

XCF is just one example among many as more U.S. states, cities and businesses follow California’s lead and join other nations around the world in decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions.",https://triplepundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cropped-3P-Icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-17 15:57:16.994860

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawai'i, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawai'i, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific, through its Pono Energy, Inc. subsidiary, to study Camelina sativa (camelina) as a multi-purpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii's launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaiʻi's first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Pono Pacific's crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

""As Hawaiʻi's airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy,"" said Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. ""Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaiʻi's energy independence.""

""We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawai'i's transportation needs,"" said Ed Sniffen, director of the Hawai'i State Department of Transportation. ""We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii, and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state's clean energy goals.""

Pono Pacific, the state's largest private resource company, will launch Pono Energy, Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens. This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawai'i by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry's carbon footprint.

""Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawai'i to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels,"" said Chris Bennett, Pono Pacific's vice president of sustainable energy solutions.

""By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawai'i's ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It's a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture, and a win for the environment — an example of how Hawai'i can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions.""

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii's earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaiʻi Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaiʻi's year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy. Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawai'i's cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026. Earlier this year, Par Pacific, parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawai'i Renewables, and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery's processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

""In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn't think we would be able to progress so quickly,"" said Par Hawaii President Eric Wright. ""With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it's exciting to see the results of our team's hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork.""

""We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,"" added James. ""This is an important milestone for our company and Hawai'i, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.""

Reaching the original climate targets by the previously communicated very ambitious target years would have required significant investments that are currently not realistic. Neste continues to drive growth in renewable fuels, providing alternatives to fossil fuels to mitigate climate change.

Neste sets a carbon footprint target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in its own operations (Scope 1 & 2) by 80% by 2040, replacing the target of reaching carbon neutral production by 2035.

The timeline for the related interim target of 50% emission reduction is extended from 2030 to 2035.

With these changes Neste focuses solely on absolute emission reductions in its own operations and removes the option of using emission compensation from its climate target setting.

Two of Neste’s climate targets remain unchanged: the carbon footprint target to reduce the use-phase emission intensity of sold products by 50% by 2040, and the carbon handprint target to help customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 Mt annually by 2030. The respective reference years 2019 and 2020 have not been changed.

“The company's original targets to reduce its carbon footprint were based on a plan to transform Neste’s Porvoo refinery into a renewable and circular solutions refining hub by 2035. Since we announced the delay of Porvoo refinery transformation earlier this year, we have conducted a careful assessment of our climate targets to ensure they are ambitious but realistic,” said Neste’s CEO Heikki Malinen.

In the short term, Neste’s climate footprint mitigation actions focus on energy efficiency and operational excellence measures as well as evaluating alternatives to fossil hydrogen.

“Neste continues to provide its customers and consumers alternatives to fossil fuels, and our continuing investment in the world’s largest renewable fuels refinery in Rotterdam underlines our commitment to this,” added Malinen.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Neste-revises-pic-Biofuel-17-12.png,N,,2025-12-17 13:57:16.023384

At the start of the year, we reported that minoritised ethnic groups, often living in urban centres or near major roads, face disproportionately high levels of harmful emissions of air pollutants.

Air quality researchers combined census data on socioeconomic deprivation and detailed information on population ethnicity at fine scales with air pollution emissions data in England. They identified that all 24 minoritised ethnic groups studied experienced higher than average air pollution emissions than socio-economically matched populations in the majority ‘White: English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British‘ ethnic group.

February – Identifying critical climate tipping points

In February, two teams set out to measure and model climate tippings points – where rapid and abrupt changes are irreversible on societal timescales.

Scientists are especially concerned about the rapid melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the collapse of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Both could lead to huge disruptions worldwide, such as drastic weather changes in Europe and rising sea levels globally.

The GAMB2LE project will build a pioneering automated and mobile polar observatory, which will focus on collecting continuous high-resolution data about the atmosphere-ice interface on the Greenland Ice Sheet.

The PROMOTE project will create a new generation of Earth System models to generate simulations of plausible tipping points, and provide recommendations for targeted observational networks. The models will be improved to better represent ice sheets and freshwater export from ice sheets into the ocean, as well as ocean eddies and mixing of water masses.

March – Understanding mountainous terrains to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts

Mountains have a big impact on local weather, regional weather patterns, and airflow in the lower and upper atmosphere.

In the spring, the NCAS-led part of the TEAMx programme set out to address the shortage of mountain weather data. Their focus over the year would be the Alps, a mountain range that stretches across 8 countries in Europe.

Joining an international team of 100+ fieldwork scientists, they began to develop and deploy bespoke research-grade instrumentation into the alpine environment – launching paired radiosondes, installing a new X-band weather radar on a mountain crest, and operating our research aircraft.

April – Integrating satellite and in-situ observations with model data

In April, we introduced VISION – a cutting-edge tool which is revolutionising atmospheric science by seamlessly integrating satellite and in-situ observations with model data, enabling researchers to create a digital twin of the FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s research aircraft, enhance model accuracy, and drive climate insights with unprecedented precision.

VISION will have real-world benefits both to the science produced by the FAAM Airborne Laboratory, but also to the carbon emissions and flight costs involved with collecting data.

May – UK’s first sustainable aviation fuel emissions “chase” experiment

In May, we investigated how pollutants from aircraft could be reduced by using sustainable aviation fuel.

Our FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s atmospheric research aircraft “chased” Cranfield University’s National Flying Laboratory Centre research aircraft to measure the emissions it produces during flight. With one trailing the other to sample its emissions, the scientists were able to compare the pollutants produced by sustainable aviation fuel and traditional jet fuel. This is a major step forward in understanding how different aviation fuels change the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

June – Weather and climate forecasting for renewable energy

This summer we highlighted how researchers are using weather and climate forecasting to help renewable energy in East Africa.

As East Africa transitions toward a low-carbon future, renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower are playing an increasingly critical role in national development strategies. These sources of energy are inherently weather-dependent, making power systems vulnerable to climate variability, low winds, increased cloud cover, and droughts.

A new collaborative research initiative, known as POWER-Kenya, is investigating how sub-seasonal weather forecasts (typically 2 to 4 weeks ahead) can inform Kenya’s strategy for a resilient renewable energy supply.

July – From clean air to a warming planet

In July, a new international study, co-authored by the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, found that recent monumental efforts to reduce air pollution in East Asia may have inadvertently contributed to a noticeable acceleration in global warming since 2010.

For decades, air pollution – particularly sulfate aerosols from burning fossil fuels – has helped cool the Earth’s surface by reflecting sunlight back into space. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated in 2021 that aerosols had a net cooling effect of about 0.4°C globally.

But, starting in the early 2010s, East Asia began implementing strict air quality policies that are vital for human health. China, where air pollution is responsible for approximately one million premature deaths each year, has led the change. These efforts have resulted in a dramatic 75% reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions over the past 15 years.

The relatively quick clean-up of air pollution in East Asia, although it reduces the cooling mask, is both necessary and long overdue to protect human health. And as aerosol levels stabilise, the pace of warming is expected to return to the longer-term trend driven by greenhouse gases.

August – Low emission hydrogen engines could cut air pollution from construction

In August, we reported on a promising innovation that could offer a practical and impactful route to reducing air pollution from the construction industry, and improving air quality in cities.

The hydrogen internal combustion engine, also known as H2ICE, can be used in heavy-duty and off-grid environments. Emissions of nitrogen oxides from a 4-cylinder 55kW spark ignition hydrogen engine using lean-burn combustion were found to be 40 – 500 times lower than those from state-of-the-art diesel engines.

H2ICE may be particularly beneficial for densely populated urban areas and major infrastructure sites where air quality effects are considered as part of planning approvals.

September – Forecasting monsoon rainfall in a changing climate

At the end of summer and prompted by the disastrous monsoon season in South Asia, we highlighted how researchers are using forecast-based attribution to provide insights into how climate change may have influenced rainfall patterns over Pakistan.

Three years ago, Pakistan experienced devastating floods caused by abnormally heavy monsoon rainfall from June to August. The 2022 disaster affected millions of people, left thousands homeless, and tragically claimed more than 1,500 lives. Over two million acres of crops were destroyed, and more than 700,000 livestock were lost, creating long-lasting humanitarian and economic impacts.

Months before the floods began, seasonal forecasts from several weather models had indicated a heightened risk of unusually heavy rainfall across Pakistan. This raised the possibility of using forecasts not just to predict events, but also to assess the impact of climate change on them.

The results of the forecast-based attribution were not straightforward, but they show that climate change is one piece of the puzzle.

October – Weather radar reveal patterns in UK insect populations

In the autumn, an insect monitoring study using weather radar data was in the spotlight. Traditionally used to track rainfall and storms, weather radar have been used to help researchers monitor the daily movements and long-term abundance of flying and floating insects.

Despite growing concern about insect declines due to climate change, land use, and light pollution, it’s been difficult to track large-scale trends – until now.

The team repurposed data from the UK’s network of weather surveillance radars. By measuring how radar signals bounce off airborne objects and using dual-polarisation technology to tell insects apart from raindrops, the scientists were able to estimate the number of insects flying between 500 and 700 metres above ground.

Their results show an average of 11.2 trillion insects in the air during daytime hours and just over 5 trillion at night during the main flying seasons. Insect abundance was higher in areas with woodlands, grasslands, and even urban areas – but dropped in intensively farmed regions and where artificial lighting was high. And while daytime insect numbers remain relatively stable or even increased in southern regions, the researchers found that nighttime-airborne insects have declined overall – especially in the far north.

November – Major drop in sulfur emissions from ships

In November, we confirmed that recent global regulations have significantly reduced sulfur emissions from ships, helping to improve air quality in coastal regions.

Using aircraft-based measurements for the first time, alongside ground-based instruments, the research team measured sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emitted by ships in the North-East Atlantic and European coastal waters.

The team found that the average sulfur content in ship fuel dropped nearly tenfold in open ocean areas following the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 regulation.

December – High levels of air pollution in homes

At the end of the year, we shared an important study that discovered harmful levels of indoor air pollution in homes, during one of the largest and most detailed indoor air quality investigations to take place in the UK – led by the INGENIOUS project team.

High concentrations of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, were found in some of the homes of 309 families participating in the long-term Born in Bradford health study – with recommended World Health Organisation guidelines exceeded on 41% of all monitored days. Families from deprived areas and ethnic minority backgrounds were found to be facing the highest levels of exposure.

Atmospheric Science in 2026

As 2025 comes to an end, we’re looking forward to 2026 and continuing our research to understand our atmosphere, how it is changing, and how it impacts our global environment, our health, and our prosperity.

While electrification and hydrogen-powered aircraft are long-term possibilities, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers an immediate and scalable solution that can be used in existing aircraft engines and airport infrastructure. However, SAF production is still limited, and the industry needs more, and increasingly sustainable, solutions to further decarbonise the aviation.

Fjord PtX addresses this challenge by producing eSAF through a locally integrated system that couples renewable energy, carbon capture and district heating. Located in Aalborg, the project builds on strong municipal partnerships to create a circular and integrated energy system. The CO₂ will be sourced from Nordværk’s waste-to-energy operations, turning local emissions into a valuable feedstock.

Aalborg Forsyning, Aalborg Municipality’s utility company, will provide both land and technical water, in turn receiving surplus heat from the plant, feeding directly into the district heating network. This level of sector coupling, linking waste, energy, heating and transport, is essential to making SAF production both sustainable and scalable.

By 2030, Fjord PtX will produce up to 90,000 tonnes of eSAF annually, enough to cover either approx. 15% of the projected European demand for eSAF or unlock Danish ambitions of fully renewable domestic aviation. The production will utilize up to 330,000 tonnes of CO2 annually and is expected to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90%, compared to fossil jet fuel. The project will support European and Danish climate ambitions, while also creating local jobs.

The score places ATR at the “management” level, indicating established governance, risk management, and performance tracking related to climate impacts.

CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, is widely regarded as a benchmark for corporate climate disclosure. Its annual assessments evaluate the quality and completeness of companies’ climate data, how organizations manage climate-related risks and opportunities, and whether decarbonization strategies are aligned with long-term global climate goals. A “B” score signals that a company has moved beyond basic disclosure and is implementing coordinated, organization-wide actions to reduce environmental impact.

Consistency in Climate Governance

Maintaining a CDP “B” score over multiple years is notable in an aviation sector facing increasing scrutiny over emissions, fuel use, and lifecycle impacts. ATR’s repeated performance suggests continuity in governance structures, internal accountability, and long-term planning rather than one-off improvements tied to a single reporting cycle.

The company’s approach centers on annual environmental disclosure to CDP, which enables year-over-year tracking of emissions performance and climate-related risks. This consistency supports comparability for investors, customers, and regulators seeking insight into how aircraft manufacturers are responding to tightening climate expectations.

SBTi-Validated Decarbonization Targets

A key driver behind ATR’s CDP performance is its decarbonization pathway, validated in 2023 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The pathway aligns with the Paris Agreement and reflects ATR’s stated ambition to contribute to net-zero aviation by 2050.

ATR’s targets include:

A 50.4% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from operations and energy use (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2030

A 30% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its in-service aircraft fleet (Scope 3, use of sold products) by 2030

Both targets use 2018 as the baseline year, placing emphasis on absolute reductions rather than intensity-only improvements.

Aircraft Efficiency and SAF Deployment

Beyond target setting, ATR continues to focus on improving aircraft efficiency, positioning its turboprop aircraft as among the lowest-emission options in the regional aviation market. Turboprops typically consume less fuel on short-haul routes compared to regional jets, making efficiency gains particularly relevant as airlines face rising fuel costs and carbon constraints.

The OEM is also supporting the deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which remains one of the primary near-term levers for reducing aviation emissions. While SAF availability and cost remain challenges globally, aircraft compatibility and manufacturer support are considered essential to scaling adoption.

Transparency as a Strategic Signal

In a statement accompanying the CDP score, the company emphasized the role of disclosure in driving accountability and progress. “By disclosing our environmental data annually to CDP, we reaffirm our commitment to transparency, accountability and continuous progress in limiting the environmental and climate-related impact of our activities,” the press release stated. It added that the score “highlights the strength and reliability of our strategy and reinforces our determination to support customers in transitioning toward lower-emission operations worldwide.”",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251216-135216-5ac-ATR%2072-500%20MSN%20703%20in%2040%20years%20of%20making%20a%20difference%20livery%20%20run-up%20point%20at%20Francazal%20airport.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 11:58:04.370970

Build back industrial decarbonisation funding, including hydrogen funding streams, and ensure timely delivery of public funds that minimise regional competition.","The UK has long been regarded as a climate leader and has achieved clear progress to back it up. It has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 percent since 1990 and was the first major economy to legislate for net zero and set legally binding carbon budgets.

Part of this attempt has been its leadership on hydrogen. Since releasing its low-carbon hydrogen strategy in 2021, the UK has taken meaningful steps to build out a hydrogen economy, including setting time-bound production targets, formulating a pragmatic low-carbon hydrogen standard (LCHS) for accounting emissions reductions, and establishing its Hydrogen Production Business Model. It has also created critical funding streams like the Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR) and Cluster Sequencing processes, which support the development of hydrogen projects within carbon capture and storage (CCS) networks.

With a Hydrogen Strategy update expected imminently, this is a timely opportunity to reflect on what the UK has got right and where there are opportunities for course correction to ensure hydrogen is deployed in the sectors that need the clean molecule most.

These questions were central to the CATF-E3G event held earlier this month in London, which examined how and where the UK should deploy clean hydrogen to best decarbonise its economy as part of a pragmatic decarbonisation portfolio. Below are some key takeaways from that discussion.

Hydrogen will play a critical but not extensive role in UK decarbonisation

While it is too early to define every end use, low-carbon hydrogen will be most critical for industry and long-distance transport. The clearest cases for hydrogen in the UK are in energy-intensive industries, such as chemicals and fuels production, that cannot decarbonise without a clean molecule, and which can also take advantage of shared industry cluster infrastructure. Hydrogen-derived fuels will be required for the UK’s aviation and maritime sectors, with demand expected to grow into the 2040s.

Electrification, however, should remain the default decarbonisation choice, with hydrogen reserved for applications that are genuinely hard-to-electrify or the only option available. The UK government, therefore, must consider how its hydrogen strategy is more closely integrated into broader industrial decarbonisation and electrification endeavours.

Some hydrogen transport and storage (T&S) may be needed at the national level, but the location, scale, and function of such infrastructure require further assessment. For example, long-distance hydrogen transport through the gas network is becoming increasingly unrealistic and lacks strategic purpose, and T&S will be more beneficial when deployed around critical demand centres.

Addressing misalignment across national hydrogen policy and funding is critical

Despite early leadership on low-carbon hydrogen, inconsistent policy frameworks and delayed implementation are now creating barriers to investment and deployment.

Funding frameworks across hydrogen-related schemes are misaligned in approach. Some allow developers to apply for funds from multiple schemes whereas others restrict support to just one pot. For example, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and Department for Transport (DfT) each have their own hydrogen-derived fuels schemes and a producer supported under the DESNZ scheme is not eligible for support under the DfT scheme.

Frameworks also apply regional competition inconsistently. The cluster sequencing and infrastructure allocations require regions to compete for funding, whereas HAR does not. The UK Government should instead plan decarbonisation strategically at the national level, prioritising infrastructure in the most critical locations. NESO’s Strategic Spatial Energy Plan due in 2027 should support this approach. This will mean making difficult but necessary decisions to ensure best value of public funds and enable projects to move from planning to operation.

Furthermore, hydrogen standards cross-government are not fully aligned. A clear standout is the DfT Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate, which does not align with DESNZ hydrogen rules as CCS-enabled hydrogen is currently ineligible as a feedstock for aviation fuels production limiting domestic feedstock production potential.

These policy inconsistences across government departments and quasi-government bodies like the National Energy System Operator (NESO) undermine business cases and delay investment decisions in first-of-a-kind hydrogen projects. And this is not just applicable to hydrogen, as cross-governmental policy coordination and support on industrial decarbonisation is also needed.

The planning and governance process would also benefit from broader stakeholder representation, particularly NGO perspectives and those of public interest. NGO perspectives would be particularly welcome under initiatives such as the Hydrogen Delivery Council, where viewpoints are limited to only government and industry, which may lead to unrealistic decisions/outcomes.

The UK has been a frontrunner on hydrogen, but it must follow through on commitments

The UK’s twin-track approach to electrolytic and CCS-enabled hydrogen production has enabled effective optionality for project developers, supported by dedicated funding streams for each pathway. However, the transition from planning to real-world progress has been slower than anticipated.

Electrolytic hydrogen production remains expensive, with costs significantly higher than early estimates. Early projects have faced high costs, and a clear pathway to economies of scale is needed to help bring costs down. Policy is also needed to tackle high energy prices faced by industry.

Delays to awarding HAR 2 projects have reduced investor confidence and slowed the speed of deployment, yet the existing policy framework does not reflect these realities. The private sector cannot price policy uncertainty on its own, and a widening “valley of death” that developers face now threatens the viability of the next wave of projects.

Without action, decarbonisation risks turning into deindustrialisation

Slow government support has already had consequences. The shutdown of the UK ammonia industry and the need for last-minute intervention to prevent Tata Steel’s exit from the domestic market illustrate how delays and uncertainty have real world consequences for energy-intensive industries. Whether these industries remain in the UK is closely linked to the pace and clarity of decarbonisation policy and availability of public support mechanisms, including hydrogen.

A path forward for the UK’s hydrogen strategy

To get hydrogen efforts back on track, the UK should:

Update its national hydrogen strategy to better reflect sectoral demand and interlink more clearly with industrial decarbonisation priorities.

Align and coordinate low-carbon hydrogen and fuels policy across Government bodies to ensure uniform and fair application.

Bring more holistic voices into decision-making processes for more pragmatic planning.

Build back industrial decarbonisation funding, including hydrogen funding streams, and ensure timely delivery of public funds that minimise regional competition.

Hydrogen can be an important part of the UK’s net zero transition, but only if deployed where it is most needed and underpinned by a coherent, predictable, and coordinated policy environment. The upcoming national strategy update offers a key opportunity for the UK to reaffirm its leadership and build a hydrogen sector that strengthens both climate ambition and industrial competitiveness.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/04065528/UK-AERIAL-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:56:48.154402

As the global fleet of AW149 and AW189 helicopters continues to expand, the CT7-2E1 remains a central component of GE’s commercial rotorcraft portfolio.","GE Aerospace announced on Tuesday that its CT7-2E1 turboshaft engine has accumulated more than 500,000 flight hours in service. This specific engine variant serves as the powerplant for Leonardo’s AW149 and AW189 helicopter fleets, which are currently utilized globally for offshore transport, passenger transit, and search-and-rescue operations.

The CT7-2E1 is a derivative of the established CT7/T700 engine family. While the broader engine family has logged a combined total of over 100 million flight hours across all military and commercial variants, the 2E1 is specifically optimized for the “super medium” helicopter class. The accumulated flight time indicates steady utilization of the Leonardo airframes in varied operating environments, ranging from maritime conditions to hot-and-high altitude zones.

According to the manufacturer, the CT7-2E1 architecture was designed to balance long-range performance with efficiency. While retaining the core design of the T700, this variant incorporates several modern upgrades intended to reduce weight and fuel burn. Key technical features include:

FADEC Integration: A Full Authority Digital Engine Control system for automated engine management.

Material Upgrades: Usage of advanced materials specifically within the turbine section to handle higher thermal loads.

Operational Efficiency: The design focuses on lowering maintenance costs and fuel consumption relative to peer engines in its weight class.

In addition to standard operations, the engine is qualified to operate on approved Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends.

The europe aircraft MRO market size was valued at USD 21.29 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach USD 22.34 billion in 2025 from USD 33.92 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.36% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033.

Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) is a critical backbone of the continent’s aviation ecosystem ensuring airworthiness operational continuity and regulatory compliance across commercial business and defense fleets. Unlike transactional service sectors aircraft MRO is governed by stringent oversight from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency which mandates recurring inspections component replacements and airframe checks based on flight hours and calendar intervals. According to Eurocontrol, European airlines operated a combined fleet exceeding 3,200 commercial aircraft in 2024, which is reflecting a 12% increase from pre‑pandemic levels and amplifying scheduled maintenance demand. Furthermore, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports that the average age of narrow‑body aircraft in Western Europe reached 11.4 years in 2024, elevating the need for structural inspections and system retrofits. The region hosts over 180 EASA Part 145 certified MRO facilities, with major hubs in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain, leveraging engineering expertise and OEM partnerships. Beyond commercial aviation, Europe’s defense sector maintains over 1,600 fixed‑wing military aircraft, as documented by the European Defence Agency (EDA), necessitating specialized depot‑level maintenance. This intricate interplay of regulatory rigor, fleet dynamics, and technological evolution defines the contemporary European aircraft MRO landscape, as it adapts to sustainability mandates and digital transformation.

MARKET DRIVERS

Aging Commercial Fleet Intensifies Structural and System Overhaul Requirements

The progressive aging of Europe’s commercial aircraft fleet has emerged as a primary driver of MRO demand due to mandatory airframe inspections component fatigue assessments and avionics modernization cycles, which is majorly driving the European aircraft MRO market growth. As per IATA (2024), the average age of narrow body aircraft operated by European carriers reached 11.4 years while wide body fleets averaged 13.7 years, which is signalling entry into high maintenance phases. Aircraft exceeding 10 years require comprehensive D checks every 6–10 years involving complete disassembly corrosion treatment and structural reinforcement. Lufthansa Technik reported conducting 42 heavy maintenance checks in 2023 alone on Airbus A320ceo and Boeing 737 Classic variants all exceeding 12 years of service. According to EASA, repetitive eddy current inspections on wing spars and fuselage lap joints are mandated after 30,000 flight cycles, a threshold increasingly met by legacy fleets. Replacement of obsolete components such as hydraulic actuators and analogue flight displays further compounds workload. As per Cirium (2024), 68% of European narrow bodies are projected to surpass the 12-year mark by 2027. This demographic pressure ensures sustained demand for deep maintenance regardless of short-term traffic fluctuations.

Regulatory Mandates for Avionics Modernization and Emissions Compliance Accelerate Retrofit Demand

European aviation authorities have enacted progressive regulatory frameworks compelling airlines to upgrade aircraft systems for safety communication and environmental performance, thereby fuelling MRO activity and the regional market expansion. According to the European Commission, all aircraft operating in EU airspace must be equipped with Performance Based Navigation and Controller Pilot Data Link Communication capabilities by 2026. This mandate has triggered a wave of avionics retrofits with over 1,400 European registered aircraft undergoing cockpit upgrades in 2023 as per Eurocontrol. Simultaneously the EU Emissions Trading System now fully integrates aviation requiring precise fuel monitoring and data reporting which necessitates installation of advanced fuel flow sensors and flight data recorders. Airbus estimates that 75% of its in service A320 fleet in Europe requires supplemental data acquisition units to comply. Additionally, noise abatement regulations around major airports such as Heathrow and Frankfurt enforce Stage IV noise compliance pushing operators to retrofit hush kits or replace engines. Rolls Royce reported servicing 210 Trent 700 engines in 2024 for noise and emissions enhancements under these rules. These overlapping regulatory imperatives transform MRO from reactive upkeep into a strategic compliance function.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Persistent Shortage of Certified Aviation Technicians Constrains Capacity Utilization

The Europe aircraft MRO market faces a critical workforce bottleneck due to an acute shortage of licensed aviation maintenance engineers which directly limits shop capacity and turnaround efficiency. According to EASA, over 12,000 new technician certifications are needed annually across the EU to meet current demand yet training institutions produce fewer than 8,000 qualified graduates each year. This gap has widened since 2022 as experienced personnel retired in record numbers with the German Aerospace Industries Association estimating that 35% of its maintenance workforce is over 55 years old. Airlines such as Air France and easyJet have reported MRO slot delays of up to 21 days in 2024 due to staffing shortages at third party facilities. The issue is exacerbated by uneven geographic distribution with Eastern European MRO centers lacking sufficient certified personnel despite available infrastructure. EASA’s strict certification requirements under Part 66 prohibit task delegation to non-licensed personnel for critical inspections further tightening bottlenecks. While virtual reality training and modular certification programs are emerging, the pipeline remains insufficient to support projected fleet growth. This human capital deficit represents a structural ceiling on MRO throughput regardless of capital investment.

Volatility in Aircraft on Ground Periods Disrupts Maintenance Scheduling and Resource Allocation

Unpredictable aircraft utilization patterns driven by operational disruptions and ad hoc route changes have significantly destabilized MRO planning across Europe, which is further impeding the regional market growth. According to the European Cockpit Association (2024), over 28% of short haul flights experienced last minute cancellations or aircraft swaps due to crew shortages and air traffic control constraints. Such volatility forces airlines to defer scheduled maintenance leading to compressed heavy check windows and cascading delays. Lufthansa Technik disclosed that 17% of its planned C checks in Q1 2024 were rescheduled due to unplanned aircraft grounding from technical faults or crew unavailability. This unpredictability complicates inventory management for rotable components and reduces workforce productivity as technicians shift between tasks. Moreover, MRO contracts increasingly include strict turnaround time penalties with non-compliance fees averaging €45,000 per delayed day as per Oliver Wyman industry benchmarks. Facilities operating at 90% capacity cannot absorb these shocks without overtime or subcontracting both of which inflate costs. Until airlines achieve stable flying schedules through improved crew planning and airspace modernization MRO providers will contend with inefficient resource deployment.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Expansion of Digital Twin and Predictive Maintenance Platforms Creates High Value Service Offerings

The integration of digital twin technology and data driven predictive maintenance is unlocking new revenue streams and operational efficiencies for European aircraft MRO market. By creating virtual replicas of aircraft systems fed by real time sensor data from engines APUs and landing gear MRO firms can forecast component failures before they occur. As per Airbus (2024), nearly 900 of its aircraft in European service now transmit live health data through the Skywise platform enabling predictive interventions. Lufthansa Technik’s AVIATAR system processed over 2.3 billion data points in 2024 to optimize component life and reduce unscheduled removals by 18%. This shift from fixed interval to condition-based maintenance extends asset life and minimizes aircraft on ground time. European regulators including EASA have endorsed these models by updating maintenance approval procedures to accept data driven deferrals. Furthermore, digital twins facilitate virtual troubleshooting allowing engineers to simulate repairs before physical work begins cutting workshop time by up to 30% as demonstrated in trials by Satair. Airlines such as Finnair have signed multi-year digital MRO contracts valuing data analytics on par with traditional labor. This transformation positions MRO providers as integrated data partners rather than reactive service vendors.

Growth in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Compatibility Testing Drives Specialized Engine MRO Demand

The accelerating adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel across Europe is generating novel MRO requirements centred on engine compatibility certification and material degradation analysis, which is another promising opportunity for the European aircraft MRO market. The European Commission mandates that 6% of all aviation fuel supplied in the EU must be sustainable by 2030 under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative. Airlines are blending up to 50% SAF in current operations. However, prolonged exposure to certain bio derived fuel components can accelerate seal wear and deposit formation in high pressure turbine sections. Rolls Royce has conducted over 200 engine teardowns since 2022 specifically to assess SAF induced wear with findings integrated into revised maintenance protocols. In 2024 Safran and Air France launched a joint program to monitor CFM56 engines on SAF rich routes with enhanced borescope inspections every 500 flight hours. EASA has issued new service bulletins requiring fuel system material verification for aircraft operating above 30% SAF blends. This regulatory and operational shift compels MRO providers to develop specialized inspection checklists trained personnel and material compatibility databases. As SAF usage expands from niche demonstrations to mainstream operations these tailored engine MRO services will become standard across European maintenance networks.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Fragmented Regulatory Oversight Across Non-EU European States Complicates Cross Border MRO Certification

The absence of harmonized aviation maintenance regulations in non-EU European countries creates significant compliance complexity for pan regional MRO providers, which is a major challenge to the European market growth. While EASA Part 145 certification is recognized across the European Union nations such as Serbia Ukraine and Moldova maintain independent airworthiness authorities with divergent approval processes. According to the European Business Aviation Association, operators in the Western Balkans face an average of 45 additional days to validate MRO work performed in EU facilities due to bilateral agreement delays. This fragmentation forces MRO companies to maintain duplicate documentation systems and pursue country specific approvals inflating administrative costs by an estimated 12% as reported by the European Regions Airline Association. Moreover, components repaired in an EASA certified shop may require re inspection before installation on aircraft registered in non-aligned states disrupting just in time logistics. During the 2024 Balkan airspace recovery following regional disruptions several carriers reported aircraft grounded for over 3 weeks awaiting paperwork validation. Until the European Common Aviation Area fully integrates oversight standards this jurisdictional patchwork will impede seamless MRO service delivery across the continent.

Rising Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Connected MRO Ecosystems Threaten Operational Integrity

The digitalization of aircraft maintenance systems has introduced significant cybersecurity risks that threaten data integrity workshop safety and regulatory compliance across Europe, which is further challenging the aircraft MRO market growth in Europe. Modern MRO operations rely on interconnected platforms for technical logbooks component tracking and remote diagnostics yet 63% of European MRO providers reported at least one cyber incident in 2024 according to ENISA. Attack vectors include compromised electronic flight bags falsified service records and malware injected through third party software updates. In one 2023 case a major European MRO facility had to suspend all work for 72 hours after ransomware encrypted its component traceability database delaying over 30 aircraft releases. EASA has since issued cybersecurity guidelines for maintenance organizations but implementation remains voluntary and uneven. The integration of OEM proprietary systems such as Boeing’s AnalytX and Airbus’s Airspace further fragments security protocols. Without standardized encryption access controls and incident response frameworks the industry remains exposed to disruptions that could cascade through the aviation supply chain. This emerging threat dimension necessitates dedicated cyber resilience investments beyond traditional workshop safety paradigms.

Aviation accounts for around 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions. In addition to CO₂, flying generates other emissions that can contribute to global warming, especially at high altitudes.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an alternative to fossil kerosene that potentially helps reduce the industry’s reliance on fossil fuels. Produced from non-fossil resources, such as used cooking oil, SAF has a significantly lower carbon impact than fossil-based kerosene when assessed over its entire life cycle.

During combustion, SAF emits similar CO₂ levels as fossil jet fuel. However, while fossil fuels add to the overall level of CO₂ in the atmosphere by releasing carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years, SAF recycles CO₂ that was absorbed during the growth of the biomass used in its feedstock.

Although SAF is a positive step forward, its use in aviation remains limited due to high costs and low availability. As a result, its current impact on the aviation sector’s carbon footprint is still modest. That is why scaling up the use and production of SAF is a shared goal for everyone working to reduce aviation’s dependency on fossil fuels.

Contribute to SAF while booking your flights

When booking your next flight on our website or through the app, you have the possibility to contribute to SAF. The contribution amount is €3–15 per passenger per direction. It's predefined and based on the travel class and the length of the Finnair-operated flights in your booking.

Finnair only purchases SAF made from raw materials that do not compete with food production or harm biodiversity. All the SAF we use meets the strict sustainability criteria set by the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED) or CORSIA. For example, biofuels that comply with EU regulations must reduce CO₂ emissions by at least 65%.

While each individual contribution has a modest impact, we believe that every step matters in advancing the use and production of SAF.

Finnair for Business and Finnair Cargo customers can also participate:

Follow the progress

We are committed to increasing our SAF usage. The share of SAF in our fuel mix will grow through both regulatory mandates and voluntary actions.

Until 2024, our SAF usage was primarily voluntary. As of 2025,

5%. This includes the mandated SAF, contributions from individual customers and voluntary SAF purchases funded by Finnair and our corporate partners. As we fuel our aircraft also outside the EU, the percentage reflects the share of SAF in relation to our global fuel consumption.

Since November 2024, customers have been able to contribute to SAF purchases when booking their flights online. A year later, at the end of October 2025, the total number of contributions was around 70,600. One contribution includes the SAF purchase for a one-way flight.

We invest our customers’ contributions in SAF twice a year and report on the progress in the same time frame. As the service was launched in November 2024, our first reporting period covers contributions from the start of the service until the end of June 2025.

These contributions enabled us to purchase 122 tonnes of SAF, replacing fossil fuel equivalent to the amount needed for approximately 40 flights between Helsinki and Rovaniemi. The fuel was delivered to our home hub, Helsinki Airport, between 17 and 23 September 2025.

Finnair for Business and Cargo customers can contribute to SAF purchases through separate services. Their contributions are not included in the above purchase.

SAF funded by public authorities

Finnair applies for allowances to cover part of the price difference between fossil kerosene and the eligible sustainable aviation fuels. The allowances are issued by The Finnish Trasport and Communication Agency (Traficom).

In September 2025, Finnair was issued around 6,000 allowances of its usage of sustainable aviation fuels according to the Emissions Trading Act and the Emissions Trading Directive. The allowances were based on the SAF usage in 2024, when we used a total of 4,685 metric tonnes (MT) of SAF.

Egypt’s new $200 million agreement with Qatar to convert used cooking oil into aviation fuel signals a surprising shift from fossil fuel dependency to circular economy innovation in a region historically dominated by petroleum politics.

The Unexpected Alliance

The partnership between Egypt and Qatar represents more than a simple business transaction—it marks a notable diplomatic and economic realignment in the Middle East. Following years of regional tensions and the 2017-2021 diplomatic crisis that saw Qatar isolated by several Arab states including Egypt, this deal demonstrates how environmental innovation can serve as a bridge for renewed cooperation. The agreement positions both nations at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in a region where oil has traditionally been extracted from the ground, not recycled from restaurant fryers.

A New Recipe for Energy Security

The $200 million investment taps into an underutilized resource stream that could revolutionize how Middle Eastern nations approach energy production. Egypt, with its population of over 100 million and thriving food service industry, generates substantial quantities of used cooking oil that typically ends up as waste or, worse, illegally recycled back into the food chain. By transforming this waste into aviation fuel, Egypt addresses multiple challenges simultaneously: reducing environmental pollution, creating new revenue streams, and decreasing dependence on traditional petroleum imports for its growing aviation sector.

Qatar’s involvement is equally strategic. As the nation prepares to maintain its position as a global aviation hub post-World Cup, securing sustainable fuel sources aligns with both its environmental commitments and its ambition to remain competitive in an increasingly climate-conscious aviation industry. The partnership could produce up to 200,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel annually, potentially reducing carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Beyond the Environmental Benefits

This deal reflects a broader transformation in Middle Eastern economic thinking. For decades, the region’s wealth and geopolitical influence stemmed from vast underground petroleum reserves. Now, nations are discovering value in what sits above ground—even in their garbage. The cooking oil-to-fuel model could be replicated across the region, where similar waste streams exist in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other populous nations with large food service sectors.

The initiative also addresses youth employment, a critical challenge across the Arab world. Creating collection networks for used cooking oil, establishing processing facilities, and developing the technical expertise for SAF production could generate thousands of jobs in an entirely new green economy sector. This represents a departure from the traditional petroleum industry’s capital-intensive but employment-light model.

Challenges on the Horizon

However, significant obstacles remain. Establishing efficient collection systems for used cooking oil across Egypt’s diverse geography—from Cairo’s dense urban restaurants to rural food establishments along the Nile—will require substantial infrastructure investment and behavioral change. The technology for converting cooking oil to aviation fuel, while proven, remains costly compared to conventional fuel production. Success will depend on continued government support, international carbon pricing mechanisms that favor sustainable fuels, and the aviation industry’s willingness to pay premium prices for greener alternatives.

As Egypt and Qatar embark on this innovative partnership, they raise a compelling question for the entire region: Can the Middle East transform from being the world’s gas station to becoming its recycling pioneer, finding new prosperity not in extracting resources but in reimagining waste?",https://middleeast24.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cropped-8dfa8ba6-6f57-4664-a56d-e20e0fac3ed3-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-12-17 04:57:16.245454

Egypt’s new partnership with Qatar to transform used cooking oil into aviation fuel represents a bold pivot from petro-dependence to circular economy innovation in a region historically defined by fossil fuel wealth.

The Middle East’s Unlikely Green Revolution

The $200 million agreement between Egypt and Qatar marks a significant departure from traditional energy partnerships in the Middle East. While the region has long been synonymous with oil production and export, this deal signals a growing recognition that the future of energy—even in petroleum-rich nations—may lie in unexpected places. The project aims to establish facilities that will collect and process used cooking oil from restaurants, hotels, and food processing plants, converting what was once considered waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This initiative comes at a crucial time for Egypt, which faces mounting economic pressures and energy security concerns. With a population exceeding 100 million and growing aviation sector demands, the country has been actively seeking ways to reduce its dependence on imported fuel while meeting international commitments to reduce carbon emissions. The partnership with Qatar, a nation with substantial expertise in energy infrastructure and deep pockets for investment, provides both the technical know-how and financial backing necessary to make this ambitious project viable.

Beyond Environmental Benefits: Economic and Geopolitical Implications

The ramifications of this deal extend far beyond environmental considerations. For Egypt, the project represents an opportunity to create a new value chain that could generate thousands of jobs in collection, processing, and distribution networks. Urban centers like Cairo and Alexandria, which produce millions of gallons of used cooking oil annually, could see the emergence of entirely new economic ecosystems built around waste collection and processing.

From a geopolitical perspective, the partnership demonstrates Qatar’s strategic pivot toward sustainable investments following years of diplomatic isolation and economic diversification efforts. By investing in green energy projects across the region, Qatar is positioning itself as a leader in the Middle East’s energy transition, potentially softening its image and building new alliances beyond traditional fossil fuel partnerships.

The Aviation Industry’s Desperate Search for Solutions

The global aviation industry faces immense pressure to decarbonize, with international agreements mandating significant emissions reductions by 2050. Sustainable aviation fuel represents one of the few viable pathways to achieving these targets without completely revolutionizing aircraft technology. However, current SAF production meets less than 0.1% of global jet fuel demand, making projects like the Egypt-Qatar initiative critical for scaling up production capacity.

The choice of used cooking oil as a feedstock is particularly strategic. Unlike other biofuel sources that compete with food production or require dedicated agricultural land, used cooking oil represents a true waste product that would otherwise contribute to environmental pollution. In a region where food security remains a critical concern, this approach avoids the ethical dilemmas associated with first-generation biofuels.

Challenges and Skepticism

Despite the promise, significant challenges remain. Establishing efficient collection networks for used cooking oil in a region with varying levels of infrastructure development will require substantial coordination and investment. Questions also arise about the scalability of the technology and whether the $200 million investment will yield sufficient fuel quantities to make a meaningful impact on Egypt’s aviation fuel needs.

Moreover, the project must navigate complex regulatory frameworks and ensure that the produced fuel meets stringent international aviation standards. The success of this initiative could set a precedent for similar projects across the Middle East and North Africa, but failure could discourage future investments in sustainable aviation fuel production in the region.

As the world watches Egypt and Qatar embark on this unconventional energy partnership, one question looms large: Will this project prove that even the most oil-rich regions can successfully transition to a circular economy, or will it serve as a cautionary tale about the limits of turning yesterday’s waste into tomorrow’s fuel?",https://middleeast24.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cropped-8dfa8ba6-6f57-4664-a56d-e20e0fac3ed3-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-12-17 01:56:19.697148

Washington, DC, Dec. 16, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) today announced that its 2026 White Plains Regional Forum has been rescheduled for Wednesday, May 20, due to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) runway construction at Westchester County Airport (HPN).

The association’s May 20 White Plains Regional Forum will be held at HPN, the same location as last year’s event.

The association has had to shift the date for the forum because of newly planned construction work on the airport’s primary runway during the second quarter of 2026. The Westchester County Airport Authority has informed NBAA that the construction work at HPN will not be disruptive to the forum.

“We look forward to hosting what has become an essential event, bringing together aircraft, exhibitors, networking opportunities and important conversations with industry’s most knowledgeable professionals all in one place,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen.

“Our thanks to the airport officials who worked with NBAA to update our plans for the forum and ensure that it will proceed in a smooth and coordinated manner. We also look forward to continuing our longstanding relationship with the team at Million Air’s White Plains FBO facility, and we appreciate their flexibility in working with us to produce the forum on the event’s new date.”

NBAA’s Regional Forums convene thousands of attendees, hundreds of exhibitors, an aircraft showcase and a lineup of expert-led discussions about the industry’s hottest topics for a single-day event. Participants highly value the forums’ peerless opportunities for in-person networking, business planning and professional development.

Expandingour global reach and network

We proudly carried more than 55,000,000 passengers on more than 486,000 flights across our combined global network.

We announced five new global destinations from our Seattle hub — Seoul, Tokyo, Reykjavik, Rome and London — opening doors to new adventures and cultural connections.

Over Thanksgiving, our employees delivered the best operation in the industry, achieving the highest on-time performance of any U.S.-based carrier.

We expanded our schedule and connectivity by adding 21 new domestic routes in 2025, including nonstop service between San Francisco and both Kona and Lihue in Hawai’i, Portland to Houston, Anchorage to Sacramento and the first-ever nonstop service between San Diego and Washington National (DCA).

We carried more than 40,000 tons of cargo to and from remote communities across Alaska, Hawaiʻi and the Pacific region — the equivalent of over 400 fully loaded Boeing 737‑9 passenger aircraft — ensuring vital goods reached those who need them most.

We launched the Atmos™ Rewards Summit Visa Infinite® card, co-branded with Bank of America, our most generous card with over 15 benefits, including an annual 25,000-point Global Companion Award, a 100,000-point Global Companion Award after qualifying purchases, eight Alaska Lounge passes annually and the fastest path to status with one status point for every $2 spent on purchases.

We celebrated one year of Huakaʻi by Hawaiian in the state of Hawaiʻi and 14 years of Club 49 in the state of Alaska.

Hawaiian Airlines awarded 500,000 Atmos Rewards points to each of its 14 Atmos Giving by Hawaiian partners in celebration of Giving Tuesday.

We created a new 501(c)(3) foundation to support nonprofits with grants in each of our namesake states. The Alaska Airlines | Hawaiian Airlines Foundation will continue investing in programs that celebrate and preserve the unique way of life in Alaska and Hawai‘i.

Elevating the guest journey

Alaska Airlines installed complimentary Starlink earlier than planned on several of its Embraer E175, and Hawaiian Airlines guests embraced the service, streaming more than177,095 hours over the year — the equivalent of streaming for 7,379 straight days or over 20 years. On average, about 200 devices were connected to the high-speed, low-latency service during each transpacific flight – even while traversing remote stretches of the Pacific.

We introduced exciting new collaborations with three award‑winning chefs — Seattle’s Brady Ishiwata Williams and San Francisco’s Brandon Jew on Alaska Airlines, and Hawaiʻi’s Jason Peel on Hawaiian Airlines — elevating our inflight culinary experience in our First Class cabins.

Alaska also introduced new snacks and chef-driven meals for guests in its Main Cabin, including its newest 100% plant-based and gluten-free The Best Laid Plants grain bowl – available on select flights.

Our guests also began collecting new pilot trading cards from both Alaska and Hawaiian – including exclusive digital collectible cards available only onboard Hawaiian Airlines aircraft.

We introduced an industry-leading surfboard policy, making it easier for surfers to bring their boards along for the ride. And we combined check-in lobbies and airport operations at most of our hubs, creating a smoother, more consistent travel experience.

Building a pipeline of talent

We welcomed over 5,000 new employees across Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, growing our team of passionate people dedicated to safety, hospitality and care.

Hawaiian Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air proudly served as title sponsors of the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals (OBAP) Conference — a first for our combined company.

Horizon Air expanded its Pilot Development Program to Hawaiʻi, the first of its kind in the state, offering aspiring pilots a pathway to join the carrier while easing training costs.

Hawaiian Airlines and Honolulu Community College expanded their workforce development partnership with the launch of the Maintenance Technician Development Program (MTDP), an initiative to train the next generation of aviation maintenance technicians.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines were recognized as 2025 Outstanding Businesses by local nonprofit ClimbHI for the third consecutive year, recognizing our efforts to engage Hawaiʻi-based students and teachers in aviation careers.

Looking ahead

As we turn the page to 2026, we’re focused on executing our Alaska Accelerate strategic plan: launching new service to Europe, unlocking the full power of Atmos Rewards, and bringing our premium experience to even more guests.

With exciting destinations on the horizon, strong foundations built in our hubs and growing investment in our hometowns of Honolulu and Seattle, we’re embarking on our journey to make travel — no matter what country or small town you’re flying from — more seamless and rewarding than ever before.

DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”), and XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX) today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, with ~4 billion people living in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation, driving the global market past ~$25 billion. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed ~$250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties with a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The goal of the collaboration is to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways, and to advance the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based “Gen 1” SAF facility in Louisiana alongside Southern’s previously announced biomass-based “Gen 2” SAF gasification facility.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform & Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform’s low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (“LCA”) methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

“This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform, linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF. “If we succeed in combining Southern’s developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream’s environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF’s HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.”

“Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment,” said Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream. “This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths—XCF’s production expertise, Southern’s developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset monetization capabilities—to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.”

“We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit,” said Jay Patel, CEO of Southern. “We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.”

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

The figure below shows how growing imports have supported U.S. BBD consumption.
The gap was filled by more imports of vegetable oil, fat oil, and grease.
Greater demand for vegetable oil will increase its price, likely around 12% based on a previous analysis of the relationship between biodiesel demand and global vegetable oil prices.
This is perhaps unsurprising, as current growth in vegetable oil production is concentrated in Brazil and Indonesia, where agricultural expansion often relies on high carbon-stock forested land.","In the last 20 years, the U.S. transportation fuel landscape has transformed: electric vehicles emerged as a clear path to zero-emissions road transport while growth in domestic oil production eliminated U.S. dependence on imported oil. Yet the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 law requiring the use of biofuels in transport, remains stuck in an era when biofuels seemed like the only option to reduce transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The latest proposal from EPA doubles down on this outdated vision. It would raise food and fuel costs for consumers by increasing the amount of biomass-based diesel (BBD) mandated under the program without delivering meaningful GHG emission benefits.

EPA’s proposal increases renewable volume obligations (RVOs), the mandatory volumes that specify how much biofuel must be supplied. It also halves the compliance value of imported fuel or fuel produced from imported feedstocks by reducing the generation of renewable identification numbers (RINs)—credits used for compliance with renewable fuel blending mandates. For every gallon of biofuel produced from imported feedstock, twice as much fuel must be supplied to meet RFS obligations. Fuels like biodiesel produced from imported used cooking oil now generate half the compliance value of a domestic fuel, such as soy-derived biodiesel.

EPA justifies these changes by emphasizing the economic and energy security benefits of domestic feedstocks. However, overall U.S. consumption of fats and oils for fuel and other purposes such as cooking and animal feed already exceeds total domestic production. Instead of supporting domestic feedstock producers, the proposal would increase U.S. reliance on imported fats and oils.

The figure below shows how growing imports have supported U.S. BBD consumption. In 2019, domestic fat and oil production met 84% of demand. By 2024, this had fallen to 68%. The gap was filled by more imports of vegetable oil, fat oil, and grease. The United States turned from a net exporter of 0.6 million tonnes in 2019 to a net importer of 3.1 million tonnes in 2024.

As illustrated by the figure, U.S. fat and oil imports would dramatically increase under the proposal; net vegetable oil imports are projected to surge by around 5 million tonnes (from 6.1 to 11.0 MMT). Greater demand for vegetable oil will increase its price, likely around 12% based on a previous analysis of the relationship between biodiesel demand and global vegetable oil prices.

However, a more dramatic price spike is possible. As described in EPA’s Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment, the 2020–2022 vegetable oil price shock that increased global prices from $700 to $1,800 per metric ton was likely caused by biofuel-driven demand and weather-related supply disruptions. The projected 5 million tonne net increase in U.S. vegetable oil imports is equivalent to 6% of the current global vegetable oil trade, creating a risk of short-term price spikes as global oilseed production responds to the additional demand.

According to EPA analysis, this huge increase in BBD consumption will not even meaningfully reduce U.S. GHG emissions, with savings equivalent to less than 1% of road sector emissions at best. One EPA model even suggests that the use of crop-based BBD fuels would increase GHGs. This is perhaps unsurprising, as current growth in vegetable oil production is concentrated in Brazil and Indonesia, where agricultural expansion often relies on high carbon-stock forested land. Indeed, groundbreaking work from Chen et al. has found that that global demand for BBD between 2002 and 2018 drove the conversion of approximately 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm. This means continued market-mediated oil crop expansion could very well offset any emissions reductions from additional BBD use in the United States.

Finally, the proposal’s claims of energy security benefits are unconvincing. Will energy security really be improved by replacing a domestic energy source (petroleum) with one we have to import? And while EPA assumes that the United States will remain the preferred destination for BBD feedstocks globally, this isn’t guaranteed. Changing policies in China have dramatically reduced used cooking oil exports to the United States, and sustainable aviation fuel mandates in the European Union and United Kingdom will heighten competition for feedstock.

Overall, EPA projects its current proposal will saddle consumers with $6.8 billion in extra fuel costs and $2.4 billion in higher food prices each year, all without meaningful emissions cuts or improved U.S. energy independence. Twenty years in, we need a wholesale reconsideration of the Renewable Fuel Standard— the inconsistencies of EPA’s proposal show exactly why reform is needed.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1412869394.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:56:17.052504

(ChiniMandi) India is likely to shift to ethanol-blended aviation fuel by mid-2027, gradually ramping it up in phases, with the addition of more than two dozen distilleries supported by federal biofuel incentives, an official familiar with the details said on Sunday, reported Hindustan Times.

The country, which has the world’s third-largest aviation market, is aiming to introduce 1% ethanol blending in jet fuel by 2027, raise it to 2% in 2028 and further to 5% by 2030. Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol had shared these targets in Parliament earlier this month.

India has already carried out trial flights using cleaner aviation fuel. In March 2023, Air Vistara, which has since merged with Air India, operated a long-haul Boeing 787 flight from the United States to India using fuel blended. In the same year, Air Asia flew the country’s first commercial domestic flight between Pune and Delhi with a fuel blend.

According to the news report, a long-pending policy on sustainable aviation fuel is likely to be released for public consultations next month, the official said, requesting anonymity.

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as a global market-based measure to reduce emissions from international aviation which require offsetting of emissions above a baseline value. Airlines can either use SAF or offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from ICAO approved Emissions Unit Programmes. SAF offers a direct pathway to emission reduction by lowering the lifecycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel. When airlines adopt CORSIA Eligible SAF (CORSIA Eligible Fuel) certified against ICAO’s sustainability standards and verified through Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV), they can claim these reductions as substitutes for carbon credits, thereby decreasing their offsetting obligations under the scheme.

The Centre is supporting biofuel projects through the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, which provides financial assistance for setting up plants, including those producing aviation fuel.

COP30

Between November 10 and 22, the COP30 climate change conference took place in Belém, Brazil. Negotiations concluded with 195 Parties approving the Belém Package, which included agreements on:

adoptation finance to triple by 2035, highlighting the need for developed countries to significantly boost climate finance for developing nations more at risk to the impacts of climate change

establishing the Baku Adaptation Roadmap, which sets out the work for 2026–2028, until the next Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement

a Just Transition Mechanism to promote equity, capacity-building, and technical support

a Gender Action Plan to strengthen support for Indigenous, Afro-descendant, and rural women

Among discussions was a notable global dialogue on the future of fossil fuels, which formed the Global Mutirão Decision. Although the final statement omitted any direct reference to fossil fuels, prompting concern from many nations, it did include strong warnings on the cost of inaction.

ISSB to Develop Nature-Related Standards as TNFD

On November 7, the ISSB confirmed plans to introduce incremental disclosure requirements on nature-related risks and opportunities, building on IFRS S1 and S2. These requirements will draw from the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework. The final Exposure Draft is expected by October 2026. TNFD will complete its current technical work by Q3 2026 and pause new guidance to support ISSB’s efforts. While not confirmed, ISSB’s approach may include amendments to existing standards, industry guidance, or a new standard, subject to public consultation.

Cross-Border

UK/EU: Council of the EU decision authorizing negotiations with UK on ETS agreement

On November 13, the Council of the EU authorized the European Commission to begin negotiations with the UK on potentially linking the EU and UK emissions trading systems (ETS). With the aim of avoiding carbon leakage and contributing to common sustainability goals, any future agreement would need to confirm how the linked systems would function, specify the sectors covered (including electricity, industrial heat, industry, and both domestic and international aviation and maritime transport), and create a process for adding new sectors to prevent carbon leakage and ensure fair competition. It would also allow goods from both sides to qualify for mutual exemptions under each party’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.

Singapore

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy Announced

On November 10, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy. This Levy will take effect from October 1, 2026. It will apply to cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights, departing Singapore, with charges varying by distance and aircraft size. Cargo shipments will be charged per kilogram, while business and general aviation flights will pay per aircraft based on wingspan categories. The Levy aims to fund SAF procurement and administration, supporting Singapore’s 1% SAF target for 2026 and its long-term goal of net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.

Europe

Regulation to simplify the Deforestation-free Products Regulation

On November 26, the European Parliament voted to simplify the Deforestation Regulation. Key changes include granting all companies an extra year to comply and simplifying due diligence requirements. If agreed, compliance timelines would be pushed back to December 30, 2026 for large operators and June 30, 2027 for micro/small enterprises. Due diligence requirements would be also streamlined, placing responsibility on those businesses which first introduce the relevant product to the EU market, as opposed to those who subsequently trade it. Micro and small primary operators will submit a one-off simplified declaration. The current text will now be negotiated between the EU Parliament and Member States before final adoption.

Amendments to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation

On November 20, the European Commission proposed amendments to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. The proposals aim to simplify sustainability disclosures and reduce complexity for in-scope businesses. The new proposal removes some company-level reporting requirements, reduces product-level disclosures to focus on clear, comparable data. It also proposes a simple categorization system for financial products making ESG claims: Sustainable, Transition, and ESG Basics. The Commission’s proposal will now be submitted to Parliament and Council for their deliberation.

Omnibus VI: Chemical Classification Labelling Regulation Amended

On November 17, the Council of the EU approved postponing key provisions of the EU’s Classification, Labelling and Packaging of chemicals (CLP) regulation to January 1, 2028. This ‘stop-the-clock’ measure, part of the Omnibus VI simplification package, delays requirements for relabeling, formatting, advertising, and online sales, which were originally set for mid-2026 and early 2027. The move aims to reduce regulatory burdens, especially for SMEs, while maintaining safety standards. The adopted regulation will be now published in the Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.

Omnibus I: Sustainable Reporting Requirements

On November 13, the European Parliament adopted its position on amendments to the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Under its current position, reporting would apply only to large firms with over 1,750 employees and over €450 million net annual turnover, with fewer qualitative details required to be submitted. Sector-specific reporting would become a voluntary process. Due diligence duties would cover very large corporations to include those with over 5,000 employees and an annual net turnover of more than €1.5 billion, using a risk-based approach and relying on existing data. Transition plans would no longer be required, and liability would be at national level. Institutional negotiations are expected to take place and remains unclear if further amendments will be set out.

EU Climate Law Amendment

On November 13, the European Parliament adopted its position on amending the EU Climate Law. The amendment sets out a binding target to cut net GHG emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. From 2036, up to five percentage points of reductions could come from high-quality international carbon credits, subject to strict safeguards following concerns from the European Commission. MEPs also backed postponing ETS2, covering CO₂ emissions from buildings and road transport, by one year to 2028. This target is set to be reviewed biennially. The European Parliament will now begin negotiations with Member States on the final law.

Legislative Package on One Substance, One Assessment Adopted

On November 13, the Council of the EU adopted the ‘One Substance, One Assessment’ (OSOA) legislative package to streamline chemical safety evaluations across the EU. The new rules aim to speed up regulatory action on chemical risks, improving health and leading to better and faster environmental protection. OSOA also aims to enhance consistency and efficiency in assessments for sectors such as food, toys, pesticides and medical devices. It introduces a common data platform, integrating information from over 70 EU laws and including a database of safer alternatives. The package also clarifies EU agency responsibilities and strengthens institutional cooperation. The adopted acts will be now published in the Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.

Revision of the New Legislative Framework

On November 12, the European Commission opened a consultation on revising the New Legislative Framework (NFL). The NFL underpins EU product safety rules, CE marking, and market access. The proposed changes aim to simplify requirements, reduce administrative burdens, and improve coherence across sectors, ensuring products remain safe and compliant while supporting sustainability and fair competition. Potential changes include introducing a digital product passport, aiming to support the EU’s circular economy objectives.

Sustainability Reporting Standards Postponed

On November 10, the Quick Fix Delegated Regulation was published, providing targeted relief postponing certain sustainability reporting requirements under the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) framework. This Regulation provides reporting relief to first wave businesses subject to ESRS, allowing businesses to omit certain disclosures, such as anticipated financial effects of sustainability risks until FY2027. Also, businesses with 750 employees or more will also benefit from the same phase-in provisions that apply to businesses with 750 employees or less.

Taxonomy Delegated Acts

On November 7, the European Commission launched calls for evidence on proposed amendments to the Taxonomy Climate Act and the Environmental Delegated Act. These Acts set technical screening criteria for activities aligned with six EU environmental objectives. The planned changes aim to improve clarity, usability, and legal certainty by simplifying criteria and reducing complexity. Feedback will inform targeted revisions to enhance cost-effectiveness and coherence of the EU Taxonomy framework. The feedback period closed on December 5.

UK

Autumn Budget Announcement

On November 26, the Government announced their Autumn Budget. As part of the budget, the Government put forward a range of sustainability-related measures. The key announcements include:

capital infrastructure will be invested in to support, among other things, greater energy security across the country, with additional investment being announced for “major growth projects”

confirmation the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) would be introduced under the Finance Bill 2025-2026. Indirect emissions within scope of CBAM will be delayed until 2029. The Government is considering including refined products in CBAM in future

confirmation the standard and lower rates of landfill tax would not be merged into a single rate

confirmation the UK Plastic Packaging Tax (PPT) rate for 2026 to 2027 will increase in line with CPI inflation

confirmation a consultation would be launched on the introduction of mandatory certification for mechanically recycled plastic packaging for businesses to claim an exemption from PPT

Planning and Infrastructure Bill

On November 24, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill cleared the House of Lords. The Bill has now returned to the House of Commons, where it will consider the amendments made. Key amendments made by the House of Lords include:

enhanced protections for chalk streams

prioritisation to redevelop of brownfield sites

proposal that the Government publish an assessment of the impact of existing regulations on low-hazard reservoirs and, within six months of the Bill’s enactment, set out proposals for their deregulation

The Bill is sat with the House of Commons, who will review the amendments on December 8.

Employment Rights Bill

On November 15, the House of Commons rejected several House of Lords’ amendments to the Employment Rights Bill. The Bill now returns to the House of Lords to review the government’s stated reasons for rejecting the amendments. These include:

protection from unfair dismissal should apply from the first day of employment

workers who meet the qualifying criteria should automatically receive a guaranteed hours offer, rather than having to request one

the requirement that industrial action is only valid if at least 50% of eligible voters participate in the ballot should be removed

FRC issues ISSA (UK) 5000

On November 12, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) issued International Standard on Sustainability Assurance (ISSA) (UK) 5000, “General Requirements for Sustainability Assurance Engagements”, providing UK companies, investors and assurance providers with internationally aligned voluntary assurance standards. This UK adaptation of the global IAASB standard provides requirements for both limited and reasonable assurance engagements. Designed for voluntary use, it aims to enhance the credibility of sustainability reporting, support informed investment decisions. The standard reflects FRC’s commitment to internationally aligned frameworks, promoting consistent assurance practices and reliable information for investors.

Draft Amendment to the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging and Packaging Waste) (Amendment) Regulations 2025

On November 3, draft regulations amending the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging and Packaging Waste) Regulations 2025 were published. The changes, effective from January 1, 2026, allow deductions for recycled food-grade plastics collected in closed-loop systems, and clarify producer obligations. The amendments aim to close loopholes and simplify compliance for in-scope businesses.

US

Endangered Species Act Regulations

On November 19, 2025, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed four rules under the Endangered Species Act regulations, to require economic impacts to play a greater role in listing decisions and critical habitat designations, narrow the effects that must be considered under Section 7 consultation, and to remove the “blanket rule” that applied the same protections for “threatened” species as those that apply to “endangered” species.

Waters of the United States Rule

On November 17, 2025, the EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers issued a proposed rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act. The stated purpose of the rule is to conform the definition with the US Supreme Court’s decision Sackett v. EPA. Among other things, the proposed rule provides jurisdiction over only tributaries connection to traditional navigable waters, provides definitions for “continuous surface connection” and “relatively permanent,” eliminates “interstate waters” from the definition of WOTUS, and revises exclusions for ditches, waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and groundwater.

EPA Proposes Amendments to PFAS Reporting

On November 11, 2025 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to amend requirements for businesses to report PFAS use under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The original rule, finalized in 2023, mandated reporting on PFAS usage between 2011 and 2022, related to exposure and any existing environmental and health effects. The proposal introduces exemptions for PFAS in concentrations of 0.1% or lower, imported articles, certain byproducts, impurities, research chemicals, and non-isolated intermediates. Public comments on the revisions will be accepted for 45 days before final rules are issued.

Hanna Campbell, market development director at the Michigan Soybean Committee and managing director for the Michigan Advanced Biofuels Coalition, sees a unique challenge in the maritime industry.
For many years, they have been trialing biodiesel and testing the waters on different decarbonization options.” Even with the consensus for biofuels, Carr raises a critical question.
Number one on the IMO’s list of priorities is creating a level playing field for the maritime industry while maintaining safety and efficiency standards across the globe.","In mid-October, the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee convened for its second extraordinary session to discuss the potential adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

With more than 80% of global trade and 40% of U.S. imports and exports moving through the maritime sector, it’s no surprise that decarbonization efforts are increasingly focused on ships operating in both brown waters—navigable inland or coastal routes—and blue, or international deep-sea, waters. And for good reason, according to Ed Carr, partner at Energy & Environmental Research Associates. “If ships were a country, they would be somewhere around Mexico or Japan in terms of their greenhouse gas emissions,” Carr notes. “It’s approximately 2.9 or 3 percent of global emissions, but a small percentage of a very large number is still a pretty big number.

“The marine sector is not one sector, [and] not all ships are created equal,” Carr continues. “Within shipping, you’ve got dozens of different sectors that operate differently because of their needs. The IMO estimates have [the maritime industry’s fuel demand] at 300 to 330 million metric tons (mmt) of residual or HFO-equivalent fuels per year.”

Pete Probst, president and cofounder of Indigenous Energy, notes the steep environmental cost of not decarbonizing the maritime sector. “When you look at CO2 on a life-cycle basis, for every five years that we wait to reduce the carbon emissions, there’s an additional 13 times more carbon carbon accumulated, which we then have to get rid of.”

The benefits of decarbonizing outweigh the upfront costs. That does not mean, however, that the costs are easy to balance.

Reeling in Emissions

While there is no shortage of alternative fuels being used to decarbonize the maritime sector—methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, LNG and biofuels—the move to net-zero emissions is easier said than done. “There are currently more vessels that can fire using methanol than ammonia,” Carr explains. “But the industry is investing in vessels that currently use conventional fuels, but are designed to be able to use alternative fuels with some retrofits. In this category, there are currently more ammonia-ready vessels than methanol-ready vessels, but the orderbook shows methanol leading the charge. The problem is that most are not actually firing on methanol or ammonia right now. Most of the methanol-capable ones may be using some methanol in their firing, but many of them will be predominantly on conventional fuels.

“The energy density of methanol and ammonia is less than half the energy density, both volumetrically and on a mass basis, of conventional bunkers,” Carr continues. “This means that to go the same distance, you need to carry twice as much [fuel], or you can only go half as far,” he continues. “In those situations, you either need to give up cargo space on your vessel in order to carry more fuel, or you need to retool the way that your operations are working and think about refueling more frequently.” The largest container ships can store up to 4.5 million gallons of fuel onboard; giving up cargo space for more fuel or increasing stops could lead to further hurdles.

Hanna Campbell, market development director at the Michigan Soybean Committee and managing director for the Michigan Advanced Biofuels Coalition, sees a unique challenge in the maritime industry. “The [maritime] fueling system is a little bit different as to how vessels get fuel,” she says. “There aren’t as many players in the game; it's not like an over-the-road truck stopping at any truck stop or gas station along the way. Fueling on the Great Lakes is more of a closed system. It’s easier to speak with the different players because there aren’t as many.”

Regardless of the challenges involved in decarbonizing the industry, Campbell, Probst and Carr all agree on what must come next. “If any of this is going to decarbonize, something’s got to fill the gap, which is where biofuels come in,” Carr says, adding that biofuels made from renewable feedstocks like soybean oil are readily available and proven solutions to decarbonize vessels today.

Probst and Campbell both note the easier transition to biodiesel compared to other alternative fuels like methanol and ammonia.

“[Biodiesel] has been around for a long time,” Probst explains. “The technical specs have been ironed out, so there are no issues with runningbiodiesel at all different blends in any type of diesel applications, including marine vessels. You can do that with pre-existing equipment. You don’t have to change anything on the dock in terms of fueling; you don’t have to change anything, really, in the engine or on the vessels. You can use biodiesel just like you would your petroleum diesel.”

Campbell explains the push toward biodiesel in the U.S. Great Lakes maritime system has been spurred by recent domestic triggers, but our northern neighbors are well-versed. “For a lot of companies, specifically on the Canadian side, biodiesel is nothing new. For many years, they have been trialing biodiesel and testing the waters on different decarbonization options.”

Even with the consensus for biofuels, Carr raises a critical question. “All of this stuff comes with a cost premium, right? [Unless] you have a carrier who’s willing to pay that cost premium [or] you’ve got a client who’s willing to say, ‘Yeah, move my goods with lower carbon intensity,’ … why would anybody be willing to take on that investment when their competitors don’t have to?”

In the Wake

This imbalance in capital and other resources is where the value of the IMO lies. Number one on the IMO’s list of priorities is creating a level playing field for the maritime industry while maintaining safety and efficiency standards across the globe. For this reason, the significance of the MEPC’s work in October cannot be understated.

“Decarbonizing ships is comparatively hard to decarbonizing land-based electricity,” Carr says. “Going into [the MEPC extraordinary session], a lot of countries were thinking very positively, and a lot of industry was talking very positively [because] it provided a sense of certainty that these folks would now be able to tailor and operate their businesses … within that framework.”

“Prior IMO policy required a switch to low-sulfur fuel, so the shipping industry is already looking for cleaner, available fuels,” adds Paul Winters, director of public affairs and federal communications at Clean Fuels Alliance America. This opens pathways for alternative fuels. And while each fuel has its role, biofuels—namely, biodiesel and renewable iesel (RD)—are operation-ready today.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework, which was approved by MEPC 83 held in April this year, comprised of new international regulations aligning with the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy, including two specific changes: a global fuel standard, and a global GHG emissions pricing mechanism. “The framework was designed not to say you must use methanol or ammonia or hydrogen or biofuels; it was designed to say that the carbon intensity of your fuel starts here, and over time has to get lower. It didn’t put a cap on emissions in total. It just said the carbon intensity of the fuel has to come down,” Carr explains.

“Some folks did not like what was being proposed at the IMO and worked hard to oppose what was going on …Ultimately, they punted a year down the road,” he says. “And some of the arguments were legitimate. There was a big question mark about how the IMO’s financial framework fit with Europe’s financial framework. That was not cleanly addressed in the regulations that were written, and it was an issue that was picked upon by some folks … and there were some other things that were left as guidelines or other things that need to be sorted out.”

With the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework decision pushed to next October, on approval, the start date for the framework has been delayed to 2028. More concerning, the lack of set guidelines marks a time of increased uncertainty in the international sector.

This does not mean, however, that the industry has found itself stalled. In the U.S., the bipartisan Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act has seen success in the Senate. Introduced to both the Senate and House by Sens. Pete Ricketts (R-NE) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), John Garamendi (D-CA) and six others, respectively, the legislation would revise the Renewable Fuel Standard to support farmers providing fuel to the maritime sector.

“Right now, the RFS requires biofuel producers to retire RINs from gallons of fuels used in ocean-going vessels. This includes ships operating in the Great Lakes, since they are in international waters,” Winters says. “The Renewable Fuels for Ocean-Going Vessels Act would make a simple change to allow fuel producers to keep the RINs and their value. It has bipartisan, bicameral support. It recently received a hearing in the U.S. Senate, so it can move forward toward adoption in the current Congress.”

Seizing the Seas

An additional area of special interest in the IMO Net-Zero Mandate, Carr says, is regarding whether the application of crop-based biofuels will be allowed. The FuelEU Maritime regulation—the law of the EU maritime land as of January this year—incentivizes lower-carbon alternative fuels; but just like its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) counterpart, ReFuelEU, FuelEU Maritime currently bars crop-based biofuels from eligibility in European markets. “[The crop-based biofuels ban] means that the U.S. markets don’t have access to European markets on that front,” Carr notes. “From a U.S. perspective, that makes a big difference in terms of what’s going out there, and it makes a big difference globally, too, in terms of how much feedstock there’s going to be.”

Until the October 2026 reconvening of the MEPC and further industry guidance, stateside movement toward renewables incentives in the maritime sector remain promising for biodiesel and RD producers. And for some, the policy changes are following behind their own initiatives. Campbell points to the Port of Detroit, which in April 2024 released its Decarbonization and Air Quality Improvement Plan to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2040. “[The Port of Detroit] is very committed to particulate matter emissions and things like that specifically for the benefit of the communities around the port,” she says. “That commitment helps spur on folks at the terminals and ships coming through.”

Under current RFS guidelines, Winters says, U.S. biodiesel and RD producers are discouraged from supplying to the maritime sector. “They’re missing an opportunity to serve a multibillion-gallon fuel market,” he adds. “Since biodiesel and renewable diesel production represents 10% of the value of all domestically grown soybeans, expansion of the market would directly benefit U.S. farmers and feedstock providers.”

Those benefits, Campbell notes, would include opportunities for biodiesel producers to sell more of their product locally. “There are two biodiesel producers in Michigan, and traditionally a lot of their biodiesel tends to leave the state,” she says. “The maritime market is a big opportunity to keep that circular biodiesel ecosystem here.”

Despite the delay in international guidelines, Carr says the first steps have been made. “Shipping was poised and really on the edge of the first global GHG standard, which is a big deal. It didn’t end up happening—yet. Hopefully it will, but just the fact that an industry that moves in the way that shipping does—historically having taken its time to ensure that things are safe and not going to be a hazard to operate—and was willing to engage in that, I think that says a lot about what’s happening now.”

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Swiss cleantech company Synhelion have signed a long-term offtake agreement for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). From 2027, SWISS will purchase at least 200 tons of solar jet fuel from Synhelion annually, pioneering the use of this innovative fuel in civil aviation. The agreement marks an important milestone on the road to more sustainable aviation.

SWISS is the first airline to sign a binding five-year SAF offtake agreement with Synhelion. This marks a pioneering step toward defossilizing aviation. From 2027, Synhelion will produce renewable synthetic crude oil, known as “syncrude”, at its first commercial plant. The syncrude will be processed in an existing refinery together with fossil crude oil and refined into certified Jet-A-1 fuel. Thus, Synhelion directly replaces fossil crude oil with sustainable syncrude, without the need for any adjustments to the existing infrastructure. The fuel will be delivered to the airport via the regular logistics chain and fed into the fuel supply system. Synhelion’s synthetic jet fuel is based on renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks.

A strong signal for sustainable aviation

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonizing our flight operations,” says Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS. “Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

With this offtake agreement, SWISS is actively supporting the scaling of Synhelion’s technology for the production of renewable synthetic fuels as a customer, investor, and strategic partner. This long-term planning certainty enables targeted expansion of production capacity and helps reduce costs over time.

Pioneering partnership

Synhelion also emphasizes the significance of the agreement: “The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of our technology,” says Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

Expanding the partnership with Kuehne+Nagel

Part of the renewable jet fuel produced by Synhelion will be resold by SWISS to the logistics service provider Kuehne+Nagel. The company will use the sustainable fuel for air freight transportation with Swiss WorldCargo, offering its customers a tangible solution to reduce their carbon footprint in global logistics.

First delivery already completed

In July 2025, SWISS became the first airline in the world to use solar fuel from Synhelion in regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered its first barrel of syncrude from its DAWN plant to a refinery in northern Germany, where the syncrude was processed into certified jet fuel (Jet-A-1) and subsequently fed into the fuel supply system via Hamburg Airport.

After a decade of pilot schemes and policy debate, the global aviation sector has entered a new phase, one driven by firm regulation, clear ambition from airlines, and the rapid build-out of SAF projects across multiple pathways.

For those of us working to bring new production online, the momentum is real. But there are risks as well. Events this year suggest that, despite unprecedented progress, political uncertainty still plays a notable role in shaping SAF investment.

Regulation Is Moving in the Right Direction, and Fast

The past 18 months have seen the most supportive policy signals the SAF industry has ever received.

The UK has led from the front, putting its SAF mandate into law and giving the market a timetable that matters: 2% in 2025, 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The UK’s decision to pair this mandate with a revenue certainty mechanism is unique globally: a recognition that early-stage industries need predictable conditions, not just aspirations.

Europe has also stepped up, with ReFuelEU Aviation now live. A binding 6% SAF requirement by 2030 and a trajectory to 70% by 2050 is already reshaping demand curves for airlines and suppliers.

And globally, airlines themselves have set a tone of ambition that often surpasses government expectation. Many now have 10% SAF targets for 2030, and several have signed multi-year offtake agreements that would have been unthinkable five years ago. Engine manufacturers and OEMs are certifying fleets for 100% SAF. Infrastructure owners are preparing for higher blends.

The direction of travel is no longer in doubt: aviation is preparing for a SAF-powered future.

A Wave of Projects Is Taking Shape from the US to the UK

This policy foundation is enabling real deployment. Across North America and Europe, dozens of first-of-a-kind and next-of-a-kind facilities have entered the final stages of engineering, financing or construction. The diversity of technologies and feedstocks coming forward mirrors exactly what the sector needs: Fischer–Tropsch, alcohol-to-jet, gasification routes, and advanced pyrolysis all now have commercial backers and blue-chip customers.

Natural State Renewables is proud to be part of this next chapter. Our flagship project in Arkansas will convert waste wood residues into high quality SAF, with a delivery horizon aligned to the UK’s 2030 mandate. We’ve spent years building a robust feedstock position and a pathway designed to meet the world’s most stringent sustainability standards. It is exactly the kind of project mandates were designed to enable.

As a U.S. producer, we see a tremendous opportunity to work with partners across the UK and Europe to help meet early mandate requirements while domestic capacity scales. Our goal is to complement — not compete with — the region’s growing SAF ecosystem by providing reliable, certified volumes that support near-term demand and strengthen supply-chain resilience as new plants come online.

Across the sector, the progress is striking. Capital is flowing. Technical risk is falling. Producers, airlines and suppliers are collaborating in ways that would have once seemed impossible.

But Momentum Does Not Guarantee Deployment

Political uncertainty has become a significant consideration for SAF investment. Behind the headlines and policy announcements, producers face a common reality: SAF facilities are large, capital-intensive projects that depend on long-term confidence in the regulatory environment.

And right now, that confidence remains fragile.

Across multiple jurisdictions, including those most committed to SAF, there is still uncertainty on future incentives, programme design, and the longevity of support. Changes in government, budget pressures, and shifting political narratives all add risk premiums to project finance.

Investors tell us the same thing: the technology risk is manageable; the market risk is understood; but the political and policy risks remain material.

Without long-term clarity on sustainability criteria, revenue support, accounting rules, and mandate enforcement, producers cannot reach final investment decision at the pace the sector demands. The result is delayed projects, higher capital costs, and slower emissions reductions for aviation.

In short: the key challenge for SAF today is less about engineering and more about policy consistency.

A Strong 2025, But the Market Must Now Move Faster

The good news is that these risks are solvable. Governments have already shown they are willing to take bold, industry-shaping decisions. The UK mandate, in particular, demonstrates that political leadership can give investors exactly what they need: a predictable, rules-based environment where long-term capital can move with confidence.

What comes next is simple but urgent:

clearer long-term signals on revenue support

stability in sustainability and feedstock rules

alignment across jurisdictions to reduce compliance friction

political consistency across electoral cycles

If governments can deliver that certainty, the industry will deliver the rest. We have the feedstocks. We have the pathways. We have the airline demand. What we need now is a policy environment that stays stable for the lifespan of an SAF plant.

Conclusion: A Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity, If We Seize It

2025 has been a turning point. Mandates are in place. Demand is locked in. SAF projects are reaching maturity. The sector has never been more aligned or more ambitious.

But to translate that ambition into tangible decarbonization — steel in the ground, supply into airports, emissions reductions at scale — we must turn momentum into permanence. That means long-term political certainty and globally coherent policy frameworks.

The UK has taken major steps in the right direction, and that leadership matters. If other jurisdictions follow suit, global SAF deployment will accelerate dramatically.

For producers like Natural State Renewables, the message is clear: the opportunity is enormous, the technology is ready, but investment decisions depend on confidence.

Kuehne+Nagel, a global leader in logistics, and Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS), Switzerland’s flagship carrier, have announced an expansion of their strategic partnership aimed at accelerating sustainable aviation initiatives. The two companies have formalized their collaboration through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that focuses on leveraging innovative technologies to improve operational efficiency while reducing environmental impact.

Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel

At the heart of this partnership lies a shared commitment to the development and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced by Synhelion, a Swiss clean technology firm. Synhelion employs a proprietary process that harnesses concentrated sunlight to convert biogenic and recycled carbon into renewable synthetic fuels, including solar jet fuel. By supporting this cutting-edge technology, Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS seek to contribute meaningfully to the long-term decarbonisation of the aviation sector.

To facilitate the scaling of production and foster further innovation, Kuehne+Nagel, SWISS, and its air freight division Swiss WorldCargo have entered into a long-term SAF off-take agreement. This arrangement provides Synhelion with the necessary planning security to expand its production capacity and advance its technology. Such commitments are considered essential for nurturing emerging SAF producers and encouraging wider adoption of sustainable fuels across the industry.

Starting in 2027, Kuehne+Nagel will purchase SAF produced by Synhelion from SWISS under a five-year contract, specifically for use in cargo shipments operated by Swiss WorldCargo. This agreement highlights Kuehne+Nagel’s dedication to decarbonising global logistics and offers its customers a tangible means to reduce the carbon footprint of their air freight operations.

Challenges and Industry Implications

Despite the promising outlook, the transition to sustainable aviation faces significant challenges. Both Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS must navigate potential regulatory obstacles, the complexities of establishing reliable SAF supply chains, and the substantial investments required for new infrastructure. While the partnership is likely to be well received by sustainability-focused investors, some skepticism remains regarding the feasibility and timeline for achieving the ambitious environmental targets set forth.

The announcement is expected to prompt competitive responses within the logistics and airline sectors, with other companies likely to increase their investments in sustainable practices to maintain market relevance. This dynamic could accelerate industry-wide efforts toward sustainability, driving further innovation and the adoption of cleaner technologies.

Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS present their collaboration as a practical example of how airlines and logistics providers can work together to support innovative solutions and expedite the transition to more sustainable aviation. SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger emphasized the importance of such partnerships, stating, “Sustainable aviation fuels are a key building block for making air travel more sustainable.

Step 10: Climate risk program management Climate risk management is not a one-time exercise but a continuous improvement program designed to maintain momentum in reducing VAR.","Climate change is no longer a distant environmental concern – it is a material business risk that demands the attention as any other strategic risk. To move past abstract assessments and guesswork, global consultancy firm dss+ has developed a practical, stepwise framework that quantifies financial exposure into a clear ‘Value at Risk’ framework.

With the global climate crisis enacting high economic tolls around the world, climate risk is no longer seen as just an abstract sustainability issue related with compliance. It is a real business risk and companies are increasingly aware of the need to take concrete action.

For executive teams, the primary challenge is identifying precisely where climate change affects operations, assets, and long-term growth. They must then determine the most cost-effective path to adaptation.

This approach narrows the focus to actions that matter most, giving leadership a solid basis for prioritization, investment, and accountability. This framework is designed to provide a defensible calculation of financial exposure and consists of ten distinct steps, summarized in the dss+ ‘Road to climate resilience’ workflow.

Source: dss+

Step 0: Organizational Maturity Assessment

Before taking concrete action, it is vital to understand an organization’s current maturity in managing physical climate risks. dss+ uses the Bradley Curve to evaluate this maturity. This scale ranges from a reactive state – driven by compliance – to an interdependent state, where climate resilience is embedded across all functions.

This assessment highlights the gap between the current state and what is required to reduce climate risk to as low as reasonably possible.

Step 1: Identify climate hazards

The process begins by identifying climate hazards, such as temperature extremes, wildfire risk, and tropical storms that could impact operations or the supply chain. Hazards should be shortlisted by focusing on those expected to change significantly over time, using data such as historic incidence, insurance data, and academic research. To maintain a practical analysis, the number of hazards should be limited to no more than ten.

Step 2: Review and shortlist receptors

After climate hazards have been identified, the next step is to understand how they can impact systems or components, referred to as receptors. This review is conducted at the site or operations level and must cover all locations in the value chain.

The approach includes reviewing peer annual reports, examining literature on common receptor vulnerabilities, and analyzing existing site assessments. Targeted reviews and site visits of critical components also help to map key system elements and product flow paths.

Step 3: Potential vulnerability

Next is to synthesize climate hazards and receptors into a Vulnerability Matrix to assess how each hazard could impact critical systems, operations, and the value chain. An initial analysis identifies known vulnerabilities, such as increased temperature driving higher cooling demand, for example.

This analysis is then validated through site visits and engagement with experts, such as maintenance engineers and facility managers. Preliminary hotspots are flagged based on potential infrastructure damage, increased maintenance, production losses, and risks to personnel safety.

Step 4: Quantify Value at Risk

With various vulnerabilities now identified, they are now translated into financial terms by developing damage functions. These mathematical models can estimate potential losses for each receptor-hazard combination under specific climate scenarios.

The outcome is a clear visualization of the Value at Risk (VAR) across the value chain, which enables the identification of financial hotspots and guides cost-effective adaptation strategies. These climate risk assessments should also factor asset condition and maintenance into damage functions for VAR calculations to be as accurate as possible.

Step 5: Estimate probability and financial impact

The most significant risks are identified using a simple five-by-five risk matrix that combines probability and impact. Probability ranges from ‘possible to occur’ to ‘multiple events at the site’, while impact spans from negligible to catastrophic.

Each vulnerability is scored, and multiplying the risk rating by its VAR provides a clear view of financial exposure across the value chain. Climate-driven changes should also be taken into account for an updated profile on operational risks that threaten staff. This ensures decisions reflect both financial and human exposure.

Step 6: Identify adaptation options

This step focuses on developing a comprehensive portfolio of adaptation measures – structural, nature-based, policy, and behavioral – targeting the highest VAR first. Organizations should start with quick wins, such as early warning systems and emergency response plans, before progressing to capital-intensive solutions like infrastructure upgrades and flood defenses. The goal is to create a full ‘wish list’ of potential actions, regardless of initial cost or complexity.

Step 7: Marginal adaptation cost curve

The Marginal Adaptation Cost Curve (MACC) ranks adaptation measures based on their cost-effectiveness in reducing VAR. Each option is plotted according to its implementation cost and the degree to which it lowers financial exposure, providing a clear visual for prioritization.

The MACC considers the entire value chain and accounts for multiple options addressing the same vulnerability. This tool identifies the most cost-effective interventions that deliver the greatest risk reduction.

Step 8: Build an integration roadmap

To minimize VAR within operational and capital constraints, the analysis is translated into a practical, prioritized adaptation roadmap. Multi-criteria decision analysis is used to weigh technical feasibility, cost, social impacts, and institutional capacity, setting clear implementation milestones.

The roadmap must be technically robust but also realistic for an organization to execute. It should align with capital allocation processes and integrate into day-to-day operations and long-term planning.

Step 9: Financing climate risk reduction

Financing determines the pace and scale at which climate risks can be reduced. The quantified VAR, MACC, and roadmap provide the foundation for investment decisions, enabling companies to prioritize the highest-impact, lowest-cost interventions. Companies can either opt to self-fund these initiatives, or look to climate finance, which leverages external funding sources like concessional loans, grants, and resilience bonds.

Step 10: Climate risk program management

Climate risk management is not a one-time exercise but a continuous improvement program designed to maintain momentum in reducing VAR. Success requires embedding resilience into the organization through mindset, governance structures, management processes, capabilities, and enabling technologies.

Companies that succeed establish a cross-functional project management office to monitor progress and lift roadblocks, ensuring organizational success factors are implemented in parallel with technical solutions. Automation is critical to ensure efficient reassessment aligned with annual budget cycles and updates to global climate models.

“This is not just about compliance – it is about safeguarding assets, operations and growth in a changing climate,” said Gerhard Bolt, principal at dss+. “Organizations that adopt this structured approach will not only reduce risk but also unlock competitive advantage through resilience, cost efficiency and stakeholder confidence.”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-12-16-092454619-Mastering_climate_risk_dss__framework_sets_out_a_10-step_approach_2.jpg?webp,N,,2025-12-16 10:58:13.859475

This came during the ninth edition of Al-Ahram’s Energy Conference, where he gave the breakdown of the figure, noting that Italy’s energy giant Eni will invest $8 bn, the UK-based bp will inject $5 bn, and the remaining $3.7 billion will be provided by ARCIUS Energy (a joint venture between bp and ADNOC’s subsidiary XRG).

The minister boasted the fact that the petroleum sector has shifted from a period of decline to a phase of stability, with natural gas production increasing gradually for the first time in four years, and the crude oil output is projected to achieve self-sufficiency within five years.

The petroleum ministry has implemented a series of measures to stimulate upstream activity, including paying nearly $1 billion of arrears to IOCs, introducing new investment incentives, and revising production-sharing agreements to include the R-Factor system.

These reforms have encouraged foreign investors to expand their operations, leading to multiple discoveries across Egypt, the most recent of which are: North El-Basant 1 exploratory well, which contains initial reserves of 15–25 billion cubic feet (bcf) and the Northeast Ramadan Crystal (NER-1X) well, with output estimated at 8 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) in the Nile Delta region.

The ministry launched a Red Sea international bid round via Egypt Upstream Gateway (EUG), available until Sunday 3rd of May 2026 at 12:00 PM. This is in addition to plans to drill 480 exploration wells over the next five years, alongside expanding seismic surveys covering 100,000 square kilometers onshore the Western Desert in addition to 95,000 square kilometers offshore the Eastern Mediterranean using Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) technology.

During the conference, Badawi highlighted the ministry’s plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and boost investment opportunities in green energy projects, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), green ammonia, and bioethanol

In December, Qatar committed $200 million to build a SAF production facility in the Ain Sokhna Integrated Zone, the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), which will convert cooking oils into 200,000 tons per year (t/y) of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), biopropane, and bionaphtha.

SWISS will resell a portion of the fuel to Kuehne+Nagel for use in airfreight operations.

From 2027, Kuehne+Nagel will use Synhelion’s SAF for a five-year period for air cargo transported with SWISS subsidiary Swiss WorldCargo.

The partnership brings together an airline, a global logistics provider and a fuel technology developer, with the stated aim of accelerating the commercial deployment of synthetic aviation fuels, which remain costly and limited in availability.

“SAFs are a key element in our endeavors to make air transportation more sustainable,” said Jens Fehlinger, Chief Executive Officer at SWISS. “These fuels are still expensive and in short supply, however, which is why we need strong partners to help further their development.”

Kuehne+Nagel said the agreement would allow its airfreight customers to reduce their carbon footprint through access to SAF volumes linked to their cargo movements.

“To meet the aviation industry’s climate targets, we must scale the production of synthetic SAF,” said Yngve Ruud, Member of the Management Board responsible for Air Logistics at Kuehne+Nagel.

SWISS said the initiative forms part of its wider decarbonisation strategy, which includes fleet renewal, operational efficiency measures and the increased use of sustainable aviation fuels.

The airline has worked alongside the Lufthansa Group, partners and customers for several years to support SAF deployment and production scale-up.

The agreement comes as EU aviation moves towards mandated SAF blending under the ReFuelEU Aviation framework, which requires fuel suppliers to deliver at least 2% SAF from 2025, rising to 6% by 2030.

Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS deepen sustainable aviation partnership

Kuehne+Nagel, one of the world’s leading logistics providers, and Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS), Switzerland’s premium airline, are strengthening their strategic partnership to accelerate progress in sustainable aviation. With the signing of an MoU, the two companies have agreed to collaborate more closely on sustainability initiatives, with a particular emphasis on innovative technologies that improve operational efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

At the heart of the partnership is a shared commitment to the use and development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced by Synhelion, a Swiss clean technology pioneer. Synhelion has developed a proprietary process that uses concentrated sunlight to convert biogenic and recycled carbon into renewable synthetic fuels, including solar jet fuel. By supporting this technology, Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS aim to contribute to the long-term decarbonisation of air transport.

To help scale production and accelerate innovation, Kuehne+Nagel, SWISS and its air freight division, Swiss WorldCargo, have agreed on a long-term SAF off-take arrangement. This agreement provides Synhelion with critical planning security, enabling the company to expand production capacity and continue advancing its technology. Such long-term commitments are seen as essential to supporting emerging SAF producers and driving wider adoption across the aviation industry.

From 2027, Kuehne+Nagel will purchase Synhelion-produced SAF from SWISS under a five-year agreement for use on its cargo shipments operated by Swiss WorldCargo. The arrangement underlines Kuehne+Nagel’s commitment to decarbonising global logistics while giving its customers the opportunity to actively reduce the CO₂ footprint associated with their air freight movements.

Together, Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS are positioning their partnership as a practical model for how airlines and logistics providers can jointly support innovative technologies and accelerate the transition towards more sustainable aviation.

“Sustainable aviation fuels are a key building block for making air travel more sustainable. They remain scarce and costly—which is exactly why we need strong partners,” says SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “We are pleased to be working with Kuehne+Nagel to implement the first commercial offtake of Synhelion’s fuel. This marks an important step forward and sends a clear signal that we intend to actively shape this path.”

The strategy emphasises clean cooking, cross-border energy trading, energy efficiency, innovation, and capacity development, setting the foundation for multi-billion-dollar investments across African countries, according to a statement the pan African bloc seen by APA on Tuesday.

The strategy was launched at the African Energy Efficiency Conference (AfEEC) that was concluded over late last week following the adoption of a communique requiring a collective commitment of AU member states to advancing energy efficiency initiatives across the electricity, industry, buildings, transport, agriculture and household appliances sub-sectors.

The conference highlighted that Africa’s target set out in the AfEES to increase the continent’s energy productivity by 50 percent by 2050 and 70 percent by 2063 as part of the global pledge to double energy efficiency improvements by 2030.

Speaking at the event, AU Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf emphasised the deep energy paradox for resource-rich Africa, where 600 million people lack electricity and 900 million still rely on biomass.

Energy efficiency is Africa’s first line of defense against energy poverty, capable of boosting productivity and cutting energy costs, Youssouf said, calling for urgent action to overcome the triple dilemma of energy security, affordability, and regional connectivity.

“Every kilowatt-hour wasted is a school not electrified, a vaccine not safely stored, a business not powered, or a job not created. Energy efficiency is an economic shield, an environmental safeguard, and a strategic pathway to securing Africa’s energy future,” said Chairperson Youssouf.

The chairperson further underscored a unified political will to build a reliable, interconnected, and future-ready energy system for all Africans.

2025 Reflections

Policy: 2025 was a pivotal year for the mandatory SAF compliance market in Europe. The blending targets under the UK SAF Mandate and EU's ReFuelEU came into effect, imposing (for the first time) a minimum 2% SAF blending requirement on aviation fuel suppliers with penalties for failing to meet the mandatory threshold.

Supply and demand: Regulation has therefore clearly boosted SAF demand in 2025. The market has largely been supplied by existing production of HEFA-derived SAF (i.e. first generation biofuels derived from used cooking oils, animal fats and vegetable oils). Notwithstanding this, the UK national average blending was still trending below the 2% requirement and the surging SAF price seen towards the latter half of the year (by more than 50% in recent weeks) signals that suppliers are scrambling to obtain available supply on the spot market to avoid a shortfall against the mandatory requirements.

Ongoing challenges: However, despite the implementation of the SAF blending mandates, announcements of construction of new SAF plants has been sluggish. The perception that HEFA-based SAF will be oversupplied through the rest of the decade may have resulted in delayed procurement. In the short term, this may have proved unwise and will lead to a change of behaviour as obligations mount. In addition, there have been other core challenges faced by SAF producers in securing third-party investment and getting their projects to FID.

Lack of FIDs: Such challenges include the funding of large upfront DevEx costs (often without a clear line of sight on FID), securing long-term offtake arrangements, the price delta between cost of production and the price offtakers/airlines are willing and able to pay (essentially the fossil fuel cost plus a limited green premium) and stable supply of eligible feedstocks. In particular, significant additional investment is needed to ensure increased SAF supply from PtL/e-SAF, noting the e-fuel sub-mandates that will take effect from 2028 in the UK and 2030 in the EU.

First steps government financial support to industry in Europe: The UK government's intention to implement a revenue certainty mechanism to support long-term SAF offtake at a guaranteed price commenced the legislative process with the introduction of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill into the House of Commons in May 2025. A summary of the proposed bill, its legislative readings and key points arising from Parliamentary debates was published in August 2025 and is available here. The Bill is expected to be passed by the end of 2026. The UK's Advanced Fuel Fund also awarded £63 million across 17 SAF projects in 2025 in an effort to assist with high upfront development costs and accelerate SAF production. In the EU, the European Commission published its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan in November 2025 (STIP) which promised increased capital for grant funding for SAF projects and signposted plans to launch an EU-wide double-sided auction for second and third generation SAFs. A summary of proposed measures can be read here. In November 2025, the EU's Innovation Fund also announced €2.9 billion in grant funding to 61 net-zero technology projects. Four of the winning projects are for e-SAF production. Both the UK and EU have therefore shown strong regulatory commitment to the acceleration of SAF production.

Book and claim: The voluntary SAF market also continued to grow alongside the compliance market, with airlines, airports and corporate travellers committing to their own decarbonisation goals, pushing demand in excess of the mandatory requirements. Book and claim models (which decouple the physical fuel from its environmental benefits) emerge on the voluntary market as corporations seek to obtain the environmental attributes of SAF (without purchasing the physical fuel itself). The launch of the IATA SAF Registry was a critical logistical milestone for the industry, providing the essential Book & Claim transparency framework needed for global corporate offtakers and to reduce double-counting risks. Book & Claim is seen as a key near-term mechanism to overcome infrastructure bottlenecks by enabling greater SAF production in the most efficient locations, the environmental benefits of which can be claimed in locations where SAF production/access is less feasible.

2026 Outlook

Project FIDs: To meet mandated 2030 demand targets, an estimated 5.8 Mt of additional capacity must secure Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2026 and 2027. It is essential that the pathfinder projects awarded grant funding the EU and the UK start to take steps towards FID, in order to come online in time for the ramping-up of the blending mandates in 2030. Lack of scalable alternative SAF production by the end of the decade threatens to make the mandates for e-SAF impossible to achieve and add penalty costs to suppliers.

Supply and demand: Expect HEFA to meet market demand for 2026.

Regulatory: The European Commission is required to review and assess the effectiveness of the EU ETS in 2026. It is anticipated that, as part of this review, the EC will extend the allocation of free SAF allowances to continue to support the scale-up of the SAF industry. The UK Revenue Certainty Mechanism will be progressed and we expect advancements to be made on support measures identified in the STIP.

Airlines, suppliers, producers and lenders grapple with new offtake models: Traditional offtake structures which have underpinned the financing of large power and fuels projects previously will be re-moulded to adapt to the market dynamics of the jet fuel supply industry. A certain level of market risk may be borne by projects which will impact on the debt capacity of those projects and ultimately the production cost of SAF.

Technological evolution: Spurred by strong regulatory support and a tightening of feedstock supply for HEFA, expect investment to continue to come into technologies to lower costs to unlock scalable feedstocks such as agricultural waste, forestry residues and municipal solid waste as well as PtL/e-SAF, without which the mandates will be challenging to meet.

The global commodity export market is evolving at breakneck speed.
If U.S. agricultural policy doesn’t evolve with it, we risk ceding leadership to competitors who are hungry for growth.","For decades, the United States stood as the world’s leading exporter of commodity grains, supported by a diverse base of global buyers. That era is fading. Today, China dominates as the largest purchaser of U.S. soybeans, and while corn exports remain strong, Brazilians have supplanted Americans as those who feed the world.

Brazil’s rise has been remarkable and intentional. The country produces soybeans at yield levels comparable to what U.S. farmers achieved back in 1978, and they’re achieving a similar rate of genetic gain as we do in the U.S. Every year, it adds acres, improves yields, and strengthens its infrastructure. This relentless expansion positions Brazil as a formidable rival in markets where the U.S. once held unquestioned leadership. Much of it is funded by China. According to the Brazil-China Business Council, China has invested more than $66 billion into Brazil since 2014. And that doesn’t include the most ambitious project; the $50 billion Transoceanic Railway. This project would connect Brazil’s massive acreage base with ports in Peru…on the Pacific Ocean side of South America. This would reduce the shipping distance to China by nearly 6,000 miles and completely reroute the world’s shipping lanes.

The vulnerability of our current system became clear when China sharply reduced soybean purchases this past year. That single shift sent shockwaves through U.S. markets, exposing how dependent we’ve become on one buyer. Worse yet, the long-term trend suggests this isn’t a temporary setback—it’s a structural change. If U.S. agriculture continues to rely on the same export-driven model, more farmers will find themselves on the outside looking in as Brazil and other nations seize market share.

The solution is building demand at home. Investing in emerging sectors like sustainable aviation fuel, soy diesel, and other industrial uses can create new, stable markets for U.S. production. These innovations not only diversify demand but also align with sustainability goals that resonate with consumers and policymakers.

Policy reform is equally critical. Farmers need better tools to adapt, such as crop insurance that covers more than just the major crops. Leveling the subsidy playing field would encourage alternative crops and foster resilience in a rapidly changing global economy.

The global commodity export market is evolving at breakneck speed. If U.S. agricultural policy doesn’t evolve with it, we risk ceding leadership to competitors who are hungry for growth. A recent report by the American Bankers Association underscores the urgency: more than 50% of U.S. ag borrowers are projected not to make a profit in 2026. That should be a wake-up call. Further proof, the USDA is set to release $12 billion in payments for “American farmers impacted by unfair market disruptions.” Is it unfair to the buy the cheapest supply or to buy from those you’ve invested in? These payments only further highlight the need for immediate change, as they are unsustainable and will only get larger.

Our system was built for yesterday’s world. If we don’t rebuild it for tomorrow, Brazil—and others—will gladly take our place.",https://seedworld.com/cdn/wp-content/uploads/20251216000253/AdobeStock_298919574-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-16 02:56:25.545256

The investment positions Azzera to expand the capabilities of its digital carbon-management platform, scale its international presence, and roll out new offsetting and sustainability tools for customers.

The partnership was formalised during Dubai Airshow 2025, signalling growing momentum behind technology-led approaches to aviation decarbonisation.

Alongside the equity investment, JETEX has entered into a sustainability partnership with Azzera that will see the private aviation specialist begin procuring and managing sustainable aviation fuel from early 2026.

This collaboration enables JETEX to integrate SAF into its international fleet for the first time, representing a significant shift in its operational strategy as environmental performance becomes a core priority.

Digital tools to unlock SAF adoption

A key element of the agreement sees JETEX acting as a lead partner for Azzera’s new SAF Productivity Operations and Delivery platform. Known as SAF POD, the tool is designed to address administrative and operational barriers that often slow the adoption of SAF across aviation supply chains.

For aircraft operators, SAF POD will be accessible through Azzera’s CELESTE platform, automating the conversion of digital certificates into verified emissions reductions and detailed fuel tracking.

The system also supports the issuance of Scope 1 and Scope 3 certificates, simplifying compliance and reporting requirements for operators managing increasingly complex sustainability obligations.

Azzera says the platform is intended to make SAF sourcing, tracking, and delivery more transparent and scalable, particularly for operators seeking to integrate lower-carbon fuels without adding operational burden.

Embedding sustainability

Beyond fuel management, JETEX will integrate Azzera’s FlyBeyond API into its charter sales ecosystem.

The integration allows real-time carbon offsetting and SAF quotations to be embedded directly into flight quotes, giving operators and customers the ability to make sustainability-led decisions at the point of sale.

According to Azzera chief executive Puja Mahajan, “The investment from and collaboration with JETEX demonstrates our shared vision of a future where sustainability is seamlessly embedded in every flight.”

She added that the partnership helps bridge “the gap between climate ambition and operational reality with practical tools that make sustainability accessible, transparent, and measurable.”

Supporting industry decarbonisation goals

JETEX chief executive Adel Mardini commented that the company views its role in supporting aviation’s climate ambitions as a responsibility, noting that partnering with Azzera aligns innovation with measurable environmental progress.

The collaboration reflects wider industry efforts to combine digital platforms, alternative fuels, and verified carbon markets to drive tangible emissions reductions.

The investment completes Azzera’s $800,000 capital raise, funding further development of its digital sustainability ecosystem.

This includes enhanced emissions tracking, automated compliance processes, and expanded access to high-quality carbon markets through the CELESTE platform, as aviation stakeholders face increasing pressure to demonstrate credible decarbonisation pathways.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/12/15/Jetex-Azzera_L_to_R_Adel_Mardini_CEO_Jetex__Puja_Mahajan_CEO_Azzera-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 02:56:32.671863

The project will be located within the Sokhna industrial and logistics zone, taking advantage of port infrastructure and proximity to major international shipping lanes.
Under the agreement, Shell will take the entire output under a long-term supply contract, with first exports expected within 18 months of project implementation.
The SAF facility will be developed in three phases, with total production capacity expected to reach 600,000 tonnes annually at full scale.
Shell’s involvement includes technical expertise, fuel certification support, and market access, drawing on its global experience in alternative fuels and energy transition projects.","Egypt has secured a USD 500 million agreement with Qatari partners to develop a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production hub in the Sokhna area of the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), with Shell acting as a strategic partner and long-term offtaker.

The SAF facility will be developed in three phases, with total production capacity expected to reach 600,000 tonnes annually at full scale. Over a ten-year period, the hub is projected to generate exports valued at approximately USD 15 billion, supplying international aviation markets across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, where demand for low-carbon jet fuel continues to rise. Shell’s involvement includes technical expertise, fuel certification support, and market access, drawing on its global experience in alternative fuels and energy transition projects. The company’s offtake commitment provides commercial certainty for the project, supporting its phased expansion and financing structure. The development aligns with Egypt’s wider strategy to position the Suez Canal Economic Zone as a regional centre for clean fuels and green manufacturing, alongside hydrogen, methanol, and renewable energy projects already under development in Sokhna.",https://cairoscene.com/Content/Admin/Uploads/Articles/ArticlesMainPhoto/1172448/bb7605b3-4b71-46c4-b04e-3d4ec77d0aaa.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 23:57:11.051258

The Ministry has been receiving project proposals for manufacturing of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from biogenic feedstock, for the grant of prior EC,” said the ministry’s office memorandum dated December 11 has said.
Accordingly, the activity shall be considered under item 4(a) [Petroleum Refining Industry] of the EIA Notification, 2006, for grant of EC,” the ministry has said.
According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.
SAF is a liquid fuel currently used in commercial aviation which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 80%.","“The EIA Notification, 2006 mandates prior Environmental Clearance (EC) for the projects/activities covered in the schedule of the Notification. The Ministry has been receiving project proposals for manufacturing of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from biogenic feedstock, for the grant of prior EC,” said the ministry’s office memorandum dated December 11 has said.

“As the production of SAF from biogenic feedstock involves processes similar to those listed under item 4(a) [Petroleum Refining Industry] of the EIA Notification, 2006, the sectoral EAC has been granting Term of Reference to such projects under item 4(a) of the schedule of the EIA Notification 2006 on a case to case basis. In this context, in order to bring clarity, the Ministry hereby clarifies that the production of SAF involves processes such as isomerization and cracking, which are analogous to those employed in the petroleum refining industry. Accordingly, the activity shall be considered under item 4(a) [Petroleum Refining Industry] of the EIA Notification, 2006, for grant of EC,” the ministry has said.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. This will require a massive increase in production in order to meet demand.

SAF is a liquid fuel currently used in commercial aviation which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 80%. It can be produced from a number of sources (feedstock) including waste oil and fats, municipal waste, and non-food crops. It can also be produced synthetically via a process that captures carbon directly from the air. It is “sustainable” because the raw feedstock does not compete with food crops or water supplies, and is not responsible for forest degradation. Whereas fossil fuels add to the overall level of CO2 by emitting carbon that had been previously locked away, SAF recycles the CO2 which has been absorbed by the biomass used in the feedstock during the course of its life.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/15/1600x900/logo/SAF-is-a-liquid-fuel-currently-used-in-commercial-_1765828644695.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 22:57:14.741141

The country, which has the world’s third-largest aviation market, is aiming to introduce 1% ethanol blending in jet fuel by 2027, raise it to 2% in 2028 and further to 5% by 2030. Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol had shared these targets in Parliament earlier this month.

India has already carried out trial flights using cleaner aviation fuel. In March 2023, Air Vistara, which has since merged with Air India, operated a long-haul Boeing 787 flight from the United States to India using fuel blended. In the same year, Air Asia flew the country’s first commercial domestic flight between Pune and Delhi with a fuel blend.

According to the news report, a long-pending policy on sustainable aviation fuel is likely to be released for public consultations next month, the official said, requesting anonymity.

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as a global market-based measure to reduce emissions from international aviation which require offsetting of emissions above a baseline value. Airlines can either use SAF or offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from ICAO approved Emissions Unit Programmes. SAF offers a direct pathway to emission reduction by lowering the lifecycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel. When airlines adopt CORSIA Eligible SAF (CORSIA Eligible Fuel) certified against ICAO’s sustainability standards and verified through Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV), they can claim these reductions as substitutes for carbon credits, thereby decreasing their offsetting obligations under the scheme.

The Centre is supporting biofuel projects through the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, which provides financial assistance for setting up plants, including those producing aviation fuel.

Under the scheme, the government offers interest support for five years, including a one-year repayment break, on loans taken to set up new ethanol distilleries. The support covers interest up to 6% per year or half of the bank’s lending rate, whichever is lower.

According to a news report by Zawya, the project, which will be developed across three phases, will span 100,000 square metres in the Integrated Sokhna Zone on Egypt’s Red Sea coast. The first phase is expected to have an annual production capacity of 200,000 tonnes, according to the cabinet statement.

The agreement marks the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, representing a milestone in bilateral economic cooperation between Cairo and Doha.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the project reflects growing momentum in Egypt–Qatar relations, driven by a shared political will to expand cooperation through joint investments and increased trade.

Egypt has been seeking to attract foreign investment, particularly from Gulf states, as it works to address high external debt levels and a widening budget deficit.

The agreement follows a series of major Qatari investments in Egypt. Last month, the real estate arm of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund announced plans to invest $29.7 billion in a luxury real estate and tourism development on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, the largest Qatari investment in the country since diplomatic relations were restored after the 2017–2021 regional rift.

Several states, including New York and California have moved to implement climate disclosure requirements over the past several months.
DEC issued draft regulations in March 2025, and received more than 3,000 public comments on the draft in its consultation.
The finalized regulation included a few changes, including extending the verification reporting deadline for the first two years, and reducing reporting requirements from facilities that closed or ceased operations.
Lefton said: “DEC’s greenhouse gas emissions reporting program and subsequent data collection is critical to the State’s ongoing efforts to protect our environment and improve the health and quality of life of all New Yorkers.”","New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Amanda Lefton announced the finalization of new regulations to implement mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions disclosure from carbon-intensive sectors, with reporting slated to begin in 2027.

The new reporting requirements come as the federal government under the Trump administration has pulled back on initiatives to provide transparency into corporate and industrial emissions, including plans to by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), and moves by the SEC to stop the implementation of its own new climate reporting rules. Several states, including New York and California have moved to implement climate disclosure requirements over the past several months.

Commissioner Lefton said:

“The Reporting Rule will enable DEC to collect the information necessary, despite proposed rollbacks on the federal level, and develop effective strategies that reduce harmful air pollution and direct investments where they are most needed.”

The finalization of DEC’s regulations follows a directive issued by New York Governor Kathy Hochul earlier this year to advance a Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, aimed at providing information on major polluters in the state, informing policies to reduce GHG emissions and to assess compliance with emissions reduction programs, and to help the state meet its emissions reduction goals.

Under the new regulation, facilities included in the new rules will be required to annually provide certain GHG emission data to DEC starting in June 2027, reflecting the previous year’s emissions. In addition, some large emission sources will also be required to verify their emissions data report annually using DEC-accredited third-party verification services.

Entities required to report under the new regulations include owners and operators of facilities in New York that emit 10,000 metric tons of CO2e annually, including electricity generation, stationary combustion, landfills, waste-to-energy, natural gas compressor stations, and other infrastructure; fuel suppliers including natural gas, liquid fuels, and petroleum products, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas, and coal; waste haulers and transporters with estimated emissions from solid wastes transported to landfills or combustion facilities outside of New York exceeding 10,000 MT CO2e in any year; electric power entities; agricultural lime and fertilizer suppliers, and anaerobic digestion and liquid storage of waste at facilities with waste imported to or generated at the facility generating 10,000 MT CO2 per year.

The trade group estimates that SAF production will reach 1.9 million metric tons in 2025, almost double the amount made in 2024. But that figure will fall short of IATA’s initial estimates for the year, and in 2026, growth in production is expected to slow to 2.4 million metric tons.

IATA officials placed the blame on “poorly designed” SAF-related mandates and policy frameworks enacted in the U.K. and Europe.

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation, for instance, has sharply increased costs, and airlines are now paying up to five times more for SAF than conventional jet fuel, the group said.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production,” Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, said in a statement. “Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course.”

The trade association said governments should focus their efforts on production incentives, rather than mandates, to increase the global supply of SAF and drive down prices.

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel made from nonpetroleum feedstocks. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, it can be developed from food and yard waste, woody biomass, agricultural waste, cooking oils, animal fats, and algae.

SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without requiring modification. Its use can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent.

Many airlines and private aviation companies now use SAF, and some have set targets for a gradual transition away from conventional jet fuel. IATA said that, as a result of increasing costs, airlines that have pledged to use 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be “forced to reevaluate these commitments.”

“SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition,” Walsh said. “These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered.”",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/shutterstock_2030568074.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 16:56:58.683224

Walsh also warned that the failure to accelerate SAF production will lead airlines with SAF targets to review their goals, noting that “many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments.
SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition.” Walsh added:","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the release of new estimates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, predicting that output of SAF will reach 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) (2.4 billion liters), nearly doubling the 1 Mt produced in 2024.

While substantially outpacing the prior year’s production, however, the new forecast marks a reduction in the IATA’s estimate for 2025 SAF output from its prior 2 Mt prediction, with the IATA noting that 2025 production will only account for 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption this year, and blaming the downward revision on a “lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities.”

Additionally, the IATA warned that it anticipates that production growth will slow significantly next year, reaching 2.4 Mt in 2026, or 0.8% of jet fuel consumption.

Moreover, the slowdown in SAF production growth follows the implementation by the EU and UK this year of new SAF-focused mandates, requiring minimum, and increasing, amounts of SAF usage, causing prices for sustainable aviation fuel to increase sharply. According to the IATA, SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets, with the IATA estimating that poorly designed mandates have led to airlines paying a $2.9 billion premium in 2025 for SAF.

IATA General Director Willie Walsh said:

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.”

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels. Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.

Walsh also warned that the failure to accelerate SAF production will lead airlines with SAF targets to review their goals, noting that “many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition.”

We need to increase the production by .01 million tonnes of green hydrogen by electrolysis. And we need around point 10 million tonnes of CO2 coming from the director of capture or from biogenic sources. But now if I put these numbers in comparison of what is the current production in the UK today and maybe you will be a little bit more shocked. So the current UK production of green hydrogen is not point not not 1,000,000 tonnes. So we are an order of magnitude. They're far away from what we need in 20-30 and if we look at CO2 that looks just a little bit worse.

The organization published its flagship cross-sector Corporate Net-Zero Standard in 2021, and is currently in the process of developing an update to the standard, Corporate Net-Zero Standard V2.
The new proposed standard was developed in alignment with the SBTi’s draft Net-Zero Standard V2, while also introducing new methodologies and requirements specific to power sector companies.
The new pilot follows the conclusion of an initial consultation on the draft power sector standard.
As renewable energy deployment accelerates and decarbonization becomes increasingly urgent, the power sector is central to the global transition to net-zero.","The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) announced the launch of the pilot phase for its new draft Power Sector Net-Zero Standard, inviting companies to test the proposed standard aimed at enabling companies across the power sector to set near- and long-term goals aligned with achieving net zero by 2050.

The SBTi released the draft standard in September 2025, set to replace its current “Quick Start Guide for Electric Utilities” with a new standard covering an expanded scope and a broader set of activities and emission sources across the sector’s value chain, for companies involved in power generation, transmission and distribution, and electricity storage, trade and retail.

The SBTi was founded in 2015 with the goal to establish science-based environmental target setting as a standard corporate practice. The organizations’ key functions include defining and promoting best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science, providing technical assistance to companies who set science-based targets, and providing companies with independent assessment and validation of their emissions reduction targets. To date, nearly 12,000 companies have set science-based emissions reduction targets with the SBTi, or made commitments to do so.

The organization published its flagship cross-sector Corporate Net-Zero Standard in 2021, and is currently in the process of developing an update to the standard, Corporate Net-Zero Standard V2. The new proposed standard was developed in alignment with the SBTi’s draft Net-Zero Standard V2, while also introducing new methodologies and requirements specific to power sector companies.

One of the key new criteria in the draft standard is a requirement for power sector companies to “publicly disclose a plan to transition away from unabated fossil fuel power generation,” which includes “interim actions to decarbonise, phase-out or retrofit unabated fossil fuel assets, with maximum 5-years milestones up to the net-zero year.” The proposed standard also requires companies to cease investing in new unabated fossil fuel capacity.

The new pilot follows the conclusion of an initial consultation on the draft power sector standard. According to the SBTi, key objectives of the pilot test include ensuring that the new standard and target setting tool are robust, clear and practical, identifying challenges for implementing the standard, informing the development of the final draft of the standard, and testing the feasibility of validating companies against the standard and the clarity of the requirements.

The SBTi said that it is inviting companies across power generation, transmission and distribution, storage, trading, and retail to take part in the new pilot, with applications to participate open until January 16, 2026. Feedback from the consultation and pilot will be used to develop the next draft of the standard

The SBTi said:

“Electricity underpins day to day life and the global economy—from powering homes and industry to enabling digital technologies and innovation. Yet, energy is currently responsible for more than 75% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. As renewable energy deployment accelerates and decarbonization becomes increasingly urgent, the power sector is central to the global transition to net-zero. Establishing a robust, science-based standard is essential for ensuring this transition is both credible and effective.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Electricity-grid.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 10:56:14.973352

With production potential placing Spain among Europe’s leaders, we outline key measures to create a competitive regulatory framework and foster sustainable investment and project development.

How do you see Spain’s biogas and biomethane market evolving in the coming years?

The updated Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (Plan Nacional Integrado de Energía y Clima – PNIEC) targets 20 TWh of biogas and biomethane by 2030. Yet, in 2024, production was only 319 GWh (according to the CNMC), underscoring the need for optimal conditions to attract investment. Although a growth trend is evident, the sector currently meets just 0.163% of Spain’s gas demand. In short, significant expansion is expected, given its early stage and numerous projects under development.

What are the main regulatory or permitting challenges for developers in Spain?

The absence of a dedicated biomethane framework is one of the main current challenges. Regulation remains fragmented and subject to inconsistent regional interpretations, complicating efficient project delivery. Developers must consider raw material proximity, network access, and social opposition, while navigating frequent rule changes on grid capacity and opaque processes for gas network connections. This situation, combined with the conditional injection capacity currently granted to such projects, further limits project appeal.

What measures could make Spain’s biogas and biomethane market more competitive?

Spain is the third country with the highest biogas production potential in the European Union (163 TWh annually), behind Germany and France.

To unlock this potential, Spanish lawmakers could:

(i) grant biomethane projects public utility status;

(ii) grant them preferential demand access capacity to the electricity grid without subjecting them to capacity tenders;

(iii) guarantee injection capacity into natural gas networks by amending current regulations that only allow conditional capacity; and

(iv) create a basic, specific, state-level regulatory framework.

Public authorities should also promote awareness campaigns to increase social acceptance of these projects, while developers should prioritise responsible, safe, sustainable and transparent development.",https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/white-with-accent/energy---gas-pipleline---teaser.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 12:57:29.097484

The project marks the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal zone.

Production is set to start by 2027 under a long-term offtake deal with Shell.

On December 14, on the sidelines of the Egypt–Qatar Business Forum held in Cairo, Egypt signed an agreement with Qatari conglomerate Al Mana Holding for an initial $200 million investment in a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production project. The facility will be located in the integrated Sokhna zone on the Red Sea and represents, according to Egyptian authorities, the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE).

The project will be developed by a newly created entity, Saf Fly, and rolled out in three phases. The first phase is expected to deliver annual production capacity of about 200,000 tons, including SAF, biopropane, and bionaphtha, all derived from refined used cooking oil. Al Mana Holding has secured a long-term supply agreement with Shell, which has committed to purchasing the entire output of the facility. Initial deliveries are expected by the end of 2027, providing early visibility on market outlets and reducing commercialization risks.

The agreement forms part of Egypt’s broader strategy to develop low-carbon aviation fuels. On December 4, the country awarded its first SAF production license to the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (ESAF), a subsidiary of the state-owned petrochemical holding company ECHEM, for a separate project in Alexandria.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who attended the signing ceremony, said the initiative with Al Mana Holding reflects the positive momentum in relations between Cairo and Doha. He noted that the project aligns with a shared political commitment to strengthen bilateral cooperation through joint investments and increased trade flows.

SCZONE authorities highlighted the project’s alignment with the area’s sustainability strategy. Its chairman, Walid Gamal El-Din, said the use of sustainable aviation fuel could reduce harmful emissions by between 50% and 80% compared with conventional fuels. He also emphasized the zone’s growing appeal for industrial investors, citing its infrastructure, diversified energy sources, and supportive regulatory framework.

Ranked 9th globally for FDI in 2024, Egypt is negotiating the Alam El-Roum coastal project with Qatari Diar to rival Emirati developments.

The rapid thawing of diplomatic relations between Cairo and Doha has crystallized into tangible economic metrics. Official data released during the Egypt-Qatar Investment Forum reveals that bilateral trade volume increased by 80% during the first ten months of 2025, reaching $143 million.

While this volume remains modest in absolute terms relative to Egypt's total trade balance, the trajectory indicates a sharp political pivot. This normalization was cemented by the announcement from Al Mana Holding, a leading Qatari conglomerate, of a $200 million investment to construct a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) plant. This project targets Egypt’s energy sector, leveraging the country's strategic position to supply green fuels to global logistics networks.

Qatar’s economic re-entry must be analyzed against the backdrop of massive regional competition, particularly from the United Arab Emirates. In early 2024, the UAE signed the Ras El Hekma deal, a historic $35 billion acquisition that stabilized the Egyptian pound and catalyzed a 154% increase in FDI inflows to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) region which includes Egypt and Ethiopia among 21 other countries.

In response to this Emirati dominance on Egypt's North Coast, negotiations have advanced regarding the Alam El-Roum peninsula. Reports indicate that Qatari Diar is positioning itself to develop this strategic coastal zone, a move that would signal Doha’s transition from smaller industrial investments to large-scale real estate and tourism infrastructure, directly rivaling the Emirati footprint.

The timing of these investments aligns with Egypt’s improved standing in global capital markets following structural reforms supported by the IMF. According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and local economic reports, Egypt ranked as the 9th largst recipient of Foreign Direct Investment globally in 2024.

This macroeconomic stabilization has altered the risk profile for Gulf investors. For Qatar, the current strategy is distinct from previous eras of financial aid; it represents a pragmatic pursuit of high-yield assets in a market that has been de-risked by multilateral support and competitor capital. The focus has shifted from liquidity injection to long-term equity in energy, logistics, and prime real estate.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/a3652e4158746dc599c29a8997eefa04_S.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 10:57:07.558401

The project illustrates growing Gulf interest in Egypt’s renewable energy and aviation fuel landscape as airlines and governments accelerate decarbonisation efforts.

The agreement was signed on Sunday and witnessed by Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly at the government headquarters in the New Administrative Capital.

The plant will be located in the Sokhna Integrated Zone and will be developed by a newly established company, Saf Fly Limited.

Boost for sustainable aviation fuel

The facility is designed to produce 200,000 tonnes annually of sustainable aviation fuel, alongside BioPropane and Bio Naphtha.

Production will rely on refined used cooking oil as feedstock, aligning with global trends towards waste-based fuels that reduce lifecycle emissions without competing with food supply chains.

Al Mana Holding has secured a long-term offtake agreement with Shell, under which the energy major will purchase the entire output of the facility.

Supply is scheduled to begin by the end of 2027, providing airlines and fuel distributors with a stable source of SAF from the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Madbouly described the project as reinforcing the Suez Canal Economic Zone’s capabilities in adopting renewable energy solutions, noting that it also supports the aviation sector’s transition in line with international environmental standards.

Strategic location and infrastructure

The plant will occupy a total area of 100,000 sq m within the Sokhna Integrated Zone. Of this, 70,000 sq m will be allocated within the industrial area, while the remaining 30,000 sq m will be located at Sokhna Port, enabling direct access to export and import infrastructure. The total investment of $200m is equivalent to around EGP 9.6bn.

Walid Gamal El Din, chairperson of the Suez Canal Economic Zone, said environmental sustainability remains a central pillar of the zone’s development strategy.

He explained that the project will reduce harmful emissions by between 50% and 80% compared with conventional aviation fuel, supporting both national climate goals and airline sustainability targets.

Gamal El Din added that the zone continues to attract investors due to its modern infrastructure, access to diverse energy sources and supportive legislative framework designed to encourage large-scale industrial projects.

Qatar’s Al Mana Holding has signed a $200m agreement to develop a large-scale sustainable aviation fuel production facility in Egypt’s Suez Canal Economic Zone, positioning the country as a regional hub for aviation decarbonization while deepening economic ties between Cairo and Doha.

The contract, signed on Sunday at Egypt’s New Administrative Capital and witnessed by Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, establishes the first Qatari industrial investment inside the zone. The project will be executed by newly formed Saf Fly Limited and will produce 200,000 tonnes annually of sustainable aviation fuel, BioPropane, and Bio Naphtha derived from refined used cooking oil.

A Strategic Industrial Bet on Aviation Decarbonisation

Al Mana Holding has secured a long-term offtake agreement with Shell covering the plant’s entire production output, with supply scheduled to begin by the end of 2027. Full offtake from a global energy major provides revenue certainty for the project and underscores the growing role of long-term purchase agreements in scaling SAF supply.

The selection of Waste-to-X company Boson Energy by NATO DIANA places municipal waste on the strategic agenda.
Boson argues that non-recyclable waste can reduce diesel consumption through electrification, cut gas dependence, and produce sustainable aviation fuel –without grid stress.
“Waste is a profoundly underestimated strategic resource hiding in plain sight” Boson describes waste as an overlooked domestic energy source.
We can do this at fossil-competitive cost, on attractive commercial terms,” said Jan Grimbrandt, CEO of Boson Energy.","Luxembourg, Gothenburg, Warsaw, Tel Aviv: Is a key to Europe’s energy security sitting in our bins and landfills? The selection of Waste-to-X company Boson Energy by NATO DIANA places municipal waste on the strategic agenda. Boson argues that non-recyclable waste can reduce diesel consumption through electrification, cut gas dependence, and produce sustainable aviation fuel –without grid stress. Resulting in a potential to replace some 440 million barrels of diesel per year at fossil-competitive cost and shielded from hybrid threats.

DIANA, Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, NATO’s deeptech accelerator, has invited 150 innovators from 3,688 applicants globally to the 2026 cohort. Boson is one of six ‘Energy & Power Challenge’ companies selected, to focus on resilient, distributed, and secure energy systems for civilian and defence environments – often referred to as ‘dual use’.

“Waste is a profoundly underestimated strategic resource hiding in plain sight”

Boson describes waste as an overlooked domestic energy source. Unlike large-scale renewable production that depends on extensive transmission infrastructure, its Waste-to-X units can operate ‘behind-the-meter’ on compact sites within urban perimeters – right where waste is produced. Boson also points to rapidly growing urban electricity demand from ‘Edge AI’ datacentres that must be located near real-time applications like autonomous vehicles and drones.

Large impact potential

Boson states that the 230+ million tonnes of non-recyclable EU waste by 2035 have the potential, if deployed in transport electrification, to offset all 440 million barrels of diesel consumed annually by EU trucks and buses. Or support production of 40+ million tonnes of SAF– roughly twice the 20–25 Mt EU mandate for 2050. Boson adds that waste heat recovered could replace one quarter of the natural gas used for EU household heating.

“Our technology and solution transform local waste into local energy, sustainable fuels, and even clean drinking water. We can do this at fossil-competitive cost, on attractive commercial terms,” said Jan Grimbrandt, CEO of Boson Energy.

Next, Boson points to the 6 billion tons of legacy waste in Europe’s landfills as an even larger long-term ‘virtual’ resource, representing the equivalent of 11 billion barrels of diesel – roughly four times the recoverable resources of Johan Sverdrup, Western Europe’s largest oil field. Boson also states the potential to at least one billion tonnes of SAF over time. The resulting heat could replace natural gas comparable to 10 times Romania’s new Neptun Deep gas field – the EU’s biggest.

Distributed systems driving local resilience

Boson explains that its standard Waste-to-X unit can convert 100 tonnes of non-recyclable waste per day into 100 MWh of fast charging. That is the daily waste of roughly 100,000 people and can power 300 to 400 trucks or buses without drawing from the grid. The company highlights the environmental benefits of diverting waste from landfills and incineration, integrating carbon capture, and avoiding fossil transport emissions. Clusters processing 300,000 tonnes of waste per year can produce circular hydrogen and CO₂ for up to 50,000 tonnes of SAF annually.

Commercial rollout under way

Boson reports that its core technology has been demonstrated at industrial scale using real municipal waste and that the first commercial projects are under development in France, Poland, Israel, and Australia – together with major waste management and energy companies. Boson works with Siemens AG and other partners to industrialise the solution for rapid rollout. Within DIANA, the company aims to bring understanding across the Alliance for the potential in waste and landfill mining.

Boson CEO Jan Grimbrandt concludes: “The world has a massive, untapped ‘sleeping asset’ in its bins and landfills. DIANA’s selection confirms that distributed generation from local waste has moved from a conceptually appealing idea to a strategic necessity, and we can deliver on that.”

Under the programme, the Government of São Tomé and Principe committed to critical reforms to the public procurement system, customs, and debt management.
The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), administered by the African Development Bank, finances this third phase.
African Development Bank’s Country Manager for Angola and São Tomé and Principe Pietro Toigo said: “As São Tomé and Principe presents to the global community its National Development Plan and approaches investors to power its private sector, these three financing agreements are a clear sign that the African Development Bank stands with the country as a provider of patient capital and risk mitigation”.","The African Development Bank Group and the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe have deepened their development partnership with $18 million in new grant financing.

Signed on Thursday at the São Tomé and Príncipe Investment Forum in Brussels, the three agreements will support energy, climate-smart agriculture, and integrated water-energy-food security.

The first agreement delivers $7.5 million for the third phase of the Fiscal Sustainability and Resilience Program -Supplementary Financing (FSERP-SF) – part of a budget support operation, launched in December 2023. This brings the cumulative value to $20 million to be disbursed directly into the national budget.

The programme drives reforms across two pillars: fiscal sustainability and energy sector transition. Under the programme, the Government of São Tomé and Principe committed to critical reforms to the public procurement system, customs, and debt management.

On energy transition – a top priority in the country’s National Development Plan – the programme finances improved governance of the national utility, tariff adjustments for cost recovery, and an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources.

This policy framework complements investment in energy transformation in generation and distribution infrastructure. The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), administered by the African Development Bank, finances this third phase.

The second financing agreement channels the Global Environment Fund’s (GEF) resources into the Co-Management of Climate Extremes for Agriculture and Fisheries Resilience Project (PRIASA III). The goal is to strengthen agriculture and fisheries value chains while deploying climate-resilient technologies to safeguard livelihoods against droughts, floods, and water scarcity.

With a total investment of $18.9 million, including $10 million in AfDB financing and $8.9 million from GEF, the project will be implemented through three components: enhancing value chains and socio-economic benefits, reducing vulnerability through climate-smart technologies and capacity building, and ensuring effective project management for integrated climate adaptation in agriculture and fisheries.

The third agreement is for a $1.4 million Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for the Water-Energy-Food Security Nexus under the NEW-ERA initiative, to drive sustainable development in the water, energy, and agriculture sectors.

Over two years, the facility will develop critical studies and master plans for integrated water resources management, including a multipurpose dam development, a water treatment plant, climate-resilience measures, and a city-wide sanitation plan.

The PPF lays the groundwork for future investments to deliver universal access to potable water, explore potential hydropower generation, and improve food production by 2030, while strengthening governance and stakeholder capacity. The project will create jobs, enhance ecosystem resilience, and support the country’s climate commitments.

African Development Bank’s Country Manager for Angola and São Tomé and Principe Pietro Toigo said: “As São Tomé and Principe presents to the global community its National Development Plan and approaches investors to power its private sector, these three financing agreements are a clear sign that the African Development Bank stands with the country as a provider of patient capital and risk mitigation”.

The report distributed by the APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB) stated that as of November 30, 2025, the African Development Bank Group’s active portfolio in São Tomé and Principe totals about $89.4 million, spread across 12 financing instruments, with an average age of 4.2 years and a disbursement ratio of 49.5 per cent. Its sectoral distribution is led by agriculture (43 per cent), followed by multisector operations (23 percent), finance (17 per cent), energy (15 per cent), and water (two per cent).

The Bank’s portfolio reflects a strong emphasis on resilience, food security, energy transition, and macroeconomic reforms, alongside growing engagement in the green and blue economy and financial infrastructure.

This technology empowers operators and their customers to make sustainable choices at the point of sale. This marks a significant advancement toward making climate action effortless within private aviation.

“The investment from and collaboration with JETEX demonstrates our shared vision of a future where sustainability is seamlessly embedded in every flight,” says Puja Mahajan, CEO of Azzera.“Together, we’re bridging the gap between climate ambition and operational reality with practical tools that make sustainability accessible, transparent, and measurable. Their investment and involvement will enable us to continue evolving intuitive technology to help our customers, partners, and investors support the global ambitions of reducing carbon emissions.”

Adel Mardini, JETEX CEO, adds,JETEX is one of the world’s largest private aviation companies, and we take our responsibility to support the industry’s ambitious climate reduction goals seriously. This is why we have chosen to partner with Azzera in advancing responsible aviation practices. Through innovation and collaboration, we’re driving meaningful progress toward the industry’s decarbonization goals.”

The investment concludes Azzera’s USD $800,000 capital raise, fueling further development of its digital sustainability ecosystem, including emissions tracking, compliance automation, and access to high-quality carbon markets through its flagship CELESTE platform.

Speaking in the Dewan Negara, Johari said the initiative is aimed at turning Malaysia into a regional SAF hub while improving investor confidence in the domestic industry, according to a report by Utusan Malaysia.

He said the government is making it easier for companies to obtain approvals for building facilities, producing SAF and exporting the fuel, adding that faster and clearer processes would encourage industry players to base their operations in Malaysia.

Johari was responding to a question from Senator Che Alias Hamid on steps being taken to attract foreign investors beyond offering tax incentives.

The minister said Malaysia is capitalising on its status as the world’s second-largest palm oil producer by using feedstock such as used cooking oil, palm oil mill effluent oil and other palm-based biomass for SAF production.

He added that efforts are also under way to increase public awareness about the collection of used cooking oil, while the government is studying measures to ensure that raw materials used for SAF remain sustainable over the long term.

Level 1 accreditation recognises airports that have defined their operational boundary and mapped their corresponding emission sources under Scope 12 and Scope 23 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, as well as compiled a latest annual carbon footprint report.

This achievement underscores RSI’s position as a pioneer in sustainable aviation infrastructure and marks the first step on its pathway towards reaching the highest level of accreditation (Level 5[1]) by 2027, in line with global climate goals.

RSI has been conceived from the ground up to set a new benchmark in airport sustainability. Built to LEED Platinum standards, the airport embeds environmental stewardship across design, construction and operations. Its modular pod-based terminal system allows capacity to scale with demand, ensuring that energy consumption remains tightly aligned to passenger flows. By maximising natural light and modular usage, this design approach significantly reduces the overall energy demand when compared with traditional centralised terminal structures.

RSI is also the first airport in Saudi Arabia to supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to aircraft, supporting the wider decarbonisation of the aviation sector. Complementing this, the airport is also rolling out all-electric ground service equipment.

To further safeguard the integrity of its surroundings, RSI’s growth is intentionally limited. RSG designed its destinations to accommodate no more than one million visitors a year at The Red Sea, and 500,000 visitors annually to AMAALA, ensuring development remains within environmental thresholds and natural carrying capacity. This measured approach reflects RSI’s role not just as a transport hub, but as a guardian of two of the world’s most pristine destinations.

Together, these measures position RSI as a global benchmark for sustainable airport operations, with Level 1 accreditation confirming its rigorous commitment to measuring, managing and reducing carbon emissions on its journey to net zero on scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2027.

Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former U.S. trade negotiator who spent nearly 30 years working on U.S./Japan issues, discussed the future of this partnership during a Nov. 19 event sponsored by the Clayton Yeutter Institute of International Trade and Finance.

“We're not going to go back to where we were on trade,” Cutler said. “I think we're living in a tariff world for the indefinite future.”

Cutler’s talk focused on the theme “What's Next for U.S.-Japan Trade?” Jill O'Donnell, the Haggart-Work Director of the Yeutter Institute, led the discussion with Cutler.

Mike Boyle, president of Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp., introduced Cutler after briefing the audience about his company and the extensive market connections linking Japan and the United States. Japan is the No. 1 foreign investor in the U.S. and in 40 states including Nebraska, said Boyle, a Husker alum with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. Japan’s total investment in the U.S. tops $819 billion and employs 968,000 people.

Japan is the No. 1 foreign buyer of Nebraska pork and the No. 2 importer of Nebraska beef and corn. In 2024, Nebraska’s exports to Japan totaled almost $700 million. More than 120 Nebraska companies are actively involved in trade with Japan.

The Kawasaki plant in Lincoln, which marked its 40th anniversary last year, has 3,000 employees making off-road vehicles, railcars, subway cars and large parts for Boeing aircraft. The 2.3 million-square-foot facility is the largest manufacturing plant in Nebraska.

Kawasaki’s Lincoln operations partner with more than 1,200 U.S. suppliers nationwide employing 22,000 people, and in 2024 the plant’s purchases of U.S. parts and services totaled $893 million.

The Lincoln plant also used $517 million in imported parts and materials, and the Trump administration’s stepped-up tariffs this year required the company to pay an additional $170 million in import taxes. The tariff costs have “really been disruptive to our business,” Boyle said.

Cutler said she regularly hears from U.S. companies that are holding off from making investment decisions due to the uncertainties generated by ever-shifting tariff levels. Ironically, American automakers haven’t achieved a significant cost advantage against Japanese competitors, she said, because the Trump administration’s 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have caused spikes in input costs for U.S. automakers and other domestic manufacturers.

Through extensive trade negotiations with the United States this year, Japan achieved a reduction to 15% in the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto exports, down from 25%. Japan’s agricultural constituency is a powerful political interest that will always push for trade protection, Cutler said, but U.S. agricultural producers will benefit from Japan’s new pledge to buy an extra $8 billion each year of U.S. exports including corn, soybeans, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

Japan also agreed to invest an additional $550 billion in a variety of projects in the United States. The arrangement is unusual and gives the United States great leverage in decision-making, but Japan’s commitment seems genuine, said Cutler, who served as the assistant U.S. trade representative for Japan, South Korea and the Asia-Pacific area.

If the Supreme Court rules that the administration acted beyond its constitutional powers this year in abruptly imposing tariffs under the 1977 International Economic Emergency Act, the executive branch will have other tariff-imposing tools, but they will be far more slow-moving and procedurally complicated compared to what the world has seen this year, Cutler said.

Just as the U.S. recently lowered tariffs on food items such as coffee and bananas, the administration will likely face pressure to provide additional exclusions on some goods, especially as midterm elections approach in 2026, she said.

The United States’ aggressive and ever-changing approaches on tariffs have given countries “a wake-up call” about U.S. unreliability as a trading partner, Cutler said, and many are pursuing bilaterial and regional trade agreements intended to shift their trade away from the United States.

“This could end up really biting the United States because these agreements will have commitments and market opening, but that will be reserved for the participants to the agreements,” she said. Over the long term, “we could really end up losing out if we don't find a way to integrate our economy more with other countries around the world.”",https://news.unl.edu/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image_teaser/public/media/images/CW0A0256%20E.jpg?itok=F-0Qcu05,N,,2025-12-15 02:56:38.484514

“The ban on internal combustion engines is history,” Weber commented. “We are delivering on our election promise: technological neutrality: combining climate protection with economic success.”

‘Create uncertainty’

Responding, the European Green Party said that it ‘strongly regrets’ reports that the EPP is aiming to weaken the phase-out of petrol and diesel cars, with co-chair Ciarán Cuffe saying that such a move would “create uncertainty, stifle innovation, and weaken Europe’s position in the global race for clean automotive technologies”, ceding leadership in the EV space to China.

“The 2035 zero-emissions standard is a cornerstone of EU climate policy, providing certainty for industry and investors while accelerating the shift to clean mobility,” he said. “The future of mobility is electric. The EU needs a real industrial policy and strategic direction instead of changing strategy every year, so Manfred Weber is acting irresponsibly.”

‘A grave mistake’

Fellow European Green Party co-chair Vula Tsetsi said that weakening or delaying the 2035 phase-out would be a “grave mistake that pushes Europe backwards”, undermining the EU Green Deal, creating uncertainty for industry, and slowing the green transition.

On top of the RIN credits that both biodiesel and SAF collect through the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, SAF also attracts up to $1 per gallon credit through the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit scheme.
For example, there is a proposal to introduce a stronger price signal for SAF production through the Energy Taxation Directive, which would provide a tax exemption.","Very few people want to give up flying. It’s how we stay connected with family, expand business opportunities and take holidays to relax. This makes scaling the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—along with other technological developments such as battery-powered planes—critical if we want to continue flying while trying to stop climate change. Without it, we risk significantly reducing, or even losing, our freedom to connect. First-generation biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester or FAME) producers who have the feedstock, capability and resources to switch to SAF production may hold the fate of air travel in their hands.

A Growing Market for SAF

Although SAF currently represents less than 1% of the overall jet fuel market, several countries including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Turkey and Brazil will introduce SAF mandates from 2026 or 2027. This will add to existing commitments from the United Kingdom and European Union. Meanwhile, several more countries are considering the introduction of SAF targets in the coming years. With growing global demand, supportive policy regimes and a significantly underserved market, now is the time for interested biodiesel producers to make the switch before feedstocks become difficult to secure.

With global SAF demand expected to rise 10-fold from 2024 to 2030, supply pressure on feedstock is already becoming apparent. For example, in late 2024, the Intercontinental Exchange launched a dedicated used cooking oil futures contract in response to rising demand, creating the opportunity for participants to better manage their price exposure.

Securing Long-Term Feedstock Contracts

When considering an investment in the construction of a SAF plant, one of the major constraints is the availability of feedstock on a long-term supply contract. Consequentially, existing biodiesel producers with contracts in place that can be diverted to make SAF start from a place of advantage.

The need for long-term contracts is further underscored by the changes we can expect to see in feedstock import and export volumes. Around 90% of the U.K.’s SAF is currently produced using imported cooking oil from China. However, with China’s plans to introduce its own SAF targets, some producers will need to begin sourcing alternate feedstocks closer to home. Altogether, having feedstock contracts locked in early in the project development process is essential for managing risk and optimizing project returns.

Financial Incentives Set to Expand

One of the key benefits of moving from biodiesel to SAF production within the next couple of years is the attractive financial incentives currently on offer, particularly in the U.S. market. On top of the RIN credits that both biodiesel and SAF collect through the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, SAF also attracts up to $1 per gallon credit through the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit scheme. State credits can also pay up to an additional $1-$2 per gallon for SAF. This brings total incentives for SAF to up to $3.50 per gallon more than biodiesel.

While in Europe there are no dedicated financial incentives yet, changes on the near horizon look promising. For example, there is a proposal to introduce a stronger price signal for SAF production through the Energy Taxation Directive, which would provide a tax exemption. The European Commission is also expected to release a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan later this year, in which industry bodies such as ACI Europe have called upon to allocate specific EU funds to develop SAF production facilities.

Although SAF plants are currently more expensive to build than an equivalent capacity biodiesel plant, incentive regimes, along with the premium price levied on SAF, make for attractive project returns. For most U.S. projects, the typical payback period has fallen to under three years, creating a compelling case for investment.

Technology Choice Significantly Impacts Project Economics

For biodiesel producers considering converting their facilities, a preliminary techno-economic assessment will estimate the cost of construction, the volume of SAF that will be produced, operational costs such as utilities and financial incentives available. Reusing auxiliary existing infrastructure from the biodiesel plant, such as housing, pretreatment systems and tankage, can reduce product costs by 20%-30%.

Currently, eight technology pathways exist to manufacture SAF, but the HEFA pathway (i.e. hydrotreating fats, oils and greases) offers the industry’s fastest payback and lowest total cost of production while producing comparable yields. This is made possible by the latest innovations which move away from traditional trickle-bed design, as well as opting for a modular build.

For example, Sulzer’s BioFlux technology is a two-stage liquid full hydrotreating process that first removes the oxygen from the oil and then isomerizes it so that the hydrocarbons resemble jet fuel. Rather than using a conventional trickle bed reactor design which is prone to hot spots, BioFlux uses a liquid full reactor design where the catalyst bed is completely submerged in liquid feed with hydrogen dissolved using a proprietary internals design, leading to homogeneous mixing. This significantly improves the efficiency and efficacy of the reaction, optimizes the volume of hydrogen needed and extends the life of the catalyst. In addition, the process has less equipment, so it is simpler to maintain and more reliable. For example, the traditional method requires gas compressors for recycling the vapor; instead, BioFlux eliminates the vapor recycle loop and gas compressors and uses pumps to move the effluent.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Cont1_BDM_1_26_8f5259cd8e.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 01:56:30.832273

Johari was responding to a supplementary question from Senator Che Alias Hamid on how the government plans to ensure a stable supply of raw materials to support the growing SAF industry.

Addressing concerns over feedstock availability, Johari said the government would move to halt exports of used cooking oil to safeguard domestic supply and would adopt a circular economy approach within plantation activities to ensure long-term sustainability of raw materials.

In a separate explanation, the minister said the government has also introduced a range of measures to attract both local and foreign investment into the SAF sector. These include streamlining approval processes for plant construction licences, production licences and export permits.

“The government will continue to assist and facilitate industry players interested in operating in Malaysia.

“These measures send a clear signal of the government’s full support for investors seeking to enter the SAF industry,” he said.

The announcement, confirmed by Egypt’s cabinet, marks the first Qatari industrial investment inside the zone and reflects growing economic cooperation between Cairo and Doha.

According to the government statement, the SAF facility will span 100,000 square metres within the Integrated Sokhna Zone on the Red Sea coast and will be developed in three phases. The first phase will produce an estimated 200,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel annually, placing Egypt among a growing group of countries investing in cleaner energy for global aviation.

The deal comes as Egypt continues its push for large‑scale foreign investment to help manage heavy external debts and a widening budget deficit. Gulf states, including Qatar, have become key partners in this strategy.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the agreement reflects “positive momentum” in relations between the two countries, citing shared political will to deepen joint investment and trade after years of turbulent ties. Diplomatic relations were restored in 2021 following the end of the 2017–2021 regional rift.

The new SAF project follows Qatar’s recent announcement of a $29.7 billion luxury real estate and tourism investment on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, the largest Qatari commitment in Egypt since relations normalised.

Regional Significance and Energy Context

The move aligns with broader global trends as nations race to create cleaner aviation fuels capable of easing pressure on climate commitments. The Suez Canal Economic Zone has positioned itself as a manufacturing and logistics hub for renewable energy, green hydrogen, and industrial projects with export potential.

The project also arrives at a time when energy markets are shifting rapidly. Gulf investors have increased strategic acquisitions across Africa and the Mediterranean to secure long‑term economic influence and diversify beyond oil.

TVOA Insight

Africa’s partnerships in energy and technology are becoming more strategic, and Egypt’s deal demonstrates how nations on the continent are positioning themselves inside a changing global economy. Africa is young, still building, and cannot be compared to economies with centuries of head starts. What matters is momentum, and deals like this show that African countries are not waiting for permission to enter industries of the future. With the right investment climate, youth talent, and cross‑regional cooperation, the continent’s emerging markets can shape cleaner aviation, sustainable industries, and new economic pathways that reflect Africa’s long‑term potential.

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is on course to produce one million metric tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2028.

Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani said this output will come from two domestic production facilities.

One plant, operated by Hong Kong-based EcoCeres, already has an annual capacity of 350,000 metric tonnes.

Petronas is building a second facility with a capacity of 650,000 metric tonnes.

“Once both plants are completed in 2028, total SAF production capacity will reach one million metric tonnes,” Johari told the Dewan Negara.

He was responding to a question on government plans to ensure stable feedstock supply for SAF production.

To secure raw materials long-term, the government will halt exports of used cooking oil.

It will also adopt a circular economy approach in plantation activities to guarantee sufficient supply.

Separately, Johari said the government introduced measures to attract SAF industry investment.

These include streamlining approvals for plant construction licences, production licences and export permits.

“The government will continue to assist and facilitate industry players interested in operating in Malaysia,” he said.

He added these measures signal full government support for investors entering the SAF sector. – Bernama",https://thesun.my/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uk-pact.webp,N,,2025-12-15 01:57:03.160651
