The demonstrative, 8,000-gallon delivery marks Avfuel’s first Midwest location to receive a load of SAF, which comes ahead of the 2025 European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) where innovation and sustainability initiatives take center stage.

“We’re proud to help lead the charge in introducing SAF to the Midwest,” said Tanner Overland, president and founder of Overland Aviation. “Our goal is to provide world-class services that support a more sustainable future for aviation—this special fuel load is an important milestone in that commitment.”

Joel Hirst, Avfuel’s senior vice president of sales, said: “This announcement represents an exciting step forward in expanding SAF availability and accessibility across the U.S. We were thrilled to work with Overland Aviation to showcase the viability of SAF’s expansion into the Midwest while offering the FBO’s global customer base a more environmentally responsible fueling option.”

The fuel delivery was further made possible by the SAF supply agreement between Avfuel and Valero Marketing and Supply Company (Valero), a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE: VLO). The neat SAF produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR), is made using the HEFA SPK pathway process, meaning it uses lipids—like used cooking oil—to produce the fuel, and can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel. With target blend percentages of 30% neat SAF and 70% conventional jet fuel, SAF can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 24% when compared to conventional jet fuel.

Overland Aviation at Williston Basin International Airport is perfectly positioned in the central U.S. and serves as a premier international tech stop, offering world-class service and competitive fuel pricing from its beautiful new facility. With a focus on delivering safe, efficient and affordable global-ready support, Overland Aviation offers U.S. Customs clearance (co-located in the FBO’s facility), quick turns in 30 minutes or less, comprehensive ground handling, aircraft maintenance and FAA Part 135 Air Charters.

The FBO is a true fee-free tech stop: free of landing fees, handling fees, security fees and infrastructure fees. In addition, ramp and international garbage fees are always waived with a fuel purchase—for which the FBO offers jet A volume discounts.

Attendees at EBACE in Geneva from May 20-22 can visit Avfuel and Overland Aviation in booth 985 to learn more about SAF and how it supports the industry’s commitment to sustainable growth.

Murdock family of companies.","VAN NUYS, Calif. / May 19, 2025 / AVIATION NEWS – Castle & Cooke Aviation, a premier provider of luxury FBO services, is proud to highlight its growing sustainability portfolio at Van Nuys Airport (VNY) as it joins forces with Avfuel Corporation—the leading independent supplier of aviation fuel and services—at EBACE 2025.

With a focus on operational elegance and environmental responsibility, the FBO is positioned as a go-to destination for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and clean energy advancements in Southern California.

Castle & Cooke Aviation VNY proudly offers SAF from Avfuel and the fuel supplier’s nearby production partner, Neste.* The fuel blend—averaging 30% concentrated SAF to 70% petroleum-based Jet A—provides a significant reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions without the need for aircraft or engine modifications.

“While SAF is not new to our facility, the difference lies in how seamlessly we can provide it,” said Tony Marlow, Castle & Cooke Aviation’s president of aviation operations and business development. “With close proximity to a Neste SAF blending facility and supply terminal, operators seeking high-volume SAF can count on Castle & Cooke Aviation VNY and Avfuel for quick, local access.”

In addition to its SAF capabilities, Castle & Cooke Aviation VNY has taken major steps toward more sustainable ground operations. The FBO outfitted the rooftops of its four largest hangars with photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, significantly reducing energy demand. Installed in 2019, the solar panels demonstrate Castle & Cooke Aviation’s long-term commitment to reducing its carbon footprint.

Complementing this renewable energy initiative, the FBO transitioned a significant portion of its ground support equipment (GSE) to electric-powered solutions. The current fleet includes three Lektro electric tugs, two Lektro charging units, two electric golf carts and one electric ground power unit (GPU).

Additional equipment, such as an electric baggage loader, is being evaluated for acquisition in the coming months. These updates reflect the FBO’s phased retirement of diesel equipment, replacing legacy systems with modern, low-emission alternatives as part of a broader, continuous transition strategy.

Furthermore, Castle & Cooke Aviation is now preparing to install electric vehicle charging stations across its VNY campus. The initial rollout—expected within the next three months—is aimed at air-side usage, catering to tenant and valet vehicles. The initiative aligns with California’s evolving transportation landscape and reflects the FBO’s foresight in accommodating the next generation of sustainable aviation travel.

Castle & Cooke Aviation’s sustainability efforts are matched by its unwavering dedication to world-class service. The VNY facility offers U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) clearance on site, making international operations both streamlined and convenient for its distinguished clientele.

“Castle & Cooke Aviation has always believed that operational excellence and environmental responsibility go hand in hand,” Marlow said. “We’re proud to offer an experience that is not only luxurious, but also mindful of the future of aviation.”Castle & Cooke Aviation welcomes visitors to the Avfuel booth (985) at EBACE 2025 to learn more about its premium services and sustainability initiatives at Van Nuys Airport, as well as premium FBO support services in Honolulu at PHNL.

*Neste MY Sustainable Aviation FuelTM is made from sustainably sourced, renewable waste and residue materials—such as used cooking oil. It is a fully approved drop-in fuel that, once blended with petroleum jet fuel, meets ASTM D-1655 specification for conventional jet fuel and performance standards under all operating conditions. This makes Neste MY SAF an optimum solution to directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft, requiring no new investments, modifications or changes to the aircraft, fuel distribution procedures or airport fuel storage tanks. SAF is the most effective way to reduce a flight’s carbon footprint. In the future, SAF could deliver up to 80% less greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle versus traditional jet fuel if used in its neat, concentrated form. Those interested in learning more about sustainable aviation fuel are encouraged to visit Avfuel.com/SAF or contact Keith Sawyer, manager of alternative fuels, at ksawyer@avfuel.com for more information.

In addition to a seamless supply of SAF, in 2019 the FBO installed photovoltaic solar systems on four of its rooftop hangars, significantly reducing energy demand.
The current fleet includes three Lektro electric tugs, two Lektro charging units, two electric golf carts and one electric ground power unit (GPU).

It is also transitioning its ground support equipment (GSE) to electric powered solutions. The current fleet includes three Lektro electric tugs, two Lektro charging units, two electric golf carts and one electric ground power unit (GPU).

Meanwhile, an electric baggage loader is currently under evaluation to further underpin the FBO’s commitment to decarbonisation, as do plans to install electric vehicle charging stations across the business aviation airport. The roll out of these charging stations is due to begin in the next three months.

Beyond offering customers an experience that is luxurious, Marlow added “its also about the future of aviation,” as he stated that “operational excellence and environmental responsibility go hand in hand.”",https://www.regionalgateway.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Castle-Cooke-EBACE-SAF-PR.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 14:56:58.970893

Electric Hydrogen’s innovative technology and modular manufacturing approach make the HYPRplant less expensive and more reliable than imported Chinese product, enhancing American energy technology leadership and competitiveness.
“We are very pleased to be working with Electric Hydrogen and have been impressed with the HYPRplant design and commercial package” said Robert Schuetzle, CEO of Infinium.
“This cutting-edge project exemplifies how low-cost, industrial-scale clean hydrogen production will drive new markets for American-made fuels and support the buildout of domestic manufacturing facilities” added Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO and Co-founder.
For additional information: Electric Hydrogen","Electric Hydrogen’s HYPRPlant is a complete solution that lowers hydrogen total installed project cost by up to 60 percent relative to other electrolyser solutions. The company manufactures HYPRPlants in the United States: its proprietary electrochemical stacks are built in Electric Hydrogen’s Massachusetts gigafactory while the chemical process modules are manufactured in Texas, drawing on strong local expertise from the oil and gas industry. Electric Hydrogen’s innovative technology and modular manufacturing approach make the HYPRplant less expensive and more reliable than imported Chinese product, enhancing American energy technology leadership and competitiveness.

“We are very pleased to be working with Electric Hydrogen and have been impressed with the HYPRplant design and commercial package” said Robert Schuetzle, CEO of Infinium. “Low-cost renewable hydrogen is a critical component to eFuel production, and the industry needs the kind of innovation and thoughtful execution we have seen from Electric Hydrogen.”

Once production begins, Project Roadrunner - expected to be the largest eFuels production facility in the world - will produce sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF), eDiesel and eNaphtha from CO2, power and water for the aviation, heavy-duty trucking, plastics and maritime sectors. The project will bolster American technological advances and bring skilled jobs and economic growth to West Texas. Many of those workers are expected to bring skills and expertise they developed in the oil and gas sector. The facility is projected to commence commercial e-fuels production in 2027.

“This cutting-edge project exemplifies how low-cost, industrial-scale clean hydrogen production will drive new markets for American-made fuels and support the buildout of domestic manufacturing facilities” added Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO and Co-founder. “We’re honoured to be selected as Infinium’s electrolyzer manufacturer of choice.”

Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst are financing partners for Infinium’s Project Roadrunner, making it the world’s first large-scale project-financed eFuels project. The project will supply sustainable aviation fuel over a 10-year period to International Airlines Group (IAG), one of the largest airline companies in the world through subsidiaries Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, LEVEL and Vueling.

This project announcement follows the unveiling of HYPRPlant, the announcement of Electric Hydrogen’s strategic partnership with Texas-based Titan Production Equipment and the company’s selection as Uniper’s exclusive electrolysis partner for the 200 MW Green Wilhemshaven project in Northern Germany.

Infinium eFuels provide an opportunity for energy diversification while leveraging the global infrastructure that powers the transportation and chemicals industries today.
In 2023, Infinium became the world’s first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi, Texas.
The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported to international markets.
Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of eFuel facilities both across the U.S. and internationally.","Infinium, the world’s leading producer of commercially available eFuels, announced today that construction is underway on its second U.S.-based eFuels production site, known as Project Roadrunner. The project, which includes investors Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, is located in Reeves County, Texas, near the city of Pecos.

The site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products for customers including global aviation leaders American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and other international airline brands.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,” said Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle. “Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors, and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

eFuels are synthetic fuels, produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy, that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in fuels are used in the transportation and chemicals sectors, seamlessly integrating with existing engines, infrastructure, and manufacturing processes. Infinium eFuels provide an opportunity for energy diversification while leveraging the global infrastructure that powers the transportation and chemicals industries today. In 2023, Infinium became the world’s first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The Roadrunner project reached financial close with investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and is now under construction. The project represents significant investment in the region and will support highly skilled direct labor jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics locally and across Texas. Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market.

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner facility will convert waste CO2 and renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel, leveraging new renewable power assets purpose-built for the project. The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported to international markets. Under a landmark agreement with airline group IAG, the eSAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under the recently enacted UK SAF Mandate which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK is sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

“The construction of Project Roadrunner represents a real step forward in the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer. “We’re proud to be an early customer of Infinium’s eSAF and working hard to procure and invest in SAF to deliver our 10% 2030 SAF goal. The aviation industry is making progress, but continued support and stronger incentives are necessary to accelerate production at the scale and pace required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”

Currently under construction, the facility is expected to reach commercial operations in 2027. Roadrunner has secured 150 MW of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement.

“We are pleased to support Infinium’s Roadrunner project, which reflects a significant step forward for an emerging new market for renewable electricity,” said Petter Skantze, Senior Vice President, Infrastructure Development for NextEra Energy Resources. “The United States has tremendous potential to use its abundant energy resources to serve global demand, and we’re excited to expand our investment in Texas to enable Infinium’s industry-leading electro-fuels production facility.”

Infinium selected leading electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100 megawatt (MW) HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production1. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner stands as a remarkable example of how next-generation technologies can rapidly evolve from proof-of-concept to finance-ready infrastructure,” said Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. “At BE Catalyst, we are proud to have partnered with Infinium from the onset to help shape this project, positioning it to attract the necessary infrastructure capital required to scale and accelerate the delivery of eFuels into the market.”

“Our investments in Infinium and Project Roadrunner are the first Brookfield has committed to sustainable aviation fuel,” said Laura Hellman, Senior Vice President at Brookfield. “We are excited about our partnership with Infinium which will help advance sustainability within the aviation sector consistent with the goals of our investment strategy.”

The Roadrunner project underscores expanded support for innovative solutions that meet the market’s growing demand for resilient energy supply chains, while decarbonizing and utilizing products that leverage the existing infrastructure and engines in use today. By enabling eFuels to be used as pure fuel or blended with petroleum-based products, Infinium solutions can be used to significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of the energy supply chain. Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of eFuel facilities both across the U.S. and internationally. This growth will not only contribute to the expansion and diversification of fuel market supply options but also offer low-carbon alternatives to augment conventional fuels relied on today.

Metafuels is collaborating with Evos to integrate the plant into its Rotterdam site.

Evos is a leading liquid-energy and chemicals-storage company in Europe committed to supporting innovative energy solutions.

This project builds on Metafuels’ expanding European footprint, following the 2024 announcement of Pizol—its planned production facility in Denmark.

The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will initially produce 12,000 liters (3,170 gallons) of eSAF per day, with plans for a second phase to increase production tenfold to 120,000 liters (31,700 gallons) per day.

Metafuels’ rapid growth is fueled by strong investment support.

In just over two years, the company has raised $22 million, including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, making it one of Europe’s best-funded SAF startups.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal is a dedicated multimodal methanol hub and the largest ethanol-storage provider in Europe.

It offers full connectivity across vessel, barge, truck and rail, with facilities to store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association specifications.

As a promising alternative to fossil fuels, renewable methanol plays a critical role in sectors where decarbonization is challenging, serving as a clean bunker fuel in marine transport and as an intermediate product in sustainable aviation fuel production, particularly within innovative eSAF pathways.

Metafuels’ aerobrew technology converts sustainably produced methanol into jet fuel with high-energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion.

The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 90 percent compared to conventional jet fuel without requiring aircraft reengineering or infrastructure changes.

“The justification for such technology is clear,” Metafuels stated. “The aviation sector accounts for over 2 percent of global CO2emissions—some 800 million tons.

When accounting for additional greenhouse gases and complex climate cofactors resulting from the nature and altitude of emissions, the sector’s total contribution to global warming rises to approximately 3.5 percent.

Aerobrew SAF plants can process biomethanol or eMethanol interchangeably, allowing the production of biobased SAF or eSAF, or both simultaneously, in response to market signals, according to Metafuels.

Biomethanol can be produced, for example, from biological waste, while eSAF uses renewable electricity and captured carbon to create synthetic fuels, offering a truly scalable and future-proof solution for aviation decarbonization.

The development of the Turbe plant is progressing steadily, according to Metafuels, with key milestones already achieved.

The next phase for Metafuels will be the launch of front-end engineering and design (FEED), followed by a final-investment decision (FID) in mid-2026.

The project aligns with major European sustainability initiatives, including RefuelEU aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, and other legislation aimed at advancing the aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.

Europe is expected to lead the adoption of synthetic or eFuels, according to Metafuels, driven by strong regulatory support.

Policymakers are relying on a substantial increase in eSAF capacity over the next decade, with the EU’s synthetic SAF submandate set to begin at 1.2 percent from 2030 rising to 35 percent from 2050.

“We have made excellent progress with our technology, and this first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward in its commercial deployment,” said Metafuels CEO Saurabh Kapoor. “We are very excited about our cooperation with Evos as we work towards delivering the Turbe project. Europe has ambitious decarbonization targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

Christiaan Kop, the managing director at Evos Rotterdam, added, “Metafuels is addressing one of the aviation sector’s most urgent challenges. With our robust infrastructure, utilities and operational expertise, we are poised to support the deployment of Metafuels’ sustainable aviation fuel project. This cooperation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the implementation of scalable, efficient solutions that will drive the aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.”

However, recognising that “the UK can face challenges sourcing investment into UK SAF production facilities, in part due to uncertainty over future revenues,” the new revenue certainty mechanism aims to “provide a launchpad for this sector to drive growth and investment”.

The mechanism builds on the DfT’s response to an initial consultation (which ran throughout March 2025), focusing on how a SAF revenue certainty mechanism might be funded. “The previous consultation response confirmed that the revenue certainty mechanism will use a guaranteed strike price (GSP), with the first tranche of contracts expected to be allocated to UK projects producing SAF using non-HEFA technologies and feedstocks,” outlined aviation minister Mike Kane. “A thriving SAF industry will drive economic growth, create good green jobs, and secure a domestic supply to meet the SAF mandate”.

The levy on aviation fuel suppliers (expected to impact some 20 companies) “may allow costs to be widely spread across the supply chain,” continued the DfT, adding that “this option is also less administratively burdensome than other options”. 58% of survey respondents agreed with this approach, with the DfT clarifying that “the levy will only be required if the price of SAF in the UK is low”. Without the revenue certainty mechanism, SAF production costs could be prohibitively expensive; stifling growth.

Notably, the DfT feel strongly against taxing alternative parts of industry (such as airlines, airports, passengers or ATC), believing that alongside administrational headaches, “there would likely also be challenges in differentiating airlines’ use of SAF from fossil kerosene and calculating market share based on other metrics could disincentivise airlines to increase their market share based on increased SAF usage”.

Additionally, the potential UK adoption of a similar scheme to Singapore (applying a levy on all air passengers) “does not align with the funding mechanism design principles of simplicity, affordability and fairness with market stability,” continued the DfT. Whereas Singaporean SAF procurement is controlled by the government, “the UK government is not currently set up to be a central SAF purchaser and supplier. Procuring and supplying fuels is currently effectively performed by industry and the market and there is substantial risk of government distorting the market by adopting this additional function,” the DfT added.

With legislation expected to be in place by the end of next year, the DfT will also work to ensure “that both the SAF mandate and revenue certainty mechanism interact positively to avoid unintended consequences or perverse incentives when designing the revenue certainty mechanism and its funding mechanism”. It noted that “collaboration with industry will be crucial in providing an effective revenue certainty mechanism as soon as possible”.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SAF-refuelling-at-London-Heathrow-2.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:57:21.225984

Once operational, the facility is expected to become the world’s largest commercial eFuels plant, producing up to 23,000 tonnes per year (approximately 7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other synthetic fuels.

A New Era for Clean Fuels

Project Roadrunner is a state-of-the-art “power-to-liquids” (PtL) facility that will convert captured waste carbon dioxide and renewable electricity into drop-in synthetic fuels—including eSAF, e-diesel, and e-naphtha. These eFuels are chemically identical to traditional petroleum-based fuels but emit significantly fewer lifecycle greenhouse gases.

The Pecos site repurposes an existing brownfield gas-to-liquids facility, adding new hydrogen and synthesis units. A centerpiece of the project is a 100 MW electrolyzer system supplied by Electric Hydrogen, which will generate green hydrogen on site. The system—Electric Hydrogen’s HYPRPlant platform—will be manufactured across Massachusetts and Texas in partnership with Titan Production Equipment.

Major Investment and Financing

While Infinium has not disclosed a precise total cost of its new facility, the scale of investment is clear. The project is backed by more than $275 million in equity financing, including over $200 million from Brookfield Asset Management and $75 million from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. Additional capital is expected from debt financing and monetization of U.S. federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

These investments make Roadrunner one of the most ambitious eFuels projects globally—both technologically and financially.

Economic and Local Impact

The facility is projected to have a transformational economic impact on Pecos and Reeves County. Infinium estimates the site’s assessed tax value will rise from around $15.9 million to approximately $180 million once operational—a tenfold increase that will dramatically expand the local tax base.

Also, the Infinium’s upcoming eFuels facility in west Texas represents a major investment in the region and will create highly skilled jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics—both locally in Pecos and throughout Texas.

Incentives and Support

To attract the project, Reeves County approved a suite of tax abatements, including:

60% ad valorem property tax abatement for 10 years, approved by the County Commissioners Court.

100% property tax abatement for 10 years on new project improvements, granted by Emergency Services District No.1, contingent on construction milestones.

Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) designation to support infrastructure development.

At the federal level, the project leverages IRA incentives for clean hydrogen (45V) and sustainable fuels (40B/45Z), with Infinium monetizing part of these credits through pre-sale agreements with financial partners.

A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary will supply 150 MW of newly built wind energy under a long-term purchase agreement to power the plant. Kinetik Holdings, a midstream gas processor in the Permian Basin, will deliver feedstock carbon dioxide via a dedicated pipeline from a nearby facility.

Customers and Market Reach

Infinium has signed long-term offtake agreements with global aviation leaders:

American Airlines, which will begin receiving eSAF from Roadrunner starting in 2026 under a 10-year deal.

International Airlines Group (IAG)—parent company of British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia, and others—will import eSAF from the site to meet sustainability requirements under the UK’s new SAF Mandate.

The EU Taxonomy sets out which economic activities can be considered “environmentally sustainable.” Until recently, aviation wasn’t included. That changed with a 2023 update that recognised certain aviation-related operations—like the manufacture or use of highly efficient aircraft, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending, and low-emission airport infrastructure—as eligible under “transitional” green criteria.

To qualify, however, aviation activities must meet stringent thresholds. For example, new aircraft must emit below a defined CO₂/km limit, be compatible with 100% SAF by 2028, and replace an older model on a near one-for-one basis. From 2030, flights using these aircraft must use at least 10% SAF to retain their “green” status.

Aircraft leasing, airport ground operations, and aircraft manufacturing are also included, but only when tied to demonstrable emission reductions or clean energy enablement. Notably, the taxonomy excludes private and business jets from green classification entirely.

So, what does a European sustainability checklist have to do with Gulf carriers?

Investors want green

While the taxonomy is EU legislation, it directly impacts the funding sources that many Middle Eastern aviation companies rely on, especially when dealing with European banks, leasing companies, or international capital markets. Under Europe’s sustainable finance rules, financial institutions are obligated to disclose how much of their portfolios are aligned with the taxonomy. This creates a strong incentive to prioritise clients and projects that tick the sustainability boxes.

That means a regional airline seeking to lease an aircraft from a European lessor or secure a loan from an ESG-focused fund may find itself subject to green scrutiny. If the aircraft, its operating emissions, or even the airport infrastructure it serves don’t meet the taxonomy standards, the financing terms could be less favourable, or unavailable altogether.

Conversely, carriers and operators that proactively align with these green standards could benefit. For instance, a new fleet of A350s ordered by a Middle Eastern airline could be deemed taxonomy-aligned if the aircraft replace older, less efficient models and support SAF integration. That would open the door to green bonds, lower-cost loans, and enhanced investor confidence.

The risk of inaction

It’s not just about access to financing. Over time, there’s a reputational and financial risk of being left behind.

Aircraft that don’t meet taxonomy criteria may face depreciating asset values as lessors and financiers avoid placing them. Airlines with older fleets may appear less attractive in investor disclosures. Even airport expansions may be scrutinised: is the project enabling low-emission operations, or merely adding capacity?

The taxonomy doesn’t just reward green alignment—it penalises misalignment by omission. And while Gulf carriers are not subject to EU compliance per se, being outside the “green” investment universe can erode competitiveness when fundraising or forming global partnerships.

Strategic moves for the region

The good news? The Gulf’s aviation sector is uniquely positioned to leverage this shift.

Carriers in the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia already operate some of the youngest, most efficient fleets in the world. Many are placing orders for new-generation aircraft that meet or exceed the EU’s emissions thresholds. With minimal adjustment, these investments can be framed and financed as taxonomy-aligned.

In parallel, several regional governments are ramping up their SAF agendas. The UAE has announced pilot projects for synthetic fuel, and Saudi Arabia’s NEOM is exploring green hydrogen production. These developments are not only climate-aligned; they’re also commercially opportune. With the EU mandating 10% SAF use by 2030, Gulf SAF producers could become preferred partners to European airlines and attract EU green finance to scale production.

Airports, too, can get ahead. Projects that prioritise electrified ground handling equipment, solar-powered infrastructure, or hydrogen refuelling capabilities are more likely to qualify for green funding. In an investment environment where ESG metrics are king, positioning infrastructure upgrades as taxonomy-compliant could unlock new revenue streams and partnerships.

A call to align

The EU Taxonomy may seem like a Brussels-centric initiative, but it’s quietly becoming a global reference point for what qualifies as “green” in aviation. For Middle East stakeholders, ignoring it is no longer an option.

Instead, regional aviation players should consider integrating taxonomy benchmarks into fleet planning, sustainability reporting, and financing strategies. Even voluntary alignment could yield tangible benefits, both in investor appeal and long-term asset value.

There’s a broader question here too: will the region develop its own taxonomy? The UAE is already working on one, and regulators across the GCC are watching closely. If they harmonise with EU criteria, regional compliance could become a formal necessity. If they don’t, market forces may still compel alignment.

In either case, the direction of travel is clear: capital is going green. And for the Gulf’s aviation industry to remain globally competitive, it needs to be green by design—or at the very least, green by association.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/05/19/espen-bierud-jGtUBwIAsA4-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:57:46.879377

The report, titled Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, provides a step-by-step guide for how businesses of all sizes—from hotels and tour operators to cruise lines and airlines—can contribute to a cleaner, greener future by adopting and promoting sustainable fuel use.

WTTC President and CEO Julia Simpson stressed the urgency of the situation. “Sustainable fuel is the most critical solution we have to reduce emissions in our sector. But the reality is, supply is nowhere near where it needs to be. If we don’t act now, we’ll see higher costs, restricted fuel access, and slower climate progress,” she said. “This roadmap gives every business a way to help. It’s time for governments to do more than set targets—they must support actual production.”

Currently, SAF makes up just 0.3% of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero emissions goals by 2050, that figure must increase over 400 times—from 1.25 billion litres today to more than 450 billion litres annually. Achieving that will require around 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), also essential for cruise lines and shipping, faces similar challenges in availability and infrastructure.

SAF offers a unique advantage—it can be used in existing aircraft and engines without modification. However, production costs remain high, and access to raw materials is limited. Prices are still up to ten times higher than those of traditional fuels.

To address these barriers, the WTTC-ICF framework outlines clear actions for industry stakeholders, categorising them as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. These range from simple steps like supplying used cooking oil or joining advocacy campaigns to more substantial investments such as funding SAF production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates.

Daniel Galpin, Managing Director at ICF, said collaboration across the sector is essential. “Reducing transport emissions is vital if we’re serious about sustainable tourism. While the aviation sector is making progress, the entire travel industry must now join in. Our partnership with WTTC highlights practical roles that companies can take to move us all forward.”

The report includes real-world examples of companies already taking action. In Asia, the Erawan Group is turning waste oil from hotels into SAF. In the UK, Jet2 has invested in a SAF facility that turns household waste into jet fuel.

However, the report also warns that inaction could have economic consequences. With several governments set to mandate a 5–10% SAF blend in aviation fuel by 2030, businesses that fail to prepare could face higher costs and reduced consumer options.

As the global travel and tourism sector is projected to generate $16.5 trillion and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, the push for sustainable fuel is not only about climate—it’s about safeguarding the industry’s future.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-5.png,N,,2025-05-19 11:58:03.530462

Метод ускорительной масс-спектрометрии базируется на подсчете количества атомов радиоактивного изотопа углерода С-14 в исследуемом образце.","Новосибирск. 19 мая. ИНТЕРФАКС - Ученые Новосибирского госуниверситета и РГУ нефти и газа (НИУ) имени И.М. Губкина (РГУНГ, Москва) планируют разработать стандартную методику определения биоуглерода в синтетическом авиакеросине (SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, получаемого из растительного сырья), с помощью ускорительной масс-спектрометрии (УМС), сообщает пресс-служба НГУ.

Отмечается, что в РГУНГ разработана технология совместной переработки лигноцеллюлозного сырья PCH-SAF, основанная на процессах быстрого пиролиза, замедленного коксования и гидрокрекинга, традиционного нефтяного и растительного сырья.

В качестве исходной биомассы используются отходы - опилки хвойных и лиственных пород, подсолнечная лузга и прочее.

""Предложенная нами технология PCH-SAF за счет уже имеющейся инфраструктуры позволит в короткий срок совершить переход на выработку авиационного биотоплива со сниженным углеродным следом без значительных капиталовложений. В случае успешных испытаний и подтверждения снижения углеродного следа необходимо провести допуск такого топлива при участии ведущих организаций ФАУ ""25 ГосНИИ химмотологии Минобороны России"", ФАУ ""ЦИАМ им. П.И. Баранова"", ФГУП ГосНИИ ГА для применения в воздушных судах гражданской и военной авиации"", - приводятся в сообщении слова профессора кафедры технологии переработки нефти РГУНГ Михаила Ершова.

Керосин, получаемый по технологии PCH-SAF, должен соответствовать требованиям ГОСТ 10227, предъявляемым к топливам для реактивных двигателей, и ничем не отличаться от нефтяных керосинов. Для производства SAF требуется сертификация и контроль за выполнением требований на минимальное содержание доли ""биоуглерода"".

В Центре коллективного пользования ""Ускорительная масс-спектрометрия НГУ-ННЦ"" впервые провели анализ содержания биоуглерода в образцах устойчивого авиационного топлива (SAF). В ходе лабораторного исследования были проанализированы четыре образца различного происхождения.

""Полученные результаты показали, что метод ускорительной масс-спектрометрии может стать рутинным методом анализа биоуглерода в авиационном топливе SAF"", - говорится в сообщении.

Отмечается, что биогенный углерод от ископаемого отличается изотопным составом - прежде всего, концентрацией радиоактивного изотопа С-14 (радиоуглерода) относительно основного стабильного изотопа С-12.

В ЦКП УМС НГУ-ННЦ в качестве ознакомительных или тестовых экспериментов из РГУНГ поступили четыре образца, из них два реперных (стандартных), представляющих собой керосин, полученный исключительно из биологического сырья, и керосин из ископаемой нефти, а также два образца керосина, полученных смешением первых двух в неизвестных новосибирским ученым пропорциях.

Из каждого образца было изготовлено по три графитовых катода и проведен УМС-анализ всех проб.

""Наши экспериментальные результаты совпали с расчетными соотношениями, по которым специалисты РГУНГ приготовили смесевые образцы, что подтверждает правомерность применения метода УМС для определения биоуглерода"", - отмечает директор ЦКП УМС НГУ-ННЦ Екатерина Пархомчук.

Как сообщалось, Международная организация гражданской авиации (ICAO) приняла программу компенсации и сокращения выбросов углерода для международной авиации (CORSIA), к которой присоединились 107 стран. РФ, Индия и Китай программу пока не приняли, однако с 2022 года все участники ICAO обязаны выполнять все требования программы CORSIA.

С 2025 года рейсы из ЕС должны использовать 2% SAF, к 2050 году эта доля достигнет 63%.

ЦКП ""Ускорительная масс-спектрометрия НГУ-ННЦ"" - единственный в России, только он располагает установками УМС. Метод ускорительной масс-спектрометрии базируется на подсчете количества атомов радиоактивного изотопа углерода С-14 в исследуемом образце. Ускорительный масс-спектрометр работает только с графитовыми мишенями. Поэтому образец органического вещества должен быть предварительно очищен и пропущен через так называемый графитизатор.

Предварительно из костей извлекают коллаген, из почвы - гуминовые кислоты, из древесины - целлюлозу, углекислый газ, растворенный в подземной воде, преобразовывают в карбонаты металлов, из органического вещества почв или осадков получают углекислый газ. Затем все эти вещества проходят многостадийную процедуру зауглероживания, или графитизации.

Morocco is rapidly emerging as a frontrunner in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production within North Africa and the broader MENA region. As the global aviation industry intensifies efforts to reduce carbon emissions, sustainable aviation fuel offers a tangible path toward decarbonizing one of the hardest-to-abate sectors.

Morocco’s strategic location, abundant renewable energy resources, governmental commitment, and growing industrial ecosystem collectively position the country to become the regional hub for SAF production and supply.

Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from renewable sources such as biomass, agricultural residues, waste oils, or through synthetic processes powered by clean energy. It can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a vital solution in the aviation sector’s quest for net-zero emissions.

1.Strategic Geographic Location:

Morocco’s geographic position at the gateway between Africa and Europe, along with proximity to the Middle East, is a critical asset. The country’s airports serve as key transit points on major flight routes connecting Europe, Africa, and the Americas. This prime location allows Morocco to efficiently distribute SAF to airlines operating within these corridors, facilitating easier and cost-effective supply logistics.

Royal Air Maroc’s pioneering SAF-powered flight from Marrakech to Paris in early 2025 highlights how Morocco’s location allows it to integrate sustainable fuels into high-traffic international routes. Morocco’s potential to become a regional SAF hub aligns with increasing SAF mandates in the European Union and other global markets that require minimum blending percentages of sustainable fuels in aviation.

Renewable Energy Potential

Morocco ranks among the global leaders in solar and wind energy development. The Noor Ouarzazate Solar Complex, spanning over 3,000 hectares, is one of the world’s largest concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, delivering massive clean energy capacity. Complemented by extensive wind farms across the country, Morocco’s renewable energy supply is both abundant and reliable.

SAF production, particularly e-fuels synthesized from green hydrogen, requires vast amounts of clean electricity. Morocco’s renewable resources enable the production of SAF with minimal carbon footprint, ensuring the fuel’s sustainability credentials are robust. By leveraging solar and wind energy, Morocco can produce SAF at scale without exacerbating fossil fuel dependence, a key differentiator compared to countries reliant on carbon-intensive grids.

Strong Government Support and Policy Framework

Morocco’s government has embedded clean energy and sustainable transport into its national development agenda. The Moroccan Ministry of Transport and Logistics has explicitly prioritized the integration of renewable energies within transport systems, aiming to boost energy efficiency and reduce emissions.

High-level commitments have translated into action, with Morocco signing significant renewable energy and green hydrogen agreements with international firms. For example, the OCP Group Morocco’s phosphate giant is partnering with French energy multinational Engie in a multibillion-euro investment plan focusing on green hydrogen, e-methanol, and SAF projects. These agreements aim to kick-start large-scale SAF production plants by the mid-2020s, signaling robust governmental backing.

Regulatory incentives and compliance with EU sustainable aviation fuel mandates provide additional market drivers for Morocco to develop its SAF industry. The government’s proactive role in facilitating industry partnerships, infrastructure development, and funding frameworks further solidifies its leadership ambitions.

Emerging Industrial and Innovation Ecosystem

Morocco’s industrial ecosystem is rapidly evolving to support sustainable fuel production. The country’s chemical and energy sectors are adapting to new technologies such as green hydrogen electrolysis and biomass conversion processes.

Notably, Swiss clean tech company Synhelion is exploring Morocco as a key site for its solar-powered synthetic fuel production. Synhelion’s technology uses concentrated solar energy to convert water and CO₂ into synthetic aviation fuels, a revolutionary process that Morocco’s abundant sunshine makes possible at scale.

The presence of strong research institutions and increasing collaboration between Moroccan and international companies fosters innovation, positioning Morocco to develop cutting-edge SAF technologies. This ecosystem will be critical to reducing production costs and improving the commercial viability of sustainable fuels.

Early Adoption and Demonstration Projects

Morocco’s early SAF initiatives validate its readiness to lead in this space. Royal Air Maroc operated its first SAF-powered commercial flight in February 2025, utilizing fuel derived from sustainable biomass and waste oils. This milestone demonstrated operational feasibility, significant carbon reductions (up to 33%), and regulatory compliance with European SAF blending mandates.

Such demonstration projects build confidence among industry stakeholders, attract investment, and accelerate broader SAF adoption. Morocco’s experience in integrating SAF on a commercial scale positions it as a regional role model.

Economic and Social Benefits, Beyond Environmental Impact

Developing a local SAF industry offers Morocco substantial economic advantages. It aligns with the country’s broader goals of economic diversification and industrial modernization, reducing dependency on fossil fuel imports.

SAF production can spur job creation in renewable energy, agriculture (for biomass feedstock), advanced manufacturing, and research sectors. It also promotes rural development by engaging farmers and local communities in supplying sustainable feedstocks like agricultural residues and non-food crops.

Morocco’s leadership in SAF could attract foreign direct investment and partnerships, boosting the national economy and enhancing regional competitiveness in green technologies.

Regional and Global Environmental Leadership

Morocco’s SAF ambitions carry significant environmental implications. The aviation sector accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, and its growth trajectory risks undermining climate goals. By scaling SAF production, Morocco can contribute to a substantial reduction in aviation emissions regionally and globally.

Morocco’s success can also inspire neighboring countries in Africa and the Middle East to adopt similar sustainable energy pathways, accelerating the continent’s clean energy transition. Its leadership in SAF production places Morocco at the forefront of Africa’s climate action efforts, strengthening its geopolitical standing as a green energy pioneer.

Challenges and the Path Forward

While Morocco’s potential is clear, several challenges must be addressed to realize its SAF leadership:

High Production Costs: Current SAF production costs remain significantly higher than conventional jet fuel, requiring technological advancements and economies of scale.

Infrastructure Development: Building the necessary supply chains, storage, and blending facilities demands substantial investment and coordination.

Feedstock Availability: Ensuring sustainable, non-food feedstock supply without impacting food security or biodiversity is critical.

Policy Harmonization: Aligning regional policies and securing international market access will be key to scaling exports.

Despite these challenges, Morocco’s strong foundational assets, proactive government, and growing partnerships provide a solid roadmap. Continued investments in technology, regulatory support, and international collaboration will be pivotal.",http://africaenergynews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMAGE-2-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 07:56:48.704507

Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, says he wants to see a clear path forward on tax credits for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production.
“45Z is a tax credit that goes to the producer of a clean fuel,” he says.
“To qualify for the tax credit, you have to be producing a fuel that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent.
For sustainable aviation fuel in particular, it has a higher value.","Airplanes are running on sustainable aviation fuel right now, and they want more of it!

Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, says he wants to see a clear path forward on tax credits for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. In order to make that happen, RFA needs some updates from the federal government, particularly when it comes to 45Z.

“45Z is a tax credit that goes to the producer of a clean fuel,” he says. “To qualify for the tax credit, you have to be producing a fuel that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent. As that greenhouse gas reduction increases, the value of the tax credit increases. For sustainable aviation fuel in particular, it has a higher value. So if a SAF producer is making aviation fuel that is net-zero emissions or a 100 percent greenhouse gas reduction, that’s worth a $1.75 a gallon to that producer.”

RFA wants Congress to give 45Z a longer shelf life — it’s set to expire in 2027 — so that the U.S. Treasury can make the ruling giving tax credits to SAF producers.

“We don’t have final rules on 45Z. All we have today is a ‘notice of intent’ to propose regulations from the U.S. Treasury, and that’s not enough for the industry to hang its hat on and make these huge investments, which are often hundreds of millions of dollars,” Cooper says. “So, we’re waiting for the Treasury to follow through with the next steps in that process, which would be a formal proposal and then ultimately a final rule.”

Cooper adds that RFA believes the final 45Z regulations must recognize the realities of today’s biorefining and agriculture sectors and the complexities of the transportation fuels marketplace. At the same time, final regulations must maintain an intuitive and manageable approach to registration, reporting, and recordkeeping that creates the kind of dependable value that empowers businesses to invest.

Welcome to the one hundred twelfth edition of the Japan FinTech Observer.

To receive individual articles straight to your inbox when released, please subscribe to the Japan FinTech Observer on its own website.

We are almost through earnings season, with mainly the three mega insurers scheduled for this week. So you will find quite a few highlights of financial results in this edition, and we are hosting a webinar on Tuesday, May 20, to discuss key developments. Registrations are open on Luma.

Undisputed highlights this week were (I) the Sumitomo Mitsui Card (Olive) partnership with Softbank (including PayPay), bringing together the leaders in credit & debit cards and QR code payments, and expanding Olive beyond financial applications towards super app status; and (II) Sony providing a detailed schedule and mechanics for the spin-off of its financial services business — the business plan for the standalone entity will be revealed at a later investor day.

Here is what we are going to cover this week:

Venture Capital & Private Markets: Acompany has completed its Series B round; AgeWellJapan has secured new funding; ASUENE has acquired 100% of the shares of NZero; new funds from MPower Partners and CryptoGames

Insurance: Dai-ichi Life Holdings has decided to make an additional investment of approximately 10.3% in Capula

Banking: ExaWizards has entered into a strategic partnership with Fukuoka Financial Group (FFG); Sustainable Lab has signed an agreement with Tottori Bank to cooperate in helping regional companies achieve ESG and sustainability management; Hitachi ZeroCarbon and MUFG have joined forces to supercharge the global transition to electric vehicles; Credit Saison’s Indian subsidiary has begun raising funds through External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) loans

AgeWellJapan has secured new funding; this round marks the first investment from the “Region, People, and Future CJS2 Fund” and UNERI Corporation, bringing the total amount raised to 310 million yen; moving forward, the company will focus on promoting business co-creation to realize an Age-Well society and strengthen talent acquisition

ASUENE has acquired 100% of the shares of NZero, a US-based climate tech company providing real-time GHG emissions visualization and AI energy management cloud services; through this acquisition, ASUENE will accelerate the visualization of CO2 emissions and implementation of reduction measures for US companies; by combining ASUENE’s achievement as Asia’s №1 in CO2 emissions visualization business with NZero’s top-class AI-powered energy management system technology implemented by US state governments, ASUENE will build a world-class decarbonization platform

JETRO has published an “Overview of Japanese Startup Investments for US Venture Capitalists”; the publication, coming out of JETRO’s San Francisco office, was prepared to dispel the prevailing perceptions among U.S. investors regarding Japanese startup investments; by describing the characteristics of Japanese startup legal practices from the perspective of U.S. startup legal practices, the publication aims to provide U.S. and international investors with a clearer and more detailed understanding of the Japanese startup legal practices

New Funds

CryptoGames, a developer of blockchain games, has launched “CG Ventures” as a new corporate venture capital business; to date, CG Ventures has invested in 17 companies, mainly in the Web3 field, where CryptoGames expects business synergy, but going forward they will also consider investing in the trading card field

Not FinTech

Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking (MUTB) has entered into a Preferred Shares Investment Agreement with Euglena in which MUTB invests up to USD 30 million in preferred shares issued by Euglena Sustainable Investment Limited (ESIL), Euglena’s overseas special purpose company (SPC); by engaging in a project to construct and operate a biofuel manufacturing plant in Malaysia through the investment in ESIL, MUTB will support establishing a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply chain and contribute to Japan’s decarbonization together with Euglena

Mitsubishi UFJ Capital participates in ARCS’ funding round: ARCS, which aims to automate assisted reproductive technology, has raised an additional 270 million yen following its 1st close of the Pre-Series A round (approximately 530 million yen) conducted on January 17, 2025, bringing the total for the Pre-Series A round to approximately 800 million yen

Insurance

Sony Group is embarking on a significant strategic shift by partially spinning off its Financial Services business; the motivation behind this move is multifaceted, encompassing a desire for greater focus on core entertainment and technology areas, enhanced operational agility for both Sony and the financial services entity, and an improved capital allocation strategy; the decision follows a period where Sony Financial Group Inc. (SFGI), a wholly-owned subsidiary, achieved operational successes after initially becoming fully integrated within Sony; despite this integration, Sony believes a spin-off is the next logical step to unlock further value and drive sustainable growth; Sony emphasizes that the Financial Services business, while valuable, has somewhat constrained Sony’s ability to efficiently allocate capital toward its highest-growth potential areas, primarily the entertainment sector (including gaming, music, and movies) and the image sensor business; these sectors are seen as holding the key to Sony’s future innovation and market leadership; by separating the financial services arm, Sony aims to free up resources to invest more aggressively in these core areas

Dai-ichi Life Holdings has decided to make an additional investment of approximately 10.3% in Capula, a leading UK-based alternative management firm with world-class expertise in fixed-income arbitrage, crisis alpha and global macro strategies, while agreeing to transfer all shares held by Dai-ichi Life International in Ocean Life Insurance, a Thai life insurance company, to the founding family of Ocean Life, who are the controlling shareholder

Sustainable Lab has signed an agreement with Tottori Bank to cooperate in helping regional companies achieve ESG and sustainability management; Sustainable Lab will collaborate with Tottori Bank to provide the opportunity to use “TERRAST for Enterprise” as a special benefit for the bank’s “Tottori Bank Sustainability Start Loan” program; companies using this loan will have the opportunity to visualize their ESG and sustainability management status through “TERRAST for Enterprise”

Hitachi ZeroCarbon and MUFG have joined forces to supercharge the global transition to electric vehicles by removing the technical and capital constraints to decarbonisation; in combining Hitachi’s technology and operational expertise with MUFG’s financial strength, fleets benefit from strategic EV guidance and support, and reliable access to low-cost capital that protects long-term asset value

Credit Saison’s Indian subsidiary has begun raising funds through External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) loans; the subsidiary has signed a contract to execute a 150 million US dollar ECB loan from Mizuho Bank, which is a capital participant in Credit Saison India; Credit Saison India has previously promoted diversification of its funding sources through borrowings from over 35 local financial institutions, as well as by issuing corporate bonds and commercial paper

The Bank of Japan has published “Recent Developments in Non-Bank Financial Intermediation and Initiatives to Enhance Its Resilience”, presenting an overview of NBFI’s financial intermediation, summarizing policy initiatives designed to enhance its resilience, and providing perspectives on issues surrounding NBFI through a review of the FSB’s regular issue of the “Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation” and its policy recommendations

The traps will be placed in 36 counties in western and central Wisconsin from mid-May through early July. Trap locations are determined according to a grid- and data-based system. Most traps will be set along public roadside rights-of-way, but some will require placement on private property in areas where new infestations are suspected. DATCP requests that all traps remain undisturbed once they are in place.

“Traps are used both to monitor known spongy moth populations and to identify new populations in previously uninfested areas,” says Amanda Miller, DATCP Spongy Moth Trapping Coordinator. “Even though spongy moth populations drastically decreased last season, the total male moth catches still set a record. It was the second highest in recent program history. Data collected from traps this season will be crucial in the program’s effort to pinpoint new populations. As well as limit their spread before infestations become large enough to cause damage to trees.”

What The Traps Are

Spongy moth traps are small green boxes stapled or tied to trees. The trap emits the scent of flightless female spongy moths to attract and catch adult male spongy moths. The lure scent is undetectable to other insects, animals, and humans. Although these traps catch adult male spongy moths, the primary purpose is to gather data to inform follow up control efforts. It does not have direct, meaningful impacts on the population of this invasive species.

Trapping staff will monitor traps until male moths stop flying. This usually occurs around Labor Day. At that time the traps will be removed. DATCP trapping staff are easily identifiable, wearing fluorescent vests and carrying identification. Each trap is labeled with a phone number and QR code that property owners can utilize if they have questions, want to report a damaged trap, or would like to request the trap be removed from their property.",https://www.q106.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2369128857-300x200-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 22:56:09.723265

Mr Charlton said New South Wales’ strong canola-growing capacity made it a logical location for establishing a domestic SAF manufacturing industry.
She said the government was “committed to providing the support” required to develop a domestic sustainable fuels industry.
GrainCorp crush plans SAF importer Ampol is also a signatory to a memorandum of understanding with GrainCorp and IFM Investors to progress domestic renewable fuels industry.
He said the work to develop a potential renewable fuels refinery at Lytton had “progressed to the pre-FEED study phase”.","QANTAS, Sydney Airport and Ampol have marked Australia’s largest commercial import of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with nearly two million litres arriving last week.

The milestone has underscored growing domestic demand for sustainable aviation fuel, prompting renewed calls from industry for Federal Government policy support to help establish local manufacturing capacity.

Proponents of domestic SAF and renewable fuel production, including GrainCorp, have highlighted potential benefits for the grains sector, with canola already used as a feedstock and emerging crops like carinata and pongamia showing promise.

In the GrainCorp half year to March 31 results presentation on Thursday, chief executive officer and managing director Robert Spurway indicated the company’s proposed crush plant would only proceed once sufficient demand was confirmed to justify the investment.

Record SAF importation

The record SAF shipment was imported by Ampol from Malaysia to its Kurnell facility on May 7 and is currently being blended with conventional aviation fuel before testing and certification so that it can be distributed into the Sydney Airport supply chain.

It will then be used on flights departing from Sydney Airport over the coming weeks.

Sydney Airport chief executive officer Scott Charlton said the airport accounted for nearly 40 percent of Australia’s total aviation fuel uplift, giving it “a big opportunity to be a leader in the development of a domestic SAF industry”.

Mr Charlton said New South Wales’ strong canola-growing capacity made it a logical location for establishing a domestic SAF manufacturing industry.

“NSW is uniquely placed to develop this industry, as a major producer of important feedstocks like canola,” Mr Charlton said.

“Most of Australia’s canola harvest currently goes offshore to be turned into biofuels by other nations.

“With the right policy settings at a state and federal level, and governments working in partnership with industry, NSW can become a global leader on SAF – creating local jobs, supporting local industry, and fuelling more sustainable flights in the future.”

Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson said the milestone was a proud moment for the company and the impact of collaboration across industries to achieve decarbonisation.

“We pick up 70pc of our fuel in Australia so we’re looking forward to working closely with the government to chart the next course for SAF in Australia,” Ms Hudson said.

“The alignment of industry and government will be critical to establishing and scaling an industry here.”

In response, the recently returned Federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Catherine King said the announcement was “a vote of confidence in the sector and a signal that demand is there” for SAF.

She said the government was “committed to providing the support” required to develop a domestic sustainable fuels industry.

“We made progress in our first term of government to develop a low carbon liquid fuel industry on our shores, and we look forward to building on that work as we build Australia’s future,” Ms King said.

GrainCorp crush plans

SAF importer Ampol is also a signatory to a memorandum of understanding with GrainCorp and IFM Investors to progress domestic renewable fuels industry.

The group is progressing the feasibility assessment for a renewable fuels facility, with capacity to produce over 450 million litres annually, at Ampol’s Lytton Refinery in Brisbane.

The MOU also includes working with GrainCorp to explore the supply of homegrown feedstocks, including increased crushing capacity for canola oil to the future plant.

GrainCorp is currently targeting a front-end engineering design phase in 2026, but this would be subject to favourable policy to accelerate supply and demand of low-carbon liquid fuels.

During the HY25 announcement, Mr Spurway noted the announcement by Qantas, Ampol and Sydney Airport commenting that this demonstrated the presence of demand from SAF consumers.

“It makes absolute sense over the medium term to see that demand manufactured in Australia, which will provide better economic outcomes, better carbon intensity outcomes and the opportunity for investment and job creation in Australia,” Mr Spurway said.

“We have an existing MOU with our partners in Ampol, IFM and we continue to work together with them on the deliverables of that MOU, particularly around developing an opportunity for supply to Ampol in the event that they convert the refinery in Brisbane to process renewable fuels.

“This also requires bringing many parts of the industry together, including having the right government policy frameworks in place.

“As we’ve always said, GrainCorp’s investment in a future crush plant will be reliant on the demand being in place.”

Mr Halliday echoed the calls for Federal Government intervention or signals during Ampol’s annual general meeting held on Thursday.

He said the work to develop a potential renewable fuels refinery at Lytton had “progressed to the pre-FEED study phase”.

“As is the case in other countries, the establishment of a renewable fuels industry in Australia requires effective policy to support both local demand and local supply, and this is an area we will continue to work on with government, together with our partners and our customers.”",https://www.graincentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sustainable_Aviation_Fuel_SAF_STI_Marvel_Oil_Tanker_Kurnell_Kurt_Ams_070525_DSC01008-scaled-e1747282831641.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 20:56:09.382787

This season marks a significant advancement in the sport’s environmental efforts, building on trials from previous years.

Renewable energy system will power the pit and paddock areas, while both the Formula 2 and Formula 3 championships will continue to run on 100% advanced sustainable fuel, setting the stage for Formula 1 cars to use these fuels by 2026.

Commenting on the transition, head of ESG at Formula 1, Ellen Jones, said: “It is incredibly exciting to see our alternative fuel strategy deliver significant carbon reductions across the European season and beyond.”

“We remain on track to be Net Zero by 2030, and it is new technologies and innovations such as this that will see us hit our goal.

“Working with our partners, as well as all of our teams and the FIA, the sport is proving that you can grow sustainably, with no compromise to our on-track product or fan experience,” Jones said.

The Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix featured a new low-carbon energy system in the paddock, with the initiative expected to cut carbon emissions from energy use by about 90%.

This system is being put in place with Formula 1’s partner, Aggreko, after successful tests at the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix and similar events in Hungary and Italy in 2024.

These trials showed big drops in carbon emissions in key areas like the paddock and pit lane.

The new energy solution for the paddock centralises power from renewable sources including hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar energy, and battery energy storage systems (BESS).

This means Formula 1, its ten teams, and the FIA no longer need individual generators, leading to significant carbon reductions and less pollution from transportation.

On the other note, DHL’s biofuel trucks will also play a big role in Europe, further boosting Formula 1’s sustainability efforts by using more alternative fuels, these trucks achieved an average emission reduction of 83% compared to regular fuels during European races.

The fuel being developed is designed to be a “drop-in” option, meaning it can be used in existing road vehicles without any changes, offering a sustainable choice with global implications.

Lastly, Formula 1’s proactive alternative fuel strategy has been key to its ongoing efforts to cut carbon emissions.

Last year, the sport invested a lot in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which led to an estimated 80% reduction in carbon emissions per flight compared to traditional aviation fuels.

Working with global partners like DHL and Qatar Airways, Formula 1 has collectively cut over 8,000 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) across flyaway events in the 2024 season, representing an approximate 19% decrease in total emissions from conventional aviation fuel.",https://ministryofsport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DHL-Biofuel-Trucks-169.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 20:56:13.397900

But for the first time in decades, Malaysia has an industrial strategy with teeth, torque, and timing.","If you want to understand how Malaysia is trying to future-proof its economy in the postpandemic era, don’t look at GDP charts or trade figures—look at how it’s rethinking its industrial playbook.

In fact, Kuala Lumpur is doing something that would make the ghost of Billy Joel’s Allentown blink twice: it’s throwing out the old industrial-growth ladder and trying to build a new one—faster, greener, and smarter.

Five big strategies are leading the charge, and together, they reveal how Malaysia hopes to sidestep the fate of mid-income stagnation and premature deindustrialisation.

NIMP 2030

Start with the New Industrial Master Plan 2030—the nerve center of the whole policy machine. It’s Malaysia’s first mission-based industrial strategy, and it reads more like a tech company’s OKRs than a government white paper.

Four big missions—boost complexity, tech-up the economy, go net-zero, and secure inclusive growth—are broken down into 62 actionable plans and a portfolio of nine “mission-based projects,” including a locally-made EV.

The headline target: grow manufacturing GDP by 6.5% annually and raise total manufacturing value-added to RM587.5 billion by 2030. Think aerospace, specialty chemicals, EV components, semiconductors.

And to get there, Malaysia aims to retrofit 3,000 factories into smart, Industry 4.0 facilities. This is not your grandfather’s industrial plan—it’s a moonshot.

But the plan doesn’t fly without chips—semiconductors, that is. Enter the National Semiconductor Strategy, launched in 2024.

Malaysia already sits at the heart of global back-end chip assembly (OSAT), but the real money—and strategic leverage—is in moving up the value chain: advanced packaging, wafer fabs, even IC design.

The NSS is Malaysia’s bid to become the Switzerland of silicon: neutral, reliable, and indispensable. Backed by RM25 billion in fiscal incentives, the goal is to draw RM500 billion in total investments and nurture at least ten Malaysian chip design or packaging firms that can break RM1 billion in annual revenue. Alongside this? Training 60,000 engineers.

The message to Intel, Nvidia, and TSMC is clear: if you’re decoupling from China, you’re welcome in Penang.

All of this, of course, requires a massive digital backbone—which is where MyDIGITAL and the Industry4WRD masterplan come in. These initiatives aim to digitize the entire economy —factories, farms, finance, and everything in between.

Targets include lifting the digital economy to 22.6% of GDP, getting 875,000 MSMEs online, and creating half a million

digital jobs by the end of the decade.

Phase Three (2026–2030) is about embedding AI, robotics, and cybersecurity into real economic sectors—especially manufacturing. The pandemic turned this into a necessity. Years of digital transformation happened in just months.

Malaysia’s challenge now is making sure its smallest firms don’t get left behind on the wrong side of the analogue divide.

EV

Then comes the Electric Vehicle and Smart Mobility Agenda, driven by a suite of overlapping frameworks: the National Automotive Policy 2020, the Low-Carbon Mobility Blueprint, and NIMP’s EV missions. By 2030, Malaysia wants EVs and hybrids to make up 15–20% of new vehicle sales, with a long-term goal of 80% by 2050.

To get there, it’s not just about charging stations—it’s about creating an EV manufacturing ecosystem: battery assembly, power electronics (linking back to the chip strategy), and recycling infrastructure. In a world rushing to electrify, Malaysia wants to be more than a market—it wants to be a maker.

Finally, we get to the green engine of the whole transition: the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR).

Think of it as Malaysia’s way of turning climate pressure into an industrial opportunity. The plan lays out RM 120–180 billion in green-industry investments by 2030, tied to flagship projects in solar-PV manufacturing, sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, and grid-scale energy storage.

If successful, this strategy could add RM220 billion to GDP by 2050 and create over 300,000 jobs. Malaysia is already the world’s third-largest solar module exporter—now it’s trying to replicate that industrial success in next-gen clean tech.

What makes all five of these plans work together isn’t just good timing—it’s good crossstitching.

Talent pipelines from the NSS feed directly into MyDIGITAL and NETR. Industrial clusters from NIMP interlock with EV and chip strategies. The digital and green agendas reinforce each other: solar-powered factories that run on AI-optimized workflows are no longer science fiction—they’re industrial policy.

And perhaps most importantly, Malaysia is signaling a predictable investment environment—an antidote to the pandemic-era global scramble for resilience and redundancy.

The bottom line? Malaysia is betting big on “high-tech, green-tech, and supply-chain resilience” to keep its industrial base not just alive, but competitive.

The risk of failure is real—execution remains the Achilles’ heel of even the best-designed plans. But for the first time in decades, Malaysia has an industrial strategy with teeth, torque, and timing. And in a post-Allentown world, that could make all the difference. - DagangNews.com

The integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends into heavy-fuel aircraft piston engines (HF-APE) presents significant potential for decarbonizing general aviation propulsion systems. This study systematically investigates gaseous and particulate emissions to advance sustainable aviation and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies. A hybrid experimental and simulation methodology was employed to assess combustion characteristics and emission behavior in HF-APE fueled with SAF-biodiesel and SAF-RP-3 blends. Emission measurements, conducted in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 16 standards, utilized high-precision instrumentation across a range of engine speeds. The simulation framework was meticulously calibrated and validated, demonstrating strong correlation with experimental results in predicting combustion behavior, flow dynamics, and emission profiles. Experimentally, the 50% SAF + 50% RP-3 blend exhibited the most favorable emission characteristics, achieving up to 63% and 75% reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, respectively, relative to biodiesel-rich blends, while the 30% SAF + 70% Biodiesel blend exhibited up to 19% higher nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) emissions. Particle size distribution (PSD) analysis revealed that RP-3 blends reduced nucleation-mode particle concentrations by 30–40%, with total particulate matter (PM) number emissions (EIntotal) decreasing by approximately 38%. Microscopic evaluation confirmed smaller, less porous particulate structures for RP-3 blends, indicative of improved combustion completeness. Simulations further demonstrated that 50% SAF + 50% RP-3 achieved the highest intake (~10.7 g/s) and exhaust (~13.8 g/s) mass flow rates, along with superior cylinder performance, reaching ~81 kW brake power, ~230 g/kWh brake-specific fuel consumption, and a 28% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions at elevated speeds. Overall, 50% SAF + 50% RP-3 and 30% SAF + 70% RP-3 emerged as the most promising blends for enhancing HF-APE efficiency and environmental performance. Minor discrepancies between simulation and experimental results, particularly in CO, CO₂, and HC emission levels, were attributed to inherent modeling assumptions, yet the simulation reliably captured overall engine behavior.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-05-18 22:56:19.062668

In the Asia-Pacific region, China’s government policies continue to support GTL demonstration plants, focusing on monetizing domestic coal and natural gas resources through catalysis advancements. Chinese manufacturers, including China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group, are ramping up efforts to commercialize more robust and sulfur-tolerant catalysts, in line with national clean fuels strategies.

From an investment perspective, 2025 sees established energy majors and new entrants forming partnerships to de-risk capital outlays and accelerate commercialization. Eni, for example, has announced collaboration with engineering firms and technology licensors to scale up its proprietary GTL catalyst systems, targeting both large-scale and distributed applications in regions with stranded gas assets. Investments are increasingly targeting modular GTL units, which offer lower upfront capital requirements and greater siting flexibility.

Policy frameworks in the European Union are also driving GTL innovation. The EU’s Renewable Energy Directive and associated funding mechanisms are stimulating R&D into integrating biogas and CO2-derived feedstocks with GTL catalysis, aiming for net-zero synthetic fuels (European Commission Directorate-General for Energy).

Looking ahead, strong policy tailwinds and strategic investments are expected to further boost GTL catalysis engineering over the next several years. Emphasis is likely to remain on catalyst durability, efficiency, and the lowering of process carbon intensity, while government-backed pilot projects and public-private partnerships will play a pivotal role in scaling up innovations from lab to commercial scale.

End-Use Applications: Transportation, Power, and Chemicals

Gas-to-liquids (GTL) catalysis engineering is entering a pivotal phase as end-use applications expand in response to decarbonization and energy security agendas worldwide. In 2025 and the coming years, the most significant drivers for GTL deployment are the transportation, power generation, and chemicals sectors, each leveraging advancements in catalysis for tailored, cleaner fuels and feedstocks.

In transportation, GTL-derived synthetic diesel and jet fuels are gaining traction due to their ultra-low sulfur content and favorable combustion characteristics. Major GTL projects, such as the Pearl GTL plant operated by Shell in Qatar, continue to supply significant volumes of GTL diesel and lubricants that meet stringent emissions regulations. The aviation sector is particularly interested in GTL-based synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK), an approved drop-in fuel for commercial flights. Qatar Airways has participated in demonstration flights utilizing GTL jet fuel, highlighting its role in reducing particulate and sulfur emissions.

For power generation, GTL naphtha and diesel are being explored as alternatives to conventional fuels, especially in regions where natural gas is abundant but infrastructure for direct use is lacking. GTL fuels burn cleaner, reducing NOx and particulate emissions in turbines and engines. Sasol continues to operate large-scale GTL facilities in South Africa and Qatar, providing consistent supply for both mobile and stationary power applications. Moreover, the modular GTL plants, such as those offered by Velocys, are expected to proliferate in remote locations or for distributed power generation, supported by advances in compact and robust Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysis.

Transportation: GTL fuels are forecast to supplement conventional diesel in heavy-duty trucking and marine sectors, thanks to their high cetane number and cleaner-burning profile. Regulatory shifts in Europe and Asia, including stricter sulfur limits, are likely to drive further adoption.

Power: Several utilities and independent power producers are trialing GTL fuels for backup and peaking power plants, where rapid deployment and emissions compliance are crucial. Modular GTL units allow local production and use of synthetic fuels, reducing logistical challenges.

Chemicals: GTL catalysis produces valuable feedstocks such as paraffins, waxes, and naphtha, which are integral to the petrochemical and specialty chemicals industries. For example, Shell supplies GTL base oils for premium lubricants, and Sasol markets GTL-derived waxes for coatings and adhesives.

Looking ahead, the outlook for GTL catalysis engineering in end-use applications is positive, with ongoing investments in catalyst efficiency, process intensification, and modularization. Companies are also exploring integration with carbon capture and renewable hydrogen, aiming to produce even lower-carbon GTL products for transportation, power, and chemicals in the years beyond 2025.

Regional Analysis: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Middle East

Gas-to-liquids (GTL) catalysis engineering is experiencing divergent trends across key global regions in 2025, driven by feedstock availability, energy transition policies, and technological investments. North America continues to capitalize on abundant natural gas resources, with companies such as ExxonMobil maintaining operational GTL units and investing in catalyst improvements to enhance process efficiency and reduce emissions. North American engineering activity is also influenced by policy support for lower-carbon fuels and the integration of renewable hydrogen in GTL processes.

In Europe, the focus is on the decarbonization of transport fuels and the utilization of stranded or renewable gases. Firms like Shell are leveraging their experience from large-scale GTL plants and advancing research for next-generation catalysts that enable lower operating temperatures and higher selectivity. European GTL catalysis engineering is closely linked to regulatory initiatives promoting synthetic fuels as a complement to electrification, especially in aviation and heavy-duty transport. The region also sees growing collaborations between catalyst suppliers and academic institutions to develop catalysts for small-scale, modular GTL units targeting biogas conversion.

The Asia-Pacific region, led by countries such as China and Malaysia, is investing in GTL catalysis to diversify energy portfolios and monetize natural gas reserves. National oil companies like PETRONAS are deploying advanced Fischer-Tropsch catalysts in commercial and demonstration-scale projects to convert offshore and remote gas resources into liquid fuels and chemicals. In China, government-backed initiatives are fostering partnerships with catalyst manufacturers and engineering firms to localize technology development and reduce dependency on imports. The region’s strong demand for cleaner transport fuels further incentivizes GTL catalysis R&D, particularly for integration with renewable feedstocks.

The Middle East, home to vast natural gas reserves, is increasingly targeting GTL as a strategic pathway for value addition beyond liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Companies such as Qatargas and Sasol (which co-operates the Oryx GTL plant in Qatar) are investing in catalyst life extension and process intensification to maximize plant reliability and economics. The region’s engineering efforts are also exploring synergies between GTL and blue hydrogen production to align with national decarbonization strategies.

Looking ahead, regional differences in GTL catalysis engineering will persist, shaped by feedstock dynamics, policy frameworks, and the pace of technological innovation. Across all regions, there is a clear trend toward the development of more robust, selective, and sustainable catalysts, with pilot and commercial demonstrations expected to expand over the next few years.

Barriers, Risks, and Competitive Threats

Gas-to-liquids (GTL) catalysis engineering faces a range of barriers and competitive threats as the industry moves through 2025 and into the coming years. A primary challenge remains the high capital expenditure required for commercial-scale GTL plants, which can reach billions of dollars. This is evident from the limited number of operational mega-scale facilities globally, with only a handful of companies such as Shell and Sasol operating large-scale units. The combination of expensive Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactors, advanced heat management systems, and highly specialized catalysts pushes up both initial investment and operational costs.

Catalyst deactivation and selectivity remain persistent technical hurdles. FT catalysts, typically based on cobalt or iron, are prone to sintering, carbon deposition, and poisoning by sulfur or other contaminants, which can lead to reduced efficiency and more frequent shutdowns for regeneration or replacement. As a result, companies such as ExxonMobil continue to invest in advanced catalyst formulations and process designs, but breakthroughs have been incremental rather than transformative.

Market risks also weigh heavily, particularly volatility in oil and natural gas prices. The economic viability of GTL hinges on a favorable spread between low-cost natural gas feedstock and higher-value liquid fuels. With global LNG markets and renewables reshaping the energy landscape, periods of low oil prices—as witnessed in past years—can quickly erode the competitiveness of GTL outputs, impacting investment confidence. Regulatory uncertainty, including evolving carbon policies and potential incentives for alternative fuels, adds another layer of risk. Producers must weigh the potential for future carbon taxes or emissions limits against the significant greenhouse gas footprint of conventional GTL processes.

Competitive threats arise from rapid advancements in alternative technologies. Renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels produced via biomass or waste-to-liquid pathways are attracting increasing attention and investment due to their lower carbon intensity. Companies such as Neste are scaling up production of renewable hydrocarbons using feedstocks like used cooking oil and animal fats, directly competing with GTL in premium fuel markets. Similarly, power-to-liquids (PtL) processes, which synthesize hydrocarbons from green hydrogen and captured CO₂, are gaining momentum as electrolysis costs fall and decarbonization pressures grow.

Looking ahead, the GTL sector’s growth will depend on its ability to overcome these engineering, economic, and environmental challenges, and to carve out a niche amidst a rapidly diversifying liquid fuels landscape.

Future Outlook: Game-Changing Advances and Roadmap to 2030

The landscape of Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) catalysis engineering is set for significant transformation as the sector moves through 2025 and plans for the next several years. Advances in catalyst design, process integration, and plant modularization are underpinning a new era of GTL technology that emphasizes efficiency, lower emissions, and economic viability for both large-scale and distributed applications.

Catalyst innovation remains at the heart of these developments. Companies are investing in next-generation Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts with improved selectivity and durability, aimed at maximizing conversion rates while minimizing by-product formation. For example, ExxonMobil has announced ongoing work to enhance cobalt-based FT catalysts, targeting higher yields of desirable middle distillates. Similarly, Shell continues to refine its proprietary catalysts, focusing on energy efficiency and process intensification for GTL plants.

In 2025, there is considerable momentum toward commercializing small- and micro-scale GTL units, which leverage modular engineering to monetize stranded or flared gas. Companies like Velocys are deploying compact FT reactors with advanced catalyst formulations, enabling economically feasible projects at scales previously unattainable by conventional GTL. This trend aligns with the industry’s decarbonization goals, as distributed GTL can reduce methane emissions from flaring and generate low-sulfur synthetic fuels.

Process intensification and digitalization are also shaping the GTL catalysis roadmap. Integration of real-time process analytics and advanced control systems is being adopted by operators such as Sasol to optimize catalyst performance, extend catalyst life, and reduce operational costs. These digital tools, combined with machine learning, are expected to further improve catalyst selection and process reliability by 2030.

The next few years will likely see pilot and demonstration projects scaling up novel catalyst types, such as those incorporating nano-structured supports or bi-functional sites for enhanced selectivity. The drive toward circular carbon economies is pushing R&D toward integrating GTL with renewable hydrogen and carbon capture, as seen in pilot initiatives by Shell Catalysts &amp; Technologies and Velocys.

By 2030, the GTL sector is anticipated to benefit from catalysts with greater resistance to impurities and longer operational lifetimes, supporting the economic and environmental case for wider adoption of GTL, especially as a pathway to sustainable aviation fuel and cleaner transportation fuels.

From Climate Necessity to Market Opportunity

With aviation emissions poised to triple by 2050 if left unchecked, SAF is no longer a luxury but a necessity. “We need molecules now and in the future,” said Frank Wouters, Director of the MED-GEM Network, kicking off the 14 May webinar hosted jointly with the International PtX Hub. “We cannot battery our way out of this.”

Indeed, while battery innovation supports short-haul flights, long-haul aviation—the sector's most carbon-intensive component—requires liquid fuels. SAF, produced either from bio-based waste or via synthetic pathways using green hydrogen and captured CO₂, offers the most viable alternative.

“The social cost of carbon is underestimated,” Wouters added, citing new research estimating real costs upwards of $1,300 per ton of CO₂—a figure over 16 times higher than current EU carbon credit prices. “That’s $52 trillion in costs annually if you multiply by our current 40 gigaton emission rate.”

Europe’s Stick and Carrot Strategy

The EU’s “RefuelEU Aviation” regulation has set clear SAF blending mandates: starting at 2% by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and 70% by 2050, including specific quotas for synthetic fuels (eSAF). These are backed by financial penalties for non-compliance that can reach €14,000 per missing tonne.

“Only one eSAF project in Europe is online today,” noted Frank Mischler, Director at the International PtX Hub. “We will not reach 2035 targets without imports. This is MENA’s moment.”

Yet, Europe’s stringent rules—especially around eligible carbon sources—make project alignment complex. “There are feedstocks that are CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation).compliant but not EU-compliant,” he warned. “Municipal solid waste, for instance, is still debated.”

MENA’s Strategic Advantage

Enter MENA—a region rich in solar and wind, with existing energy export infrastructure and an expanding hydrogen economy.

“Abundant renewable resources, proximity to EU markets, and existing refining capacity make MENA ideally suited for SAF and eSAF production,” explained Dr. Mustapha Taoumi, Key Expert at MED-GEM. “Countries like Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are already launching pilot projects.”

📂 Read the keynote https://drive.med-gem.eu/drive/s/wgzeg1zdKJKTD2stxmmvjfM0Jj7k1d

For Christian Pho Duc, CTO of Smartenergy Group AG, the SAF market is as much about momentum as policy: “Airlines like Lufthansa and Emirates are securing off-take agreements today. Young consumers want to fly clean. Companies are embedding SAF in ESG policies.”

Pho Duc emphasized that early movers can capture long-term advantage, even in a cost-intensive landscape: “Technology and scale will bring costs down. Solar costs fell by 95% in a decade—why not SAF?”

He also highlighted that projects like SkyPower, which brings together key European SAF stakeholders, demonstrate the value of integrated ecosystems. “This is not about fuel alone,” he said. “It’s about creating aviation ecosystems—from Co₂ sourcing to transport, certification, and end use.”

Policy Alignment: Simplicity, Certainty, and Speed

The panel agreed that to seize this opportunity, both MENA and EU actors must prioritize regulatory clarity and rapid coordination.

“Complexity kills momentum,” Pho Duc noted. “We need frameworks that de-risk first movers—not perfect policies, but implementable ones.”

Wouters echoed this: “The SAF train has left the station. The question is how fast it will run—and who gets on board.”

🔑 Key Takeaways

✅ SAF is not optional: It is the only scalable pathway for long-haul aviation decarbonization over the next 30 years.

✅ MENA holds natural advantages: Abundant renewables, energy infrastructure, and geographic proximity to Europe.

✅ The EU needs imports: Current European production will fall short of the 2030 and 2035 SAF and eSAF mandates.

✅ Invest now, not later: Early movers in MENA can secure off-take agreements and shape the value chain.

✅ Policy alignment is critical: Streamlined regulation, technical support, and cross-border incentives will determine success.

✅ The market is forming: Voluntary demand from corporates and airlines is rising—this is the moment to act.

A transição para essa nova fonte de energia começa em breve, a partir de 2025, refletindo um compromisso global do setor aéreo. O Brasil, rico em biomassa e com experiência na produção de biocombustíveis, se posiciona como um grande potencial nesse mercado emergente.

Oportunidades e desafios na produção de SAF

A transição para o SAF é vista não apenas como um desafio, mas também como uma oportunidade significativa para o Brasil, que atrai investimentos bilionários para desenvolver essa nova fonte de combustível. A Lei do Combustível do Futuro, sancionada em outubro, estabelece um plano claro para a descarbonização do setor aéreo brasileiro, começando com a exigência de redução de 1% nas emissões de carbono em voos domésticos até 2027, aumentando gradualmente ao longo dos anos.

Até o momento, a Vibra (anteriormente conhecida como BR Distribuidora) foi a primeira empresa a comercializar o SAF no Brasil, que, por enquanto, é importado e produzido a partir de óleo de cozinha usado. No entanto, para garantir a produção local, o Brasil investe em diferentes rotas tecnológicas que vão desde a conversão de etanol da cana-de-açúcar até o coprocessamento de óleos vegetais, como os utilizados na produção de biocombustíveis.

Expectativas e investimentos no setor

A Petrobras lidera o desenvolvimento do SAF nacional, com previsão de iniciar a produção comercial ainda este ano, utilizando refinarias em São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro e Minas Gerais. A empresa já planeja uma expansão na produção com o uso do etanol em suas formulações. Outra iniciativa importante é da Acelen, que pretende começar a produção de SAF na Bahia, focando na macaúba como matéria-prima até 2026, contribuindo para a solidificação do Brasil como uma plataforma de exportação.

Estudos indicam que a demanda nacional por SAF deve iniciar com 126 milhões de litros em 2027, podendo atingir 1,75 bilhão de litros anuais na década seguinte. Para as companhias aéreas, que enfrentam margens de lucro estreitas, essa demanda representa um custo adicional significativo, podendo alcançar US$ 1,4 bilhão até o final da década.

Um dos principais obstáculos a serem superados é o alto custo de produção do SAF, que ainda é de 2,5 a 3 vezes superior ao do querosene convencional. Especialistas, como Clayton Souza da L.E.K. Consulting, apontam que a viabilidade econômica do SAF depende de incentivos governamentais e regulamentações que favoreçam a cadeia produtiva.

Regulamentação e o futuro do SAF no Brasil

A transição para o SAF requer regulamentações claras e eficazes, e o governo brasileiro está em fase de elaboração de decretos complementares para a Lei do Combustível do Futuro, essencial para a implementação desse projeto. Em setembro, a ANAC e a ANP assinaram um acordo de cooperação técnica para regulamentar o uso do SAF no país, o que representa um passo significativo em direção à estruturação desse novo mercado sustentável.

Entretanto, ainda há desafios, como a necessidade de regras claras em relação aos créditos de carbono e a disponibilidade em escala do SAF. Além disso, a Gol Linhas Aéreas, que busca incorporar 5% de SAF até 2030, comentou que a regulamentação será crucial para garantir segurança jurídica para todos os envolvidos, desde os produtores até os operadores aéreos.

À medida que o Brasil se destaca na corrida global pela produção de SAF, a colaboração entre o setor privado e o governo será fundamental para criar um ambiente propício ao crescimento sustentável, capaz de apoiar a aviação em sua missão de alcançar a neutralidade de carbono.

Com esses avanços, o Brasil não só se posiciona como um líder na produção de SAF, mas também abre portas para exportação e colabora na luta global contra as mudanças climáticas, apresentando um modelo que pode inspirar outros países a seguir o mesmo caminho.",https://diario.dopovo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/opengraph.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 12:56:14.403686

18일 정유업계에 따르면 SAF 시장을 선도하는 미국, 일본, 유럽 외에 중국의 움직임이 빨라지고 있다. 중국의 한 에너지 기업은 5월부터 연간 20만톤(t) 규모로 SAF 생산을 시작했다. 국내 최대 SAF 생산 능력을 갖춘 SK에너지의 배 수준이다. 또 다른 중국 에너지 기업은 내년부터 연간 30만t 규모의 SAF 공장을 가동할 계획이다.

정유업계 관계자는 “중국은 SAF를 국가 차원에서 육성하고 있다. 중국은 SAF 원료인 폐식용유의 최대 보유국인데 만약 폐식용유 수출을 줄이면 한국 정유사는 원료 조달조차 힘겨워지고 중국 기업이 SAF 시장을 선점할 수 있다”고 말했다.

SAF는 폐식용유, 농업 폐기물 등으로 만드는 항공유를 말한다. 기존 항공유보다 탄소 배출량이 최대 80% 적어 항공 부문에서 온실가스를 줄일 핵심 요소로 여겨진다. SAF는 기존 항공유와 화학 구조가 유사해, 기존의 항공기 엔진과 인프라(기반 시설)를 그대로 사용할 수 있다.

유럽연합(EU)과 영국은 올해부터 항공사가 사용하는 연료의 최소 2%를 SAF로 채우도록 하는 규정을 시행했다. EU는 이 비율을 2030년까지 6%, 2050년에는 70%까지 확대할 계획이다. 미국은 2050년까지 항공유 사용 전량을 SAF로 대체한다는 목표를 세웠다. 일본도 2030년까지 기존 항공유에 SAF를 혼합하는 비율을 10%로 늘릴 계획이다.

한국은 2027년까지 전체 항공유의 1%를 SAF로 채운다는 목표를 세웠다. 정유업계는 정부의 도입 목표가 낮다고 지적한다. 국제항공운송협회(IATA)에 따르면 SAF는 전체 항공유의 0.2%(2023년 기준)에 불과하고, 현재 가격은 기존 항공유의 2~3배다.

정유업계 관계자는 “SAF 수요가 증가해야 SAF를 대량으로 생산해 규모의 경제가 생기고, SAF 단가가 낮아지는 선순환이 이뤄질 수 있다”고 말했다.

SAF는 정유사의 미래 먹거리로 여겨지지만, 국제 유가 하락 여파로 실적이 악화해 투자할 여력이 없는 상태다. SK이노베이션, GS칼텍스, HD현대오일뱅크, 에쓰오일(S-Oil) 등 국내 정유 4사는 SAF 전용 시설 대신 기존 정유 설비에 석유 기반 원료와 바이오 원료를 함께 투입하는 코프로세싱(Co-Processing·공동 처리) 방식으로 SAF을 생산한다. 정유업계 관계자는 “SAF 전용 시설 수율(생산량 중 양품의 비율)은 60~80%지만, 코프로세싱 수율은 약 10%에 불과하다”고 말했다.

정유업계는 SAF 전용 공장 설립을 촉진하기 위한 제도 마련이 필요하다고 주장한다. 미국은 인플레이션감축법(IRA)을 통해 리터(L)당 440~615원의 생산 보조금을 지급한다. 이에 따라 전 세계 SAF 전용 공장 359개 중 30%에 해당하는 107개는 미국에 있다. 일본은 SAF 시설 투자, 판매와 관련해 연간 최대 40%의 법인 세액을 공제한다. 또 약 292억 엔의 기금을 조성해 SAF를 생산하면 리터당 30엔의 생산 세액공제 혜택을 지원할 계획이다.",https://thumb.zumst.com/1024x0/https://static.news.zumst.com/images/110/2025/05/18/e0f5b29ad6de4a78846b0a219b0d960a.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 11:56:13.734653

Angka ini setara dengan lima kali luas seluruh lahan pertanian di Amerika Serikat (AS) atau dua puluh kali luas lahan pertanian Kanada.","Industri penerbangan global tengah giat mempromosikan bahan bakar aviasi berkelanjutan, atau sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), sebagai solusi jitu untuk menekan emisi karbon. Narasi yang dibangun pun begitu memukau: SAF diklaim mampu memangkas jejak karbon hingga 80% dan menjadi kunci menuju penerbangan ""netral karbon"" pada 2050. Maskapai, pabrikan pesawat, hingga pemerintah ramai-ramai menyebut SAF sebagai primadona dekarbonisasi. Asosiasi Pengangkutan Udara Internasional (IATA) bahkan memperkirakan SAF bisa menyumbang 65% dari total pengurangan emisi yang dibutuhkan sektor ini. Namun, optimisme hijau ini patut dipertanyakan. Di baliknya, tersembunyi perhitungan karbon yang penuh tanda tanya, beban lingkungan yang terabaikan, dan dampak iklim penerbangan secara utuh yang kurang diperhatikan. Klaim ""berkelanjutan"" pada SAF sesungguhnya adalah ilusi murahan yang bisa menyesatkan kita semua.

Fatamorgana Pengurangan Karbon dan Dampak Tersembunyi

Andalan utama klaim ramah lingkungan SAF terletak pada metodologi Penilaian Siklus Hidup (LCA) yang digunakan. Teori ini menghitung emisi gas rumah kaca (GRK) dari penanaman bahan baku hingga pembakaran di mesin pesawat. Para pendukungnya berargumen, karena biomassa (bahan baku SAF) menyerap CO2 saat tumbuh, CO2 yang dilepas saat SAF dibakar hanyalah ""daur ulang"". Dari sinilah, muncul klaim bombastis pengurangan emisi ""hingga 80%"" atau bahkan, seperti disebut United Airlines, hingga 85% dibandingkan bahan bakar jet fosil. Akan tetapi, angka fantastis ini merupakan skenario paling ideal yang sangat bergantung pada jenis bahan baku, teknologi pengolahan, dan rantai pasok. Kenyataannya, hasilnya bisa sangat beragam. Sebuah studi LCA komparatif yang berjudul ""Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production from Different Biomasses"" pada jurnal MDPI menunjukkan variasi Potensi Pemanasan Global (GWP) yang ekstrem. Minyak sawit, misalnya, menghasilkan GWP 18,12 g CO2eq/MJ dan camelina 19,14 g CO2eq/MJ. Sebaliknya, kedelai justru menghasilkan GWP sebesar 390 g CO2eq/MJ, jauh melampaui bahan bakar fosil yang menurut standar Uni Eropa berkisar 83,8-105,7 g CO2eq/MJ. Artinya, beberapa jenis SAF justru bisa lebih merusak iklim ketimbang bahan bakar konvensional.

Persoalan krusial lainnya dapat ditemukan pada Perubahan Penggunaan Lahan Tidak Langsung (ILUC). Ketika lahan pangan dialihkan untuk tanaman bahan baku SAF, kegiatan pertanian pangan bisa tergeser ke area lain, berpotensi memicu pembukaan hutan atau lahan gambut yang melepaskan cadangan karbon dalam jumlah besar. Meskipun kerangka Skema Pengimbangan dan Pengurangan Karbon untuk Penerbangan Internasional (CORSIA) dari Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional (ICAO) telah memasukkan faktor ILUC, penghitungannya sangat rumit dan penuh ketidakpastian, seperti diakui dalam berbagai laporan Uni Eropa. Mengandalkan SAF tanpa perhitungan ILUC yang cermat sama saja dengan berjudi dengan nasib hutan dan keanekaragaman hayati kita. Lebih jauh lagi, fokus berlebihan pada CO2 telah mengaburkan dampak pemanasan non-CO2 dari penerbangan. Mesin pesawat tidak hanya mengeluarkan CO2, tetapi juga uap air, nitrogen oksida (NOx), partikel jelaga, dan lainnya. Di ketinggian jelajah, emisi ini memicu pembentukan jejak kondensasi (contrail) dan awan sirostratus yang memiliki efek pemanasan signifikan. Studi yang dipublikasikan di jurnal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP) oleh Copernicus Publications menyebutkan bahwa efek non-CO2 ini berkontribusi hingga tiga kali lebih besar terhadap pemanasan global dibandingkan emisi CO2 historis penerbangan. Selain itu, SAF memang diklaim bisa mengurangi jelaga. Studi ECLIF3 yang juga dilaporkan dalam jurnal ACP menunjukkan penggunaan 100% SAF jenis HEFA mengurangi jumlah kristal es di contrail sebesar 56% dan partikel jelaga sebesar 35%. Ini diproyeksikan bisa mengurangi efek pemanasan dari contrail sebesar 26% jika seluruh armada global menggunakan 100% SAF. Namun, manfaat ini baru optimal pada penggunaan 100% SAF, sementara standar ASTM International saat ini masih membatasi campuran SAF maksimal 50% dengan bahan bakar jet konvensional, bahkan ada yang hanya 10% untuk jalur produksi tertentu. Dampak SAF terhadap emisi non-CO2 lainnya seperti NOx juga tidak konsisten antar-studi, seperti yang diungkapkan dalam sebuah penelitian dari KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Jadi, mengandalkan SAF untuk mengatasi seluruh dampak iklim penerbangan jelas suatu kekeliruan.

Ancaman bagi Lahan, Pangan, dan Alam Liar

Keberlanjutan SAF sangat bergantung pada ketersediaan bahan baku yang diklaim ""berkelanjutan"". Visi yang disajikan mencakup pemanfaatan limbah pertanian, sampah kota, minyak jelantah (UCO), hingga tanaman energi khusus di lahan marginal. Namun, visi ini menabrak tembok kenyataan. Jika SAF diproduksi massal dari tanaman energi, kebutuhan lahannya akan sangat masif. Laporan dari National Farmers Union (NFU) Kanada, mengutip proyeksi U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), permintaan bahan bakar penerbangan global pada 2050 mencapai sekitar 230 miliar galon. Untuk memenuhi angka tersebut dengan SAF dari kedelai, kanola, dan jagung, dibutuhkan lahan seluas 2 miliar hektar. Angka ini setara dengan lima kali luas seluruh lahan pertanian di Amerika Serikat (AS) atau dua puluh kali luas lahan pertanian Kanada. Dari mana lahan seluas itu akan didapat? Tak pelak, ini akan bersaing langsung dengan lahan untuk produksi pangan, pakan ternak, dan bisa mengancam ekosistem alami seperti hutan.

Persaingan ini memicu dilema ""pangan versus bahan bakar"". Pengalihan tanaman pangan atau lahan subur untuk SAF berisiko mendongkrak harga pangan global. Laporan NFU Kanada menyebutkan bahwa SAF bisa berarti ""Mengorbankan Pangan Terjangkau"", karena dana pembelian pangan miliaran penduduk termiskin akan bersaing dengan dana liburan miliaran penduduk terkaya. Ini jelas memperburuk ketidakadilan sosial dan ancaman kelaparan. Dampak terhadap keanekaragaman hayati juga tak kalah mengerikan. Laporan Greenpeace menyatakan bahwa pertanian industri masih menjadi penyebab utama deforestasi global, menyumbang sekitar 80% dari total kerusakan hutan. Komoditas seperti kedelai dan kelapa sawit, yang menjadi bahan baku utama SAF, merupakan biang keladi deforestasi di kawasan tropis. Laporan Greenpeace lainnya, ""Bankrolling Ecosystem Destruction"", mengungkap bahwa konsumsi Uni Eropa saja pada 2017 terkait dengan 16% deforestasi tropis, utamanya akibat kedelai dan kelapa sawit. Ironisnya, lembaga jasa keuangan (LJK) besar Uni Eropa justru terus menyuntikkan miliaran dolar ke perusahaan-perusahaan yang terbukti terkait dengan deforestasi skala besar baru-baru ini, termasuk Bunge dan Cargill. Analisis Greenpeace juga menyebutkan, antara 2010 dan 2020 (periode di mana banyak janji ""nol deforestasi"" dibuat), sekitar 50 juta hektar hutan, atau seluas Spanyol, hilang untuk produksi komoditas.

Bagaimana dengan bahan baku ""canggih"" dari limbah seperti UCO atau sampah kota? UCO, yang kini mendominasi produksi SAF, ketersediaannya sangat terbatas. Menurut studi Transport & Environment (T&E), Eropa menggunakan hampir 7 juta ton UCO untuk biofuel per tahun, padahal jumlah itu delapan kali lipat dari yang berhasil dikumpulkan di dalam negeri dan empat kali lipat potensi pengumpulan teoretis maksimumnya. Akibatnya, T&E melaporkan bahwa 80% pasokan UCO Eropa kini berasal dari impor, dengan Tiongkok sebagai pemasok utama (60% impor). Analisis T&E juga menunjukkan bahwa satu maskapai seperti Ryanair diperkirakan membutuhkan seluruh potensi UCO Eropa hanya untuk memenuhi target SAF 12,5% pada 2030. Kelangkaan ini memicu praktik penipuan. T&E dan Wells Fargo menyoroti kekhawatiran minyak nabati murah seperti sawit diduga kuat sengaja dilabeli sebagai UCO untuk meraup insentif. Indikasinya, menurut analisis Stratas yang dikutip T&E, Malaysia mengekspor UCO tiga kali lebih banyak dari yang dilaporkan berhasil dikumpulkannya. Limbah lain seperti sampah kota atau residu pertanian menghadapi kendala logistik, biaya pengumpulan, dan teknologi konversi yang mahal dan belum matang.

Biaya Selangit dan Energi yang Boros

Secara ekonomi dan energi, SAF juga bermasalah. Laporan dari Departemen Energi (DoE) AS menyebutkan biaya produksi SAF 2 hingga 10 kali lebih mahal dibandingkan bahan bakar jet konvensional. ICF dan McKinsey juga menyebutkan angka serupa, sekitar 2-4 kali atau setidaknya 3 kali lipat. Data MSCI menunjukkan harga rata-rata SAF pada 2022 mencapai $2.400 atau Rp39,5 juta per ton, dua setengah kali lipat harga bahan bakar biasa. Mengingat bahan bakar menyumbang 20-30% biaya operasional maskapai, menurut IATA, premi sebesar ini jelas memberatkan. Akibatnya, pasar SAF sangat bergantung pada subsidi dan insentif pemerintah. Tanpa sokongan dana publik ini, pasar SAF dipastikan akan sulit bertahan. Laporan World Economic Forum (WEF) memperkirakan, untuk mencapai permintaan tahun 2030, dibutuhkan investasi modal $19-45 miliar atau Rp312,8-740,8 triliun untuk kilang baru, dan untuk target net-zero 2050 bisa mencapai $1,45 triliun atau Rp23.871,6 triliun (setara dengan PDB Indonesia) menurut Aviation Benefits.",https://assets-a1.kompasiana.com/items/album/2025/05/18/rolls-royce-successfully-completes-100-saf-test-programme-6829b685c925c469c41b0c03.jpg?t=o&v=1200,N,,2025-05-18 08:56:27.263159

Overview of Qatar’s Strategic Aviation Role

Qatar’s aviation sector continues to assert a significant strategic influence globally, particularly due to its flagship carrier Qatar Airways and the country’s investments in advanced aircraft technology. In 2025 and the near future, Qatar’s aviation ambitions are expected to intensify, shaped by both geopolitical dynamics and high-profile international connections.

Qatar Airways remains a leading global airline, renowned for its premium service and cutting-edge fleet. The airline is a major customer of Boeing, notably for the 747-8 and next-generation models, further cementing Doha’s status as an aviation hub in the Gulf region. Strategic orders and partnerships with Boeing not only enhance Qatar’s fleet but also foster critical economic and diplomatic ties with the United States, as highlighted in recent industry reports (www.reuters.com).

The intersection of Qatar’s aviation sector and U.S. politics has occasionally drawn public scrutiny. For example, speculation has arisen over links between Qatari jets and former U.S. President Donald Trump, including rumors about Qatari-owned aircraft being used or associated with Trump or his associates. While these narratives often circulate in media outlets such as the nypost.com and www.thedailybeast.com, there is no definitive public evidence of direct involvement or emoluments clause violations. However, the debate underscores ongoing concerns about foreign influence and transparency, especially as Trump maintains a public profile through platforms like Truth Social and as a potential 2024-25 election candidate (apnews.com).

Qatar’s broader strategy includes leveraging aviation for soft power and economic diversification. Doha International Airport’s expansion and the country’s continued investments in luxury and business-class travel position Qatar as a pivotal connector between East and West. This is further supported by high-profile events and diplomatic visits involving U.S. officials such as Chuck Schumer and Jon Ossoff, who have engaged with Qatari counterparts in recent years (www.aljazeera.com).

Looking ahead, Qatar is likely to further expand its aviation influence, supported by sustained investment in technology, international partnerships, and a focus on geopolitical relevance. The ongoing evolution of aircraft—such as the Boeing 747-8—and the interplay of political figures and media commentary (including voices like Ben Shapiro, Jon Stewart, and Brit Hume) will continue to shape public perceptions and policy discussions surrounding Qatar’s aviation role through 2025 and beyond.

Qatar and U.S. Presidential Aircraft: Recent Intersections

In 2025, the relationship between Qatar, high-profile U.S. political figures, and presidential aircraft has continued to generate significant attention, highlighting issues of diplomacy, influence, and legal scrutiny. Qatar’s substantial investments in aviation, including its national carrier’s acquisition of state-of-the-art Boeing aircraft, have intersected with U.S. politics in several notable ways, especially regarding former President Donald Trump and the ongoing debates around the Emoluments Clause.

Recent reporting has revisited www.apnews.com that Qatar’s government considered facilitating Trump’s access to a luxury Boeing 747-8, a model similar to the current Air Force One, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and violations of the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits U.S. officials from receiving gifts or benefits from foreign governments. While there is no evidence of a completed transaction, congressional scrutiny—led by figures such as Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Jon Ossoff—remains heightened, especially as Trump seeks another presidential term www.nytimes.com. Legal analysts and commentators—including Ben Shapiro and outlets like www.dailybeast.com—have debated whether such arrangements, even if indirect, could constitute improper influence or violate federal law.

Boeing’s prominence in these stories is unsurprising, as the company continues to deliver the 747-8 for both commercial and special missions use. The U.S. Air Force is currently modernizing the presidential fleet, with the new VC-25B (based on the 747-8) expected to enter service by 2027 www.apnews.com. These aircraft symbolize American power and prestige, but also draw scrutiny regarding their procurement and use. Recent news from www.nypost.com and www.britannica.com has focused on the high costs and security features of these planes, as well as speculation about Trump’s private jet—recently refurbished and frequently showcased on his www.truthsocial.com platform.

Media personalities like Jon Stewart and Brit Hume have amplified public discourse about these intersections, questioning both the optics and legality of foreign connections to U.S. political figures. As the 2024 election cycle’s aftershocks continue into 2025, expect ongoing investigations and media coverage to shape both public perception and policy regarding presidential aircraft, foreign influence, and transparency in political relationships www.apnews.com.

Trump, the Emoluments Clause, and Aviation Ties

The intersection of Donald Trump’s aviation interests, foreign governments such as Qatar, and the U.S. Constitution’s Emoluments Clause remains a focal point in American politics as 2025 unfolds. The Emoluments Clause prohibits federal officeholders from receiving gifts or payments from foreign states without congressional consent—a matter repeatedly scrutinized during Trump’s presidency due to his global business connections, including those in aviation and luxury real estate.

Recent investigations have revisited Trump’s alleged business ties to Qatar, especially regarding private jet usage and luxury aircraft leases. Reports from www.apnews.com and www.nypost.com highlight ongoing legal debates over whether Trump’s companies benefited from lucrative arrangements involving the Qatari government or its emissaries. While no direct legal conclusions have yet been reached, lawmakers such as Sen. Chuck Schumer and Sen. Jon Ossoff have called for more transparency and potential legislative remedies to clarify foreign influence in U.S. political and business dealings.

The aviation industry itself is a key backdrop. Trump’s personal aircraft, a Boeing 757, has become a symbol among supporters, while simultaneously drawing criticism and scrutiny regarding maintenance, financing, and the optics of former presidents using private jets for political or business purposes. Meanwhile, the U.S. government’s relationship with Boeing—manufacturer of Air Force One and the new Boeing 747-8 models—remains crucial as discussions continue on fleet modernization and security upgrades through 2027 (www.dailybeast.com).

Media figures like Ben Shapiro, Brit Hume, and Jon Stewart have amplified national conversations around these topics via television and digital platforms, often linking Trump’s aviation interests with broader questions of ethics, class, and presidential precedent. On Truth Social, Trump’s own platform, he regularly addresses these allegations, denouncing them as politically motivated attacks and touting his aviation achievements as evidence of success.

Looking ahead, the legal and political outlook hinges on several factors: ongoing litigation related to the Emoluments Clause; Congressional investigations into foreign payments or benefits; and the potential for new ethics legislation. The spotlight on Trump’s Qatar connections and aviation ties may intensify if he seeks or holds public office again—especially amid heightened scrutiny from outlets like www.nypost.com and www.apnews.com. The debate is likely to persist, affecting not only Trump’s legacy but also future standards for financial transparency and foreign entanglements in American public life.

Media Perspectives: Ben Shapiro, Jon Stewart, and Brit Hume

In the shifting media landscape of 2025, prominent commentators such as Ben Shapiro, Jon Stewart, and Brit Hume have played influential roles in shaping public discourse around high-profile stories involving Qatar, Donald Trump, and the intersection of politics, aviation, and ethics. Their perspectives offer insight into how narratives about international diplomacy, presidential conduct, and business entanglements are constructed and debated in the public sphere.

Ben Shapiro, a leading conservative voice, has focused on the potential ethical and legal implications surrounding reports that former President Trump may have benefited from business deals involving Qatar, particularly the use of private jets and investments linked to Qatari interests. Shapiro’s commentary often centers on the Emoluments Clause, raising concerns about foreign influence and constitutional boundaries for former presidents. He has argued on his platforms that transparency and accountability remain paramount, regardless of political affiliation (www.dailywire.com).

On the other side of the spectrum, Jon Stewart has approached the controversy with his trademark satire, highlighting the perceived absurdity of the political and media responses. Stewart, now a fixture on streaming news platforms, has lampooned the spectacle surrounding Trump’s reported use of a Boeing 747-8—dubbed by some as the “Qatar Jet”—and the broader implications for American democracy. Stewart’s segments frequently draw attention to the double standards in media coverage and the sometimes performative nature of congressional investigations, referencing figures like Chuck Schumer and Jon Ossoff (www.nytimes.com).

Veteran journalist Brit Hume has provided a more measured analysis, emphasizing the importance of separating speculation from verifiable fact. On platforms such as Fox News and AP News, Hume has called for restraint and thorough reporting, particularly as new details emerge about aviation contracts, the role of Boeing, and the use of Air Force One and other aircraft post-presidency. He has also addressed the broader context of U.S.-Qatar relations, noting the delicate balance between diplomatic partnership and scrutiny of elite privilege (apnews.com).

Looking ahead, these media perspectives will continue to influence public understanding as investigations and legal debates unfold. With the rapid pace of news, the intersection of political celebrity, international business, and aviation technology remains a fertile ground for both substantive analysis and partisan commentary.

As of 2025, the Boeing 747-8 remains a central figure in discussions about presidential and state aircraft, commercial aviation trends, and geopolitical influence, especially regarding its role as the basis for the next-generation Air Force One. The U.S. government’s ongoing modernization of the presidential fleet, initiated during the Trump administration, involves two Boeing 747-8 aircraft set to replace the aging VC-25A models (modified Boeing 747-200s) currently serving as Air Force One. These new aircraft are expected to enter service by late 2026 or early 2027, after delays due to supply chain challenges and cost overruns reported by apnews.com and www.nytimes.com.

Boeing’s contract for Air Force One modernization has drawn political scrutiny from figures like Chuck Schumer and Jon Ossoff, who have expressed concerns about cost transparency and security features. At the same time, recent news cycles have spotlighted Qatar’s strategic use of high-profile jets—including Boeing 747-8s—for diplomatic and business purposes. Reports indicate that Qatari officials have engaged in high-level meetings involving prominent Americans, raising questions about influence, protocol, and the Emoluments Clause in the context of former President Trump’s business interests and travel aboard private jets www.thedailybeast.com.

Media commentators such as Ben Shapiro and Brit Hume, as well as satirists like Jon Stewart, have weighed in on the symbolism and politics of presidential aircraft. The Trump-branded Boeing 757—often referred to as “Trump Force One”—remains a campaign icon, with recent upgrades to its avionics and interior documented in outlets like nypost.com. Meanwhile, discussions about Qatar’s investments in aviation technology and ties to Western politicians continue to provoke debate about transparency and global influence.

Outlook for 2025 and Beyond: As Air Force One’s new Boeing 747-8s near completion, further scrutiny of Boeing’s production and cost management is expected, especially in the wake of recent aviation safety issues. The intersection of private jet diplomacy, campaign optics (e.g., Trump’s aircraft), and regulatory concerns will likely intensify in the lead-up to the 2028 U.S. presidential election.

Qatar’s continued use of advanced aircraft for statecraft suggests sustained investment in high-profile aviation assets, likely impacting both commercial and diplomatic aviation dynamics www.reuters.com.

Truth Social, NYPost, and Latest News Dissemination

In 2025, the convergence of social media platforms like Truth Social, established news outlets such as the nypost.com (NYPost), and the broader media ecosystem continues to shape the dissemination of news related to Qatar, high-profile aircraft, and political figures, especially former President Donald Trump. This dynamic is particularly visible in coverage relating to allegations about Trump’s use of private jets, potential conflicts of interest such as those covered under the Emoluments Clause, and geopolitical ties to nations like Qatar.

Truth Social, launched by Trump Media & Technology Group, remains a pivotal platform for the former president and his supporters to disseminate their narrative directly to followers. In 2025, it continues to be used for rapid response to mainstream media reports, especially those concerning Trump’s international dealings, business ventures, and legal challenges. For instance, discussions about Qatar’s alleged involvement with Trump’s business interests, as well as speculation around the use of private or Qatari-linked jets, are frequently amplified and reframed on Truth Social, often countering the narratives seen in outlets like the www.thedailybeast.com and apnews.com.

Mainstream publications such as the NYPost and AP News have reported on the continued scrutiny Trump faces regarding the Emoluments Clause, particularly concerning foreign governments’ alleged payments or favors while he was in office, and his post-presidential business activities. The interplay between these reports and responses on Truth Social often leads to a cycle of amplification, with each side mobilizing its base through both factual reporting and opinion-based content.

Boeing 747-8 and Air Force One: In 2025, coverage of aircraft such as the Boeing 747-8—currently the basis for the next generation Air Force One (apnews.com)—remains a topic of interest, especially as delays and cost overruns are debated in both political and media circles. Trump’s own private plane, often compared to Air Force One, is frequently used as a symbol in political messaging.

Media Personalities: Figures like Ben Shapiro, Jon Stewart, and Brit Hume contribute to the ongoing discourse through their platforms, offering analysis or satire that is then widely shared on social media and referenced in news articles, further blurring the lines between commentary and reporting.

Political Context: Senators like Chuck Schumer and Jon Ossoff are often quoted in response to these controversies, reflecting the ongoing politicization of aviation, foreign policy, and presidential accountability in the U.S. political arena (www.nytimes.com).

As the 2024 election aftermath settles and the 2025 political landscape takes shape, the cross-pollination of stories between Truth Social, legacy outlets like NYPost, and aggregators such as Daily Beast and AP News will continue to influence public perception. The speed and reach of digital platforms ensure that narratives around Trump, Qatar, and high-profile aircraft will remain at the forefront of news cycles for years to come.

In 2025, the intersection of political figures and aviation policy remains highly relevant, particularly as scrutiny grows over government and private jet usage, as well as foreign influence in U.S. politics. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Jon Ossoff have both weighed in on key aviation issues, reflecting broader debates about transparency, ethics, and national security.

Chuck Schumer’s Aviation Advocacy: Schumer has long been a vocal advocate for airline passenger rights and aviation safety. Recently, he has pushed for tighter regulations on private jet travel by public officials, citing concerns over ethical lapses and the potential for foreign influence, especially in light of ongoing investigations into high-profile figures’ use of luxury jets linked to foreign governments such as Qatar. Schumer has called for updates to the Emoluments Clause to include stricter reporting on gifts, flights, and accommodations provided by foreign entities, emphasizing the need for transparency amid allegations involving former President Trump and Qatari-linked aircraft (www.nytimes.com).

Jon Ossoff and Modernization Efforts: Senator Jon Ossoff, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, has advocated for modernizing the U.S. aviation fleet, including Air Force One. Ossoff has voiced concerns about the security and operational integrity of American presidential aircraft amid reports that Boeing’s 747-8, the next Air Force One model, faces delays and cost overruns. He has pushed for congressional oversight on contracts and transparency regarding any foreign components or investments, particularly as Qatar increases its stake in Boeing and the global aviation market (www.apnews.com).

Outlook and Future Developments: With the 2024 election cycle concluded and campaign travel under renewed scrutiny, bipartisan calls for disclosure of jet usage—especially in relation to foreign governments like Qatar—are intensifying. This includes calls for reforms to the Emoluments Clause and new ethics legislation. In the next few years, Schumer and Ossoff are expected to continue leading efforts on aviation transparency, making the private jet activities of political figures a major issue for both national security and public trust (www.politico.com).

As debates over aviation ethics and foreign influence evolve, the positions of leaders like Schumer and Ossoff will shape regulatory approaches and public expectations for transparency in the skies.

Forecasts: Qatar-U.S. Aviation Relations Through 2028

The outlook for Qatar-U.S. aviation relations from 2025 through 2028 is shaped by strategic investments, political nuances, and evolving aviation technology. Qatar Airways, the nation’s flagship carrier, remains a vital player in transatlantic air travel, with continued interest in expanding routes and deepening its partnership with Boeing, notably with its orders for the Boeing 777X and 787 Dreamliner families. The airline’s relationship with American manufacturers is expected to strengthen, especially as Qatar positions itself as a global aviation hub ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and other major events (www.reuters.com).

On the U.S. side, political developments will continue to influence aviation relations. Discussions around the Emoluments Clause—which prohibits U.S. presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments—may resurface, particularly if Donald Trump remains active in politics or returns to office. In 2024, there was renewed scrutiny over reports of Qatar-linked entities booking rooms at Trump properties and the use of private jets with connections to the Qatari government (apnews.com). These concerns could intensify, especially with high-profile commentators such as Ben Shapiro and Jon Stewart amplifying the conversation on platforms like Truth Social and mainstream media.

The ongoing modernization of Air Force One—specifically the adaptation of two Boeing 747-8 aircraft for presidential use—ties into the broader Boeing-Qatar relationship. Boeing’s strong order book with Qatar Airways is a stabilizing force for the U.S. aerospace sector, despite recent controversies and production delays at the manufacturer. Congressional figures like Chuck Schumer and Jon Ossoff have signaled the importance of maintaining robust U.S.-Qatar ties for economic and security reasons (www.nytimes.com).

By 2028, Qatar’s aviation strategy is likely to emphasize premium service, technological advancement, and climate initiatives. Industry analysts predict continued investments in sustainable aviation fuel and digital transformation, aligning with global trends and U.S. priorities. Meanwhile, the interplay of politics, business, and media scrutiny—from sources like The Daily Beast, NY Post, and Brit Hume—will ensure that Qatar-U.S. aviation relations remain dynamic, with high visibility and evolving public narratives (www.dailybeast.com).

Predictions: Evolving Political Discourse on Presidential Aircraft

As the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle concludes and 2025 unfolds, the role of presidential aircraft continues to intersect sharply with political discourse, transparency debates, and international relations. Recent years have seen heightened scrutiny of former President Donald Trump’s use of private jets—most notably his Boeing 757, sometimes called “Trump Force One”—and the symbolic resonance of Air Force One, now embodied in the next-generation Boeing 747-8 aircraft, which is set for delivery and operational debut in the coming years www.boeing.com.

The intersection of these aircraft with political narratives owes much to ongoing controversies. Trump’s private travel, including reported interactions with Qatari officials and the use of jets linked to foreign entities, has reignited debates around the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. These debates question whether foreign gifts or benefits—direct or indirect—could influence U.S. officials, feeding into ongoing investigations and media coverage from outlets like www.nypost.com and www.thedailybeast.com. Analysts such as Ben Shapiro and commentators including Brit Hume have been vocal on the implications for national security and ethics, while voices like Jon Stewart have amplified these issues on late-night platforms, broadening public engagement.

Transparency and Oversight: Congressional leaders like Chuck Schumer and Jon Ossoff have called for stricter oversight on the intersection of private aircraft, campaign finance, and foreign entanglements. These calls are likely to intensify, especially as Trump’s use of Truth Social and other platforms keeps the issue in the public eye apnews.com.

Technological and Symbolic Shifts: The arrival of the Boeing 747-8 as the new Air Force One is expected to serve as a renewed symbol of presidential authority and American aerospace leadership. Its advanced communications and security systems will become a focal point in debates about the separation between presidential and private travel www.boeing.com.

International Relations: Qatar’s expanding investment in aviation and its strategic partnerships with both U.S. and international stakeholders will further complicate perceptions, especially if former or current officials are seen engaging with Qatari-linked jets www.nytimes.com.

Looking ahead, the evolving discourse on presidential aircraft will remain a potent lens for broader debates around ethics, influence, and the intersection of technology and power. The next few years promise further revelations, regulatory proposals, and public debate—especially as media, lawmakers, and new voices on both ends of the political spectrum continue to scrutinize every flight and its implications.

Class, Voice, and Influence: The Future of Aviation in U.S. Politics

The intersection of class, voice, and influence in U.S. political aviation is poised for renewed scrutiny and transformation as the 2025 election cycle intensifies. Private and government aircraft have historically symbolized both status and controversy, with recent events involving former President Donald Trump and international players like Qatar spotlighting the blurred lines between power, privilege, and policy.

One persistent issue is the ongoing debate over the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits sitting officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments. Reports in apnews.com and www.nytimes.com have highlighted investigations into whether Trump’s business interests—including the use of luxury jets potentially linked to Qatari officials—violated these provisions. As Trump’s campaign activity ramps up, watchdog groups and lawmakers like Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Jon Ossoff are expected to push for tighter oversight and transparency on candidate and officeholder travel.

The symbolic gravitas of Air Force One and the presidential fleet remains central. The much-anticipated delivery of two new www.boeing.com aircraft designated as the next Air Force One is slated for late 2025, after years of delays and budget overruns. This upgrade, frequently discussed by media figures such as Ben Shapiro and Brit Hume, will likely become a flashpoint for debates about government spending, security, and the optics of presidential travel in an era of heightened economic inequality (www.nytimes.com).

Meanwhile, Trump’s own nypost.com—dubbed “Trump Force One”—continues to serve as both a campaign asset and a lightning rod for controversy, especially amid swirling rumors about foreign ties and funding sources, including Qatar. Media outlets like www.thedailybeast.com and nypost.com have amplified these narratives, fueling public fascination and partisan debate.

Influential commentators such as Jon Stewart and platforms like Truth Social also shape public perception, often using aviation stories as metaphors for broader issues of class, privilege, and access. As the 2025 race escalates, the voices shaping these narratives—across traditional and new media—are likely to determine how Americans perceive the legitimacy and ethics of their leaders’ airborne lifestyles.

Looking ahead, the convergence of global players (notably Qatar), new aviation technology, and intensifying political campaigns will keep the discussion of class, voice, and influence in U.S. political aviation in the spotlight well into 2025 and beyond. Continued media scrutiny and legislative action are expected as transparency and accountability remain top voter concerns.

Dimulai dari Grand Prix Emilia-Romagna 2025, F1 akan mengimplementasikan sistem energi rendah karbon secara menyeluruh di area paddock.

Langkah ini menandai penggunaan sistem energi terpusat pertama dari mitra energi F1, Aggreko, yang menggabungkan energi terbarukan seperti hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), panel surya, dan sistem penyimpanan energi baterai (BESS).

Teknologi ini diharapkan mampu menekan emisi karbon hingga 90 persen dibandingkan sistem konvensional yang menggunakan generator diesel terpisah di tiap tim dan area teknis.

“Kami tetap pada jalur menuju Net Zero 2030. Teknologi dan inovasi seperti ini membuktikan bahwa pertumbuhan bisa tetap berkelanjutan tanpa mengorbankan performa atau pengalaman penonton,” ujar Ellen Jones, Head of ESG Formula 1.

Truk Biofuel dan Logistik Rendah Emisi

Selain sistem energi paddock, Formula 1 juga kembali menggunakan 37 truk logistik berbahan bakar biofuel milik DHL selama tur Eropa.

Penggunaan truk ini tahun lalu terbukti mampu mengurangi emisi logistik rata-rata hingga 83 persen, dibandingkan dengan penggunaan bahan bakar fosil biasa.

Langkah ini merupakan bagian dari kerja sama jangka panjang F1 dengan DHL sebagai mitra logistik resmi, yang bertujuan menekan emisi karbon tanpa mengganggu kelancaran operasional antar sirkuit.

F2 dan F3 Jadi Pelopor Bahan Bakar Berkelanjutan

Tahun ini, Formula 2 dan Formula 3 juga sudah sepenuhnya menggunakan bahan bakar berkelanjutan 100 persen, setelah sebelumnya hanya 55 persen di musim 2024.

Bahan bakar ini dikembangkan oleh Aramco dan disiapkan untuk dipakai di mobil F1 mulai musim 2026 dengan mesin hybrid generasi terbaru.

Menariknya, bahan bakar ini dikembangkan sebagai “drop-in fuel”, artinya dapat digunakan pada mobil jalan raya tanpa perlu modifikasi, menjadikannya solusi global yang berpotensi besar untuk mengurangi emisi di industri otomotif secara luas.

Investasi di Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Formula 1 juga memperluas upaya keberlanjutan ke sektor penerbangan dengan investasi besar di Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Pada musim 2024, penggunaan SAF dalam kerja sama dengan DHL dan Qatar Airways mampu mengurangi emisi hingga 80 persen per penerbangan, dan menghindarkan lebih dari 8.000 ton CO2e, setara dengan pengurangan 19 persen emisi dari seluruh penerbangan ke luar Eropa.

Dengan mengusung tema Enhancing Productivity While Maintaining Sustainability Standards in Palm Oil Plantation, Jatmiko menekankan pentingnya produktivitas yang sejalan dengan prinsip keberlanjutan.

Dalam pemaparannya, Jatmiko menyampaikan bahwa proses transformasi PalmCo dimulai sejak pemerintah menginisiasi penggabungan sejumlah PTPN pada Desember 2023, membentuk entitas baru bernama PTPN IV PalmCo. Langkah konsolidasi ini membawa perubahan besar yang mencakup sistem kerja, budaya organisasi, hingga pola operasional.

“Kami menghadapi tantangan signifikan, mulai dari perbedaan budaya perusahaan hingga ketergantungan industri terhadap tenaga kerja. Maka, perubahan ini dilakukan menyeluruh dari hulu ke hilir,” tutur Jatmiko.

PalmCo kini menjadi perusahaan perkebunan kelapa sawit terbesar di dunia dari sisi luas lahan, dengan aset tersebar di berbagai wilayah Indonesia, termasuk Sumatera, Jawa, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, dan sebagian Papua.

Meski demikian, Jatmiko menekankan bahwa keberhasilan sektor perkebunan tidak hanya ditentukan oleh skala lahan atau kondisi alam, tetapi bergantung pada pengelolaan manusia yang bijak dan bertanggung jawab terhadap sumber daya.

Sebagai bagian dari upaya modernisasi, PalmCo mengimplementasikan digitalisasi menyeluruh dalam proses bisnisnya melalui sistem PalmCo Business Cockpit, platform ERP berbasis SAP yang mengintegrasikan seluruh data operasional untuk mendukung pengambilan keputusan secara real-time.

“Platform ini menjadi sumber informasi utama (single source of truth) yang memastikan akurasi dan akuntabilitas setiap keputusan manajerial,” jelasnya. Selain berorientasi bisnis, PalmCo juga mengemban misi sosial sebagai BUMN dengan mendukung program Peremajaan Sawit Rakyat (PSR). Perusahaan ditargetkan merealisasikan replanting seluas 60.000 hektare hingga 2026, mencakup 120.000 petani dan keluarganya. Hingga saat ini, 20.000 hektare lahan telah berhasil direkomendasikan untuk program tersebut.

“Kami percaya bahwa keterlibatan petani adalah kunci keberhasilan transformasi ini. Karena itu, kami aktif mendorong penggunaan bibit unggul bersertifikat dan memberantas peredaran bibit palsu,” tegas Jatmiko.

Menurutnya, langkah ini memberikan dampak positif bagi semua pihak: petani memperoleh hasil panen lebih baik, sementara pabrik mendapatkan bahan baku berkualitas tinggi yang meningkatkan efisiensi.

PalmCo juga memberdayakan pelaku UMKM lokal melalui penyediaan alat panen. Di beberapa wilayah operasional, alat panen kini diproduksi oleh koperasi lokal yang terdiri dari pandai besi binaan perusahaan.

Dalam aspek lingkungan, PalmCo mencatatkan kemajuan lewat pembangunan 11 unit Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Biogas (PLTBg) dengan total kapasitas 12,05 MW.

Metafuels is partnering with Evos Rotterdam to advance development of the plant, named Turbe. Evos, one of Europe’s leading storage companies for liquid energy and chemicals, brings vital infrastructure and operational expertise to the collaboration, underlining its commitment to supporting innovative energy solutions.

This latest project builds on Metafuels’ growing presence across Europe, following the recent announcement of Pizol, a planned production facility in Denmark. Initially, the Rotterdam site will produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day, with a second-phase expansion set to increase capacity tenfold to 120,000 litres per day.

Strong Investment Backing and Infrastructure

Metafuels’ rapid expansion is supported by robust financial backing, having raised $22 million in just over two years. This includes a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, positioning the company among the best-funded SAF startups in Europe.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal—Europe’s largest ethanol storage provider and a dedicated multimodal methanol hub—offers full connectivity by vessel, barge, truck and rail. The facility can store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association (IMPCA) standards, making it an ideal location for Metafuels’ operations.

Advanced Technology for Scalable, Low-Carbon Aviation Fuel

Metafuels’ patented aerobrew process converts renewable methanol into jet fuel with high energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion, resulting in a drop-in fuel that reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 90 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Crucially, it requires no changes to existing aircraft or airport infrastructure.

The technology is flexible, capable of processing both bio-methanol—derived from biological waste—and e-methanol, produced using renewable electricity and captured carbon. This versatility enables the production of both bio-SAF and e-SAF, or a combination of the two, in response to market dynamics.

The need for such innovation is critical. Aviation currently accounts for more than 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions—approximately 800 million tonnes. When additional greenhouse gases and climate factors are considered, the sector’s total contribution to global warming increases to around 3.5 percent.

Aligning with EU Net-Zero Mandates

Development of the Turbe facility is progressing steadily, with key milestones already achieved. The next step is the launch of front-end engineering and design, with a final investment decision expected in mid-2026.

The project supports major European decarbonisation initiatives, including RefuelEU Aviation and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Synthetic SAF is expected to play a pivotal role in meeting the EU’s climate goals, with the bloc’s sub-mandate for synthetic fuels set to begin at 1.2 percent in 2030 and increase to 35 percent by 2050.

Leadership Commentary

Saurabh Kapoor, CEO of Metafuels, stated:

“We have made excellent progress with our technology, and this first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward in its deployment. We are very excited about our cooperation with Evos as we work towards delivering the Turbe project. Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

Christiaan Kop, managing director at Evos Rotterdam, added:

“Metafuels is addressing one of the aviation sector’s most urgent challenges. With our infrastructure and operational expertise, we are well positioned to support this sustainable aviation fuel project. This partnership reflects our commitment to scalable, efficient solutions that will drive the industry’s net-zero transition.”

Boudewijn Siemons, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam, also welcomed the development:

“We are delighted that Metafuels has chosen Rotterdam for this new e-SAF facility. Their partnership with Evos and use of existing methanol infrastructure supports our climate goals and strengthens the port’s position as a leading renewable fuels hub.”

This development signals a major step in Europe’s efforts to decarbonise aviation and establishes Rotterdam as a key player in the future of sustainable flight.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-05-17 12:57:02.827374

Dalam forum internasional industri sawit yang dihadiri oleh berbagai pelaku industri hingga regulator global ini, Jatmiko memaparkan langkah transformasi dengan mengangkat tema Enhancing Productivity While Maintaining Sustainability Standards in Palm Oil Plantation.

Mengawali paparannya, Jatmiko menjelaskan bahwa fondasi transformasi PalmCo bermula dari keputusan pemerintah pada Desember 2023 untuk menggabungkan sejumlah entitas PT Perkebunan Nusantara ke dalam satu entitas besar bernama PTPN IV PalmCo. Merger besar ini membawa konsekuensi perubahan masif, baik dari sisi sistem, budaya, hingga operasional di lapangan.

“Kami menghadapi tantangan besar di awal, mulai dari disparitas budaya kerja, sistem manajemen yang tidak seragam, hingga realita bahwa industri ini sangat bergantung pada tenaga kerja atau labor intensive. Transformasi ini harus dilakukan dari hulu ke hilir,” ujar Jatmiko.

Lebih lanjut, ia menyebut bahwa saat ini PTPN IV PalmCo merupakan perusahaan perkebunan kelapa sawit dengan luas areal terbesar di dunia. Aset perkebunan perusahaan tersebar di berbagai wilayah, mulai dari Sumatera, Jawa, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, hingga sebagian kecil di Papua.

Namun, menurut Jatmiko keberhasilan pengelolaan perkebunan tidak semata ditentukan oleh luasan lahan, jenis tanaman atau iklim melainkan ini tentang manusia, bagaimana cara menyikapi dan merawat tanaman, serta mengelola sumber daya secara bijak.

Sebagai bagian dari transformasi, manajemen PalmCo sejak awal telah mendorong digitalisasi proses bisnis secara menyeluruh. Salah satu terobosannya adalah pengembangan sistem PalmCo Business Cockpit, sebuah platform digital berbasis ERP SAP yang menyatukan data operasional perusahaan dan memungkinkan pengambilan keputusan secara real-time.

“Sistem ini kami rancang sebagai single source of truth, yang memastikan bahwa seluruh data dan keputusan manajerial memiliki dasar yang akurat dan dapat dipertanggungjawabkan,” kata Jatmiko.

Lebih lanjut, PalmCo juga mengemban peran strategis sebagai BUMN yang berpihak pada masyarakat. Salah satunya diwujudkan dalam dukungan terhadap program Peremajaan Sawit Rakyat (PSR).

Jatmiko menyampaikan bahwa pemerintah menargetkan PalmCo untuk mendukung penanaman kembali 60.000 hektare lahan plasma hingga 2026 sebagai dukungan terhadap sekitar 120.000 petani dan keluarga. Hingga tahun ini, perusahaan telah berhasil merealisasikan penerbitan rekomendasi atas 20.000 hektare program PSR bersama petani mitra.

“Transformasi kami tidak bisa dilakukan sendirian. Kami menyadari pentingnya keterlibatan masyarakat, terutama petani sawit. Karena itu, kami juga aktif memerangi peredaran bibit palsu dengan mendorong penggunaan bibit unggul bersertifikat. Ini kami lakukan untuk memastikan produktivitas petani bisa meningkat secara signifikan,” tuturnya.

Menurut Jatmiko, langkah ini sangat menguntungkan semua pihak. Bagi petani, peningkatan hasil panen berarti peningkatan pendapatan. Sementara bagi pelaku industri, mereka akan menerima Tandan Buah Segar (TBS) dengan kualitas prima yang mendukung produktivitas dan efisiensi pabrik kelapa sawit.

Tidak hanya itu, PalmCo juga memberdayakan UMKM lokal melalui program penyediaan alat panen. Jatmiko menyebut bahwa saat ini sebagaian alat panen di salah satu Regional PalmCo diproduksi oleh para pandai besi lokal yang tergabung dalam koperasi binaan.

PalmCo juga mencatatkan tonggak prestasi dalam inisiatif dekarbonisasi dan circular economy. Hingga saat ini, PalmCo telah mengoperasikan 11 unit Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Biogas (PLTBg) dengan total kapasitas 12,05 MW. Ke depan, Perusahaan akan membangun 29 unit fasilitas Bio-CNG hingga 2030 dan satu unit Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang ditargetkan mulai beroperasi pada 2027.

“Beberapa waktu lalu, kami juga mendapat apresiasi dari Menteri Lingkungan Hidup yang bekunjung ke salah satuuni amiyaiu KS Lubuk Dalam yang berada di iak, Riau karena menjadi Perusahaan perkebunan pertama di Indonesia yang meraih Sertifikat Penurunan Emisi Gas Rumah Kaca (SPE-GRK). Ini merupakan bentuk pengakuan atas upaya serius kami menjalankan agenda dekarbonisasi,” ujar Jatmiko.

Ia menambahkan bahwa inisiatif dekarbonisasi ini tidak hanya berdampak pada penurunan emisi karbon, tetapi juga berkontribusi besar terhadap peningkatan citra industri sawit Indonesia di mata global khususnya Eropa.

“Dekarbonisasi sangat penting untuk memperkuat persepsi bahwa industri kelapa sawit kita adalah industri yang peduli lingkungan, berkelanjutan, dan siap memenuhi tuntutan pasar global yang makin ketat.

Rencana Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) menerapkan program mandatori bioavtur atau Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) berpotensi membuat harga tiket pesawat melonjak.

Pengamat Penerbangan, Alvin Lie, mengatakan kebijakan tersebut harus didiskusikan bersama Kementerian Perhubungan dan asosiasi maskapai (INACA), karena akan berdampak besar pada biaya operasional maskapai.

""Pada ujung-ujungnya ini akan berdampak pada harga tiket yang akan naik sangat signifikan,"" ungkapnya saat dihubungi kumparan, Sabtu (17/5).

Alvin mencontohkan, Singapura akan mewajibkan maskapai menggunakan bioavtur dengan campuran 1 persen mulai tahun ini. Kenaikan biaya dibebankan kepada tiket pesawat yang akan naik hingga USD 50.

""Itu akan berdampak kepada setiap tiket yang berangkat dari Singapura ada kenaikan USD 30 sampai 50. Bayangkan kalau ini diberlakukan di Indonesia, harga tiket akan naiknya luar biasa,"" tegasnya.

Namun, berbeda dengan Singapura, Alvin menyebutkan pemerintah Indonesia membatasi pergerakan harga tiket pesawat domestik melalui kebijakan tarif batas atas (TBA).

Jika mandatori bioavtur berlaku, maka dia meminta agar Kementerian Perhubungan menghitung kembali kebijakan TBA dengan menyesuaikan kenaikan biaya operasional maskapai.

""Kalau tarif batas atasnya tidak dinaikkan, saya yakin maskapai-maskapai penerbangan tidak akan mampu bertahan hidup dan pada ujung-ujungnya ini akan membunuh industri transportasi Indonesia,"" kata Alvin.

Di sisi lain, ketika harga tiket dinaikkan secara signifikan, Alvin meyakini pasar tidak akan kuat untuk menopang beban tersebut sehingga otomatis mengurangi peminat transportasi udara.

""Akan terjadi masalah besar di sini, dalam kondisi seperti ini saja pengguna jasa transportasi udara merasakan bahwa harga tiket Indonesia ini masih tinggi, berharap harga tiket kita bisa lebih turun. Ini kalau dipaksakan tidak akan terjangkau,"" jelasnya.

Dengan demikian, dia mengusulkan Kementerian ESDM dapat menurunkan biaya produksi bioavtur agar setara dengan harga avtur konvensional, sebab jika harganya lebih mahal akan sangat berat bagi industri penerbangan.

""Satu-satunya jalan kalau ini mau dilaksanakan adalah harga avtur itu menjadi standar harga SAF. Jadi harga SAF tidak lebih mahal daripada harga avtur biasa,"" ujar Alvin.

Senada, Pengamat Penerbangan Gatot Rahardjo mengatakan dampak pengenaan mandatori bioavtur kepada industri penerbangan nasional tergantung pada fluktuasi harganya.

""Berdasarkan pengalaman, harga bioavtur bisa beberapa kali lipat dari avtur konvensional. Dengan kondisi sekarang, beban itu nanti akan ditanggung maskapai karena itu akan membuat biaya meningkat, sementara tarif batas atas tidak berubah,"" jelasnya.

Jika pemerintah akan merevisi TBA, lanjut dia, maka kenaikan beban dari mandatori bioavtur mau tidak mau akan ditanggung penumpang. Selain itu, Gatot juga menilai pemerintah perlu memastikan pasokan bioavtur tersedia di seluruh bandara. Jika persiapan tidak matang, maka maskapai akan menanggung beban yang berat.

India’s ethanol policy must align with Atmanirbhar Bharat, emphasising self-reliance while selectively embracing global collaboration in R&D, innovation, and technology transfer.
With forward-looking policy, industry commitment, and technology adoption, ethanol can evolve into a multi-dimensional, low-carbon energy platform.
The next phase of India’s ethanol journey must be bold, inclusive, and transformative – anchored in sustainability, resilience, and national self-reliance.","The Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme has been one of the biggest success stories in India’s quest to achieve sustainability. Over the past few years, blending of ethanol increased from 12.06% in ESY 2022-23 to 19.7 per cent in April 2025, showing the right policy framework by the Government and a remarkable support from the sugar and ethanol industry. India’s ethanol drive has so far added Rs 1,07,580 crore to farmers’ earnings while saving Rs 1,26,210 crore in foreign exchange by curbing crude oil imports.

With India achieving the E20 target ahead of target, the conversation has now shifted towards achieving a potential 30% target by 2030. Achieving this vision will require scalable infrastructure, flexible feedstock usage, and consistent policy frameworks that support sustainable pricing and growth across the value chain.

To transition beyond the 20% ethanol blending milestone, India must adopt a forward-looking roadmap centred on advanced biofuel technologies and integrated systems thinking. A key pillar of this vision is the large-scale deployment of Second-Generation (2G) ethanol technologies that convert agricultural residues into fuel, thus avoiding food-versus-fuel conflicts while enhancing environmental sustainability and food security.

Simultaneously, a faster rollout of Flex-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) capable of operating on higher ethanol blends is critical. These vehicles serve as an important bridge between conventional fossil fuel systems and a low-carbon future, offering cleaner, more flexible mobility options.

Creating ethanol-integrated bio-hubs in sugarcane-rich regions is another enabler. These hubs, combining ethanol production with co-generation of bioelectricity, biogas, and biofertilizers, represent a model for resource-efficient, circular rural economies.

Sugar Industry at the Heart of Ethanol Growth

The Indian sugar industry continues to be the foundation of the ethanol economy. Companies like Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd (TEIL) have emerged as key contributors to India’s ethanol production ambitions. TEIL’s investments in dual-feed distilleries and cutting-edge ethanol technologies have significantly bolstered national blending targets.

TEIL operates advanced distillation facilities across Uttar Pradesh. It has state-of-the-art distilleries spread across Muzaffarnagar (MZN) – 2 facilities, Sabitgarh (SBT), Milak Narayanpur (MNP), Rani Nangal (RNG) and Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. These facilities have the capability to produce Ethanol, Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA), Rectified Spirit (RS) and Denatured Spirit (SDS). TEIL utilises a mix of sugarcane-based feedstocks as well as grain. Distillers Dried Grain Solubles (DDGS), a co-product produced on grain operations is also sold to premium Institutions and it also manufactures Indian Made Indian Liquor (IMIL) and Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL).

TEIL has also increased its sugarcane crushing capacity from 61,000 TCD to 63,000 TCD for Sugar Season 2024–25, further supporting upstream integration.

Overcoming Bottlenecks

Scaling beyond E20 will require resolving structural challenges—chief among them, feedstock diversification. Continued dependence on sugarcane and surplus FCI rice is unsustainable. India must aggressively promote maize and other non-food biomass to ensure supply chain resilience. Companies like TEIL, with feedstock-diverse distillation infrastructure, play a vital role in this transition, but long-term viability depends on pricing models that reflect input cost realities.

Policy measures will also be pivotal—rationalising GST for FFVs (5%), introducing differential pricing for ethanol fuels, and achieving Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) parity with electric vehicles can unlock consumer adoption. A pricing mechanism linked to the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane can provide the predictability needed for sustained producer investments.

Further, India must invest in innovation—spanning ethanol-to-hydrogen pathways, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, and carbon capture—to expand ethanol’s utility beyond blending and into broader clean energy use cases.

Balancing Global Pressures with Domestic Priorities

As blending levels rise, international trade dynamics are growing more complex. The United States is seeking greater access to the Indian ethanol market, particularly for fuel-grade imports. However, large-scale imports contradict the foundational goals of India’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme—namely, strengthening domestic agriculture and reducing foreign exchange outflows.

India’s ethanol policy must align with Atmanirbhar Bharat, emphasising self-reliance while selectively embracing global collaboration in R&D, innovation, and technology transfer.

A Transformative Opportunity

Ultimately, the road beyond E20 is not just a matter of volume but of vision. Ethanol sits at the confluence of India’s energy, agricultural, and climate goals. With forward-looking policy, industry commitment, and technology adoption, ethanol can evolve into a multi-dimensional, low-carbon energy platform. For leaders like TEIL, sustaining this momentum requires a stable policy environment, feedstock viability, and long-term pricing mechanisms that support continued innovation and capacity growth.

IAG has grown through many mergers and is now one of the most significant forces in the global aviation industry.

Read this article to discover five fascinating facts about IAG that define its history and position it at the forefront of European aviation. These include how IAG has become so large, an interesting failed merger, its environmental leadership, and more.

5 Formed From Several Mergers and Acquisitions

IAG brings together several airlines and cargo carriers under a single umbrella.

IAG is now formed of seven key airlines. Further subsidiaries, such as Aer Lingus Regional and BA CityFlyer, raise this total further. It has reached this size through mergers, acquisitions, and even the founding of new airlines. The group began through a merger between British Airways and Iberia, which was completed in January 2011. The two airlines began trading together with the new holding company name IAG.

One of the airline group's most substantial acquisitions was Aer Lingus in 2015, the culmination of Ireland's flag carrier's privatization (2006-2015). IAG paid 1.36 billion euros to acquire Aer Lingus, succeeding with the third attempt. Due to European Commission regulations, this deal almost fell through, but Aer Lingus and IAG successfully made concessions to ensure the market remained competitive. Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, said:

""By obtaining significant concessions from the airlines the Commission has ensured that air passengers will continue to have a choice of airlines at competitive prices after IAG's takeover of Aer Lingus. The five million passengers travelling each year from Dublin and Belfast to London will be able to choose among several strong carriers.""

The first airline created from scratch by IAG was Iberia Express, serving as a subsidiary of Iberia. This carrier operates short and medium-haul routes from Madrid-Barajas Airport that act as feeder flights into Iberia's long-haul network. More recently, IAG created the airline Fly LEVEL SL (LEVEL). This airline entered insolvency in 2020. However, it was revived with IAG confirming plans to acquire an independent air operator's certificate (AOC) for LEVEL in December 2024, allowing the airline to act as a standalone carrier.

4 IAG Botched an Attempt to Acquire Air Europa

European Commission concerns caused the planned acquisition of Air Europa to fall through.

Since its foundation, IAG has been slowly expanding through mergers and acquisitions. However, it hasn't always been successful in pulling these off. In November 2019, IAG launched its attempt to acquire Air Europa, the third-largest Spanish airline, behind Iberia and Vueling. It wanted to pay a billion euros to the airline's owner, Globalia, and aimed to close the deal during 2020 before integrating Air Europa's assets into Iberia.

Negotiations continued until 2021, when both parties agreed the price would be halved due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The deal eventually fell through in the winter of 2021, and both parties sought ways to re-enter negotiations. For example, IAG acquired a 20% stake in Air Europa in August 2022. Things appeared to be moving again in February 2023, when IAG agreed to purchase the airline for 400 million euros.

However, the European Commission stood in its way. The regulator argued that the deal would severely reduce competition in Spanish domestic and cross-Atlantic aviation, and found IAG's efforts to mitigate these concerns insufficient. By August 2024, IAG announced that the European Union's demands were excessive and abandoned the merger permanently. Instead, the airline group announced plans to develop Madrid Airport to rival Europe's major hubs.

3 IAG Has Led In Green Aviation

It is the world's first airline group to make a net-zero commitment for 2050.

IAG is leading the way in aligning the aviation industry with current concerns regarding climate change. It was the first airline group in the world to pledge net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. IAG publishes a ""road map"" each year to update its customers and the industry on its progress towards net-zero. The airline group has also pledged that its airlines will use 10% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030.

Beyond choosing better aviation fuel, IAG has three pillars to its net-zero strategy. Firstly, it plans to invest 12.6 billion euros in new, more efficient aircraft from 2025-2029. This will provide the airline group with 171 new aircraft. IAG estimates that the planes it invests in will reduce fuel use by 15-40%. IAG will also invest in carbon removal solutions to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it. Finally, IAG has invested in market-based carbon offsets since 2012. The airlines group participates in the EU, UK, and Swiss ETS schemes, and supports the global CORSIA scheme.

However, IAG has received some criticism for its net-zero pledges. According to The Guardian, environmental campaigners have called such pledges ""essentially meaningless."" They have shared concerns that the focus is too heavy on offsetting emissions rather than drastically reducing them. IAG has also come under fire due to widespread accusations that the aviation industry is lobbying officials to weaken environmental regulations. More analysis is needed to understand if IAG's pledges are genuine, or simply ""greenwashing"".

IAG's environmental commitments aren't limited to preventing climate change, which is one of several environmental concerns the aviation industry contributes to. In 2025, it aims to hit the ""5 by 2025"" waste targets. These targets are to reduce on-board passenger waste by 20%, office waste by 50% per employee, maintenance waste per unit of activity by 25%, and cargo waste per unit of cargo by 25%. IAG is also aiming for a zero-based approach to single-use plastic.

2 IAG Operates a Loyalty Scheme

You can collect Avios points to have your loyalty rewarded across the group.

When Iberia and British Airways began IAG, they also merged their frequent flyer programs, Air Miles, BA Miles, and Iberia Plus Points. The result was Avios, a frequent-flier scheme that you can use across most of IAG. It is also available for some airlines in the OneWorld alliance, such as Qatar Airways. This carrier switched to Avios as its primary currency in March 2022. Finnair and Loganair have also adopted Avios.

There are many ways that you can collect Avios that aren't limited to booking flights. Avios points can be earned through online shopping, hotel bookings, and more with IAG's partners outside the aviation industry. Likewise, you don't have to spend your Avios points on flights. They can also be used for hotel stays and car rentals, meaning they have many uses throughout your holiday or travels.

Another great advantage of Avios for IAG customers is that they are not locked into one person's account. You can create a household account to share Avios points with up to six household members. It is also possible to transfer Avios to friends and family not in your household.

1 IAG is the Fourth-Largest Airline Group by Market Cap

The group is smaller than Ryanair, United Airlines Holdings, and Delta Air Lines.

In February 2025, Simple Flying reported on the ten largest airline groups by market cap. Analysis of data from Companies Market Cap, listing 71 publicly traded companies in the aviation sector, ranked IAG at fourth with a market cap of $20.49 billion.

The large size of this market cap, indicating successful trading, was put down to diversified strategy, strong brand identity, and popular sustainability initiatives.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/main-image-16_9-3-3.png,N,,2025-05-17 13:56:13.785459

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for Travel & Tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors.
From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear: every business can contribute.
Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector.
With Travel & Tourism forecast to generate $16.5TN and support over 460MN jobs by 2035, scaling up sustainable fuel isn’t just an environmental challenge.","Dhaka: The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, has today launched a bold new framework urging the entire Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges: scaling up the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said “Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3pc of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25BN litres today to over 450BN litres. That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonisation options, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ solution. It works with existing engines and aircraft. But high production costs, limited infrastructure, and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high – up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for Travel & Tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear: every business can contribute.

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead.

It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

“ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway. The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF, in Asia, whilst Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5pc to 10pc blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

Ten travel startups raised $245 million over the past three weeks.

Electra is one of only a few electric plane startups to raise money this year. Most of the other fundraises over the last three weeks were less than $15 million. They were mostly startups in areas that are continuing to get funding — tech for hotels, business travel, and travel selling — even if many of the deals are small these days.

Electra: $115 Million

Electra, which is developing a hybrid-electric plane, has raised $115 million in series B funding.

Prysm Capital led the round. Other investors included Lockheed Martin Ventures, Honeywell, Safran, Statkraft Ventures, the Virginia Innovation Partnership Corporation, and private investors.

Virginia-based Electra (not to be confused with the electric vehicle charging or the iron refining startups with the same name) says its EL9 aircraft is meant to take off and land with 150 feet of runway space, roughly 10% of the space needed for traditional planes of a similar size.

It works by using eight electric propellers to blow air over large flaps on the wing, creating additional lift at lower speeds, and is paired with hybrid-electric propellers. “It operates with the landing and takeoff versatility of a helicopter, the quiet of an electric vehicle, and the cost advantage and safety of a fixed-wing, fixed-propeller aircraft,” according to the company.

The aircraft is designed to carry up to 3,000 pounds and travel up to 1,100 nautical miles. The battery charges in-flight.

For commercial use, the goal is to connect smaller communities that lack traditional aviation infrastructure, as well as accommodate areas with strict noise restrictions. The company also aims to enter the cargo and defense markets.

The company says it has secured more than 2,200 pre-orders valued at over $10 billion. The funding will support pre-production and certification.

Hy2gen: $52.3 million

Hy2gen, which is developing tech to produce renewable jet fuel, has raised $52.3 million.

Hy24 led the round, with support from Technip Energies and the fund BenDa (owned by Hy2gen board chair Dana Kallasch).

Germany-based Hy2gen is designing, building, and operating production plants for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other products derived from renewable hydrogen.

The company earlier this year signed an agreement with Vinci Airports to supply SAF to commercial airlines operating at the Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport in France by 2030.

Fora Travel: $40 Million

Fora Travel, a travel agency that is recruiting newbies as salespeople, has raised $40 million in series C funding. The company did not announce its series B round of $20 million in 2023.

Thrive Capital and Insight Partners co-led the latest two rounds, with support from previous investors Forerunner Ventures and Heartcore Capital.

New York City-based Fora Travel said it works with thousands of travel advisors, 97% of whom are new to the industry. The company recruits them as gig workers and says it provides them training and tools to grow a business. The company provides a tech platform that its travel advisors use to complete bookings on behalf of consumers.

The company says its portfolio includes nearly 6,000 hotels and that it has booked over $1 billion in travel, including 2 million room nights, since it was founded just over three years ago.

Tern: $13 Million

Tern, a booking platform for travel advisors, has raised $13 million in series A funding.

Viewpoint Ventures and Haystack VC led the round, with support from Upfront Ventures.

The startup in 2023 raised a seed round of $4 million led by Upfront Ventures.

Tern, based in the U.S., says its platform includes an AI assistant, trip planner, invoicing, and AI products to generate city guides and packing lists. It’s meant to simplify multiple fragmented office tasks with a single platform.

The platform launched publicly this week with more than 5,000 users and more than 1,000 agency clients, the startup said.

The funding will go toward strengthening AI automation, payments, agency tools, and customer service.

ROH: $9.2 Million

ROH, a payments platform for hotels, has raised $9.2 million. Highgate Technology Ventures and Acrew Capital led the round.

New York City-based ROH says its platform is meant to help hotels automate payment processing, receipt sending, and refund management from a variety of buyers. It also manages legal compliance and payment reminders

Select Highgate properties have been piloting ROH over the past two years. The funding will go toward business expansion and strengthening the product.

Hotiday: $6.1 Million

Hotiday, which works with hotels to sell unbooked rooms, has raised $6.1 million (€5.5 million). P101 led the funding, with support from 40Jemz and a group of angel investors.

Milan-based Hotiday says it partners with more than 65 European companies, including hotel group TH Resorts. Users who book rooms through Hotiday can access online check-in and an app to book ticketed activities.

The startup says it has seen 500% revenue growth since 2023. The funding will go toward expanding its portfolio in Europe, expanding services, establishing new partnerships, and hiring.

S4labour: $5.2 Million

S4labour, which provides a workforce management platform for hotels, has raised $5.2 million (€4.7 million).

YFM Equity Partners led the investment.

England-based S4labour says its platform helps hotels and restaurants streamline workforce management, scheduling, payroll, and human resources. It has more than 250 clients.

The funding will go toward business expansion and product development.

Roamr: $2.3 Million

Roamr, which incentivizes business travelers to stay with a colleague or friend instead of booking a hotel, has raised $2.3 million as a pre-seed extension. The startup raised $639,000 in September.

The funding comes from a group of angel investors.

Ireland-based Roamr works by providing client companies with an estimated cost to book a hotel in a business traveler’s destination city. If the traveler is able to stay with a person instead, then the client, the traveler, and the host each get 30% of that estimated cost. Roamr gets the remaining 10%.

The funding will go toward expanding in the U.S. and building out tech.

Visa2Fly: $2 Million

Visa2Fly, which streamlines visa applications for travelers, has raised $2 million in seed funding.

M Venture Partners led the round, with support from Flipkart Ventures, FinSight Ventures, and Thinkuvate.

Bob Ferguson signs funding bills passed by the state Legislature into law.

In March 2023, officials announced plans for the center to be established at Paine Field by 2027. The purpose of the joint venture between Snohomish County and Washington State University would be to collect sustainable aviation fuel samples from around the world and then test them for safety, performance and chemical similarity to conventional jet fuel.

Sen. Marko Liias, D-Everett, helped secure an initial $6.5 state Department of Transportation grant.

Now the center has secured a $10 million anonymous gift, and an additional $10 million legislative appropriation was approved by state lawmakers in a funding package that has yet to be signed by Ferguson, said Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers.

“The new funding will help make the center a reality,” he said.

The new $10 million appropriation is included in the $78 billion two-year budget approved by the state Legislature. Ferguson is expected to approve the budget but has the power to make line-item vetoes from the budget.

Mike Fong, chief of staff for Somers, said the county executive and team met with the governor a month ago, and Ferguson seemed very excited about the center.

“I’m confident he will approve it,” Fong said.

Brionna Aho, a spokesperson for Ferguson, said the governor is currently reviewing the budget with his team.

She did not offer any specifics on the governor’s decision but said he has until Tuesday to make a decision. That is the same day that Somers will speak at the Economic Alliance Snohomish County annual forecast at the Boeing Museum of Flight at Paine Field.

Fong said an 8-acre site has been chosen at Paine Field for the facility and that a multi-million contract is expected to be signed in the next several months with a firm for facility design work.

The tentative schedule is for design work to be completed by the end of 2026 with construction starting in 2027, according to Fong, who said the facility could take 18 months to complete. He said at least another $36 million would be needed to build the facility.

Sustainable aviation fuels are developed without fossil fuels, using plants, sewage and/or food.

The commercial aviation industry has pledged to transition to 100% use of sustainable fuel by 2050.

But it has a long way to meet that goal. Only several percent of the aviation fuel used today is sustainable, said Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab at Washington State University in Pullman.

He said a big issue is making the fuel more affordable. It can cost between two and five times the cost of conventional fuel.

The idea of the facility is to create job growth in Snohomish County, Fong said.

Brazil has taken a decisive step towards sustainability in aviation with a Chinese investment of US$1 billion — equivalent to around R$5,6 billion in direct conversion — aimed at the production of renewable fuel for aircraft, known as SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

According to information released this Monday (12), the contribution will be made by Envision Group, a Chinese company that also intends to install a research and development (R&D) center dedicated to renewable energy in the country.

The announcement came during President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's official visit to Beijing, his third in just over two years, and marked four meetings with Chinese executives from the sustainable energy and defense sectors.

“We concluded a hearing with an announcement of a US$1 billion investment for the production of SAF from sugarcane in Brazil. The country will become one of the largest producers of green aviation fuels,” said Minister Rui Costa, from the Civil House, who accompanied the presidential delegation.

Strategic investments for Brazil's energy future

In addition to the commitment to SAF, the agreements signed between Brazil and China cover several renewable energy projects, including initiatives in wind energy, solar energy, hybrid systems and energy storage technologies.

According to representatives of the Brazilian government and ApexBrasil, the investment in SAF is one of the largest ever announced for the sector in the country, demonstrating global interest in Brazil's potential for sustainable development.

Shanghai-based Envision Energy, a globally recognized leader in green technology, will be primarily responsible for the projects.

The company already works on innovative solutions, such as smart wind turbines and advanced energy storage systems, in addition to prioritizing the development of SAF in its global energy transition agenda.

The investment is the result of negotiations that began in 2024, with recent meetings in April of this year between Brazilian authorities and Chinese executives, aimed at exploring opportunities for partnership and joint technological development.

These conversations also addressed how to reduce production costs and integrate multiple renewable sources using cutting-edge technologies, including hybrid power systems, green hydrogen, green ammonia and large-scale wind turbines.

The new research center, which will be implemented in partnership between Senai Cimatec, a national reference in innovation, and Windey Energy Technology Group, a Chinese state-owned company that is a leader in wind turbines, will focus on the development and maintenance of technologies for large wind turbines, expanding Brazilian expertise in clean energy.

Sustainable aviation fuel: a revolution for the aviation sector

SAF is an innovative alternative to the fossil fuel currently used in commercial aviation.

It is produced from renewable raw materials, with processes that respect strict environmental sustainability criteria.

According to the National Bioenergy Union (UNICA), Brazil has unique conditions to lead the global production of this fuel, thanks to its favorable climate and the variety of natural resources available.

Among the raw materials used are sugar cane, oil palm, macauba, eucalyptus, soy, corn and even agave.

Studies show that the use of SAF can reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector by up to 80% compared to traditional kerosene, which represents a crucial step towards decarbonizing one of the most challenging sectors in terms of environmental impact.

According to research by Boeing, Brazil has the capacity to produce up to nine billion liters of sustainable fuel per year, which corresponds to 125% of the current fossil fuel consumption of the national aviation sector.

This production would come mainly from agro-industrial waste, such as sugarcane leftovers, eucalyptus residues, residual gases, as well as unusual raw materials such as beef tallow and used cooking oil, increasing the efficiency of the production cycle and contributing to the circular economy.

International panorama and challenges for Brazil

In the global context, the airline industry faces increasing pressure to adopt alternatives that reduce its environmental impact.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) highlights SAF as one of the most promising technologies to meet carbon neutrality goals by 2050.

However, for Brazil to achieve this leadership, it still needs to face challenges such as technological development, distribution infrastructure and the competitive cost of sustainable fuel in relation to fossil kerosene.

According to experts, recent investments — such as the Chinese contribution — are essential to accelerate these processes, bringing innovation and expanding international cooperation.

Furthermore, the strengthening of public policies, such as the Fuel of the Future Law, offers an important regulatory framework to stimulate the sector and guarantee legal security for investors.

Brazil, therefore, is at the forefront of a transformation that could redefine not only the national energy sector, but also the country's position in the global sustainable aviation scenario.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-photograph-of-a-modern-passenger-airpl_3IH1ZC90TIqQeFfrQmynqg_3a0QITLLTV6FfdqayOTUFg.jpeg,N,,2025-05-17 15:56:43.269382

The association, in a press release on Thursday, said that travel intermediaries including travel agents and tour operators accounted for 5 million euros’ worth of refund claims that are now part of Air Belgium’s bankruptcy proceedings.

The travel and tour operators’ group, which represents 80,000 travel agents and tour operators in Europe, further added that the bankruptcy incident highlighted travel intermediaries’ exposure to massive losses in case of airline bankruptcies.

Air Belgium’s outstanding passenger refund claims

Air Belgium announced that it would stop all scheduled passenger flights to focus on cargo and aircraft leasing operations in Sept. 2023. After the European airline’s declaration of bankruptcy, the passengers refund claims for its cancelled flights became a part of its bankruptcy proceedings.

In the case of Air Belgium’s cancelled flights that were booked through travel intermediaries, the responsibility to provide alternate travel arrangements fell on these intermediaries. Hence, the travel and tour operators had to provide alternate arrangements to its passengers with no prospect of recovering the original cancellation claims from the Belgian airline insolvency.

The association said that this places an “unfair financial burden” on travel intermediaries, who would have to bear the losses following airline failures as airline tickets need to be paid upfront.

Frank Oostdam, President of ECTAA said:

“The Air Belgium bankruptcy is yet another stark reminder that the current system leaves both consumers and travel intermediaries exposed to unacceptable risks. Airlines must be required to provide financial guarantees to cover their liabilities in case of insolvency.”

The ECTAA emphasised rising airline failures, calling for government support for failing airlines in Europe in terms of travel intermediaries. It further stated that there have been around 1,200 commercial passenger airline failures in the past 25 years.

The Air Passenger Rights Regulation (Regulation 261/2004) revision is currently up for discussion in the Council of the European Union. The association has urged the council to take this moment to consider adding mandatory protection measures that guarantee airline ticket refunds for flight cancellations owing to an airline ceasing operations or going bankrupt.

Air Belgium’s bankruptcy explained

The Belgian airline was established in 2016 for long-haul flights connecting Belgium with Asia.

On Sept. 18, 2023, Air Belgium announced that it would end its scheduled passenger flight service by October 2023 to focus on cargo and aircraft leasing operations.

To simplify it, the gap between the highest and lowest global oil demand forecasts is 0.6 mb/d for 2025 and 0.5 mb/d for 2026.","For decades, oil was the backbone of global transport. It powered nearly every vehicle, pushing oil demand ever higher. Infrastructure significantly grew around extraction, refining, and distribution. But with mounting concerns over emissions and climate change, the search for cleaner alternatives gained momentum. Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a game changer in this shift.

IEA recently published its Global EV Outlook 2025, where it has predicted,

By 2030, EVs are set to replace more than 5 million barrels of oil per day (mb/d) globally, with China’s expanding EV fleet making up half of that impact.

Let’s deep dive into this report and understand how the rise of EVs is impacting global oil demand.

The Rise of EVs and Its Impact on Global Oil Demand

By the end of 2024, the global electric car fleet reached nearly 58 million, more than triple the number in 2021. These EVs now make up about 4% of the global passenger car fleet.

The trend is strongest in China, where roughly 1 in 10 cars is electric. In Europe, the ratio is 1 in 20, but growing fast.

The UK, the second-largest car market in Europe, saw EVs take nearly 30% of new car sales in 2024. This rise was driven by the new Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which required 22% of new car registrations to be battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell models.

With flexible credit borrowing allowed, manufacturers achieved nearly 20% EV sales. Norway led with near-total electrification. 88% of new cars sold were fully electric, and another 3% were plug-in hybrids.

As a result, Norway’s oil demand from the road fell 12% from 2021 to 2024. Denmark also saw a big jump, with EVs reaching 56% of new car sales in 2024 and nearly 100,000 units sold.

Meanwhile, Denmark is also seeing strong progress. In the latest figures, the share of electric cars jumped by 10 percentage points, reaching 56%, with nearly 100,000 EVs sold.

Oil Demand Drops as EV Fleet Grows Rapidly

Surge in EVs on roads came heavy on the oil industry. IEA says that electric vehicles slashed oil demand by over 1.3 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2024.

It was a steep 30% jump from 2023, and the present figures are nearly equal to all the oil Japan currently uses for transportation.

Passenger cars and small vans classified as light-duty vehicles (LDVs) drive most of this shift. Today, they account for 80% of the oil displaced by EVs. By 2030, their share will slightly drop to 77% as electric trucks and buses gain traction.

This is because of the rapidly evolving batteries and stronger charging infrastructure, these heavy-duty vehicles will likely displace nearly 1 mb/d of oil within the decade.

EVs Cut Costs and Boost Energy Security

IEA analysts highlighted that even if global oil prices fall to $40 per barrel, EVs remain cost-effective especially with home charging. This way drivers can continue saving money by switching to electric vehicles.

In China, fast public charging costs about twice as much as charging at home. Yet, EVs still offer better fuel savings than gas-powered cars. As more people choose EVs, countries reduce their oil use and become less vulnerable to price shocks. This shift not only saves money but also strengthens national energy security.

Strong Policies Keep EV Adoption on Track

Although trade tensions, slow economic growth, and oil price drops may hurt overall car sales, these issues affect the market size more than the EV share. In China, steady government support and affordable EV prices continue to drive sales forward.

Meanwhile, in Europe, even though EVs cost more than traditional cars, long-term policies and past crisis responses help keep the market moving.

Additionally, Norway planned to raise taxes on traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) from April. This was meant to boost EV sales and help the country reach its goal of 100% zero-emission car sales by the end of 2025.

The 2025 EV outlook shows strong momentum. Despite economic uncertainty, EVs continue to grow thanks to smart policies, lower battery costs, and better infrastructure. As countries push for cleaner transportation, EVs are helping the world move toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future.

With over 58 million electric cars already on the road by the end of 2024—and more to come—the transition is well underway. This shift not only transforms the oil market but also puts the world on a clearer, more energy-secure path forward.

Global Oil Demand: What the Forecasts Say

We found the latest oil demand forecast in the International Energy Forum’s monthly comparative analysis of the oil market report. It highlights the following:

OPEC

OPEC expects oil demand to grow by around 1.3 million barrels per day (mb/d) in both 2025 and 2026. Almost all this growth will come from non-OECD countries, where demand is expected to rise by 1.2 mb/d each year. In contrast, OECD countries will see only a small increase of 0.1 mb/d annually.

EIA

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently increased its 2025 forecast by 0.1 mb/d compared to last month. It now expects demand to rise by 1.0 mb/d next year. However, this is 0.4 mb/d lower than the estimate made in January 2025. For 2026, the EIA sees demand rising more slowly, by 0.9 mb/d.

IEA

The IEA has a more cautious view. It expects global oil demand to grow by 0.7 mb/d in 2025, even though OECD demand may fall by about 120,000 barrels per day. For 2026, the IEA sees demand increasing by 0.8 mb/d. According to its latest data, average yearly demand growth between 2022 and 2024 was just 0.3 mb/d.

To simplify it, the gap between the highest and lowest global oil demand forecasts is 0.6 mb/d for 2025 and 0.5 mb/d for 2026. These differences highlight the uncertainty that still surrounds future oil demand.

Furthermore, as electric vehicles gain popularity, governments are starting to feel the financial impact. Fuel taxes, which have been a key source of public funding for roads and transport, are shrinking. In 2022 alone, the global shift to EVs resulted in an estimated $9 billion drop in fuel tax revenues.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2454822329.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 05:56:40.414586

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Chinese President Xi Jinping underlined the start of a new, more united chapter of this relationship; CELAC leaders emphasised the need for a more balanced, multipolar world, and framed the bloc’s partnership with China as a pathway to greater autonomy in global affairs.

Founded in 2010, CELAC is a regional intergovernmental organisation that brings together all the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. The China-CELAC Forum was established in 2014 to promote partnerships between the regions. Each previous China-CELAC summit has produced joint cooperation action plans, covering a variety of areas, from sustainable development to cultural collaborations.

Tuesday’s summit was officially a ministerial meeting, but several national leaders attended: Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, Gabriel Boric of Chile, and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva all travelled to Beijing for the opening ceremony.

Recommended

President Xi’s speech included the announcement of a CNY 66 billion (USD 9.15 billion) credit line to support development in CELAC countries. This figure is slightly less than half that pledged at the 2015 summit.

“Although China and the LAC [Latin America and Caribbean] region are geographically distant, the bonds of our friendship stretch back through centuries,” Xi said. “Together, China and LAC countries champion true multilateralism, uphold international fairness and justice, advance global governance reform, and promote global multipolarity and greater democracy in international relations.”

Xi added that China and Latin America should expand cooperation on clean energy, artificial intelligence and the digital economy. He said that China will increase imports of “quality products” from Latin America, and that Chinese companies will be encouraged to expand investment in the region.

Chile’s Boric concurred, claiming this as the time “to take a qualitative leap forward in economic ties with China”. Petro – whose country Colombia is currently assuming CELAC’s rotating presidency – proposed a fibre optic cable to connect Asia with Latin America. Brazil’s Lula advocated for strong trade with China and deeper cooperation on the energy transition. He also defended multilateralism: “Chinese support is crucial to getting highways, railways, ports and transmission lines off the ground.”

In a 28-point joint statement issued late on Tuesday, the China-CELAC Forum underlined its commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation, and to “strengthening all pillars of the climate change mechanism”.

A summit amid a trade war

The China-CELAC summit took place amid a cooling in the tariff war between the United States and China. On Monday, the two countries agreed to a rollback on the trading terms and reciprocal tariff hikes that had been escalating in severity since January. On Tuesday, the US dropped its tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China signed off on a reduction from 125% to 10%. However, this will be reviewed in 90 days.

This trade conflict has placed Latin America in a challenging position. While US President Donald Trump has close allies in the region, such as Argentina’s President Javier Milei and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, others in Latin America have sought to diversify their partners. For example, on Monday, Petro confirmed Colombia’s joining of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The BRI has expanded in the region over the past decade, and Colombia will become the 23rd CELAC country to sign up.

Dialogue Earth consulted Francisco Urdinez, who directs the Millennium Nucleus on the Impacts of China in Latin America, an interdisciplinary research initiative. He says the summit’s main goal was to “show the world that multilateralism still exists and that free trade is still possible”.

Rebecca Ray, senior academic researcher for the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, agrees: “With trade barriers all over the place, it’s an important moment to come together and reaffirm commitment to multilateralism. The region is committing to pragmatic, open, non-discriminatory relations with the world to achieve its goals.”

Further investments

For Parsifal D’Sola Alvarado, executive director of the Andrés Bello Foundation (FAB)’s Latin American Chinese Research Center, the most important parts of the summit were the bilateral interactions that the leaders of Brazil, Colombia and Chile each had with China. “The rest was just statements from the governments and a lack of definitions,” Alvarado adds.

Companies from China, Brazil’s primary trading partner, expressed their intention to invest approximately USD 4.5 billion in various sectors of the Brazilian economy.

According to the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (ApexBrasil), that will include renewable energy, mining, automobiles, food, logistics and the health sector.

Brazil also issued a joint statement with China on the margins of the summit, in which both countries agreed to cooperate on projects related to the environment, energy transition and science and technology, among other areas.

Brazil has so far chosen not to join the BRI. But the country still desires closer ties with China, says political scientist and international relations professor Maurício Santoro: “In recent years, we have seen a diversification of Chinese investments in Brazil, such as in the electric vehicle sector. Major car manufacturers such as BYD are building factories in the country.”

The Chile-China Business Forum also took place in Beijing this week, organised by the Boric administration. At the forum, the Chilean president lauded multilateralism and free trade, and the reciprocal benefits they bring. Both countries indicated willingness to collaborate on solutions to challenges facing the energy transition and the digital transformation, among other issues.

Meanwhile, Nicaragua, which resumed diplomatic relations with China in 2021, signed four agreements with Chinese companies on the margins of the summit, including a deal with Yutong on electric vehicles. Hydroelectric and mining deals were also floated.

Margaret Myers, managing director of the Johns Hopkins University’s Institute for America, China and the Future of Global Affairs, notes China’s lower credit commitment compared to previous summits. But she says it remains significant given the US’ withdrawal of certain forms of assistance, such as USAID, and the slow progress of Europe’s Global Gateway programme.

“Whether China’s billions materialise or not will depend on multiple factors,” says Myers, “including China’s own economic prospects, the extent to which bankable projects are available to Chinese companies, and the interests of individual countries and localities. But China seems committed to continued engagement with the region.”",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/05/CELAC-China-ministerial-summit-in-Beijing_Juan-Diego-Cano_Presidencia-de-la-Republica-de-Colombia_f6e04c1b39-1200px-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-05-17 05:56:44.922858

A multi-billion-dollar engine and services agreement between GE Aerospace GE and Qatar Airways marks one of the aviation giant's largest widebody aircraft commitments to date.

It arrives at a pivotal moment for GE Aerospace, which has been newly streamlined as a standalone company and is intensely focused on the future of flight.

The implications are wide-reaching, offering a significant tailwind to its operations, financial trajectory, and long-term value proposition for shareholders.

The Nuts and Bolts of GE’s Deal

At the heart of the agreement with Qatar Airways is a substantial order for more than 400 of GE Aerospace's advanced jet engines.

This includes a commitment for 60 GE9X engines, the exclusive powerplant for Boeing's new 777-9 aircraft, and 260 GEnx engines, a popular choice for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner family. The order also encompasses options for additional units and a comprehensive inventory of spares.

Next-Generation Thrust: The GE9X and GEnx Advantage

The GE9X is the world’s most powerful commercial aircraft engine, delivering 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor, the GE90-115B. The GEnx engine family has logged over 62 million flight hours and powers about two-thirds of all Boeing 787s in operation.

Both platforms are certified to run on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends—supporting aviation decarbonization goals and giving GE a clear advantage in a rapidly evolving aerospace landscape.

Why Services Are a Game-Changer for GE Stock

While the hardware grabs headlines, the real long-term value lies in the agreement’s extensive Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) contracts. These multi-decade service agreements generate higher profit margins than initial engine sales and offer recurring revenue for decades.

For GE Aerospace stockholders, this de-risks future cash flow and supports a more predictable earnings model over the life of the engines.

How GE's Focus and Strength Secured the Qatar Win

GE Aerospace’s success in landing a deal of this magnitude is no accident. It follows the strategic spin-offs of GE HealthCare GEHC and GE Vernova GEV, which left the company wholly dedicated to aviation. Under the leadership of Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr., GE has sharpened its focus, allowing for more deliberate capital allocation and strategic execution.

In Q1 2025, GE Aerospace posted strong financials: $12.3 billion in total orders (up 12% YoY), $9.0 billion in adjusted revenue (up 11%), and a 60% jump in adjusted EPS to $1.49. The company ended the quarter with a sizable Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) of $172.6 billion, providing high visibility into future revenue streams.

From Order to Earnings

The Qatar Airways agreement adds significantly to GE’s already industry-leading commercial engine backlog. Within the Commercial Engines & Services (CES) segment alone, RPO stood at $153.8 billion as of March 31, 2025. The deal contributes to future revenue not just through engine deliveries but through its high-value service contracts that will span decades.

It also supports GE's 2025 outlook, which includes low-double-digit adjusted revenue growth and operating profit guidance between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion. Notably, CES services revenue rose 17% in Q1, a momentum the Qatar deal is expected to sustain.

The Qatar Deal Is A Strategic Win

Qatar Airways’ decision to go with GE9X and GEnx engines is a resounding endorsement of GE Aerospace’s technological innovation and operational reliability. It’s also a meaningful win in a competitive global market where Rolls-Royce RYCEF is a key rival.

Industry analysts view the agreement as a significant competitive victory and a strong signal of GE’s dominant position in the widebody engine space.

From Factory Floor to Flight Line

Fulfilling an order of this scale necessitates sustained and potentially increased production rates for the GE9X and GEnx engine lines. This operational demand aligns with GE Aerospace's recently announced plans to invest nearly $1 billion in its U.S. manufacturing facilities and technology throughout 2025.

This investment strategy, which includes hiring approximately 5,000 new employees, is geared towards enhancing production capacity, improving capabilities, and supporting the entire lifecycle of its commercial and military engines, directly enabling the execution of significant commitments such as the Qatar deal.

What the Qatar Deal Signals for GE’s Stockholders [content-module:MarketRank|NYSE:GE]

For investors, the Qatar Airways agreement reinforces GE Aerospace’s strategy as a focused aviation leader. It brings improved earnings predictability, a critical asset in the cyclical aerospace sector.

The cash flow from this agreement backs the company’s capital return program, including its $0.28 quarterly dividend (targeting 30% growth in 2025) and a $15 billion share repurchase program. In Q1 2025 alone, GE repurchased $1.9 billion in stock, with plans to reach $7 billion for the full year.

Mega-deals like this one tend to lift analyst sentiment and market confidence by reducing uncertainty and highlighting the company’s competitive edge. Investors will closely track metrics such as RPO growth, services revenue, and segment margins to evaluate execution.

GE Aerospace: Powered by Partnership

This landmark agreement with Qatar Airways is more than a sales milestone—it’s a defining moment. It underscores GE Aerospace’s technological edge, competitive strength, and the long-term value of its integrated engine-and-services model.

As a standalone company, GE is demonstrating its ability to deliver large-scale, high-impact solutions that create lasting value for customers and shareholders alike.

TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanee called on EU regulators in January at the World Economic Forum to support premium prices for Europe's low-carbon fuels market, or risk offshoring its transitioning refining sector to growing producers such as China.

However, this call for policy protection from regulators for European SAF production might fall on deaf ears. ""I don't believe it will happen simply because Europe is short,"" Phillip Moore, global head of SAF at EcoCeres, told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in an interview on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association's Aviation Energy Forum in Baku.

""There's not the capacity to supply from here and there is a genuine need, so why would you want to have antidumping?,"" he said.

Biofuels have felt pressure from Asian imports more widely. Chinese import competition was widely blamed for a slump in biodiesel prices in 2024 that left many suppliers struggling to break even and saw large-scale projects paused. In August, the EU imposed tariffs on Chinese biodiesel to support European projects, but exempted SAF from the measures.

The market for biofuels is struggling amid oversupply, but toughening mandates boost the longer-term outlook, management at Dutch storage firm Royal Vopak and Austrian refinery OMV said in summer 2024.

Platts assessed SAF on a CIF basis in Northwest Europe at $1,774/mt over jet cargoes May 14, a premium of 158% and down from 203% when the SAF assessment was launched in September 2023.

Looking ahead, EU mandates will raise demand and Europe could fall short on supplies, with prices rising accordingly, according to analysts.

New capacity

EcoCeres has a 350,000 mt/year biofuels plant in Jiangsu, China. The company is about to complete a second plant in Johor, Malaysia, with a capacity of 420,000 mt/year. From 2026 onward, the company will have up to 500,000 mt/year of SAF production.

""Most of our market is in Europe, and we are selling to obligated parties and also to airlines,"" Moore said.

Feedstock is waste-based and mostly used cooking oil. With the startup of its Malaysian plant, the company will also be looking at some other feedstocks, soap stock, soybean oil, animal fats from Australia and New Zealand, and fish oil fats from Vietnam.

EcoCeres is considering another hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids pathway plant in Southeast Asia and FID will be taken either later in 2026 or early in 2026.

The company also produces hydrotreated vegetable oils and cellulosic ethanol.

There is growing interest in bringing product produced in Asia to Europe across the industry. TotalEnergies and China's Sinopec will jointly develop and own a 230,000 mt/year sustainable aviation fuel production unit at a Sinopec refinery in China, the companies said in March.

TIAC’s message highlights the vital economic role tourism plays from coast to coast, noting that the industry supports over two million Canadian jobs and generates more than $130 billion in economic activity. The association warns that recent declines in American visitors – Canada’s largest inbound market – are threatening the viability of many tourism operators across the country.

In the letter, TIAC outlines a series of policy recommendations aimed at stabilizing and growing the industry, from boosting international marketing efforts to improving visa processing and investing in sustainable tourism infrastructure. The letter appears in full below:

Dear Prime Minister Carney:

As you lead Canada into this next chapter, it is essential to recognize the critical role that Canada’s tourism sector plays in shaping both our economy and our national identity. Tourism is a significant contributor to the economy, cultural exchange and international goodwill. Tourism is at the heart of political ridings from coast to coast to coast – from our bustling urban centres to our country’s beautiful rural landscapes and seascapes.

Canada’s travel and tourism sector represents over 243,000 businesses and over 2 million households who rely on tourism, conferences, events, and travel for their livelihoods. This sector is crucial in every single electoral district in Canada. In 2024, tourism generated $130 billon in economic activity. With over $32 billion of annual spending coming from international visitors, tourism is also our country’s third largest export industry representing over 14 percent of Canada’s total service export revenue.

Though the tourism sector demonstrated remarkable resilience after being the hardest hit during the global pandemic, it is now facing a real and similar crisis. More than ever, the sector requires the support of our government and political leaders.

While the on-going trade tensions between the United States and Canada threatens to increase business operating costs economy-wide, unlike many other sectors, the success of Canadian tourism is also deeply tied to the influx of travelers from the U.S. Whether they’re visiting for family vacations, exploring our stunning national parks, discovering cultural and historical landmarks, embarking on whale-watching adventures, or attending international conferences and events, American visitors represent a crucial demographic for the industry. They represent the largest inbound market for many destinations, attractions, as well as transportation and accommodation businesses across the country.

Statistics Canada reports significant declines in cross-border visitors in February, March, and April 2025 when compared to the same month in previous years, underscoring the immediate impact of global trade uncertainty on Canada’s tourism sector.1 A recent poll conducted by TIAC finds that half (47%) of tourism businesses and organizations have supply chains that are reliant on products from the U.S. and 70% of tourism organizations rely heavily on U.S. travellers. The rapid drop in American visitors in a number of markets is already threatening the viability of operators across the country and putting at risk the livelihoods of the more than 2 million Canadians employed in the sector – a prolonged reduction of U.S. visitors could have detrimental effects.

Understanding the crucial roles that travel and tourism play in shaping Canada’s economic future, we are calling on you to take immediate action in supporting policies and investments that will stabilize and fuel the growth of this essential sector.

Fortify Canada’s international marketing capacity through meaningful investments in Destination Canada to attract more international visitors from other parts of the world;

Expedite visitor entry into Canada by expanding programs like the Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), reducing processing times for visitor visas, and digitizing screening and clearance procedures;

Strengthen the tourism workforce by supporting the integration of underemployed Canadians—including youth, asylum seekers, newcomers, and underrepresented groups –into rewarding tourism careers;

Incentivize business investment aimed at renewing our country’s tourism infrastructure and assets, and developing innovative tourism ventures across the country;

Develop a national, multi-modal transportation strategy that expands connectivity, enhances rural/urban connections, and improves traveller access to and throughout Canada.

Invigorate Canada’s business events sector through expanded support for the International Convention Attraction Fund (ICAF); and,

Support sustainability for Canadian travel and transportation industries by investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and alternative green power solutions.

These recommendations can help secure the future of tourism in Canada – fueling job creation, strengthening local economies, and making Canada a top destination worldwide. According to the BDC, a mere 10% increase in tourism spending could boost Canada’s GDP by a full 1% – a powerful return on investment that fortifies thousands of businesses and creates sustainable employment for generations to come.

We hope you will take this opportunity to champion a sector that touches every corner of the country.",https://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_241046455-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-05-17 05:56:57.436035

Senate Bills 235-36, introduced by Sens. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Joe Bellino (R-Monroe), and House Bills 4424-25, introduced by Rep. Jerry Neyer, (R-Shepherd), would establish a $1.50 (€1.30) per gallon tax credit for the purchase, production, or blending of SAF starting in 2026.

The credit increases to $2 (€1.80) per gallon for fuels that deliver greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The SAF will then be used for flights that depart from Michigan.

“This bipartisan plan will make aviation fuel more accessible and affordable and will help us realise the global vision we spelled out in our landmark Clean Energy Future plan,” Sen. Singh said.

“Decarbonising the aviation sector will not be easy, but we have to start somewhere. Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy. By tackling this monumental task, we continue to prove that Michigan is a global leader in protecting our environment.”

Rep. Neyer, chair of the House Agriculture Committee, said: “Whether we like it or not, things are changing in Michigan.

“New clean energy standards are quickly approaching, and pending policy changes from the feds have left corn and soybean farmers with a ‘let’s wait and see’ mentality. And who can blame them? By incentivising the private sector to produce and blend SAF here in Michigan, we can encourage cleaner skies and boost the agriculture industry at the same time.”

By encouraging the use of Michigan-grown feedstocks such as corn and soybeans, the legislation is poised to open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the vital connection between agriculture and energy innovation.",https://www.gleaf.in/uploads//blogs/a5f34e2564153183f4c5c09e6fca023d.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 02:56:32.572325

Now you’re doing checkered flag down on a Sunday, Monday we’re at the next race.” Equipment is split among air, sea and road freight.
“Cutlery is sponsor-specific for teams, so you can’t just take whatever, and you can’t locally source it,” Fowler said.
Instead of the trucks burning gasoline or standard diesel fuel, they are using Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or S.A.F., and biofuels.
S.A.F., Jones said, is a minimum 80 percent reduction compared with Jet-A fuel: “For sustainability, those are massive numbers.”","Formula 1 visits 24 locations annually, across 21 countries, and its equipment needs to be present. It is a gargantuan operation.

“I’ve been here 39 years, we used to do 16 races, five international, now it’s 15 international and nine Europeans,” Paul Fowler, vice president of motorsport product for DHL Motorsport, Formula 1’s longtime logistics partner, said in an interview. “It was two DC-10s in the day, the 747 freighter just about existed — now it’s up to nine flights per race — and the calendar was spread. Now you’re doing checkered flag down on a Sunday, Monday we’re at the next race.”

Equipment is split among air, sea and road freight. For European events most equipment travels by road, and for the remainder — colloquially called flyaways — essential items are flown on up to nine 777 jets, including the cars. Nonessential equipment is shipped by sea. There are extreme examples, like knives and forks.

“Cutlery is sponsor-specific for teams, so you can’t just take whatever, and you can’t locally source it,” Fowler said.

The grueling schedule means every movement is carefully coordinated.

“The first plane takes 30 pallets, so each team gets three pallets as their priority freight,” said Simon Price, event manager for DHL Motorsport. “That will normally go just over 12 hours after the flag, but it depends where we’re going.

“After Las Vegas, the next race is the next week in Qatar. We’re changing continents and time zones, we have an 18-hour flight, but there’s also a deficit of 11 hours [time zone change], so we lose over 24 hours, just a liftoff, and that’s before we set up — and everything still has to be done. The schedules are so tight, this industry and what we’re working in now, everything is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible — and that also extends to logistics.”

The logistics team must monitor costs and consider restrictions on Russia’s airspace. Avoiding the Suez Canal because of military action there has lengthened journeys. And the team must be prepared if seaports are congested. Smooth relationships and experience with customs personnel are also essential, especially in countries where signoffs take longer.

“We do have a Plan A, B and C, and we do joke that we never want to get to P, Q and R, which is Panic, Quit and Run!” Fowler said.

Such contingencies mean Formula 1 has rarely has had any problems, even with issues in recent years, including a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, two planes having technical problems between Grands Prix in Australia and China, and the collapse of part of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore affecting shipping lanes.

“Teams will never be without anything,” Price said. “Our deadlines are not like commercial deadlines where if you can’t deliver it on Friday you could deliver it on Monday morning — that doesn’t work here because the race is on Sunday. It has to be here.”

Price recalled an engine manufacturer requiring the urgent deployment of a repaired component to the track during a race weekend.

“This was on Friday afternoon; we were in Italy,” Price said. “We booked a flight for one of our guys, he flew to the U.K., had a van to take him to the factory. There were no flights available to return, so we had to get a private jet, but the only one we could get was in Nice,” in France.

They flew the jet to Luton Airport, near London, but “Luton takeoff rights wouldn’t allow the plane to take off overnight, so we had to move the plane to Birmingham.” He said they then flew to the Malpensa airport near Milan, with a man carrying the part in a suitcase.

“We had a car waiting for him there and took him straight to the circuit,” Price said. “That’s Friday 4 p.m. to Saturday lunchtime.”

The Imola track in Italy this weekend hosts the first European round, the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, so road transport takes over. But there are events across the next two weekends, in Monaco and Spain, bringing further complications. Three Grands Prix in successive weekends used to be rare, but they are now commonplace.

“In the old days we could never do back-to-backs, as everything was built around single events,” Ian Stone, Formula 1’s director of transport logistics and cargo, said in an interview. “Now we have two sets of key infrastructure: the E.T.C. [Event Technology Center], cabling, fiber optic network, the pit lane garage network, and we leapfrog with an A and B team.

“For Imola, one team went out last Thursday [May 8], starting the setup. They’ll stay until after the race, while the other team will be in Monaco, then the Imola team will go straight to Spain. There’s some expensive kit that you don’t have multiple versions of, so we have priority trucks that will be on the road by midnight to get there Monday lunchtime. Our deadline is to be ready to do a full system test with the F.I.A. at 2 p.m. on Thursday, and that’s an immovable object.”

Despite the quantity of equipment — which Formula 1 estimates is about 1,200 tons per race and likely to grow in 2026 with Cadillac’s arrival — and the expanded schedule, championship officials say they are managing to arrange logistics in line with their sustainability and Net Zero 2030 ambitions. Instead of the trucks burning gasoline or standard diesel fuel, they are using Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or S.A.F., and biofuels.

“When you look at the biofuels in our trucks, which power our European season, that’s over an 80 percent reduction in our carbon footprint compared to standard fuel,” said Ellen Jones, Formula 1’s head of environment, social and governance. S.A.F., Jones said, is a minimum 80 percent reduction compared with Jet-A fuel: “For sustainability, those are massive numbers.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17sp-emilia-logistics-inyt-pfvm/17sp-emilia-logistics-inyt-pfvm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 22:56:24.049145

Eric Sfiligoj: Hello, welcome to another edition of CropLife Retail Week. I’m Eric Sfiligoj, editor of CropLife and CropLife Iron, here again with Lara Sowinski. Lara, how you doing?

Lara Sowinski: Doing great. Thank you. How are you?

ES: I am doing good. And hey, we’ve got some good news to share with our viewers this week. You know, and um my first item, this has to do with our favorite herbicide, glyphosate. As you know, of course, we’ve talked about many times over the years, there have numerous lawsuits regarding that popular herbicide and its producer Bayer.

A lot of them are at the state level involving state labeling laws versus federal labeling laws. And I know we talked a couple of weeks ago about how the fact that The state of North Dakota became the first state to actually have its legal body pass legislation that said a federal labeling laws are enough of a warning. State labeling laws don’t need to be over and above that.

And we found out this week on May 12th that Governor. Brian Kemp of Georgia signed SB144. And that bill does the same thing as the North Dakota bill. It actually affirms that EPA regulations and warning labels on pesticides are enough of a warning, and that that supersedes any state warnings that would have normally been required in this instance. So I know that several folks in the industry, farmers and agricultural groups, were applauding this move.

They’re hoping that this will add some clarity to the whole question of what’s going on with glyphosate. and maybe hope fully help it when it comes to some of these state level lawsuits that have hurt the brand so badly.

LS: I think um that was um expected that that would go through. I’m curious what states are next and how this, I remember when you were talking about this a few weeks ago, there were a handful of states that were considering similar legislation. So yeah, it’ll be interesting to see how this continues to unfold.

ES: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And those other states, I know Missouri in particular, of course, it makes sense. That’s as so located here in the States. um They have a bill that’s, you know, I guess it’s made it through one part of their of their, I think the House has passed the bill. The Senate’s looking at it now. And I believe Iowa was also considering a similar bill. But again, we’ve got two states now on board. So hopefully more will begin to fall on the line. We will see.

So, yeah, so one other item on glyphosate, since we’re talking about that, you may remember a couple of videos ago, we talked about the fact that our friends at Bayer had actually petitioned the Supreme Court to kind of weigh in on this whole question about federal labels versus state labels.

And we found out this week that several groups, farmers and agricultural organizations have also filed a brief on behalf of the industry encouraging the U.S. Supreme Court to indeed take up this issue. Among the groups that have filed are the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Soybean Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Corn Growers Association, and your friends at the National Cotton Council.

So hopefully, no word yet on whether or not the Supreme Court will actually take up this case, but they are considering the petition at this point.

LS: That’s great.

ES: So we will see what happens next.

LS: Yeah, that’s great. Good news, Eric. Thank you.

ES: Well, Laura, that was the news I have to share this week. And I guess you said you have a couple of items as well. So take it away.

LS: I do, thank you. i have a press release some dated May 13th from the Iowa Corn Growers Association. And this one caught my attention. I was a little bit surprised. um The press release states that the Iowa Senate passed the anti-pipeline bill, this is House File 639, with a vote of 27 to 22, effectively banning carbon capture and sequestration CCS projects within Iowa, including those that could achieve 100% voluntary easement.

Stu Swanson, Iowa have a Corn Growers Association president and farmer from Galt, Iowa, released the following statement. Quote, this is a hit to Iowa corn growers and ethanol producers. The decision to ban carbon capture and sequestration projects cuts off our ability to tap into markets for ultra low carbon ethanol and puts Iowa a corn growers at a disadvantage compared to states pursuing CCS projects.

Iowa has long been known as the corn state, and this decision impacts our ability to stay competitive as other states and countries seize this new opportunity.

Our farmers deserve increased market access, not increased barriers. Iowa Corn Growers Association is disheartened, by this decision, but appreciates the support of Senate members who voted in the interest of the Iowa farmer.

And just a quick little backgrounder, production of corn continues to outpace demand. USDA is estimating we will have 1.8 billion bushels of excess corn at the end of the twenty five twenty six crop year. If this bill is signed by the governor, it would destroy the opportunity to pursue massive new ethanol markets like sustainable aviation fuel. Worldwide jet fuel demand is projected to be at 120 billion gallons by 2035.

If just 10% of that market could be made into sustainable aviation fuel from ethanol, this would equate to nearly 19 billion gallons of new ethanol demand or nearly 6.5 billion bushels of new corn demand.

That is more than 1.5 times the amount of corn grown in Iowa today. So, um yeah, I was kind of surprised. We’ll see how this plays out. But surprisingly, I did read this past week as well um on the sustainable aviation fuel sector and just how much growth is estimated for that that market. It’s i astounding just how much growth.

So we’ll see what happens with that.

I also have some good news as well. This one is from CoBank. U.S. food and ag exports to Mexico have surged 65% over the past four years, making it the fastest growing export market for a host of American agricultural commodities and products. Mexico’s growth as a destination for US exports has been spurred by the country’s booming post-COVID-19 economy in a rapidly growing manufacturing sector.

So this new research from CoBank, um says that exports, in particular since 2020, from U.S. exports to Mexico have risen from 11.2% to 16.4%. On a volume basis, corn, pork, dairy products, soybeans, and poultry products make up the top five U.S. commodities purchased by Mexico.

So it looks like they are perhaps on… Let’s see, and well, let me say in 2024, US food and ag exports to Mexico climbed to 31.4 billion, slightly below Canada, the top market at 32.4 billion.

So yeah, um Canada is like, or excuse me, Mexico is likely to surpass Canada as our top ag export market. And actually um coincidentally, Peter Zion, um geopolitical strategist, who is the keynote speaker at the ARA conference, not last year, but I think the year prior. I’ve been following him for years. He’s fantastic. He happened to ah release a little video clip this past week and a half or so ago, talking about how China, as an export market for ag um exports is really not going to, it you know, the tariffs and the threat of tariffs up, down, we have tariffs, we don’t, they’re 145%, they’re not, have really kind of, it was essentially the nail in the coffin.

It’s been, you know, the slower population growth, ah other factor factors have been weighing on China as our export market, not to mention competition from Brazil um as an export market for ag. So he was saying that China is not, it’s going to continue to decline as far as an export, a buyer of exports of ag goods from the US. So

Thankfully, I think we do have, um barring some kind of disruption with our Mexico-Canada agreement, you know, thankfully we do have two very strong export markets in Canada and Mexico both. But yeah, so that’s some good news there.

ES: Yeah. And that doesn’t surprise me because like you said, when Peter was the keynote at ARA a couple years ago, I remember even at the book he had that he was sort used as the basis for his speech, he mentioned the fact that he saw the US-Mexico partnership moving forward over the next 10 years as becoming increasingly important and beneficial to both countries.

So it doesn’t surprise me that some of this, you know, some of his predictions from then are now still coming to pass.

LS: Exactly. So, yeah, and I do have that signed copy. copy I was… it able to track Peter down when he was um running around the expo floor.

The end of the world is just the beginning. That’s the title of his latest book, I believe that was, and he signed it. So yeah, he’s great. if If you all don’t know about him, Peter Zion, Z-E-I-H-A-N.

He’s got a free new newsletter that’s just great. lot of good insights, and he frequently talks about ag.",https://www.croplife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Retail-Week-new.00_00_58_16.Feature.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 02:56:37.597989
