The Reno facility was converted to SAF production in October 2024.
During the initial phase of production ramp-up, New Rise Reno operated at approximately 50% of nameplate capacity.
XCF said the New Rise Reno team has been reviewing the catalyst processing for SAF to meet nameplate capacity.
“We currently expect to resume SAF production as early as the first quarter of 2026, although we cannot assure you when SAF production will resume, and when it does resume, when or whether the Reno production facility will be able to produce SAF at full capacity,” XCF wrote in the quarterly report.","XCF Global Inc.’s biorefinery located near Reno, Nevada, could resume sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production as early as the first quarter of 2026, according a second quarter financial report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Oct. 16.

The biorefinery, currently known as New Rise Reno, was developed as a 50 MMgy renewable diesel plant, which began operations in 2022. Development of the facility was supported by loan guarantee awarded through the USDA’s 9003, Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical and Biodiesel Production Manufacturing Assistance Program, according to Greater Commercial Lending, which helped assemble the loan package that made the project possible. According to a 2017 USDA announcement, the facility at that time was being developed under the name Ryze Renewables Reno LLC.

The Reno facility was converted to SAF production in October 2024. XCF Global acquired the facility in February 2025 and later that month announced the plant had commenced production of neat SAF and renewable naphtha. Initial deliveries of both fuels began in March 2025. During the initial phase of production ramp-up, New Rise Reno operated at approximately 50% of nameplate capacity. XCF said the New Rise Reno team has been reviewing the catalyst processing for SAF to meet nameplate capacity.

According to the second quarter report, until SAF production reaches nameplate capacity, New Rise Reno is not deemed to be an operating facility and classifies as under construction until final project acceptance under New Rise’s license agreement with Axens North America under the original intention of the SAF conversion. Such final project acceptance has not yet been completed.

“Due to the conversion to SAF and associated testing of the facility, we have observed variable operating performance which has impacted the ability of the plant to operate at full capacity,” XCF wrote in the quarterly report.

While ramp-up processes are being undertaken and until final plant acceptable, XCF said it has made the determination to temporarily produce and sell renewable diesel, a byproduct of SAF production, which can be achieved at approximately 2,000 barrels per day, which is approximately 20% below nameplate capacity, and without any additional modifications to the facility. “Management regards the production of renewable diesel as an interim derivative during the ramp up process of the ongoing SAF conversion process,” the company said.

New Rise Reno in May 2025 began selling renewable diesel under a supply and offtake agreement with Phillipps 66. According to the second quarter report, New Rise Reno produced, in aggregate, approximately 1.9 million gallons of neat SAF, renewable diesel and renewable naphtha during the three months ended June 30.

“We currently expect to resume SAF production as early as the first quarter of 2026, although we cannot assure you when SAF production will resume, and when it does resume, when or whether the Reno production facility will be able to produce SAF at full capacity,” XCF wrote in the quarterly report. “Any delay beyond the first quarter of 2026 in our ability to resume SAF or renewable diesel production and/or any delay in our ability to operate the Reno production facility at full nameplate capacity for SAF production will adversely affect our revenues and profitability.”

By filing its second quarter report with the SEC, XCF has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of all required periodic financial reports with the SEC.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/XCF_Logo_XCF_Global_Vertical_29092024_eac06fc7f9.png,N,,2025-10-20 20:00:07.463700

When we spoke with other conference attendees about FMR’s perspective on SAF, multiple people admitted they had never really considered how it could affect water quality.
How we'll build on what we learned The North American SAF Conference allowed us to peek behind the curtain to hear what the industry decision-makers are saying.
FMR will continue to advocate for clean water, soil health, habitat and pollinators in state and federal SAF conversations.
By ensuring that our guiding principles form the backbone of SAF policy going forward, we will help deliver a SAF industry that is more than just low-carbon, but one that is on a flight path toward true sustainability.","Hundreds of people from around the globe traveled to the Twin Cities last month for the North American Sustainable Aviation Fuel Conference and Expo(link is external). There, attendees discussed the future of SAF technology and policy. This conversation was driven primarily by industry experts, corporate decisionmakers, agribusiness representatives and biofuels researchers.

Also there? Friends of the Mississippi River.

Two members of FMR’s Water Program, myself and Trevor Russell, attended the conference. Our goal — when mingling with fellow attendees or participating in panels and presentations — was to share FMR’s perspective: That the industry needs to take a broad view of what it means to be “sustainable,” and account for the impact any new fuel might have on our air, land and water.

We were there, in short, to be the voice for the river.

Here are three things we discovered from our time at the conference.

1) Water and biodiversity aren’t currently top of mind

Throughout the conference, we heard scant mention of clean water, healthy soil or biodiversity. When we spoke with other conference attendees about FMR’s perspective on SAF, multiple people admitted they had never really considered how it could affect water quality.

That might seem surprising, but there’s a practical reason for this. The legal definition of SAF — the criteria the fuel needs to meet in order to qualify for tax credits (more on these below) — only references greenhouse gas emissions. If the fuel has less than half the carbon emissions of traditional jet fuel, then it qualifies as ""sustainable aviation fuel.""

But in our view, just being lower carbon is not the same thing as being sustainable. That’s why it’s important for advocates like FMR to keep pushing for broad definitions of sustainability in SAF, while also urging investments in the most environmentally friendly fuel sources we have, such as winter-hardy oilseeds.

2) Minnesota is likely to be a national hub of SAF activity

Over and over, we heard how Minnesota is expected to be a national leader in this new industry.

The state has the input materials (meaning, what the fuel is made out of) in its agricultural crops and forest products, a major airport with MSP, and a highly trained and educated workforce. Critically, there is also a state tax credit for producers of SAF. (In fact, the Star Tribune recently highlighted SAF(link is external) as one of the ""Midwestern ideas shaping the future.)

Under current conditions, however, SAF is still much more expensive than traditional jet fuel. In order for early adoption of SAF to make economic sense for airlines, they need both a federal boost and a state boost.

A federal credit does exist, though as we mentioned earlier, they’re based only on greenhouse gas emissions. That makes state policy a powerful lever for establishing stronger sustainability parameters.

Even if the federal government rolls back environmental protections, SAF companies are going to have to meet the more stringent state laws if they want to benefit from all the available incentives.

3) Now is the time to shape SAF's future

Right now, there are only a handful of SAF production facilities throughout the country, and the number of SAF-powered flights that have happened in the U.S. is quite small. (The Delta flight powered in part by winter camelina is one example.) Even the experts can’t agree on what they think the next five or 10 years will look like, because there are still so many unknowns.

SAF companies are waiting for more stability in state and federal policy before committing billions of dollars to building new production facilities. Policy is shaping the way this new industry rolls out, and how truly sustainable it will end up being.

How we'll build on what we learned

The North American SAF Conference allowed us to peek behind the curtain to hear what the industry decision-makers are saying. It’s clear they see Minnesota as an emerging leader in the SAF space, and that state policy will be influential in shaping what happens next.

Importantly, we also shared our message of clean water and healthy rivers directly with decisionmakers, researchers and leaders. We were really encouraged by the thoughtful questions and positive response from attendees.

But concrete public policy decisions and industry commitments are where the rubber meets the runway.

FMR will continue to advocate for clean water, soil health, habitat and pollinators in state and federal SAF conversations. By ensuring that our guiding principles form the backbone of SAF policy going forward, we will help deliver a SAF industry that is more than just low-carbon, but one that is on a flight path toward true sustainability.",https://fmr.org/files/2510-saf_conference-meghan_and_trevor-chloe_piekkola__danielle_piekarski__bbi_international.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 19:00:41.615573

The European Union is also implementing a regulation that makes companies importing certain emissions-intensive goods into Europe pay for the carbon emissions created from producing these products.

Several multinational companies with a Singapore presence have started to feel the implications of these trends.

In 2024, oil giant Shell sold its energy and chemicals park on Pulau Bukom and Jurong Island, as part of measures to boost its overall profitability and lower its carbon footprint worldwide.

As crude prices tumbled in 2025 , some global oil companies including Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil have announced thousands of job cuts. On Oct 1, ExxonMobil announced that it plans to reduce 10 per cent to 15 per cent of its workforce in Singapore by the end of 2027.

The energy and chemicals sector is a global industry, and Singapore is an open economy with leading positions in refining, trading and chemical production, said EDB’s vice-president of chemicals and materials, Ms Kelly Lai.

“Due to the global petrochemical downcycle, companies are reviewing their footprints globally, and we are not sheltered from these global developments,” she said.

“With any mature industry, we would expect to see some churn, and naturally then reinvestment and rejuvenation.”

As the energy and chemicals sector transforms, it will need to reimagine its business models, innovate processes, and adopt low-carbon technologies, JTC and EDB added.

Decarbonisation is a key part of Singapore’s growth strategy for the energy and chemicals sector – it enables companies to stay competitive and capture new markets, said EDB and JTC.

Companies on the island are combining immediate measures, such as improving the energy efficiency of industrial processes and deploying solar panels , with those that will take a longer time to scale and commercialise.

Advario is attempting to do this by diversifying its business model beyond fossil fuels to include low-carbon options, such as sustainable aviation fuel.

Its director of business development, Mr Kevin Jen, said: “With increasing societal awareness and stakeholder pressure, demand for traditional hydrocarbons is expected to decline gradually, driven in part by the wider adoption of electric vehicles, as well as transitional fuels in both the maritime and aviation sectors.”

Fossil fuels include naturally occurring compounds of hydrocarbons. While greener fuels are not yet commercially mature, the Dutch company, being family-owned, is able to take a longer-term perspective – one that balances sustainability with commercial discipline, Mr Jen added.

Power generation companies Keppel, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya are also studying ways of capturing planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants, to identify the specific infrastructure needed to make carbon capture and storage a reality in Singapore.

EDB’s Ms Lai also pointed out that, despite the recent cutbacks, Shell and ExxonMobil still continue to maintain a significant presence in Singapore.

Singapore is home to ExxonMobil’s largest manufacturing site and the company has just started up new production facilities, she said.

Shell and ExxonMobil have since 2024 also been leading a consortium to study the feasibility of capturing CO2 in Singapore for storage in other countries. The aim is to develop a carbon capture project that can permanently store 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030.

“By scaling innovative low-carbon solutions in Singapore, companies can meet sustainability standards, tap regional demand and export new technologies globally,” said JTC and EDB.

On a broader level, Singapore had seen the writing on the wall for the oil and gas sector, and began to move on this front a few years ago.

In 2021, it launched a plan to transform Jurong Island into a sustainable energy and chemicals hub, with 2030 targets to raise the production of sustainable goods, ensure that local refineries and crackers are highly energy efficient, and realise carbon capture.

The authorities will be providing updates on this , including additional announcements, at the upcoming Singapore International Energy Week on Oct 27.

Ms Ni kki Kemp, director of the Singapore Green Finance Centre at the Singapore Management University, noted that while the Republic may not suffer widespread job losses due to changes in the sector , it faces a “skills transition challenge”.

Those affected will need reskilling for alternative occupations, leading to additional transition costs, she said.

For example , job functions in electricity transmission and distribution, low-carbon alternatives, solar energy and smart grids are expected to experience significant growth, added Ms Kemp.

She cited a 2024 study which found that, globally, the petrochemical sector’s demand growth is set to weaken over the next 10 years. Roles focused on oil and gas refining and traditional petrochemical production are likely to be restructured and reduced.

“New job opportunities may not emerge in the same location or timeframe as those that have been lost. Therefore, effective employment planning is crucial as part of the transition,” she added.

The 2022 Energy Sector Manpower Survey by the Energy Market Authority showed that Singapore’s clean energy workforce is projected to increase by 80 per cent by 2032, reaching around 2,700 workers. The power sector is also expected to expand by 800 workers during the same period .

Ms Kemp observed that Jurong Island’s transformation is under way with significant technical and governance hurdles.

She noted that carbon capture is a highly technical solution that is currently being tested, but not on a big enough scale. The commercial viability of hydrogen as a clean fuel remains questionable, she added.

She said: “A credible energy transition in Singapore includes a commitment to decarbonise Jurong Island industries, ensuring decarbonisation is permanent, rather than moving operations elsewhere.”

This requires transparency in having a company’s green achievements verified, having public dashboards to track how firms are progressing with their climate goals, and company disclosure about their investment in clean technology, she added.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/09e3a76f9b8f32f425287762a3ba3df8d3628b22a580e99d0988ccea119fd5a9,N,,2025-10-20 18:00:03.328600

“Third quarter net income increased to $10.1 million, or $0.59 per share, and was driven by core earnings growth and lower credit costs,” said Johnny Lee, President and Chief Executive Officer of RBB Bancorp. “Continued loan growth supported increased asset yields and net interest income. Loan loss provisions decreased as credit continued to stabilize and we made good progress addressing many of our non-performing loans and performing criticized loans.”

Reconciliations of the non–U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures included at the end of this press release.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

Net interest income was $29.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $27.3 million for the second quarter of 2025. The $1.9 million increase was due to a $3.2 million increase in interest income, offset by a $1.2 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was due mainly to a $2.4 million increase in interest and fees on loans. The increase in interest expense was due mainly to a $1.0 million increase in interest on deposits.

The net interest margin (“NIM”) was 2.98% for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 6 basis points from 2.92% for the second quarter of 2025. The NIM expansion included a 6 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets and a 2 basis point decrease in the overall cost of funds. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 5.85% for the third quarter of 2025 from 5.79% for the second quarter of 2025 driven by a 9 basis point increase in the yield on average loans to 6.12%. Average loans represented 83.3% of average interest-earning assets in the third quarter of 2025, as compared to 84.5% in the second quarter of 2025.

The average cost of funds decreased to 3.12% for the third quarter of 2025 from 3.14% for the second quarter of 2025, due to a 3 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, and a 9 basis point decrease in the average cost of total borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased to 3.63% for the third quarter of 2025 from 3.66% for the second quarter of 2025. The overall funding mix for the third quarter of 2025 remained relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2025 with average total interest-bearing deposits representing 89.4% of average interest-bearing liabilities and average noninterest-bearing deposits representing 16.6% of average total deposits. The spot rate for total deposits was 2.97% at September 30, 2025.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was $625,000 for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $2.4 million for the second quarter of 2025. The third quarter of 2025 provision for credit losses reflected a provision for loan loss of $750,000 due mainly to net loan growth, and a decrease in provision for unfunded commitments of $125,000 due to lower volume of unfunded commitments. The third quarter provision also took into consideration factors such as changes in the outlook for economic conditions and market interest rates, and changes in credit quality metrics, including changes in loans 30-89 days past due, nonperforming loans, special mention and substandard loans during the period. Net charge-offs totaled $6.9 million in the third quarter and related almost entirely to a commercial construction loan, of which $6.6 million of this credit loss was reserved in prior periods, and the borrower filed for bankruptcy this quarter. Net charge-offs on an annualized basis represented 0.84% of average loans for the third quarter of 2025 compared to 0.42% for the second quarter of 2025.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2025 was $3.3 million, a decrease of $5.2 million from $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2025. The decrease was mostly due to the second quarter of 2025 including other income of $5.2 million for the receipt of ERC funds from the IRS. There were no such ERC amounts received or associated advisory costs recognized during the third quarter of 2025. In addition, other income increased $148,000 due to higher equity investment income of $498,000, offset by lower recoveries on fully charged-off acquired loans of $350,000.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2025 was $18.7 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from $20.5 million for the second quarter of 2025. The decrease was mainly due to lower legal and professional expenses of $1.5 million, including $1.2 million of ERC advisory costs incurred in the second quarter of 2025. Salaries and employee benefits also decreased by $480,000, of which $330,000 related to executive management transitions recognized in the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio was 57.36% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 57.22% for the second quarter of 2025.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 23.5% for the third quarter of 2025 and 27.8% for the second quarter of 2025. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was due mostly to a change in California tax law (Senate Bill 132), which changes the way banks and financial institutions apportion income for California tax purposes. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 is estimated to be in the range of 26% to 27%.

Balance Sheet

At September 30, 2025, total assets were $4.2 billion, a $118.4 million, or 2.9%, increase compared to June 30, 2025, and a $218.0 million, or 5.5%, increase compared to September 30, 2024.

Loan and Securities Portfolio

Loans held for investment (""HFI"") totaled $3.3 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $67.9 million, or 8.3% annualized, compared to June 30, 2025, and an increase of $210.7 million, or 6.8%, compared to September 30, 2024. The third quarter of 2025 net loan growth included $187.8 million in originations with an average yield of 6.70%. The net increase from June 30, 2025 was largely due to net increases of $47.9 million in single-family residential (""SFR"") mortgage loans, $13.2 million in commercial real estate (""CRE"") loans, and $8.4 million in commercial and industrial (""C&I"") loans. The loan to deposit ratio was 98.1% at September 30, 2025, compared to 101.5% at June 30, 2025 and 100.0% at September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2025, available for sale securities (""AFS"") totaled $410.6 million, a decrease of $2.5 million from June 30, 2025, primarily related to maturities and paydowns of $62.3 million, offset by purchases of $58.3 million during the third quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2025, net unrealized losses totaled $20.5 million, a $2.6 million decrease when compared to net unrealized losses of $23.1 million as of June 30, 2025.

Deposits

Total deposits were $3.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $178.3 million, or 22.2% annualized, compared to June 30, 2025 and an increase of $274.3 million, or 8.9%, compared to September 30, 2024. The increase during the third quarter of 2025 was due to a $171.7 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $6.6 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest-bearing deposits included increases in wholesale time deposits of $84.3 million, retail time deposits of $57.4 million, and interest-bearing non-maturity deposits of $30.0 million. Wholesale time deposits were raised to repay $50.0 million in maturing FHLB advances. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $550.5 million, or 16.4% of total deposits at September 30, 2025 compared to $543.9 million, or 17.1% of total deposits at June 30, 2025.

Credit Quality

Nonperforming assets totaled $54.3 million, or 1.29% of total assets, at September 30, 2025, down from $61.0 million, or 1.49% of total assets, at June 30, 2025. Nonperforming assets included $8.8 million other real estate owned (“OREO”) (included in “accrued interest and other assets”) at September 30, 2025 and $4.2 million at June 30, 2025. The increase in OREO in the third quarter related to the foreclosure of 2 SBA loans with $3.7 million guaranteed. Accordingly, including the SBA guarantees, OREO exposure totaled $5.1 million at September 30, 2025.

Nonperforming loans totaled $45.4 million at September 30, 2025, down from $56.8 million at June 30, 2025. The $11.3 million decrease in nonperforming loans during the third quarter of 2025 was due to $6.9 million in net charge-offs, $5.0 million of loans migrating back to accrual status, $1.2 million in payoffs and paydowns, and $970,000 moving to OREO. These decreases were partially offset by additions to nonaccrual loans of $2.8 million.

Special mention loans, also referred to as criticized loans, totaled $49.3 million, or 1.49% of total loans, at September 30, 2025, down from $91.3 million, or 2.82% of total loans, at June 30, 2025. The $42.0 million decrease was primarily due to the upgrade of one $44.4 million completed construction loan, downgrades to substandard-rated loans totaling $8.4 million, and payoffs and paydowns totaling $2.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by the downgrade of loans to special mention totaling $10.8 million and $2.8 million in balance increases. As of September 30, 2025, all special mention loans were paying current.

Substandard loans, also referred to as classified loans, totaled $76.9 million at September 30, 2025, down from $91.0 million at June 30, 2025. The $14.1 million decrease in substandard loans during the third quarter was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns of $16.6 million, net charge-offs of $6.9 million, upgrades to pass-rated loans of $5.0 million, and transfers to OREO of $970,000. These decreases were partially offset by downgrades of loans to substandard of $15.4 million. Of the total substandard loans at September 30, 2025, there were $31.4 million on accrual status.

30-89 day delinquent loans, excluding nonperforming loans, totaled $6.5 million, or 0.20% of total loans, at September 30, 2025, down from $18.0 million, or 0.56% of total loans, at June 30, 2025. The $11.5 million decrease was mainly due to $13.0 million in loans returning to current status and $2.4 million in loans migrating to nonaccrual status, offset by $4.0 million in new delinquent loans.

As of September 30, 2025, the allowance for credit losses totaled $45.4 million and was comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $44.9 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $504,000 (included in “accrued interest and other liabilities”). This compares to the allowance for credit losses of $51.6 million, comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $51.0 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $629,000 at June 30, 2025. The $6.2 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses for the third quarter of 2025 was due to net charge-offs of $6.9 million, offset by a $625,000 provision for credit losses. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans HFI decreased to 1.36% at September 30, 2025, compared to 1.58% at June 30, 2025, due mainly to net charge-offs which were specific reserves at June 30, 2025. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans HFI was 98.70% at September 30, 2025, up from 89.79% at June 30, 2025.

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 (dollars in thousands) Allowance for loan losses Reserve for unfunded loan commitments Allowance for credit losses Allowance for loan losses Reserve for unfunded loan commitments Allowance for credit losses Beginning balance $ 51,014 $ 629 $ 51,643 $ 47,729 $ 729 $ 48,458 Provision for (reversal of) credit losses 750 (125 ) 625 9,983 (225 ) 9,758 Less loans charged-off (7,019 ) — (7,019 ) (13,084 ) — (13,084 ) Recoveries on loans charged-off 147 — 147 264 — 264 Ending balance $ 44,892 $ 504 $ 45,396 $ 44,892 $ 504 $ 45,396

Shareholders' Equity

At September 30, 2025, total shareholders' equity was $514.3 million, a $3.3 million decrease compared to June 30, 2025, and a $4.6 million increase compared to September 30, 2024. The decrease in shareholders' equity for the third quarter of 2025 was due mostly to common stock repurchases totaling $12.5 million and common stock cash dividends paid of $2.8 million, offset by net income of $10.1 million and lower net unrealized losses on AFS securities of $1.6 million.

The increase in shareholders' equity for the last twelve months was due to net income of $26.2 million, lower net unrealized losses on AFS securities of $1.6 million, and equity compensation activity of $2.2 million, offset by common stock repurchases totaling $14.0 million and common stock cash dividends paid of $11.4 million. Book value per share and tangible book value per share (1) increased to $30.18 and $25.89 at September 30, 2025, up from $29.25 and $25.11 at June 30, 2025 and up from $28.81 and $24.64 at September 30, 2024.

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity

Management measures return on average tangible common equity (“ROATCE”) to assess the Company’s capital strength and business performance and believes this is helpful to investors as an additional tool for further understanding our performance. Tangible equity excludes goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights) and is reviewed by banking and financial institution regulators when assessing a financial institution’s capital adequacy. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table reconciles ROATCE to its most comparable GAAP measure:

NORWELL, Mass., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DIH Holding US, Inc. (“DIH” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:DHAI), a global provider of advanced robotic devices used in physical rehabilitation, which incorporate visual stimulation in an interactive manner to enable clinical research and intensive functional rehabilitation and training in patients with walking impairments, reduced balance and/or impaired arm and hand functions, today announced financial results for the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.

Recent Highlights

Revenue of $62.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, representing a decrease of 2.5% over the prior year

Device revenue of $49.7 million and service revenue of $12.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, representing a decrease of 2.8% and an increase of 8.4%, respectively over the prior year

Negative operating cash flow of $4.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2025

“DIH remains committed to driving innovation and delivering value for patients and healthcare providers,” said Jason Chen, Chairman and CEO of DIH. “During this year, we made meaningful progress across our key strategic initiatives while maintaining our focus on operational discipline. As we look forward to the results of the NASDAQ hearing panel regarding our listing status held on October 16, 2025, our team is committed to positioning DIH for long-term success.”

Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2025

The overall decrease in revenue was primarily due to a change in product mix, where many customers purchased a similar number of devices but with a lower average sales price than the prior year mix. This change in mix was offset by a price increase implemented during fiscal year 2024, and effective for devices sold in fiscal year 2025. Services revenues increased slightly during the year, as the Company continues to focus on expanding its service department in established regions. Overall, as the product mix shifted to smaller and lower priced products, the revenues decreased slightly, year over year.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net sales for the year ended March 31, 2025, resulting in a decrease of approximately $0.2 million. This was mainly driven by fluctuations in Euro valuations throughout the period.

Gross profit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, was $32.2 million, an increase of 8.2% compared to the prior period. The increase was driven by a cost of goods decrease of $4.1 million, of which $5.3 million was due to the change in product mix, as the devices produced for delivery to customers had a lesser cost basis, and the impact of a lesser inventory reserve recorded in the current fiscal year, as compared to the prior year. The decreased reserve in the current year is the result of a stabilized current inventory on hand, with significantly less identified materials where excess inventory was identified. The decrease in devices costs was offset by an increase cost of services for providing routine and on demand service requests of $1.2 million between periods.

Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased by $4.2 million, or 16.3%, to $30.0 million. The increase was driven by a $1.9 million increase in personnel expenses related to compensation including an increase in performance-based compensation, merit increases to salaries, and additions in headcount as well as a $0.5 million increase in stock compensation. In addition, there was a $1.1 million in impairment of related party receivable in the year ended March 31, 2025 due to a settlement of related party balances. The provision for credit losses reflected a $0.3 million release in fiscal 2025 compared to a $1.0 million release in fiscal 2024, resulting in a $0.7 million increase in total expense in the year ended March 31, 2025.

Research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased by $0.5 million, or 7.4%, to $7.1 million primarily due to increase in software costs.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we discontinued the development and commercialization of the SafeGait product, resulting in an impairment loss of $0.6 million. We also ceased further development of capitalized software related to the HocoNet platform, resulting in an additional impairment loss of $1.5 million. There were no such impairments recognized during fiscal year 2024

Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2025 totaled $1.9 million.

Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended March 31, 2025

Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $12.6 million, a decrease of 34.7% compared to the prior year period. The decrease in devices revenue was primarily driven by lower sales volume in EMEA. In EMEA, we sell our equipment through a distributor network across Europe. One of our largest sales partners, which primarily operates in Eastern Europe, has been impacted by wartime import restrictions resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a minor unfavorable impact on our net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2025, resulting in a decrease of approximately $0.3 million.

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $6.0 million, a 30.4% decrease compared to the prior period which directly correlated to the product mix changes.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of 8.7% compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to $1.4 million of transaction costs incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 in connection with the business combination that did not recur, as well as $0.7 million of cost reductions from efficiency initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase due to the impairment on related party receivables and a $0.5 million increase in performance-based compensation, merit increases to salaries, and additions in headcount.

Research and development expenses were $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, consistent with $1.9 million in the prior-year period. The slight decrease was due to lower personnel expenses related to salary and benefit partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we discontinued the development and commercialization of the SafeGait product, resulting in an impairment loss of $0.6 million. We also ceased further development of capitalized software related to the HocoNet platform, resulting in an additional impairment loss of $1.5 million.

Subsequent Events

After March 31, 2025, the Company paid the April 2025 scheduled redemption of the Original Debentures. On May 29, 2025, the Company and Five Narrow Lane amended the Securities Purchase Agreement. Under the amendment, the deferred May 1, 2025 redemption was settled through the issuance of 1,540,277 shares of Class A common stock, and the June 2025 redemption was settled in shares as provided in the Original Debentures. The amendment permits future monthly redemptions and interest to be settled in cash or in shares, and the holder waived the default related to the deferred May payment. Separately, the Company made a partial redemption in July 2025 and deferred later scheduled redemptions while finalizing its Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On August 7, 2025, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it issued, in a private placement, senior secured convertible debentures with an aggregate principal amount of $2.2 million on an original-issue-discount basis, resulting in expected net proceeds of $1.9 million after estimated offering expenses. The debentures were structured to be funded in four tranches of gross proceeds. As of the date of these financial statements, $1.4 million has been funded under the first three tranches, and the remaining $0.5 million is expected to fund upon (a) the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, (b) delivery of a substantially complete draft Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and (c) appointment of one additional independent director.

The debentures mature on September 21, 2026. No interest accrues during the first year; beginning the first day of the month after the first anniversary, interest is 8% per annum, payable monthly. The Company may extend the maturity by six months if specified conditions are met and six months of interest is prepaid and credited against future interest. The debentures are initially convertible at $0.25 per share, subject to adjustment and a 9.99% beneficial-ownership cap. Beginning October 1, 2025, monthly redemptions of $171 thousand are required; each monthly redemption may be satisfied in cash or, if conditions are met, in shares priced at the lesser of the then-current conversion price and 90% of the average of the five lowest VWAPs for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the applicable monthly redemption date. The debentures are secured under the Company’s existing June 6, 2024 security arrangements. In connection with the financing, the Company issued warrants to purchase 8,888,888 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.25 per share, exercisable beginning February 1, 2026 and expiring February 1, 2030.

The agreements include a resale registration undertaking with filing and effectiveness timelines and liquidated damages if missed; a 90-day limitation on new issuances or registration filings after the resale registration becomes effective; a prohibition on variable-rate transactions while the debentures remain outstanding; an obligation to seek shareholder approval under Nasdaq rules to permit additional share issuances in connection with the debentures and warrants; and a commitment to include in the proxy proposals authorizing a reverse stock split to support listing compliance and amending certain June 6, 2024 and March 20, 2025 debentures to align their minimum base conversion price with the new debentures.

A 1-for-25 reverse stock split of the Company’s Class A common stock was approved by stockholders at a Special Meeting held on September 25, 2025. The final ratio was determined by the Board on September 26, 2025. The Company legally effected by filing a certificate of amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State on October 17, 2025. The Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Stock Market at market open on October 20, 2025. As a result, every twenty-five shares of Common Stock were converted into one share, decreasing issued and outstanding shares from approximately 52.3 million to 2.1 million as of the effective date. The par value and authorized shares remained unchanged.

On October 15, 2025 the Company entered into an equity line of credit agreement with Five Narrow Lane, L.P. (the “investor”) whereby the Company can issue and sell up to up to the lesser of (i) $22,000,000 in aggregate gross purchase price of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, but shall not exceed 10,458,031 Common Shares (representing 19.99% of the voting power or number of Common Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement). The shares can be purchased at 94% of the VWAP on the Business Day immediately preceding the VWAP Purchase Date but not less than $0.10 or such higher price as set forth by the Company in the VWAP Purchase Notice. In exchange for entering into the equity line of credit, the company agreed to an upfront commitment fee equal to 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock and a pre-funded warrant to purchase up to an additional 2,500,000. In the event the company does not retain listing status as a result of the NASDAQ hearings panel meeting on October 16, 2025, the shares will be returned to the Company.

Want to Capitalise on Green Premium Investment Opportunities?","Understanding Green Premium Fundamentals

Green premiums represent the additional financial burden that sustainable alternatives impose compared to conventional options in today's marketplace. This cost differential reflects the economic reality where environmentally responsible technologies require higher capital investments, specialised manufacturing processes, and developing supply networks that haven't achieved large-scale efficiencies.

The concept extends beyond simple price comparisons to encompass the true economic cost of environmental responsibility. Furthermore, modern markets increasingly recognise these premiums as essential components of the transition toward sustainable industrial practices, with trading platforms now establishing standardised metrics for green product classification.

Critical Characteristics of Green Premium Markets:

Price gaps between sustainable and traditional alternatives

Reflection of genuine environmental compliance costs

Significant variation across sectors and applications

Direct correlation with technology advancement stages

The London Metal Exchange's recent establishment of Commodity Pricing and Analysis Ltd in Dubai demonstrates institutional recognition of green premiums as permanent market features. This initiative leverages responsible sourcing criteria and digital trading platform data to create standardised premium calculations, starting with nickel markets where carbon footprint thresholds below 20 metric tons per ton of metal define green classification.

Recent market activity shows substantial trading volumes in sustainable metals. In addition, digital platform Metalshub processed over $220 million worth of Class I refined nickel transactions in 2023, with 488 tons of environmentally certified nickel traded since March 2024, establishing concrete benchmarks for premium calculations.

How Are Green Premiums Calculated Across Different Industries?

Premium calculation methodologies vary significantly depending on sector-specific requirements and measurement standards. The fundamental approach compares sustainable option pricing against conventional alternatives, though implementation details differ based on industry characteristics and regulatory frameworks.

Standard Mathematical Framework:

Green Premium Percentage = (Sustainable Product Cost – Conventional Product Cost) / Conventional Product Cost × 100

Metal markets have pioneered structured approaches to premium assessment. Consequently, the LME's new pricing administrator employs expert judgment mechanisms when sufficient trading data remains unavailable, assuming green premiums always exist within sustainable metal markets.

Industry-Specific Premium Calculations:

Sector Premium Methodology Key Variables Metals Processing Carbon footprint per ton Energy source, smelting technology Transportation Fuels Lifecycle emission analysis Feedstock origin, production method Industrial Materials Sustainability certification Raw material sourcing, manufacturing process Energy Generation Grid integration costs Storage requirements, transmission infrastructure

The nickel market's carbon footprint threshold of 20 metric tons per ton provides a concrete example of quantifiable green standards. This benchmark enables precise premium calculations based on measurable environmental impacts rather than subjective sustainability claims.

Why Do Green Premiums Exist in Today's Markets?

Multiple interconnected market forces sustain green premium structures across various industries. These fundamental drivers explain persistent price differentials despite increasing environmental consciousness and technological advancement.

Technology Development Investment Requirements

Research and development costs for clean technologies impose significant upfront expenses that manufacturers must recover through premium pricing. Patent licensing fees for innovative processes add additional cost burdens, while new facility construction requires higher capital expenditures compared to conventional alternatives.

Supply Chain Constraint Factors

Limited availability of sustainable raw materials creates scarcity-driven pricing pressure. Processing infrastructure for environmentally certified products remains underdeveloped, while specialised transportation requirements for green alternatives increase logistics costs.

Production Scale Economics

Sustainable alternatives typically operate at lower production volumes than established conventional options, preventing economies of scale realisation. Higher per-unit fixed costs across smaller manufacturing operations contribute to premium persistence, while inability to leverage mass production efficiencies maintains cost differentials.

Current copper price outlook dynamics illustrate these principles clearly. Chilean producer Codelco increased its 2026 European delivery premium to $325 per ton, rising from $234 in 2025, while German producer Aurubis implemented similar increases to $315 per ton. These premium adjustments reflect supply chain redistribution challenges and compliance cost pressures.

Which Sectors Show the Highest Green Premiums?

Certain industries face particularly severe green premium challenges due to technical complexity, regulatory requirements, or fundamental production limitations. Understanding these high-premium sectors provides insight into where sustainable alternatives face the greatest economic barriers.

Critical Materials and Specialty Metals

The germanium market exemplifies extreme premium conditions where sustainable sourcing faces geopolitical constraints. Industry specialists report material shortages at any price point, with germanium prices reaching 25-year highs following Chinese export restrictions. Some manufacturers struggle to secure supplies regardless of premium willingness.

Transportation Fuel Alternatives

Sustainable aviation fuel represents one of the most challenging green premium environments, with costs reaching multiple times conventional jet fuel prices. Limited production capacity and complex certification requirements sustain these extreme differentials, while infrastructure constraints prevent rapid scaling.

Base Metal Processing

Aluminium smelting operations with verified low carbon footprints command substantial premiums as manufacturers address scope 3 emission requirements. Industry analysts project aluminium prices above $3,000 per ton, potentially reaching $4,000, compared to current levels around $2,765 per ton, driven partly by sustainable production capacity constraints.

Rare Earth Elements

China's addition of holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium to restricted export lists creates extreme premium conditions for these specialty materials. Most metal traders lack familiarity with these elements, yet they increasingly influence global market dynamics and sustainable technology development.

How Do Government Policies Influence Green Premium Levels?

Policy interventions significantly shape green premium dynamics through various mechanisms that can either amplify or reduce cost differentials between sustainable and conventional alternatives. Government actions create both direct financial impacts and indirect market incentives affecting premium structures.

Strategic Infrastructure Investment Programmes

The Australian government's commitment of A$135 million ($87.4 million) to maintain Trafigura's smelter operations demonstrates direct policy intervention in sustainable metals processing. This investment addresses critical processing capacity shortfalls while supporting domestic sustainable material production capabilities, highlighting Aussie green metals leadership in the sector.

Export Control and Trade Policy Mechanisms

China's germanium export restrictions illustrate how trade policies create artificial scarcity conditions that amplify green premiums. Beijing's expansion of restricted export lists to include additional rare earth elements directly impacts global sustainable technology supply chains and pricing structures.

Processing Capacity Strategic Priorities

Industry leaders emphasise that processing infrastructure matters more than raw material availability for sustainable supply chain security. Trade house executives argue that Western nations need base metal smelting capacity to produce critical materials and break Chinese processing dominance over exotic metals like gallium and germanium.

Carbon Pricing and Regulatory Frameworks

Direct carbon taxation increases conventional product costs

Emissions cap systems create financial advantages for clean alternatives

International border adjustment mechanisms equalise competitive conditions

Procurement mandates establish guaranteed market demand

The collapse in copper smelting fees, with spot treatment terms turning negative, prompted joint governmental responses from Japan, Spain, and South Korea expressing concerns over raw materials market sustainability.

What Role Do Green Premiums Play in Metal Markets?

Metal markets serve as laboratories for green premium development, with sophisticated trading mechanisms and precise measurement standards enabling detailed premium analysis. These markets demonstrate how sustainability requirements integrate with traditional commodity trading structures.

Copper Market Premium Dynamics

European copper premiums for 2026 deliveries show significant increases reflecting sustainability and supply chain pressures. Codelco's premium rise to $325 per ton and Aurubis's increase to $315 per ton demonstrate how tariff policies and supply redistribution create premium pressure across traditional metal markets.

The copper premium increases signal broader market transformation where tariff-driven inventory movements to the United States force other regions to pay higher premiums for supply security. This redistribution creates artificial scarcity conditions that amplify green premium effects.

Sustainable Nickel Trading Infrastructure

Digital trading platform Metalshub established concrete frameworks for green nickel transactions, processing over $220 million in Class I refined nickel during 2023. The platform's definition of green nickel as metal with carbon footprints below 20 metric tons per ton creates measurable sustainability standards.

Since March 2024, Metalshub facilitated 488 tons of certified green nickel trades, providing sufficient transaction data to support systematic premium calculations. This trading volume demonstrates market appetite for sustainable metal alternatives despite premium costs.

Aluminium Market Transformation Indicators

Aluminium market sentiment shifted dramatically toward bullish outlooks as supply dynamics change fundamentally. China's maintained smelter capacity restrictions combined with growing demand concerns create conditions where sustainable production commands increasing premiums.

Consultancy projections for aluminium prices exceeding $3,000 per ton, potentially reaching $4,000, reflect supply constraint recognition and sustainable production capacity limitations. These price projections incorporate premium expectations for environmentally certified aluminium production.

Critical Materials Supply Chain Disruption

Rare earth export controls demonstrate how geopolitical factors amplify green premiums for critical materials. China's dominance over exotic metal processing creates vulnerability points where export restrictions generate extreme premium conditions for energy transition minerals.

How Are Companies Reducing Green Premiums Through Innovation?

New Zealand’s action plan for aviation In September, the newly established Interim Aviation Council released an aviation action plan.
Global goal for net-zero flying The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has a goal of net-zero international aviation emissions by 2050.
States have committed to mapping out plans to cut aviation emissions and submit them to ICAO.
It appears Sustainable Aviation Aotearoa has not achieved its core purpose to “provide advice and coordination to accelerate the decarbonisation” of New Zealand’s aviation sector.","Following a brief dip during the COVID pandemic, aviation is back in a growth phase.

Globally, passenger traffic is projected to grow by 3.8% annually over the next 20 years. In New Zealand, this optimism is reflected in Jetstar’s expansion plans for its domestic and trans-Tasman services and Auckland Airport’s airfield extension.

The government has welcomed the trend and sees the aviation and tourism industries as key drivers of economic growth.

But climate impacts of flying are rarely mentioned, even though the government is currently considering whether or not to include emissions from international aviation and shipping in New Zealand’s net zero 2050 target, as recommended by the Climate Change Commission.

Emissions from New Zealand’s international aviation and shipping are equivalent to about 9% of the country’s net domestic emissions. Without action to reduce emissions from these sectors, they could grow to a third of domestic net emissions by 2050, according to the commission.

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts is expected to announce a decision next month.

New Zealand’s action plan for aviation

In September, the newly established Interim Aviation Council released an aviation action plan. It covers regulation, innovation, economic growth and emissions.

The plan’s ambition is that New Zealand will be:

reducing the use of fossil fuels and transitioning to clean energy, in line with New Zealand’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In a new report, we have analysed the plan in the context of New Zealand’s international commitments.

First, let’s backtrack to 2021 and New Zealand’s first emissions reduction plan. That also included work to decarbonise aviation by setting specific targets, implementing a sustainable aviation fuel mandate and establishing a public-private leadership body.

That body, Sustainable Aviation Aotearoa (SAA), was set up in 2022. But there is no word yet on the targets or mandate. The SAA has never published any minutes, work plans, calls for evidence or advice.

Its initial balance of public and private membership became skewed in favour of industry, with more airlines and oil companies (Airbus, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, British Petroleum, Z Energy, and Channel Infrastructure) joining the group than organisations representing the environment.

Of 49 members, only three (one from the Climate Change Commission and two from the Ministry for the Environment) have an environmental focus.

New Zealand’s second emissions reduction plan, published last year, mentions aviation emissions only briefly, commenting that:

the government’s role is to facilitate industry discussions through existing forums, consider regulatory barriers and ensure New Zealand’s interests are represented on the international stage.

That statement is incorrect. The government’s role, as specified in the Climate Change Response Act, is to prepare sector-specific policies to reduce emissions. But the Climate Change Commission has reviewed these policies and found them to be inadequate – it found virtually all policy-driven goals to cut emissions were at risk of not being achieved.

Global goal for net-zero flying

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has a goal of net-zero international aviation emissions by 2050. A key task for New Zealand, one of 193 member nations, is to determine how we should implement this.

International aviation is currently a large, unregulated source of emissions. In 2024, just the first outgoing legs of flights from New Zealand emitted 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 12% of all domestic emissions from fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) combined.

States have committed to mapping out plans to cut aviation emissions and submit them to ICAO. New Zealand’s plan was already overdue in 2022. Although it appears the SAA has done some work on this, no plan has been submitted yet.

Plans from other countries, including the United Kingdom, give some idea of the challenge. They describe a mixture of low-carbon fuels, efficiency gains and offsetting – but add these won’t get us all the way.

Additional measures such as carbon removal and demand management will be required. The UK’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate began this year and will strengthen every year, with airlines facing penalties of about NZ$11 per litre for missing targets.

As the UK’s action plan notes:

Most options for aviation decarbonisation rely on new technology, the development and uptake of which is extremely uncertain, owing to the uncertain nature of technology readiness and cost of technology over time.

This is not the government’s task alone

Aviation is part of a wider system. Passengers, tourism operators, airports, airlines, fuel companies and the government all share responsibility for the sector’s requirement to cut emissions.

Failure to deliver can lead to a loss of trust and impede progress. The tourism industry is crucial for New Zealand, and it is notable that the Tourism Industry Association supports the entry of international aviation into emission targets.

It appears Sustainable Aviation Aotearoa has not achieved its core purpose to “provide advice and coordination to accelerate the decarbonisation” of New Zealand’s aviation sector.

The Interim Aviation Council may be heading the same way. It has no environmental representation and assigns no actions to the Ministry for the Environment. Nor does it mention the regulation of emissions, which is the only way to simultaneously achieve environmental goals and lower uncertainty for investors.

As the permanent council is formed, it should operate openly and balance state, industry and public interests.

AEO Secretary-General Jamal Al-Loughani told KUNA that the study examines the entire process, from sources of used cooking oil and its collection and transportation to production centers, to refining and processing steps necessary to produce high-quality, impurity-free biofuel.

According to the study, approximately 14 billion liters of used cooking oil were collected worldwide in 2022, with expectations this volume could exceed 30 billion liters by 2030. Al-Loughani also noted that global trade in used cooking oil is projected to grow from 3.7 billion gallons in 2022 to between 5 and 10 billion gallons annually by 2030, depending on efforts to stimulate its conversion into sustainable fuels.

The report details recent global advancements in producing biodiesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil. Al-Loughani highlighted projects underway in Arab countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and pointed to growing regional interest in sustainable aviation fuels, driven by goals to reduce carbon emissions, diversify economies, and conserve natural resources.

He cited Qatar Airways’ 2023 test flight using sustainable jet fuel derived from used cooking oil imported from Finland as an example of regional momentum, with more initiatives expected as airlines pursue net-zero emission targets.

Al-Loughani emphasized that investing in converting used cooking oil into biofuel maximizes resource efficiency while serving as a strategic environmental solution to lower greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security. The process also supports national economies by creating new jobs.

The airline: Croatia Airlines

Route Frankfurt to Split, flight OU417

Frequency Two to four times daily

Aircraft Dash 8-Q400

Class Economy; seat 10D, aisle

Flight time 1 hour + 45 minutes (lands 18 minutes late)

Checking in

Ten years ago, when I last flew Croatia Airlines, I had an argument with a frosty check-in attendant and swore off the airline for good. A decade has passed and I had forgotten all about the experience (and the boycott) until a few days before this flight. This time, the check-in interaction is all smiles and no complaints.

Advertisement

I stay at an airport hotel inside Terminal 1 of Frankfurt Airport the night before my flight, so I don’t have far to walk to the check-in counters. The airline instructs passengers to arrive three hours before their scheduled departure, but check-in doesn’t open until two hours prior. I’m the first in line.

Baggage

Baggage allowance varies by fare class. The lowest fare class, FlyEasy, does not include checked luggage. My FlyFlexi economy ticket includes one handbag or personal item up to eight kilograms, and one checked bag up to 23 kilograms. The aforementioned argument was about excess baggage, and I’m feeling nervous when my bag is weighed. To my surprise and relief, it’s exactly 23 kilograms.

The overhead bins are too small and narrow on this Dash 8-Q400 turboprop aircraft to accommodate roller bags. Several passengers are told by the flight attendant that their cabin bags must go in the hold.

Loyalty scheme

Advertisement

Miles & More, the loyalty program shared by several Star Alliance airlines and partners. Airlines that use Miles & More as their primary frequent flyer program include Lufthansa and Swiss. Points can also be earned and redeemed on flights with participating Star Alliance airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand.

The seat

The seats are in a 2-2 layout, 78 seats in total. I’m in aisle seat 10B. Don’t bother splurging on business class: on this plane, economy and business seats are the same width (17 inches/43 centimetres) and pitch (31 inches/79 centimetres – though the more spacious exit row seats are categorised as business). I’m short, but the legroom feels tight. A tall man sitting behind me politely asks if I’d refrain from reclining as his knees are already touching the back of my seat.

Entertainment + tech

Advertisement

Wi-Fi isn’t available on Croatia Airlines’ older, propeller-driven planes, and there are no seat-back screens or charging ports. I flick through the in-flight magazine, CROATIA. Published four times a year, it has news and guides to destinations the airline flies to, plus a selection of items for sale, including model planes and locally made jewellery.

Service

Warm, efficient and relaxed service on the ground and in the sky. Even the passengers who complain when they are separated from their cabin bags get a smile. Uniforms look professional and stylish in the classic colour combination of navy and white with a pop of red.

Food

Advertisement

On this short-haul flight, a snack of herb crackers is served, along with a choice of still or sparkling water. Food and drinks are for sale at sky-high prices: $9 for a 330ml can of Coke, $14 for a small can of Heineken beer, $9 for 40 grams of Pringles.

Sustainability

The airline is increasing its use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), expanding its fleet to include more fuel-efficient planes and focusing on better fuel management to decrease carbon emissions.*

One more thing

Advertisement

Expect to see newer planes in the fleet in the coming months and years, as the airline takes delivery of several new Airbus A220s. With visitor numbers to Croatia steadily increasing, there are plans for additional routes within Europe to be added.

The price

From €211 return from Frankfurt for economy.**

The verdict

The service is much better than what I remember from 10 years ago, but the plane is old, the seats are not comfortable and there’s no Wi-Fi.

The feasibility study will be based on NextChem waste-to-chemical segment MyRechemical SRL’s proprietary NX Circular gasification technology for converting urban and industrial waste into chemical-grade synthesis gas (syngas) that the plant would further process to produce low-carbon methanol for use in reducing emissions of hard-to-abate sectors, Maire said on Oct. 20.

The scope of the study will cover technical and economic evaluation of waste gasification as well as the subsequent purification of syngas for methanol production, according to the service provider.

If built, Maire said the plant could enable methanol production complying with FuelEU Maritime and ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, respectively, to displace fossil-based marine fuels and for use in methanol-to-jet (MtJ) production pathways aligned with emerging sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates, helping support the broader decarbonization strategies of both the shipping and aviation industries.

Project details, integration

Confirmation of the newly awarded contract to Maire follows separate Oct. 10 announcements from Mana and NG Nordic revealing entrance into an early-stage strategic partnership with Equinor to explore potential development of the large-scale waste-to-methanol plant at Mongstad.

In addition to converting about 550,000 tpy of residual, non-circular waste into 270,000 tpy of low-carbon methanol, Mana and NG Nordic said the proposed Mongstad project would also be equipped to capture and permanently store 400,000 tpy of carbon dioxide (CO2).

The partnership’s plan for using a waste-reducing feedstock to produce green fuels together with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in a single, integrated project comes as an important step in Norway’s journey to a zero-emission society, according to Mana.

""To succeed with innovation and green transition, we must build strong alliances,"" said Jon Bergan, Mana’s chief executive officer.

""The partnership with Equinor is a milestone for Mana. Together, we are taking a new step to support the development of a circular economy and industrial decarbonization in Norway,"" Bergan added.

While a precise timeline for anticipated startup of the proposed plant has yet to be revealed, Mana and ND Nordic confirmed the project’s feasibility study is targeted for completion during spring 2026.

Powered by FlyORO’s modular AlphaLite technology, it provides on-demand fuel blending and can be scaled or replicated at other airports across Australia and the Asia-Pacific.

Wagner Sustainable Fuels Chief Executive Officer Matt Doyle said the new facility forms part of the company’s broader strategy to reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and heavy transport. He noted that flexible, efficient blending solutions are essential to meet future decarbonisation goals and help the aviation sector transition toward renewable fuels.

SAF is produced from renewable or non-fossil feedstocks, including municipal solid waste, animal fats, vegetable oils, and agricultural residues. When blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF can deliver up to 80% lifecycle carbon emissions savings compared with fossil-based fuels. The current certification permits airlines to use blends of up to 50% SAF, with higher levels possible as new production pathways are approved.

According to the Boeing–CSIRO SAF Roadmap, jet fuel demand in Australia could rise by 75% by 2050, underscoring the need for scalable SAF infrastructure. Boeing’s regional partnerships aim to integrate SAF into commercial, general aviation, and defence operations. Dr. Kimberly Carnahan, Boeing Asia-Pacific sustainability director, said the company is focused on supporting local SAF production and commercialisation to help meet the aviation sector’s net-zero targets.

FlyORO Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Yeo said the modular design of the AlphaLite system allows greater flexibility, transparency, and scalability for fuel blending. The company plans to replicate the model at other airports and develop standalone facilities similar to those in Singapore.

The establishment of the Wellcamp blending terminal represents a key step in building a sustainable aviation ecosystem in Australia, expanding regional employment and enabling new export opportunities for renewable fuels.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-20 21:01:54.688189

What began as a strategy for connectivity has evolved into a foundation for diversification, technology and sustainable growth.

A sector that doubled its economic reach

The white paper shows just how dramatically aviation’s contribution has expanded in under a decade. Between 2016 and 2023, nearly every indicator of economic impact increased by double digits, and in most cases, by triple.

These figures reveal a remarkable story of economic elasticity as aviation has nearly doubled its contribution to GDP while maintaining a lean workforce. Direct employment in the sector rose by less than 5%, even as total value creation grew by more than 90%.

This means the industry is producing far greater value per employee, thanks to the region’s rapid adoption of automation, digitalisation and infrastructure efficiency. Maintenance, repair, cargo and airport operations now function as advanced industrial ecosystems, rather than labour-heavy services.

Equally striking is the scale of the indirect and induced impact, the economic ripple effect through tourism, trade, retail and logistics. These broader effects surged by 136%, showing that every new flight and every airport expansion is fuelling wider sectors of the economy.

According to the white paper, every $1 generated directly by aviation now produces $3.60 in the wider economy. That multiplier effect underscores aviation’s role not merely as a transport system but as a macroeconomic catalyst, stimulating industries far beyond its immediate reach.

National strategies and varied pathways

While the regional trend is clear, the national stories behind it vary in scale and focus. The UAE remains the benchmark, with aviation contributing 18.2% of national GDP, the highest proportion anywhere in the world. Emirates and Etihad have become global brands synonymous with connectivity and service, supporting more than 770,000 jobs and generating around $47 billion in economic output. Dubai International Airport alone is estimated to contribute roughly a quarter of Dubai’s GDP, a rare case where a single industry defines an entire city’s economy.

In Saudi Arabia, aviation is at the heart of Vision 2030. Backed by $100 billion in aviation investment and $800 billion in tourism infrastructure, the kingdom plans to handle 330 million passengers annually, reach 250 destinations, and move 4.5 million tonnes of cargo. Aviation already supports 8.6% of Saudi GDP, illustrating its growing weight in the non-oil economy and its potential to create hundreds of thousands of new skilled jobs.

Qatar has taken a more targeted approach, using aviation to project influence and facilitate re-export logistics. The sector contributes roughly 11% of GDP, led by Qatar Airways and Hamad International Airport’s efficiency-driven model. The country expects re-export activity alone to reach QAR 25 billion by 2030, cementing aviation’s role as a trade multiplier.

Further west, Egypt provides perhaps the most vivid example of aviation’s catalytic power. Since 2016, aviation’s GDP impact there has increased by 266%, driven largely by tourism and airport modernisation. The expansion of international routes has spurred rapid growth in hospitality, real estate and local transport, sectors that depend heavily on air connectivity.

Across the region, one common thread emerges: aviation is being used as industrial policy. It is a deliberate, government-backed instrument for diversification and development, rather than simply a mode of transport.

A region outperforming the world

Globally, aviation contributes around 3.5% of total GDP. The Middle East’s 4.3% share puts it nearly a quarter above the world average, a remarkable feat for a region that, just a few decades ago, had limited air transport infrastructure.

The region’s geographic advantage remains its natural strength: within an eight-hour flight of 80% of the world’s population, it has become the primary bridge between Europe, Africa and Asia. More than half of all long-haul passengers now transit through Gulf airports, making the Middle East the nexus of global aviation flow.

Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi have effectively become city-economies built on air connectivity, transforming location into long-term economic leverage. Unlike mature Western markets, where aviation’s share of GDP has plateaued, the Middle East’s growth remains exponential. Youthful populations, strong investment appetite and cohesive government strategy all combine to maintain momentum.

Technology, tourism and sustainability

The reasons behind this growth are as strategic as they are structural. The region’s central geography is the starting point, but it is the policy choices that have turned potential into dominance.

Governments have embedded aviation at the heart of their national visions. Saudi Vision 2030, the UAE Tourism Strategy 2031, Qatar Vision 2030 and Egypt Vision 2030 all treat the sector as a platform for diversification and employment. Collectively, these initiatives represent hundreds of billions of dollars in investment in airports, fleets and manufacturing zones.

Tourism integration is another powerful driver. About 59% of all visitors to the Middle East arrive by air, the highest ratio globally. Flagship projects, from NEOM and the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia to Dubai’s perpetual reinvention as a global tourism magnet, depend entirely on aviation as their circulatory system.

Technological transformation is also reshaping the industry’s economics. The region is adopting AI-driven maintenance systems, digital twins and data-led operations, improving efficiency and reducing emissions. The maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) market is forecast to reach $12.8 billion by 2030, driven by new facilities from Emirates Engineering, Saudia Technic and GE Aerospace’s regional bases.

Perhaps most significantly, the Middle East is emerging as a leader in sustainable aviation. Projects such as Saudi APSCO’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) initiative and the UAE’s SAF Roadmap demonstrate a determination to move from consumer to producer in the green aviation economy. For a region often defined by hydrocarbons, this pivot signals a profound strategic shift.

Outlook to 2043

Looking forward, the white paper forecasts aviation’s contribution to the regional economy to soar from $290 billion to $730 billion by 2043, an increase of 151%. The number of jobs supported by the sector is expected to more than double to over eight million, reflecting the depth of its supply chains in tourism, logistics and advanced manufacturing.

The region’s share of global aviation GDP will rise from 7.6% to 8.6%, while its portion of global aviation employment will approach 7%. Passenger volumes are projected to exceed 530 million per year, driven by network expansion, tourism diversification and new carriers like Riyadh Air.

This is not merely growth, it is transformation. Aviation is becoming the industrial base of the future Middle Eastern economy, uniting logistics, technology, and sustainability. Airports are evolving into self-contained economic zones, while national carriers are turning into engines of export and employment.

One of the most telling insights from the report is that aviation contributes a greater share of GDP to the UAE (18.2%) than oil does to the entire economy of the United States. Few facts illustrate more vividly how profoundly the region’s economic centre of gravity has shifted from below the ground to the skies above it.

As governments continue to invest in sustainability, technology and workforce development, aviation is set to define a new era of prosperity, one powered not by hydrocarbons, but by human mobility and global reach.

A new economic horizon

The findings of Lifting Economies confirm what the industry has long sensed: aviation is no longer a supporting market in the Middle East’s economic story but the main character. With 4.3% of GDP and 5% of employment tied to the sector, the region leads the world in aviation dependence and benefit alike.

Each terminal expansion, fleet order and training centre feeds into a wider ambition, to use connectivity as a national growth strategy. The success of this model lies in the region’s ability to treat aviation not just as infrastructure but as a driver of trade, technology, and diversification.

As the region’s runways continue to expand, so too does its economic altitude. The whitepaper reinforces with data the idea that the future wealth of the Middle East will not just be mined or built, but it will be flown.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/10/17/FAPF9733-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 13:16:41.359584

La réglementation vise précisément à garantir l’équité en imposant un cadre harmonisé à l’ensemble des acteurs du secteur aérien opérant dans l’Union.","C'est une question qui revient sans cesse dans le débat public : comment rendre le transport aérien plus respectueux de l'environnement ?

Dans ce domaine, l'Union européenne joue un rôle clé. Conformément au Traité sur le fonctionnement de l'Union européenne (TFUE), l'UE partage avec les États membres la compétence en matière de transports. En d'autres termes, elle intervient lorsque les enjeux dépassent le cadre national et nécessitent une approche commune.

La politique européenne des transports a d'abord visé à construire le marché intérieur, en facilitant la libre circulation des biens et des personnes à travers les frontières. Mais ses objectifs se sont progressivement élargis : la protection de l'environnement est désormais au cœur des décisions européennes. Grâce à ses stratégies de mobilité durable et à ses mesures de réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre, l'Union agit pour rendre les transports plus verts, notamment dans le domaine de l'aviation.

C'est dans ce contexte qu'a été adopté en 2023 le règlement RefuelEU Aviation, qui impose progressivement aux compagnies aériennes d'incorporer des carburants durables. Depuis le 1ᵉʳ janvier 2025, ce règlement demande aux fournisseurs d’intégrer au minimum 2 % de SAF dans le carburant mis à disposition des aéroports européens.

La proportion de SAF devra ensuite augmenter progressivement pour atteindre 6 % en 2030, puis 70 % en 2050. À partir de 2030, une part croissante de e-kérosène sera également imposée : 1,2 % en 2030, puis 35 % à l’horizon 2050. L'objectif global est clair : réduire les émissions nettes du secteur aérien de 55 % d’ici 2030, et de 65 à 70 % d’ici 2050, par rapport à un scénario où aucune mesure ne serait prise.

Des carburants alternatifs vraiment verts ?

Les carburants d'aviation durable, ou SAF (""sustainable aviation fuel""), sont conçus pour remplacer le kérosène classique dans les avions sans modification technique. Ils peuvent être directement mélangés au carburant fossile, jusqu’à hauteur de 50 %, et utilisés dans les moteurs actuels.

Deux grandes voies de production existent aujourd’hui. La première, déjà utilisée, consiste à fabriquer des biocarburants à partir de résidus agricoles (colza, tournesol, betteraves, canne à sucre), d'huiles de cuisson ou de graisses animales. La seconde, encore marginale, repose sur le e-kérosène, produit grâce à de l'électricité renouvelable et du dioxyde de carbone capté. Ce dernier apparaît comme le plus prometteur, à condition d'utiliser exclusivement de l'électricité d’origine renouvelable pour sa fabrication. Mais il reste pour l'heure trop coûteux et encore loin d'une production industrielle.

Selon une étude de Transport & Environment (T&E) parue en janvier 2024, 45 projets de production d’e-kérosène ont été recensés dans l'Espace économique européen (EEE). Dans le détail, l'organisation a dénombré 25 projets industriels et 20 projets pilotes plus modestes dédiés à la production d’e-kérosène pour l’aviation. Les 25 projets industriels recensés visent à produire 1,7 million de tonnes de ce carburant d’ici 2030, soit bien plus que les 600 000 tonnes exigées par la réglementation européenne ReFuelEU. Une telle production permettrait d’alimenter environ 70 000 vols Paris–New York et d’éviter 4,6 millions de tonnes de CO₂. Mais pour l'heure, aucun projet n'a encore franchi l'étape décisive de l'investissement et du lancement des travaux.

L'organisation européenne pour la sécurité de la navigation aérienne (Eurocontrol) estime également que les SAF constituent une réelle opportunité pour l'avenir. Elle affirme que ces carburants permettent de réduire jusqu’à 80 % les émissions de CO₂ par rapport au kérosène fossile. Dans les faits, leur impact dépend fortement de leur origine, de leur mode de fabrication et des ressources utilisées. Les biocarburants issus d'huiles usagées sont parmi les plus vertueux, tandis que ceux produits à partir de cultures comme le maïs ou l’huile de palme soulèvent des inquiétudes environnementales.

Des objectifs encore lointains, une Union ambitieuse

Si l'UE entend réduire les émissions nettes du secteur aérien de 55 % d’ici 2030, l'écart entre l'ambition affichée et la réalité reste considérable. En 2024, la production mondiale de SAF ne représentait que 0,53 % de la consommation de carburants d'aviation, contre 0,2 % en 2023 selon l’Agence européenne de la sécurité aérienne (AESA).

Pour atteindre l’objectif de 2030, il faudrait que la production actuelle soit multipliée par dix en seulement cinq ans. Selon certains spécialistes de la transition énergétique, la montée en puissance de la production de SAF est lente notamment à cause des tensions sur les ressources énergétiques. Concrètement, la production entre en concurrence avec d'autres besoins, tels que la demande pour l’électricité et les carburants pour les véhicules électriques, ce qui limite les capacités à se concentrer uniquement sur l'aviation.

Malgré ces difficultés, le projet européen se distingue par son caractère pionnier : à ce jour, aucune autre région du monde n’impose au secteur des quotas de carburants durables aussi exigeants.

Une équation économique difficile à résoudre

Le coût et la disponibilité du SAF sont au cœur des préoccupations des compagnies aériennes. D'après des données publiées par l'Association internationale du transport aérien (IATA), le SAF coûte entre deux à cinq fois plus cher que le kérosène fossile. Une différence de prix que les transporteurs ne peuvent absorber seuls, surtout dans un secteur très concurrentiel aux marges souvent réduites. Beaucoup de compagnies redoutent une hausse inévitable du prix des billets, qui pourrait être directement répercutée sur les voyageurs.

Selon les analyses de l'ONG Transport and Environment, les compagnies aériennes européennes affichent des écarts importants concernant l'intégration des SAF dans leur modèle de développement. Certaines, comme Air France – KLM, British Airways (International Airlines Group) ou la compagnie nationale allemande Lufthansa, sont en avance en passant régulièrement des commandes de SAF et en établissant des partenariats durables avec les producteurs. Air France est même le leader mondial selon le classement établi. À l'inverse, des compagnies telles que Ryanair ou Wizz Air misent d’abord sur l’acquisition d’avions plus économes en carburant fossile, tout en amorçant progressivement des efforts dans l'approvisionnement en carburants durables, témoignant ainsi d'une démarche plus graduelle vers la décarbonation.

Même pour les compagnies les plus volontaristes, un obstacle majeur demeure : la structure même du marché. Les compagnies aériennes fonctionnent généralement avec des contrats d’approvisionnement d'une durée limitée, souvent annuelle. Dans un marché encore naissant, il leur paraît risqué de s’engager sur plusieurs années avec un fournisseur peu connu, à un prix fixe, alors que la concurrence pourrait contribuer à réduire les coûts dans quelques années. Cette incertitude explique pourquoi certaines préfèrent temporiser avant de s'engager réellement.

Le 16 juillet 2025, le chef de l'Association du transport aérien international (IATA) a appelé l'UE à ""réévaluer"" ses objectifs de décarbonation dans le secteur aérien. ""Je pense que l'UE en particulier doit réévaluer les objectifs qu'elle a définis"", a déclaré Willie Walsh.

Selon lui, l’UE aurait d'abord dû évaluer la production actuelle et future de carburant vert avant de fixer ""un objectif pertinent par rapport à la production"". Certaines compagnies aériennes d'Europe achètent du carburant durable en dehors de l’UE pour se conformer aux seuils fixés. Une situation qu'il juge peu sensée en raison de l’empreinte carbone générée par le transport du carburant.

Contribuant à près de 3 % des émissions mondiales de dioxyde de carbone, le secteur de l'aviation est parmi les plus difficiles à décarboner.

Les mesures européennes ReFuelEU Aviation imposent des quotas de SAF dès 2025 à tous les opérateurs d’aéronefs qui effectuent des vols commerciaux au départ des aéroports situés dans l’Union européenne, indépendamment de leur nationalité. Ainsi, les compagnies aériennes non européennes sont également tenues de respecter ces quotas lorsqu’elles opèrent des vols depuis l’UE. La réglementation vise précisément à garantir l’équité en imposant un cadre harmonisé à l’ensemble des acteurs du secteur aérien opérant dans l’Union. Elle entend ainsi éviter tout risque de distorsion concurrentielle et limiter les pratiques telles que le ""tankering"" (chargement excessif de carburant hors UE pour échapper aux règles locales).

Mais la responsabilité de la transition ne repose pas uniquement sur les compagnies. Les fournisseurs de carburants sont eux aussi tenus d’incorporer un pourcentage croissant de SAF dans leur production à partir de 2025. Des mécanismes de contrôle existent et des sanctions peuvent être appliquées en cas de non-respect. Ainsi, l'analyse ne se limite pas à la demande : l'offre joue également un rôle central dans la dynamique du marché.

Une pièce centrale mais insuffisante du défi climatique

Pour la Commission européenne, les carburants d'aviation durable constituent aujourd'hui la solution la plus avancée et immédiatement disponible pour réduire les émissions, notamment sur les vols moyen et long-courriers où l’électrique et l’hydrogène ne sont pas encore viables à grande échelle. Mais ils ne suffiront pas à décarboner complètement le secteur, d'autant que la croissance attendue du trafic risque d’effacer une partie des progrès accomplis.

C'est pourquoi de nombreux experts – à l'image du scénario ""Destination 2050"" élaboré par les acteurs du secteur – insistent sur la nécessité d'activer d’autres leviers : améliorer l'efficacité énergétique des avions, instaurer une fiscalité plus équitable des carburants, renforcer le recours au train à grande vitesse ou encore limiter les trajets les plus polluants, comme les courts-courriers et les jets privés.

La décarbonation de l’aviation européenne reposera donc à la fois sur des innovations technologiques, des investissements massifs et des choix collectifs dans nos modes de transport. Les carburants durables en sont une pièce maîtresse, mais certainement pas l'unique solution.",https://www.touteleurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Aviation-durable.png,N,,2025-10-20 17:00:24.000521

In the long term (beyond 5 years), waste-based biofeedstocks are poised to become a cornerstone of the global energy transition.","London's financial district is increasingly turning its gaze towards an unconventional yet immensely promising commodity: waste-based biofeedstocks. These discarded materials, ranging from used cooking oil to municipal solid waste, are rapidly emerging as a new frontier in the global pursuit of renewable fuel production. Driven by stringent environmental mandates, the compelling economics of waste valorization, and a strategic pivot towards sustainable investments, London investors are pouring significant capital into this nascent sector, signaling a profound shift in the renewable energy landscape with far-reaching implications.

This surge in investment is not merely a fleeting trend but a calculated response to the urgent need for decarbonization and enhanced energy security. By transforming waste into valuable biofuels, the industry addresses critical environmental challenges, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and alleviating landfill pressures, while simultaneously unlocking substantial economic opportunities. The immediate consequence of this concentrated financial backing is an accelerated pace of innovation, the rapid scaling of waste-to-fuel technologies, and the solidification of a circular economy model where waste is no longer a liability but a strategic asset in the energy transition.

The Rise of Waste as a Commodity: A Detailed Look at London's Green Bet

The burgeoning interest from London investors in waste-based biofeedstocks marks a pivotal moment in the renewable energy sector. This isn't just about sustainability; it's about smart economics meeting pressing environmental needs. The core of this movement lies in the ability to convert diverse organic wastes—such as used cooking oil (UCO), animal fats, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste (MSW), and even wastewater sludge—into advanced biofuels like renewable diesel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and biogas. These fuels offer a significantly lower carbon footprint than their fossil counterparts, with some pathways even achieving negative emissions through efficient waste management.

The timeline leading up to this moment has been shaped by evolving global energy policies and a growing awareness of climate change. Over the past decade, international agreements like the Paris Agreement, coupled with national mandates such as the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), have created a robust regulatory framework incentivizing renewable fuel production. The RTFO, for instance, sets ambitious targets for fuel suppliers to incorporate increasing percentages of renewable fuel, aiming for nearly 19.5% by 2030. This policy certainty, combined with the increasing financial pressure on companies to meet Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, has made waste-based biofuels particularly attractive. The period between 2020 and 2025 has seen a notable acceleration in investment, as technological advancements in processes like anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) have made waste-to-fuel conversion more efficient and scalable.

Key players and stakeholders involved in this emerging market include specialized waste management and bioenergy companies, major oil and gas firms diversifying their portfolios, and, crucially, a growing cohort of private equity and institutional investors based in London. Companies like Alkagesta, for instance, are at the forefront, combining trade execution, risk management, and investment structuring to transform UCO and other biofeedstocks into traceable and compliant commodities. Large energy companies such as BP (LSE: BP) and Shell (LSE: SHEL) are also actively investing in advanced biofuels, recognizing the strategic importance of diversifying their energy mix. Initial market reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, with increased valuations for companies demonstrating viable waste-to-fuel technologies and a heightened interest in green bonds and sustainable finance instruments directed towards this sector. The market perceives waste-based biofeedstocks as a more resilient and less volatile commodity compared to traditional agricultural feedstocks, which can be subject to food-versus-fuel debates and price fluctuations due to crop yields.

The immediate implications are clear: a rapid expansion of waste collection and processing infrastructure, a surge in research and development for new conversion technologies, and the creation of new localized supply chains. This trend reinforces the shift towards a circular economy, where waste is viewed not as a disposal problem but as a valuable resource, impacting everything from urban waste management practices to industrial production cycles. The integration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology with Energy-from-Waste (EfW) facilities is further boosting investor confidence, positioning the UK as a leader in carbon reduction and creating new green jobs, thereby accelerating the push towards negative emissions targets.

Corporate Fortunes Shift: Winners and Losers in the Biofeedstock Boom

The escalating investment in waste-based biofeedstocks is poised to redraw the competitive landscape across several industries, creating significant opportunities for agile companies while posing substantial challenges for those slow to adapt. This paradigm shift, driven by environmental imperatives and economic incentives, will profoundly impact the operations, market positions, and financial performance of public and private entities alike.

Companies Poised to Win

The most significant beneficiaries are renewable fuel producers specializing in waste feedstocks, along with forward-thinking waste management companies and traditional energy majors diversifying their portfolios.

Renewable Fuel Producers: Companies like Neste (XHEL: NESTE, OTC: NTOIY) are leading the charge. As the world's largest producer of renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Neste's reliance on waste materials like used cooking oil and animal fats for over 95% of its feedstock by 2025 positions it for massive growth. Its proprietary NEXBTL technology ensures low carbon intensity, maximizing value in credit markets. Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR), through its 50/50 joint venture with Valero, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), leverages its global organic waste processing capabilities to create one of the world's largest renewable diesel operations, benefiting from a vertically integrated, low-cost feedstock supply. Aemetis (NASDAQ: AMTX) is expanding its dairy digester network for negative-carbon-intensity Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and developing a large SAF and renewable diesel plant using waste wood and carbon capture. Gevo (NASDAQ: GEVO), while also using renewable carbohydrates, is a key player in SAF and operates significant dairy-based RNG facilities, enhancing profitability through high-value co-products.

Waste Management Companies: Traditional waste management giants are increasingly integrating into biofuel production. Waste Management (NYSE: WM), for example, is heavily investing in RNG infrastructure, capturing landfill gas to fuel its own fleet and supply others. This strategic move transforms a liability (landfill gas emissions) into a valuable, revenue-generating asset, strengthening its market position in sustainable waste solutions.

RNG Specialists: Pure-play Renewable Natural Gas companies are also set for significant expansion. Clean Energy Fuels Corp (NASDAQ: CLNE), the largest provider of RNG in the U.S., benefits from its extensive network and strategic partnerships with major energy players. Montauk Renewables (NASDAQ: MNTK), which converts landfill and agricultural waste into pipeline-quality RNG, is well-positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for low-carbon gas. OPAL Fuels (NASDAQ: OPAL) specializes in converting biogas from landfills and dairies into RNG for heavy- and medium-duty trucking fleets, expanding its capacity through joint ventures.

Oil and Gas Majors Diversifying: Even traditional energy giants are making substantial pivots. BP (NYSE: BP) acquired Archaea Energy for $4.1 billion to significantly boost its RNG output and invested in WasteFuel for bio-methanol production from waste. TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE) has invested in Clean Energy Fuels' RNG business, while Chevron (NYSE: CVX) expanded its biofuels through the acquisition of Renewable Energy Group and a joint venture with Brightmark. Repsol, a Spanish energy company, is pioneering large-scale production of 100% renewable fuels from organic waste at its Cartagena complex, aligning with its net-zero ambitions. These companies are enhancing their market positions by diversifying their energy portfolios and hedging against future fossil fuel demand decline.

Companies Facing Challenges

Conversely, businesses that remain heavily invested in traditional fossil fuels without significant biofuel diversification, or those in waste management slow to adopt advanced conversion technologies, may face headwinds.

Traditional Fossil Fuel Producers (without diversification): Companies solely focused on crude oil and natural gas extraction and refining, without substantial investments in renewable fuels, risk long-term erosion of demand. As sectors like aviation and heavy transport increasingly mandate biofuels, these firms could see shrinking market shares and reduced profitability due to shifting demand and rising regulatory costs associated with carbon emissions.

Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Incineration Plants (without diversification): While WtE incineration plants reduce landfill volume and generate electricity, they often have high capital and operational costs and may offer lower energy conversion efficiencies compared to advanced biofuel production. If the market prioritizes waste conversion into higher-value transportation fuels over electricity generation, these facilities might struggle to compete and miss out on lucrative environmental credit markets.

Companies Reliant on Food-Based Biofuels: The persistent ""food vs. fuel"" debate and increasing governmental reluctance to support biofuels derived from food crops (e.g., corn, soy) pose a threat. Companies dependent on these feedstocks may face regulatory hurdles, reduced subsidies, and public scrutiny as waste-based alternatives gain preference, potentially impacting their market position and financial viability.

In essence, the biofeedstock boom is accelerating a fundamental transformation. Companies embracing waste as a resource are poised for operational efficiencies, market expansion, and robust financial growth, fueled by both product sales and environmental credits. Those resistant to this shift, however, risk obsolescence in an increasingly decarbonized and circular global economy.

Broader Implications: A Catalyst for Circularity and Decarbonization

The pronounced backing of waste-based biofeedstocks by London's financial sector is far more than a localized investment trend; it represents a significant accelerant for global decarbonization efforts and a fundamental shift towards a circular economy. This influx of capital into waste valorization is redefining how industries perceive and manage waste, transforming it from a liability into a critical resource for a sustainable future.

Fitting into Broader Industry Trends

This investment wave is a cornerstone of the burgeoning circular economy. By converting organic waste into valuable fuels, the process drastically reduces landfill dependence, conserves natural resources, and mitigates environmental pollution. It champions the principle of ""waste-to-wealth,"" where discarded materials re-enter the economic cycle as high-value products. London-based firms like Alkagesta are instrumental in this, structuring investments that turn biofeedstocks such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO) into investable, traceable commodities, thereby facilitating this global circular transition.

Furthermore, it is a crucial pillar of global decarbonization strategies, particularly for ""hard-to-abate"" sectors like aviation, heavy transport, and marine industries, where electrification remains challenging. Waste-based biofuels offer substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—up to 90% for Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) from UCO compared to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a more than 20% increase in global demand for advanced biofuels by 2030, with waste-derived fuels driving the majority of this expansion. Major oil and gas companies are strategically increasing their investments in this sector to meet their own decarbonization targets and respond to the growing demand for sustainable fuel sources.

Ripple Effects on Competitors and Partners

The intensified focus on waste-based biofeedstocks will create significant ripple effects. Competitors in the advanced biofuels sector will likely face increased pressure to innovate and improve efficiency, potentially leading to a more competitive market for technologies and feedstock sourcing. This could also spur the development of new global trade routes specifically for waste streams, making materials like UCO a highly prized commodity. Domestically, certain first-generation bioethanol industries, often reliant on food crops, might face challenges from cheaper, more environmentally favorable waste-derived imports.

Partners across the supply chain, from waste generators (e.g., restaurants, food manufacturers) to waste collection, sorting, and processing companies, will see increased demand for their services. This fosters greater integration into vertically aligned business models within the renewable fuel supply chain. However, it also introduces potential challenges such as supply chain disruptions and increased operating costs for biofuel producers due to feedstock scarcity and price volatility, necessitating robust long-term sourcing strategies.

Regulatory and Policy Implications

Regulatory frameworks are not just influencing but actively driving this investment. In the United Kingdom, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) mandates increasing proportions of low-carbon biofuels, with waste-derived feedstocks receiving ""double credits,"" providing a powerful economic incentive. The upcoming UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) obligation, supported by revenue-certainty mechanisms, is projected to add billions to the economy and create thousands of jobs. The European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED II and RED III) explicitly favors waste and residue feedstocks, setting blending targets and restricting food crop-based biofuels. Upcoming regulations like ""ReFuel EU Aviation"" and ""FuelEU Maritime,"" commencing in 2025, will further differentiate feedstock categories and mandate increased biofuel use in these critical sectors. Globally, government policies, including blending mandates and tax credits (e.g., the U.S. Clean Fuel Production Credit), are crucial for driving investment, though policy volatility remains a risk factor.

Historical Precedents and Comparisons

The current trend echoes past shifts in energy and infrastructure. The consistent outperformance of renewable power investments over fossil fuels in the last decade, often with lower volatility, provides a historical precedent for the financial viability of green energy solutions. There has been a clear shift from food-based to waste-based biofuels, learning from the ""food vs. fuel"" debate and indirect land-use change concerns associated with first-generation biofuels. This has paved the way for second-generation, waste-derived biofuels as more sustainable. Furthermore, the viewing of waste management companies, especially those involved in waste-to-energy conversion, as vital infrastructure assets mirrors how renewable energy was initially recognized as an investable infrastructure class. Early innovators like London-based Bio-bean, converting waste coffee grounds into biodiesel since 2014, demonstrated the feasibility of pure waste streams for biofuel production, setting the stage for today's expansive investment. These historical lessons underscore the structural, long-term nature of this transition.

The Road Ahead: Navigating the New Commodity Frontier

The trajectory for waste-based biofeedstocks is set for dynamic growth, driven by an urgent global imperative for decarbonization and the economic logic of the circular economy. London's strategic investments are not merely reacting to current trends but are actively shaping the future of sustainable energy and waste management.

Short-Term and Long-Term Possibilities

In the short term (1-5 years), we anticipate an accelerated adoption of waste-derived inputs like used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats, particularly for Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Global biofuel demand is projected to increase by nearly 30% by 2028, with waste and residues accounting for a growing share. The expansion of efficient Waste-to-Energy (WtE) facilities, driven by population growth and increased solid waste generation, will continue, with the market expected to grow by 6.3% annually to reach around $78.3 billion by 2032. Focus will remain on high-priority organic waste streams like agricultural residues, municipal solid waste (MSW), and food waste, with the waste-derived biogas market alone projected to reach $126.2 billion by 2030. Continuous technological advancements in gasification, pyrolysis, and anaerobic digestion will improve efficiency and expand the range of treatable waste types.

In the long term (beyond 5 years), waste-based biofeedstocks are poised to become a cornerstone of the global energy transition. By 2050, waste-based biofuels could supply an additional 20 million barrels per day of liquid biofuel, potentially satisfying a quarter of all future liquid fuel demand. This will involve the development of advanced biorefineries capable of converting solid wastes into liquid fuels through sophisticated pre-treatment and thermal cracking processes, yielding biofuel versions of crude oil-based products. Beyond fuels, there's significant potential for producing high-value biochemicals and bioproducts from waste streams, offering attractive economic opportunities. Integration with carbon capture technologies in WtE facilities will also become standard, further enhancing environmental performance and profitability.

Strategic Pivots and Adaptations

To fully harness this potential, several strategic pivots are essential. Significant infrastructure investment will be needed for processing plants, logistics hubs, and carbon-efficient trading systems to build robust supply chains. Governments must provide consistent policy and regulatory support, including carbon tax credits and stricter carbon regulations, to level the playing field with fossil fuels. Continued technological innovation and R&D are crucial to overcome challenges related to energy efficiency, high production costs, and the variability of waste streams. Supply chain optimization, favoring localized ""hub-and-spoke"" models for waste collection and initial conversion, will be key to managing transport costs. Crucially, traceability and certification will become paramount, ensuring feedstocks meet international sustainability criteria and attract ESG-focused investors. Public acceptance and education will also be vital to foster support for WtE projects.

Market Opportunities and Challenges

The market opportunities are vast, driven by the surging global demand for sustainable fuels, particularly in hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation. Waste-to-energy solutions offer an innovative answer to growing waste management challenges, simultaneously providing economic benefits through reduced disposal costs and local job creation. The diversification of energy supply through localized waste-based biofuels also enhances energy security. However, significant challenges persist. Feedstock supply limitations and variability are a major concern, as rapid growth in demand may outpace the supply of commonly used waste oils and fats, leading to price volatility. High production costs and the competitive economics of securing waste feedstocks remain barriers. Contaminants and impurities in waste streams necessitate advanced pre-treatment. Lastly, regulatory uncertainty and infrastructure gaps, particularly for cross-border traceability, pose ongoing hurdles.

Potential Scenarios and Outcomes

Several scenarios could unfold. An accelerated decarbonization scenario sees strong governmental support and R&D leading to waste-based biofeedstocks making a significant contribution to net-zero pathways, with the global bio-feedstock market potentially reaching USD 224.9 billion by 2035. Conversely, a feedstock crunch/stagnation scenario could emerge if supply limitations are not addressed, leading to increased competition, volatile prices, and a slowdown in decarbonization. A diversified biorefinery scenario envisions facilities producing a range of products—fuels, chemicals, and materials—from diverse waste streams, improving economic viability. Regionalized circular economy hubs with localized processing could become dominant, fostering local economies. Finally, a ""waste as an asset class"" scenario could see certified waste-based biofeedstocks become a distinct and attractive asset class for institutional investors, driving substantial capital flow into the sector. The ability to strategically adapt and innovate will dictate which of these futures materializes.

A Sustainable Future Takes Shape: The Lasting Impact of Waste-Based Biofeedstocks

The surge of investment from London's financial heart into waste-based biofeedstocks signifies a monumental shift, marking these once-discarded materials as a new and critical commodity frontier. This trend is not merely about generating profits; it's a strategic fusion of environmental necessity and economic opportunity, paving the way for a more sustainable and circular global economy.

Summary of Key Takeaways

At its core, this investment trend is driven by the ingenious transformation of waste—ranging from used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats to municipal solid waste and agricultural residues—into high-value renewable fuels like renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). London's role as a global financial hub is crucial, providing the sophisticated financial engineering and commodity trading expertise needed to scale this nascent industry. Regulatory frameworks, such as the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) and the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), offer powerful incentives, often granting ""double credits"" for waste-derived inputs, thereby accelerating their adoption and reducing lifecycle emissions. This policy support, combined with undeniable environmental benefits like reduced landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions, makes waste-based biofeedstocks an exceptionally compelling investment proposition.

Assessment of the Market Moving Forward

The market for waste-based biofeedstocks is projected for robust and sustained growth. Forecasts indicate the global bio-feedstock market will expand from USD 115.0 billion in 2024 to USD 224.9 billion by 2035, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3%. The International Energy Agency (IEA) further projects over a 20% increase in global advanced biofuel demand by 2030, with waste-derived fuels constituting the majority of this expansion. This upward trajectory is fueled by stringent carbon regulations, ambitious green mandates, and a pervasive global ambition for a circular economy across transportation, packaging, and biorefining sectors. Europe, in particular, is strategically positioning itself as a central hub for globally sourced feedstocks, necessitating significant investments in advanced physical and digital infrastructure, including specialized handling facilities and sophisticated traceability systems for cross-border supply chains.

Final Thoughts on Significance and Lasting Impact

London's endorsement of waste-based biofeedstocks transcends mere capital allocation; it represents a profound philosophical re-evaluation of resources. Waste, once an intractable disposal problem, is now recognized as a strategic commodity and an emerging asset class with tangible environmental and economic benefits. This trend offers a dual advantage for the UK and the wider global economy: it not only aids in achieving critical emissions reduction targets but also unlocks substantial investment potential, contributing to enhanced energy security and sustainability. Crucially, waste-based biofuels ingeniously bypass the ethical ""food versus fuel"" debate associated with crop-based alternatives, while offering significant carbon savings—up to 90% for renewable diesel like HVO. Their importance is particularly pronounced in ""hard-to-decarbonize"" sectors such as aviation, marine transport, and heavy trucking, where viable liquid fuel alternatives are limited. This transformation lays the groundwork for a truly circular economy, where resources are maximized, and waste is minimized, leaving a lasting legacy of environmental stewardship and economic innovation.

What Investors Should Watch For in Coming Months

Patients had a median target lesion sum of a diameter of 103 mm (ranging from 31 to 210 mm), and 81% of patients had liver and extrahepatic metastasis.

Anti-tumor Activity and Durability: Continued strong anti-tumor activity and durability of anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy

Updated data of a one-time infusion of anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy demonstrated promising benefit in a difficult-to-treat population with limited effective treatment options:

Confirmed objective response rate (cORR) of 67% (10/15 1 )

Disease control rate (DCR) of 88% (14/16)

Median duration of response (mDOR) of 11 months (min 4.4, max 31.6 months)

Median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 8.5 months (min 1.4, max 32.9) at a mFU of 10.4 months. The PFS rate was 69% at six months and 39% at 12 months

Median overall survival (mOS) not reached (min 4.3+, max 34.2+ months) at a mFU of 14.3 months. The OS rate was 71% at 12 months

Anti-tumor activity was observed in liver and extrahepatic metastases, including lung, lymph node, abdomen/peritoneum and others. 14/16 patients had target lesions in the liver and treatment with anzu-cel led to a median shrinkage in liver target lesion size of 49.6%.

Notably, 11 out of the 16 patients received a TCR bispecific (ten gp-100-targeting, one PRAME-targeting) as prior systemic treatment line, and thereof, six achieved a confirmed partial response, one a partial response and three stable disease. These results demonstrate anti-tumor activity of anzu-cel in patients who received prior TCR-based therapies.

Safety: Favorable tolerability in uveal melanoma, generally consistent with full anzu-cel tolerability profile

The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAs) were anticipated cytopenias associated with lymphodepletion. Expected and manageable cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mostly Grade 1 or 2, which is consistent with the mechanism of action (Grade 1: 37.5%, Grade 2: 43.8%, Grade 3: 18.8%, Grade 4: 0%). No patients experienced long-term CRS, and most CRS was resolved by day 14. No anzu-cel-related Grade 5 events were observed.

Tolerability in the uveal melanoma subset was generally consistent with the full anzu-cel tolerability profile in the Phase 1b.

Development Path for Anzu-cel in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma

Based on the promising clinical data in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, Immatics has initiated a Phase 2 cohort with approximately 30 uveal melanoma patients planned. The cohort is being conducted at select centers in the U.S. and Germany with deep expertise in uveal melanoma. Given the high prevalence of PRAME expression in uveal melanoma, prospective PRAME testing is no longer required for inclusion in the clinical trial.

The consistent tolerability, anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetic profile of anzu-cel across both uveal and cutaneous melanoma provide a strong rationale for pursuing a parallel late-stage development strategy to serve both patient populations.

About PRAME

PRAME is a target expressed in more than 50 cancers. Immatics is the global leader in precision targeting of PRAME and has the broadest PRAME franchise with the most PRAME indications and modalities. The Immatics PRAME franchise currently includes three product candidates, two therapeutic modalities and a combination therapy that target PRAME: anzu-cel (IMA203) PRAME cell therapy, IMA203CD8 PRAME cell therapy (GEN2), IMA402 PRAME bispecific, anzu-cel in combination with Moderna’s PRAME cell therapy enhancer.

About Anzu-cel (IMA203) PRAME Cell Therapy

Anzu-cel (anzutresgene autoleucel; IMA203) is a PRAME-directed TCR T-cell therapy engineered to recognize an intracellular PRAME-derived peptide presented by HLA-A*02:01 on the cell surface and initiate a potent and specific anti-tumor response. Anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy is currently being evaluated in a registration-enabling randomized controlled Phase 3 trial, “SUPRAME,” in patients with unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma who have disease progression on or after treatment with at least one checkpoint inhibitor. In parallel, the Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with PRAME cancers is ongoing with a focus on uveal melanoma.

NEWTOWN, Pa., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Solana Company (NASDAQ: HSDT) released the following letter from the Executive Chairman:

We are excited to enter the next phase of our lifecycle with a strong capital base and expanded accessibility for investors.

This week will be remembered as a foundational moment for Solana Company (NASDAQ: HSDT). We have made the deliberate choice to move forward with our scheduled registration for resale of the shares purchased by investors in the recent private placement rather than delay it. Whereas some of our peers have decided to postpone it at the first sign of market volatility, we want to explain why we made this decision and why we feel it positions us for long-term success.

Transparency in Volatile Markets

Markets can be volatile, and digital asset treasury companies will continue to experience volatility with the broader macro market.

In this next phase, with the resale registration statement effective, HSDT will be one of the largest effective market cap Solana DATs and therefore a strong investible option for institutional investors looking for exposure to Solana. Since we have launched the Solana treasury, we have opened up a new menu of capital providers and capital raise opportunities. That’s why we believe it’s appropriate to reach market equilibrium now rather than postpone the inevitable. The pressure on our stock price that comes with the effectiveness of the resale registration statement will likely shake out weak hands, but we believe this will also establish a remaining foundation of committed long-term shareholders. We're delivering for our investors by registering their shares on time and leaving the choice in the hands of our investors, where it belongs. That's what good stewardship looks like.

If HSDT trades below its net asset value in the coming days or weeks, understand what that means: investors can buy one dollar of Solana for less than a dollar. HSDT is committed to doing the right thing to maximize shareholder value.

Our Conviction

This strategy demonstrates the conviction in Solana that we share with our shareholders. We plan to continue to demonstrate how HSDT can be an active accumulation vehicle that acquires more SOL per share than investors can achieve on their own. We believe we can generate 7%+ yield through sophisticated institutional-grade staking not accessible to individual investors. We also intend to leverage the capital markets to acquire additional Solana. Most importantly, we expect to deploy capital strategically during market dislocations.

This is precisely where our vehicle will differentiate itself. We believe we have the right team of leaders and advisors. When the non-believers are flushed out, HSDT can continue to accrete Solana per share. We can buy aggressively when others are fearful. We believe we can compound Solana per share holdings through disciplined capital allocation.

Looking Ahead

This week may test your conviction. However, we are confident that disciplined investors who understand our strategy will one day look back on this period as an inflection point. We’re attempting to build the Berkshire Hathaway of the Solana ecosystem – a vehicle that compounds shareholder value and trades at a premium, with a strong balance sheet, a clear strategy, and the expertise of a team that is experienced with DATs and is shareholder-aligned with meaningful ownership. Our success is intertwined with Solana's success, which is why we're committed to actively contributing to ecosystem growth.

We're playing the long game, and we're inviting you to join us. We're playing offense, not defense. Thank you for your trust and partnership.

– Joseph Chee, Executive Chairman

Qatar, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Spain’s Iberia are at the forefront, implementing policies and programs to accelerate the adoption of SAF in their aviation sectors.

What Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a biofuel derived from renewable resources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and other biomass. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a crucial component in the aviation industry’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Where Are These SAF Initiatives Being Implemented?

Qatar

Qatar Airways has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and is actively working with industry stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of SAF. In 2022, Qatar Airways signed a deal with Shell to source 3,000 metric tonnes of neat SAF at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, marking a significant step in its SAF procurement efforts. Additionally, Qatar Airways is the first carrier in the Middle East to join the International Civil Aviation Organization‘s (ICAO) Global Coalition for Sustainable Aviation, reaffirming its commitment to sustainable aviation practices.

Australia

Australia is investing in the development of a domestic SAF industry through a $30 million funding initiative announced by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in July 2023. This initiative aims to reduce emissions in the aviation sector by supporting the production of SAF from agricultural feedstocks. The Australian government recognizes aviation as a “hard-to-abate” industry and is leveraging its bioenergy sector to unlock market opportunities for SAF production.

Indonesia

Indonesia plans to introduce a 1% SAF blend for international flights by 2026, with a gradual increase to 5% by 2035. The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation is currently drafting regulations to implement this SAF adoption timeline. This initiative aligns with Indonesia’s broader strategy to reduce carbon emissions from the aviation sector and promote the use of renewable fuels.

Singapore

Singapore is implementing a flight levy to boost the use of SAF, effective from 2026. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that all international flights departing from Singapore will be mandated to use SAF starting in 2026. The levy aims to provide an incentive for airlines to invest in SAF production facilities and accelerate the transition to greener aviation fuels.

Spain (Iberia)

Iberia Airlines has launched the “SAF Circle” initiative, a program designed to help companies reduce the environmental impact of their air travel by supporting the use of SAF. Companies participating in the program can purchase SAF for their flights, helping them offset the carbon footprint of their business travel. The SAF used in the program is produced at Repsol’s Cartagena plant, which can produce up to 250,000 tonnes of SAF per year.

When Will These SAF Initiatives Take Effect?

Each of these initiatives has a clear timeline for implementation. Spain’s Iberia SAF Circle program has already launched, and businesses can begin purchasing SAF for their flights as of October 2023. Singapore’s flight levy was introduced in 2023 and is set to expand as more airlines adopt SAF in the coming years. Indonesia’s SAF blend for international flights is scheduled to roll out by 2026, marking a major milestone in the country’s commitment to sustainable aviation.

These policies are designed not only to help airlines meet their sustainability goals but also to provide the necessary infrastructure and financial incentives to make SAF more accessible and affordable for both airlines and passengers.

Why Is Green Aviation Important?

The push for sustainable aviation is essential for addressing the environmental impact of the aviation industry. Air travel accounts for a significant portion of global carbon emissions, and without substantial changes, the sector will struggle to meet international climate goals. SAF is one of the most promising solutions, as it can significantly reduce emissions while maintaining the performance and safety standards of conventional jet fuel.

In addition to its environmental benefits, SAF represents a new frontier in energy production and biofuel technology. The growing demand for SAF will drive innovation and investment in biofuel production, creating new opportunities for businesses and communities in renewable energy sectors.

How Are Other Countries Responding?

Alongside Spain, Singapore, and Indonesia, other countries are also taking significant steps to promote SAF use. The United States, for example, has been working to ramp up SAF production through government incentives and partnerships with private sector stakeholders. The European Union is investing heavily in SAF research and development, with a goal to ensure SAF accounts for at least 5% of aviation fuel consumption by 2030.

In addition, Australia, Japan, and South Korea are also making strides in integrating SAF into their aviation industries. These countries have recognized the potential of SAF as a key component of their environmental strategies, aligning with international commitments to reduce carbon emissions across all sectors.

Conclusion

As countries like Spain, Singapore, and Indonesia lead the charge in integrating sustainable aviation fuels into their air travel systems, the push for greener skies is gaining momentum globally. With the aviation industry responsible for a significant share of carbon emissions, the adoption of SAF is crucial for meeting global climate goals and reducing the sector’s environmental footprint. By working together, governments, airlines, and energy producers can create a more sustainable future for air travel, one where emissions are minimized, and cleaner fuels power the skies.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/make-a-beautiuful-image-on-sustainable-a_LGsr-NFfQUaccIb1QMIAvA_6bhp1HBMQvW3gej8SDo-zg.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:56:44.177336

Delays in the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline keep reshaping plans across the Midwest. The project includes investment from Oklahoma City energy leader Harold Hamm. His involvement keeps Oklahoma tied to every major turn in this carbon capture story.

This week, Gevo Inc. moved a headline project out of South Dakota. The company will now build sustainable aviation fuel at an ethanol plant in Richardton, North Dakota. That site already captures carbon. It also sits inside a friendlier permitting climate.

Why Gevo moved

Local resistance and permitting fights slowed Summit’s route in South Dakota and Iowa.

Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber finally lost patience. “South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business. Everything is oppositional,” he told South Dakota Searchlight. “North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.”

Three years ago, Gevo broke ground on a $2.6 billion jet-fuel plant in Lake Preston. Leaders billed it as the state’s largest development project. However, the plan depended on carbon capture and pipeline access. The delays undermined that path. Therefore, Gevo shifted the project.

What it means for Summit and Oklahoma

The Richardton plant fits Summit’s model. Carbon capture sits at the center of sustainable aviation fuel economics. In 2022, Continental Resources, founded by Hamm, committed $250 million to Summit. The pipeline’s cost has since ballooned. Yet the core logic remains the same: connect ethanol plants to secure storage and cut lifecycle emissions.

North Dakota approved early carbon storage work. As a result, projects can tie in sooner. South Dakota still faces lawsuits and ballot fights. Iowa approved Summit with conditions, including permits in both Dakotas.

For Oklahoma, the story is simple. Hamm’s investment keeps the state connected to the front edge of carbon capture, ethanol decarbonization, and jet-fuel innovation. The next move in the Dakotas will shape returns for Summit’s backers—and set the pace for aviation fuel growth in the Plains.

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Kementerian Perhubungan memperkuat kebijakan untuk mempercepat penggunaan bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan (Sustainable Aviation Fuel/SAF) guna menerapkan dekarbonisasi industri aviasi nasional.

Direktur Kelaikudaraan dan Pengoperasian Pesawat Udara Ditjen Perhubungan Udara Kemenhub Sokhib Al Rokhman dalam keterangan diterima di Jakarta, Senin, mengatakan langkah percepatan kebijakan penggunaan SAF dilakukan melalui penguatan peta jalan, mekanisme pemantauan dan pelaporan emisi, serta penerapan skema Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) yang sesuai standar Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional (ICAO).

“Roadmap SAF, mekanisme MRV oleh operator, serta regulasi penerapan skema CORSIA telah disiapkan. Dengan sertifikasi sesuai ketentuan Ditjen Migas dan ICAO CORSIA, serta insentif yang proporsional, adopsi SAF di dalam negeri dapat dipercepat,” kata Sokhib.

Sokhib mengatakan Kemenhub berkomitmen memastikan seluruh kebijakan dekarbonisasi sektor penerbangan nasional berjalan sejalan dengan target penurunan emisi nasional dan standar global. Penggunaan SAF, kata dia, menjadi langkah strategis untuk menekan emisi karbon tanpa mengganggu operasional penerbangan yang sudah ada.

Hal itu disampaikan Sokhib dalam diskusi pada Pertamina Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Forum 2025 dengan tema “Sustainability: Indonesia’s Emission Reduction Ambition and the Benefits of SAF” yang menghadirkan pembicara lintas sektor dari maskapai, industri pesawat, lembaga sertifikasi dan pemerintah.

Dari sisi industri penerbangan, Country Manager Indonesia Cathay Pacific Airways Tony Sham menyebut potensi besar Indonesia sebagai pemasok SAF berbasis minyak jelantah di kawasan Asia, jika tantangan harga dan ketersediaan bahan baku dapat diatasi.

“Cathay Pacific menargetkan 10 persen pemakaian SAF pada 2030. Kolaborasi lintas pelaku menjadi kunci untuk mempercepat transisi ini,” ujarnya.

Sementara itu, Senior Managing Director Boeing Malcom An menilai kawasan Asia Tenggara memiliki sumber daya memadai untuk memenuhi kebutuhan bahan bakar berkelanjutan secara mandiri.

“Minat untuk mengubah minyak jelantah dan limbah pertanian menjadi SAF terus meningkat. Kawasan ini bahkan berpotensi memproduksi lebih untuk diekspor,” katanya.

Dari sisi standar mutu, CEO Qualitas Sertifikasi Indonesia Ryanza Prasetya menjelaskan pentingnya penerapan International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) CORSIA guna memastikan integritas rantai pasok SAF.

Sertifikasi tersebut, ujarnya, menjamin asal bahan baku, perhitungan emisi, dan ketelusuran produksi sesuai standar global.

Direktur Utama Pertamina Patra Niaga Mars Ega Legowo Putra mengatakan, melalui penyelenggaraan forum ini, Pertamina memperkuat peran sebagai penggerak utama pengembangan energi bersih untuk industri penerbangan.

Pertamina Group diketahui telah memanfaatkan minyak jelantah sebagai bahan baku SAF melalui ekosistem terintegrasi mulai dari pengumpulan, pengolahan, hingga distribusi.

Langkah tersebut diharapkan dapat menekan emisi karbon sekaligus menciptakan nilai ekonomi sirkular bagi masyarakat.

The company, via its business unit MyRechemical, has been awarded a contract by Altalto Ltd. to develop an engineering study for the construction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) plant in Immingham, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. The facility is expected to become operational by 2030 and will produce 30 million liters of SAF per year—equivalent to approximately 23,000 tons of low-carbon fuel.

This initiative aligns with the UK’s SAF Mandate, part of the national strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by at least 50% by 2050. The plant will convert residual municipal solid waste (MSW) and commercial and industrial (C&I) waste into high-quality synthetic fuel, turning non-recyclable waste into a valuable energy resource.

According to project estimates, the annual fuel output will be sufficient to power over 500 transatlantic flights between London and New York, reducing net CO₂ emissions by more than 100,000 tons per year. This substantial climate impact will be further enhanced by the integration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, designed to capture and reuse CO₂ released during production.

The NX Circular process converts waste into synthesis gas (syngas), which is then transformed into SynCrude through Velocys’s Fischer-Tropsch technology. This intermediate product is subsequently refined into high-quality sustainable fuels suitable for aviation. The NX CPO system, based on a controlled partial oxidation process, further optimizes carbon efficiency and maximizes yield while minimizing environmental impact.

Through MyRechemical, NextChem will act as the technology provider and coordinator among the industrial partners involved in the project. The NX Engineering District in Catania, together with other Maire Group companies, will provide technical and operational support during both the design and implementation phases.

Maire’s technological approach underlines the increasing role of waste-to-chemical processes in the circular economy. By transforming waste streams into energy products, these solutions can significantly reduce landfill use, cut methane emissions, and support the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Globally, SAF is expected to represent up to 10% of total aviation fuel consumption by 2030, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), with production expected to rise from the current 0.5 billion liters to over 30 billion liters annually.

Economic and Employment Impact

Beyond its environmental benefits, the Immingham project is expected to have major economic and social impacts. Supported by the UK Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund, the initiative will generate around 1,000 direct and 300 indirect jobs during the construction phase, while creating approximately 100 permanent positions once operational. The investment will also contribute to strengthening the UK’s energy security by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels and stimulating the local industrial supply chain.

According to Altalto, the project will attract new private capital and foster long-term innovation partnerships within the British bioenergy and waste management sectors. Moreover, by producing low-carbon fuel domestically, the UK could save up to £50 million per year in import costs while cutting lifecycle emissions by 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

For Fabio Fritelli, Managing Director of NextChem, “this recognition confirms the validity and flexibility of our technological proposal, which meets the needs of mobility sector players, particularly in aviation where decarbonization is of fundamental importance.” His statement wants to underscore the strategic vision driving Maire’s international expansion and its role as a leading developer of circular and low-carbon solutions.

Only two airlines, Air France and British Airways, operated the original Concorde commercially, starting in 1976.
Due to the loud sonic booms created by breaking the sound barrier, its flights were restricted to transatlantic routes over the ocean.
Described as 'quiet', the aircraft's special design means it will make a thump noise instead of a loud sonic boom.","More than 20 years since the Concorde made its final journey, industry insiders have confirmed that the next generation of supersonic jets could enter service in the next few years.

The announcement follows the signing of new US legislation this June, removing bans on supersonic travel over land.

This has been made possible by modern noise-reduction technologies that suppress the loud sonic booms, which was a criticism of the original Concorde.

The new aircraft unofficially dubbed 'Concorde 2.0' is being led by Fly‑Concorde Ltd, a company backed by international engineers and aviation innovators, according to Euro Weekly News.

The updated version of the Concorde will feature a host of new design elements and cutting-edge technology.

The aircraft will be powered by sustainable aviation fuel, weigh approximately 50 per cent less than its predecessor and fly at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet.

Reports suggest that the first commercial services are being timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Concorde's maiden transatlantic crossing in 1976.

Journey times on routes such as London to New York, or Los Angeles to Washington, could be reduced to just two hours - a drop from the current six to seven hours.

Ticket prices are expected to be high initially, appealing to business travellers and premium fliers.

However, manufacturers hope that operating costs will eventually come down, allowing broader public access to ultra-fast travel.

Though not a direct relaunch of the original Concorde, which was decommissioned in 2003, this new chapter in aviation honours its legacy while embracing 21st-century environmental and technological standards.

The Concorde was the first turbojet-powered supersonic airliner to enter service flying passengers across the Atlantic at twice the speed of sound.

Only two airlines, Air France and British Airways, operated the original Concorde commercially, starting in 1976.

Due to the loud sonic booms created by breaking the sound barrier, its flights were restricted to transatlantic routes over the ocean.

Concorde's famous passengers included royalty, musicians, actors, and politicians, such as Queen Elizabeth II, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger and Joan Collins.

Concorde made its last-ever flight on November 26, 2003, departing Heathrow Airport and landing in Bristol, greeted by a cheering crowd gathered behind fences near the runway

It comes as NASA's X-59, a supersonic research aircraft, could fly from the capital of the UK to New York in around three hours and 44 minutes.

Described as 'quiet', the aircraft's special design means it will make a thump noise instead of a loud sonic boom.

The $247.5 million jet has been dubbed the 'Son of Concorde'.

For the Airbus A320neo family, for instance, the company supplies the high bypass geared turbofan engines collectively called GTF.

The breed has been around for decades now, and it didn't seem in need of an upgrade, but Pratt & Whitney thinks differently, and that's why over the past few years it has been busy developing something called the GTF Advantage, an updated version of the current PW1100G powerplant.

The main reason why the company opted to revise the engine was to give A320neo operators enhanced payload and range, but also a more durable configuration that could double the engine's time on wing. As a bonus, more thrust (4 percent more at sea level and 8 percent more at high-altitude airports) is also thrown into the mix.

The engine got the type certification for the Airbus A320neo family from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) earlier this year, but now Pratt & Whitney announced the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) cleared it as well – and this opens the door for the GTF Advantage to take off for the first time commercially in 2026.

Hailed as a game-changer for operators, the powerplant will be offered on new A320neo aircraft, but the ones that use the current GTF could make use of it as well, as the two versions are intermixable and interchangeable. In the not-so-distant future, Pratt & Whitney plans to make the Advantage the new production standard.

There are a few key upgrades that should make the Advantage a better choice than the current variant, including the lowest fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for single-aisle aircraft, increased airflow in the core that results in lower operating temperatures, and a new airfoil design in the high-pressure turbine.

As a bonus, the engine will probably be fully compatible with future versions of the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and it will likely be able to operate entirely on this kind of source of energy.

The engine maker does not say who will be the first customer to use the new engine but says it already has 11,000 orders for the extended GF family. And that's saying something, seeing how there are only 2,200 GTF-powered aircraft flying in the sky today, serving the needs of no less than 80 operators.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/new-pratt-whitney-engine-for-the-airbus-a320neo-cleared-to-fly-in-2026-259512_1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 10:56:25.768930

Together, they paint a compelling picture — one where Ethiopia could become a continental leader in bioethanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

From Cassava to Sustainable Jet Fuel

Ethiopia’s biofuel journey began with a simple ambition: to reduce fuel imports and create rural jobs through domestic ethanol production.

The RSB Biofuel Strategy reaffirmed this goal, setting out a policy roadmap built on three pillars:

Feedstock expansion – large-scale cassava and sugarcane development with smallholder out-growers.

National blending mandates – progressive ethanol blending targets of E10 → E20, backed by fuel security objectives.

Private-sector participation – incentives for investors through public-private partnerships, concessional finance, and tax reliefs.

Today, Ethiopia already produces ethanol from molasses for both E5 fuel blending and clean cooking, but supply remains far below potential. With the sugar sector under reform, the government aims to revive underutilised estates like Finchaa, Metehara, and Kessem — creating a platform for industrial biofuel expansion.

The Alcohol-to-Jet Advantage

The World Bank’s 2024 SAF report identifies Ethiopia as one of Africa’s most promising locations for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.Its techno-economic modelling found that the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway is the optimal technology for Ethiopia — both technically and economically.

“An investment of $376 million in an alcohol-to-jet facility could meet 6 percent of Ethiopia’s jet-fuel demand,”

notes the World Bank, highlighting sugarcane and molasses as the most viable feedstocks.

Unlike other SAF pathways such as Fischer-Tropsch or hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), ATJ leverages Ethiopia’s existing ethanol infrastructure.By converting fermented ethanol into jet fuel through dehydration, oligomerisation and hydrogenation, the country can extend the value chain of its bioethanol industry into aviation fuels — a strategic advantage few African nations possess.

Market Potential Across Transport, Cooking and Aviation

The RSB Biofuel Strategy forecasts a combined national bioethanol demand exceeding 250–350 million litres per year by 2030:

This multi-sector demand base offers investors a diversified revenue model: domestic blending, clean-cooking distribution, and exportable SAF via book-and-claim systems under ICAO CORSIA or EU ReFuelEU frameworks.

Policy Tailwinds: Ethiopia’s Biofuel Transformation

Both the RSB and World Bank highlight clear policy imperatives driving the sector:

Energy security – Biofuels reduce dependency on imported petroleum, saving scarce foreign exchange.

Climate alignment – SAF from sugarcane or molasses can cut lifecycle emissions by >60 percent, meeting international certification thresholds.

Investment readiness – Reforms to open Ethiopia’s fuel import market and attract private capital mark a decisive shift toward liberalisation.

Social inclusion – Out-grower programmes ensure rural communities share in value creation from feedstock production.

The Road Ahead

Ethiopia’s next decade will be defined by its ability to turn feedstock abundance into refined fuels.

With ATJ technology as its backbone, the country can establish a vertically integrated renewable-fuel value chain — from sugarcane farms to SAF-ready airports.

But success will hinge on coordinated action:

government policy enforcement,

concessional financing from development banks,

and strategic partnerships with global fuel offtakers.

As the World Bank concludes, “Ethiopia’s heavy reliance on imported jet fuel makes local SAF production a strategic priority for enhancing energy security and reducing operational costs for its aviation sector.”

In Summary

Ethiopia stands on the threshold of a renewable-fuel revolution. With the RSB setting the policy vision and the World Bank validating the economics, the country has all the ingredients — feedstock, demand, and intent — to become Africa’s first integrated bioethanol-to-SAF hub.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e95502_8a6eaa7b1cf64a11a228fc036c0f20a8~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1536,h_1024,al_c/e95502_8a6eaa7b1cf64a11a228fc036c0f20a8~mv2.png",N,,2025-10-20 12:01:20.615806

Sovereign wealth fund Danantara said Monday that it was still reviewing the feasibility of the government-backed projects worth over $38 billion projects in the country’s downstream industries before deciding to make some investments.

Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia had drawn up a list of 18 projects worth $38.63 billion that Indonesia wishes to work on with Danantara’s help. The projects spans various resources, all aimed at getting Indonesia to move up the value chain by producing higher-valued goods. Bahlil, who leads the downstream development task force, had handed over these projects’ pre-feasibility documents to Danantara in late July. The ball remains in Danantara’s court, as the fund -- which now controls all state-owned enterprises -- intends to only finance projects that they deem “investment-ready”. According to Danantara’s chief executive officer Rosan Roeslani, the reviews are still ongoing, while admitting that some projects required “fine-tuning”.

""We will keep in touch with the Energy Ministry,"" Rosan told the press in Jakarta.

“There are some projects that need some adjustments, including on the projections,” he said.

Rosan did not disclose the timeframe of when the reviews would likely finish, nor the details of the projects that still needed some improvements. Bahlil’s aide Ahmad Erani Yustika not long ago told reporters that the review would likely finish by the end of the year, saying that Indonesia would like to actually execute the plan “as soon as possible”.

A few days ago, Bahlil told the 18 projects could directly create “almost 300,000 jobs” within the targeted industries. It is expected to generate a million jobs in indirect employment, thus possibly spurring a more equitable growth in regions outside Java.

Past media reports showed that some of the projects included coal gasification, palm oil-based oleofood, and sustainable aviation fuel based on cooking oil. When Danantara received the pre-feasibility study documents, Rosan said at the time that the fund was open to partnering with both state-run and private-owned firms in financially backing the projects.

According to government’s estimates, the resource-rich Indonesia needs up to $618 billion investments to develop the downstream industries of its minerals, oil, forestry, fishery, marine, and plantation commodities, by 2040. Indonesia needs $498.4 billion in investments to turn its raw minerals and coal into higher valued goods. Indonesia began this budget-heavy industrialization with nickel -- a key ingredient in electric vehicle battery production. The Southeast Asian country had stopped exporting unprocessed nickel in 2020, only wanting to sell half-finished or finished goods made from the silvery white metal. The policy has ruffled Europe’s feathers, but became a major economic driver. Indonesia’s nickel derivative exports only reached $3.3 billion in 2017, but soared to $33.9 billion last year.

But look a little closer, and you'll see a powerhouse of international activity, especially in the maritime and aviation sectors.

As of May 2025, over 291 merchant ships, 349 yachts, and 285 aircraft are registered here, representing billions of pounds in assets managed, financed, and operated across the world.

These aren't just numbers, they're a testament to how the Isle of Man has earned the trust of global asset owners through regulation, reputation, and results.

Let's look closer at the numbers that tell a story.

For a jurisdiction of just over 80,000 people, the scale and sophistication of the Isle of Man's maritime and aviation registries are extraordinary. The Island's brand has quietly become synonymous with quality, and global asset owners have increasingly taken notice.

The Isle of Man Ship Registry

Consistently ranks among the top registries in the world for quality, safety, and performance, the Isle of Man Ship Registry's fleet sails under a flag synonymous with reliability and one that exceeds international standards and holds a ""low-risk"" status under the Paris and Tokyo Memoranda of Understanding. It:

is ISO-certified (ISO 9001 and ISO 14001), indicating strong quality controls and environmental systems.

operates on a cost-neutral basis, meaning it is not profit-driven, allowing for competitive fee structures.

delivers 24/7 responsiveness, backed by a global network of surveyors in key locations.

supports multiple regimes (for yachts): pleasure yachts, commercial yachts, and new schemes like Yachts Engaged in Trade (YETs).

supports title registration for merchant ships and allows mortgages to be registered against vessels.

has a simpler Part II register for 'small ships' (less than 24m) which offers a lighter-touch regime with fewer requirements (though without mortgage capability).

has fairly broad ownership eligibility including individuals, body corporates, and limited partnerships, subject to criteria (residency, place of incorporation, etc.).

supports flexibility in structuring for example, appointment of a local 'representative person' when required (for non-Isle of Man owners of vessels over 24 m).

is a British register, which means Isle of Man-flagged vessels enjoy the right to fly the Red Ensign and benefit from access to British diplomatic and naval support globally.

is careful to position itself not as a 'flag of convenience', emphasising its quality, compliance, and professional oversight.

These features give owners both flexibility and peace of mind.

The Isle of Man Aircraft Registry

Meanwhile, the Isle of Man has long been a jurisdiction of choice for private and corporate jet ownership and registration. The Isle of Man Aircraft Registry's client base includes some of the most prominent global operators and high-net-worth individuals who value efficient service, regulatory confidence, and international recognition. It:

has registered over 1,000 aircraft (to date) and is ranked among the top dedicated private/corporate registers globally. Total aircraft currently on register is 285 (194 business jets, 37 helicopters, 29 turboprop, 9 light aircraft and 16 transactional aircraft) – as at 28 May 2025.

has the motto 'Safety with Service', balancing high regulatory standards with client-centric responsiveness.

uses an online platform, ARDIS, enabling digital services like registration searches, reservation of out-of-sequence registration marks, mortgage searches, and invoice payments.

accepts corporate/private jets, twin turbine helicopters, and in some cases smaller turbine aircraft (or light aircraft owned by Island residents).

has the nationality mark ""M-"" followed by four characters (for example, M-YJET, M-ANDY). The neutrality of that prefix is an advantage in some jurisdictions or regions.

allows personalised registration marks are permitted, and the prefix may be recycled across different airframes.

offers flexibility in acceptance of airworthiness, crew licences, and maintenance programmes, so long as they comply with major recognised standards (FAA, EASA, JAA etc.).

is aligned with the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) of the Isle of Man, and oversight is anchored in compliance with ICAO standards and recommended practices.

is trusted by financiers, with a published aircraft mortgage register, enhancing lender comfort.

has won many awards including Best Global Aviation Registry (in 2019 and 2020) in the World Commerce Review Awards.

These combined features make the Isle of Man particularly attractive to owners of corporate jets and high-end aviation assets.

Why Choose the Isle of Man?

Add the Island's renowned corporate structuring capabilities to the above, and the message is clear: this is a jurisdiction that moves assets that move the world.

So, what makes the Isle of Man such a trusted home for global assets?

At the core lies stability; politically, economically, and reputationally. The Island operates under its own government, legal system, and regulatory frameworks, offering a balance of autonomy and alignment with the UK and international standards.

Its regulatory environment is robust but pragmatic, ensuring compliance without unnecessary complexity. Both the Ship and Aircraft Registries are known for their responsiveness, technical expertise, and most importantly, client-centric approach; rare qualities in a global landscape often dominated by bureaucracy.

Beyond policy, there's credibility, built over decades. The Isle of Man has invested in professionalism, transparency, and innovation to ensure that its registries and corporate service providers aren't just keeping pace with global change but helping to shape it.

The global asset landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Owners are increasingly influenced by ESG considerations, digital transformation, and shifting geopolitics.

We're seeing a growing preference for jurisdictions that demonstrate environmental and ethical accountability, qualities the Isle of Man has embraced through its Blue Carbon initiatives, zero-emission maritime goals, and commitment to sustainable regulation.

Digitalisation is also reshaping compliance and administration, with e-registration, blockchain verification, and AI-assisted governance becoming part of the new norm. The Island's forward-thinking approach positions it well to adapt, and even lead, in this changing world.

As international regulation tightens and perceptions around transparency evolve, the Isle of Man remains steady, trusted, and agile, and these are qualities that global asset owners value now more than ever.

So, whether it's a superyacht cruising the Mediterranean or a jet crossing the Atlantic, its roots may well trace back to a small island in the Irish Sea.

How can we assist?

For asset owners, choosing where to register is just one part of a much larger picture.

Behind every ship, yacht, or jet lies more than just an asset – there's ownership, governance, and legacy at stake.

At Sentient International, we specialise in creating the robust structures that sit behind these global assets.

Working alongside clients and their advisors, we set up and administer structures that align with international tax, regulatory, and family governance frameworks, supporting everything from private aviation holdings and shipping groups to family offices managing diverse portfolios. Whether through trusts, companies, or bespoke succession vehicles, we ensure that ownership is secure, compliant, and built to endure.

A travel expert has shed light on what the resurgence of supersonic air travel could mean for future passengers. Nearly two decades after the grounding of the iconic Concorde, it appears the legendary aircraft may soon grace our skies once more.

Tech firms are suggesting that by 2026, passengers could be experiencing supersonic journeys again, with flight durations significantly shorter than those currently offered by commercial airlines. One might question why it's taken so long for supersonic flight to stage a comeback - but a pivotal development has now paved the way. In June 2025, the United States enacted a key piece of legislation that lifted the longstanding ban on supersonic travel over land.

As reported by Euro Weekly News, this significant policy shift opens up the potential for new routes across North America and beyond. The original Concorde was criticised for its noise levels, but updated models aim to address this issue with contemporary noise-reduction technology, reports the Express.

The revival is being spearheaded by FlyConcorde Ltd, a firm supported by international engineers and aviation innovators. Their revamped version of the Concorde will boast a range of new design features and state-of-the-art technology.

The aircraft will run on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), weigh roughly 50% less than its 20th-century predecessor, and fly at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet. Nicholas Smith, Holidays Digital Director at Thomas Cook and eSky online travel agency, told Express.co.uk: ""While it's thrilling to imagine this aviation icon back in the skies, it's unlikely to appeal to the average holidaymaker from the UK jetting off to Benidorm for a week in the sun.

""We see the future of mainstream air travel heading towards larger, more efficient aircraft designed to carry more people, not fewer. That said, a modern relaunch focused on sustainability, digital innovation, and safety could carve out a niche for high-end, short-haul luxury routes - such as London to New York in under four hours.

""It's not a mass-market solution, but for time-sensitive premium travellers, it could once again become the pinnacle of prestige flying.""

Reports indicate that the inaugural commercial flights are planned to mark the 50th anniversary of Concorde's first transatlantic voyage in 1976.

Flight durations on routes including London to New York or Los Angeles to Washington could be slashed to merely two hours - a substantial reduction from the present six to seven hours.",https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/article32712529.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_British-Airways-Concorde-Farnborough-International-Airshow-September-10th-1986.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:01:35.578054

It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the 176-member state UN agency responsible for developing global standards for shipping, announced that its member states have voted to delay the adoption of the “IMO Net-Zero Framework,” a global agreement aimed at implementing measures to reduce the climate impact of ocean shipping.

The establishment of the international net zero shipping framework was delayed despite an initial draft receiving majority support in April, following significant pressure from the U.S.’ Trump administration, which had threatened a series of retaliatory actions against nations supporting the agreement.

Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios. Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.

The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.

Under the framework, ships would be required to comply with a new global fuel standard to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time, with ships above the GFI thresholds required to balance their emissions deficit by transferring “surplus units” earned by other ships or used surplus units they may have already banked, or to purchase remedial units.

Proceeds from the sale of remedial units would contribute to an IMO Net-Zero Fund, rewarding low-emission ships, supporting innovation, research, infrastructure and just transition initiatives in developing countries, funding technology transfer and capacity building to support the IMO GHG Strategy, and mitigating negative impacts on vulnerable states.

The April framework was approved by 63 nations in April, while the U.S. publicly opposed the agreement and left the negotiations prior to the vote, following which the administration warned of “reciprocal measures” to compensate for any fees under the new framework charged to U.S. ships, and “for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures.”

Prior to the beginning of negotiations to adopt the framework last week, the U.S. State Department issued a communication stating that “the Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO,” and detailing a series of actions that it would consider on nations supporting the framework, including “considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries,” imposing visa restrictions on crews, imposing commercial penalties and additional port fees, and “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers,” among other potential measures.

A motion to delay the negotiations on the framework by a year put forward by Singapore and tabled for a vote by Saudi Arabia was agreed to by 57 countries, and opposed by 49, with 21 abstaining.

Industry participants expressed disappointment with the delay, citing the uncertainty it will create in their emissions reduction initiatives and investments. In a statement following the announcement, shipping giant Maersk called the decision “a loss of momentum for the shipping industry’s efforts to decarbonize,” and that it now must “await further clarity on the road ahead and on how the IMO intends to continue the work on the Net Zero Framework.”

Maersk added:

Sustainable aviation initiatives not only reduce emissions but also enhance the appeal of these destinations as leaders in responsible tourism.
The combination of a flight levy, centralized fuel procurement, and regional collaboration offers a replicable model for sustainable air transport.","The global aviation sector is entering a new era of environmental accountability, and Singapore is taking a decisive step forward. In a landmark move, the nation has passed a parliamentary bill that imposes a fixed flight levy aimed at curbing carbon emissions and fostering the widespread use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This initiative places Singapore at the forefront of green aviation in Asia, setting a precedent for other nations seeking to balance air travel growth with environmental sustainability. The levy will be collected by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), which will utilize the funds to procure and manage SAF across airlines operating from the city-state.

With air travel rebounding strongly after the pandemic and climate change remaining a global concern, Singapore’s decision reflects a forward-thinking approach that blends economic resilience with ecological responsibility. The nation aims to increase SAF usage to more than 1% by 2026, with an ambitious plan to expand that figure to 3–5% by 2030. The initiative not only supports environmental goals but also reassures travelers that sustainable flying can remain affordable and accessible.

Singapore’s Flight Levy: A Step Toward Sustainable Air Travel

Under the newly approved policy, every departing flight from Singapore will include a fixed levy collected by CAAS. The funds will directly support the procurement and management of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ensuring that airlines contribute to emission reduction efforts. According to Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling, this centralized approach will enable the government to manage resources efficiently and negotiate better terms with global suppliers of SAF.

This model marks a shift from the traditional airline-by-airline procurement of fuel toward a unified, government-led strategy. The goal is to aggregate SAF demand across carriers, which would help achieve economies of scale and stabilize prices in a market where sustainable fuel production remains limited and costly.

By ensuring consistent SAF availability, Singapore is also positioning itself as a strategic hub for green aviation in the Asia-Pacific region — a move that complements its reputation as a global air transport center and tourism gateway.

The Cost Impact: Shared Responsibility for a Greener Future

Concerns often arise when new environmental levies are introduced, particularly regarding potential fare hikes. However, Singaporean authorities have clarified that the new levy will not cause a significant increase in airfares. The additional cost will be modest — approximately S$3 (US$2.30) per passenger for an economy-class direct flight, depending on the travel distance.

Rather than placing the entire burden on airlines or passengers, the initiative distributes the cost evenly across all air transport users. This balanced model reflects a principle of shared responsibility, encouraging travelers, operators, and policymakers to work collectively toward achieving a carbon-neutral aviation sector.

The modest increase is a small price to pay for a cleaner sky and a more sustainable future. For eco-conscious travelers, it also offers an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to environmental preservation each time they fly.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that Sustainable Aviation Fuel could deliver up to 65% of the emissions reductions needed for the global aviation industry to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, SAF currently accounts for just 0.7% of global aviation fuel use, leaving a long road ahead for scaling up production and adoption.

SAF is typically produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and other bio-based materials. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF significantly lowers lifecycle carbon emissions — in some cases by up to 80%. It can also be blended seamlessly with existing jet fuel, allowing airlines to use it without modifying their aircraft engines.

By driving demand through policy, Singapore is creating market confidence that could stimulate global investment in SAF production. This move aligns with the broader sustainable tourism movement, as travelers increasingly prefer airlines and destinations that demonstrate environmental responsibility.

Regional Momentum: Thailand Joins the Sustainable Push

Singapore’s leadership is already inspiring regional action. In neighboring Thailand, the Department of Energy Business has announced that the country’s first national standard for SAF specifications will be released within this month. The new standard will come into effect on January 1 next year, marking a significant milestone in Southeast Asia’s collective effort to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

By developing standardized fuel criteria, Thailand is ensuring that locally produced and imported SAF meets international quality and safety benchmarks. This alignment will facilitate easier trade and cooperation across borders, allowing airlines to adopt eco-friendly fuel options with greater confidence.

Together, Singapore and Thailand are creating a blueprint for sustainable aviation in Asia, setting the stage for other countries to follow suit.

Tourism and the Future of Green Aviation in Asia

For the tourism sector, these developments could not come at a better time. Post-pandemic travel demand continues to soar, but so do concerns about the environmental consequences of flying. By integrating sustainability into aviation policy, Singapore and Thailand are sending a clear message that growth and responsibility can coexist.

Eco-conscious tourists are increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize environmental ethics, and the rise of SAF-backed flights offers them tangible ways to make greener travel choices. Sustainable aviation initiatives not only reduce emissions but also enhance the appeal of these destinations as leaders in responsible tourism.

Travelers arriving at Changi Airport or exploring the natural wonders of Thailand can now be part of a global sustainability journey — one that connects leisure, business, and climate action.

Global Context: Aligning With Long-Term Climate Goals

Singapore’s levy aligns closely with the global aviation industry’s broader sustainability roadmap. As countries pledge to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, initiatives like this help bridge the gap between ambition and action.

By leveraging its role as an international aviation hub, Singapore demonstrates how small island nations can exert outsized influence on global environmental policy. Its proactive stance could encourage more nations to introduce green levies or adopt centralized SAF procurement systems.

The ripple effect could accelerate investment in SAF production facilities, stimulate technological innovation, and ultimately lower costs for airlines and passengers worldwide.

A Greener Horizon for Global Air Travel

Instead, the cabin is wrapped in towering six-foot-wide digital panes, each powered by high-resolution exterior cameras, offering fliers enhanced 4K renders of the horizon in colour-saturated clarity (something Otto Aerospace CEO Paul Touw dubbed “supernatural vision”).

“You could sit in our seat and look at the entire world around you… It is surreal,” Touw told The Wall Street Journal.

But this isn’t just another vanity project to benefit one-percenters.

Without the structural weight of windows, Otto Aerospace’s teardrop-shaped private jet promises a 60% cut in fuel burn compared with peers – a radical efficiency that could, in theory, make chartering private cheaper than flying business class on commercial carriers.

The concept has already seduced the likes of Flexjet, one of America’s biggest names in private aviation, inking a contract valued at an estimated US$5.85 billion for 300 Phantom 3500s – deliveries are slated for the early 2030s.

Flexjet – valued north of US$4 billion and recently buoyed by an US$800 million injection from LVMH-affiliated private equity firm L Catterton, is betting that its clientele (CEOs, ultra-high-net-worth families, younger generation of tech-native flyers) will embrace the Instagrammable novelty and Trojan gamechanger.

For context, the company already curates rarefied perks like Napa Valley tastings and philanthropic galas. A futuristic, windowless cabin feels like the natural extension of its brand.

And as for Otto Aerospace, the Phantom 3500 is just the beginning.

Backed by US$250 million in private investment and an additional US$515 million state government incentive package, the start-up has built its first full-scale mockup and is already eyeing larger regional aircraft once Phantom jet takes hold; with the US$43 billion annual market for business aviation at stake – far more lucrative than the frontier fantasies of space tourism, claims Paul Touw.

“Everybody’s running around excited about Firefly and SpaceX. But the market for moving wealthy people around the world every day is actually much bigger than the market for moving stuff into space,” said the chief executive.

The cherry on top of this exceedingly ambitious sundae?

Otto Aerospace is also targeting zero-emission flight by 2030 for the Phantom 3500 (and the rest of its coming lineup), by combining full laminar-flow fuselage design with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The company believes emissions can fall by up to 90% once SAF is applied.

With Flexjet’s colossal order, they may have found their launch pad. Keep an eye out here for when the Phantom 3500 officially takes off for its maiden flight in 2027.",https://www.bosshunting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/interior-SNV-main-1.webp,N,,2025-10-20 07:21:26.395636

Este foro ha servido como espacio de reflexión y diálogo sobre cómo avanzar hacia una aviación sostenible y el papel del combustible de aviación sostenible (SAF del inglés Sustainable Aviation Fuel) para conseguirlo.

Rocío Blanco, consejera de Empleo, Empresa y Trabajo Autónomo de la Junta de Andalucía, inauguró el evento destacando el crecimiento histórico del sector, que superó los 15.000 trabajadores el año pasado, gracias a la colaboración público-privada.

La descarbonización es el principal desafío del sector aéreo, el cual es responsable de casi el 3 % de las emisiones globales de CO2 en Europa. En este contexto, el Combustible Sostenible de Aviación (SAF) se perfila como la solución tecnológica más rápida y eficiente para alcanzar el objetivo de cero emisiones netas en 2050. La regulación europea ReFuel Aviation ya obliga a un suministro mínimo de SAF, comenzando con el 2 % en 2025, el 6 % en 2030 y escalando hasta el 70 % en 2050.

Álvaro Macarro, director de Aviación Sostenible de Moeve, enfatizó que, si bien el primer año del mandato ReFuelEU Aviation activó el mercado con un aumento de la demanda y la concienciación, el principal reto para España es de tipo regulatorio y de inversión, no tecnológico.

El director de Moeve señaló que los Estados miembros deben complementar el impulso generado por el mercado con políticas nacionales que faciliten tanto la producción como el acceso al combustible sostenible.

A pesar de los desafíos de implementación, la producción de SAF presenta un gran potencial económico para España. Se estima que este desarrollo podría generar hasta 56.000 millones de euros de impacto en el Producto Interior Bruto (PIB) en el año 2050, según un informe elaborado por Moeve, Iberia, Vueling, BIOCIRC y PwC.

Andalucía se posiciona como una región estratégica en este desarrollo industrial. Moeve está construyendo en el Parque Energético La Rábida, en Huelva, el mayor complejo de biocombustibles de segunda generación del sur de Europa. Esta instalación tendrá una capacidad de producción anual superior al millón de toneladas de diésel HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) 100 % renovable y SAF.

Macarro afirmó que Moeve está apostando firmemente por Andalucía como eje estratégico de su actividad, con proyectos que combinan innovación, sostenibilidad y colaboración público-privada. El director expresó su convicción de que la región puede convertirse en un referente europeo en movilidad aérea sostenible.

Por su parte, Juan Román, director de Andalucía Aerospace y moderador del encuentro, asumió el compromiso del clúster con la sostenibilidad y la responsabilidad medioambiental, ejes estratégicos del futuro de la aviación.

Nyt fuusioteknologia on Pohjoismaissa askeleen lähempänä toteutumista.

Novatron Fusion Group (NFG) - ainoa yksityinen fuusioenergiayhtiö Pohjoismaissa - kehittää magneettiseen peiliin perustuvaa fuusioreaktorikonseptia, jonka tavoitteena on luoda kaupallisesti kannattava ja kustannustehokas puhtaan energian lähde. Päätöksenteon tueksi NFG tilasi VTT:ltä selvityksen mahdollisista pilottifuusioreaktorin sijoituspaikoista neljässä Pohjoismaassa.

Raportin tutkimustulokset esitellään tänään Espoossa järjestettävässä Nordic Fusion Forum -tapahtumassa. Tilaisuudessa puhuva Suomen ympäristö- ja ilmastoministeri Sari Multala korostaa, että fuusioteknologian läpimurrot ovat käymässä toteen:

""Läpimurrot fuusioteknologiassa eivät ole enää pelkkää teoriaa. Digitalisaation ja tekoälyn hyödyntäminen on varmasti auttanut, mutta ennen kaikkea olemme päässeet näin pitkälle tutkijoiden ja insinöörien kovan työn ja päättäväisyyden ansiosta”, Multala sanoo.

VTT:n analyysissa tarkasteltiin sääntelyyn, ympäristökysymyksiin sekä operatiivisiin ja yhteiskunnallisiin tekijöihin liittyviä haasteita ja mahdollisuuksia kussakin maassa.

”VTT on tehnyt erinomaista työtä toimittamalla perusteellisen raportin, jossa on selkeä ja käytännönläheinen tiekartta konseptista rakentamiseen. Rajat ylittävä yhteistyö, lainsäädäntöuudistukset ja fuusiostrategioiden kehittäminen ovat avainasemassa pohjoismaisen fuusioekosysteemin vauhdittamiseksi”, sanoo Novatron Fusion Groupin toimitusjohtaja Peter Roos.

Parhaat mahdollisuudet löytyvät olemassa olevilta teollisuusalueilta lähellä tutkimuskeskittymiä

VTT:n tutkimusryhmän johtaja Markus Airila kertoo, että lupaavimmat sijainnit fuusioreaktorille löytyvät jo olemassa olevilta teollisuusalueilta, joissa on hyvät liikenneyhteydet.

”Satamien ja tutkimuskeskittymien läheisyys sekä raskaan liikenteen maayhteydet ovat sopivimpien paikkojen tärkeimpiä ominaisuuksia”, Airila sanoo.

Tutkimuksen mukaan lupaavimmat alueet pilottifuusioreaktorille ovat:

Suomessa pääkaupunkiseutu noin 50 kilometrin säteellä Helsingistä

Ruotsissa Tukholman ja Nyköpingin välinen alue

Kööpenhaminan ja Malmön metropolialue Tanskan ja Ruotsin rajalla

Lisäksi tutkimuksessa tunnistettiin noin kymmenen toissijaista sijoituspaikkaa, jotka jakautuvat kaikkien neljän maan kesken.

Sääntelyvalmius vaihtelee Pohjoismaissa

Fuusioenergialla on vielä selvitettävänään tiettyjä sääntelyn esteitä. Maiden sääntely-ympäristöjä vertailleessa tutkimuksessa todetaan, että Suomen lainsäädäntö on tässä suhteessa kehittyneintä ja Ruotsi seuraa tiiviisti perässä.

Suomi uudistaa parhaillaan ydinenergialakiaan, mikä yksinkertaistaa lupaprosessia ja vähentää esteitä pilottifuusiokohteille. Muutosten odotetaan astuvan voimaan vuonna 2027.

”Samankaltaista lähestymistapaa noudattamalla muut Pohjoismaat vahvistaisivat asemaansa kansainvälisellä fuusiosektorilla”, VTT:n Markus Airila sanoo.

Maat, joilla on oma fuusiostrategia ja erillinen lainsäädäntö fuusiolle ja fissiolle, ovat laitosten kehittäjille houkuttelevampia, sillä ne vähentävät ei-teknisiä riskejä.

Ruotsilla on vakiintunut ydinenergialainsäädäntö, jota sovelletaan nimenomaisesti myös fuusioreaktoreihin. Sääntely on kuitenkin edelleen laajasti fissioon keskittyvää. Tanskassa ja Norjassa taas toimitaan vanhemman sääntelyn mukaan, jossa fuusioenergiaa ei mainita erikseen. Tämä luo epävarmuutta menettelytapojen ja poliittisen päätöksenteon suhteen.

Fuusio voi olla lähempänä kuin uskotaan

Airilan mukaan tutkimuksen havainnot osoittavat, että Pohjoismaat ovat valmiita johtamaan fuusioenergian kehitystä eteenpäin.

”Kansallisten viranomaisten, teollisuuden ja paikallisten yhteisöjen tiiviillä yhteistyöllä ensimmäiset fuusioprojektit voivat toteutua nopeammin kuin moni odottaa”, Markus Airila sanoo.

”Vaikka kilpailukykyisen energiantuotannon saavuttaminen on edelleen suuri haaste, fuusiolaitos tuo ympärilleen paljon yhteiskunnallista hyötyä kuten asiantuntijoiden työpaikkoja ja kysyntää vaativalle teknologialle, jota voidaan siirtää muihinkin sovelluksiin. Jos fuusioteollisuuden kasvu maailmalla jatkuu ennustetusti, tästä syntyy erittäin merkittäviä vientimahdollisuuksia.”

Projektin seuraavassa vaiheessa tuotetaan yksityiskohtaiset ja paikkakohtaiset selvitykset laitoksesta kiinnostuneiden pohjoismaisten sidosryhmien ja teollisuuskumppanien kanssa. Tuolloin mahdollisia sijoituskohteita tarkennetaan maanomistuksen, paikallisen halukkuuden ja teknisen toteutettavuuden perusteella.

Energiayhtiö St1 ilmoitti keväällä 2025 sijoittaneensa 13 miljoonaa euroa Novatron Fusion Groupiin tukeakseen energiasiirtymää Pohjoismaissa.

”Novatron Fusion Group vauhdittaa puhtaan energian läpimurtoa, ja olemme ylpeitä voidessamme tukea tätä kehitystä pitkäjänteisesti. Tämän raportin havainnot nostavat esiin Pohjoismaiden konkreettiset mahdollisuudet globaalissa fuusiokehityksen kilpailussa.

Anläggningen, med projektnamnet FlagshipThree, kommer att byggas intill Umeå Energis kraftvärmeverk Dåvaverket i Umeå Eco Industrial Park. Den planeras producera upp till 100 000 ton e-metanol per år och samtidigt fånga in 150 000 ton biogen koldioxid med hjälp av koldioxidinfångning och -användning (CCU). Planen är att komma igång med byggnation 2026 och ta anläggningen i drift 2028.

– Det är en viktig milstolpe för vårt team, och resultatet av ett starkt och konstruktivt samarbete med Umeå Energi. Med avtal på plats och tillstånd beviljade går vi nu in i nästa fas, som erbjuder investerare en tydlig väg till klimatnytta och långsiktigt värde, säger Claes Fredriksson, vd på Liquid Wind i en presskommentar.

Elektrobränslet – en fossilfri metanol som kan ersätta fossila bränslen i bland annat sjöfart och flyg – produceras genom att biogen koldioxid fångas in från kraftvärmeverkens rökgaser, som uppstår vid förbränning av skogsrester. Koldioxiden reagerar sedan med vätgas med hjälp av en katalysator och omvandlas till elektrobränsle.

– Det här blir en anläggning i teknisk framkant som skapar nytta för Umeåborna, men också för Sverige och internationellt, säger Jan Ridfeldt, vd på Umeå Energi.

– Nu söker vi investerare som vill vara med och skapa affärsnytta, nya arbetstillfällen och en starkare grön ekonomi – lokalt, nationellt och på EU-nivå.

Supported by Amadeus, BBVA, Repsol, and Telefónica, the program allows businesses to link part of their Scope 3 emissions to the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reports INSPENET.

The initiative was created to encourage companies to take an active role in reducing emissions in the aviation sector. Through SAF Circle, corporate and cargo flights operated by Iberia can use SAF certified under the European Renewable Energy Directive. Companies participating in the program receive certification for their use of SAF, which can help improve their performance on environmental and sustainability measures.

Companies are grouped into tiers, which come with rewards in Iberia’s loyalty program and access to better services. The program is designed to combine environmental responsibility with business benefits, giving companies an incentive to adopt cleaner fuels.

Some of the fuel used in the program comes from Repsol’s Cartagena plant, which can produce up to 250,000 tons of SAF per year. This supports Spain’s clean energy industry and positions SAF as a practical alternative to traditional kerosene.

SAF can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, without requiring any changes to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. SAF Circle offers an immediate solution for companies looking to reduce indirect emissions from business travel and cargo transport.

KONTAN.CO.ID - JAKARTA. Pertamina Patra Niaga menegaskan komitmennya dalam mendorong dekarbonisasi sektor penerbangan melalui pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Isu ini menjadi fokus dalam panel diskusi bertajuk “Sustainability: Indonesia’s Emission Reduction Ambition and the Benefits of SAF” pada Pertamina SAF Forum 2025.

Country Manager Indonesia Cathay Pacific Airways Tony Sham menyoroti pentingnya ekosistem dan kebijakan pendukung adopsi SAF di Asia.

“Cathay Pacific menargetkan 10% pemakaian pada 2030, sementara pada tahun 2024 saja Cathay Pacific telah menggunakan 6.884 KL SAF. Indonesia berpotensi menjadi pemasok strategis SAF berbasis minyak jelantah bila tantangan ketersediaan dan harga dapat diatasi melalui kolaborasi lintas pelaku,” kata dia dalam keterangan tertulis, Senin (20/10).

Sementara itu, Direktur Kelaikudaraan dan Pengoperasian Pesawat Udara Kementerian Perhubungan Sokhib Al Rokhman menegaskan pemerintah tengah memperkuat kebijakan untuk mempercepat penggunaan SAF yang selaras dengan roadmap dan standard internasional.

“Roadmap SAF, mekanisme MRV oleh operator, serta regulasi penerapan skema CORSIA telah disiapkan. Dengan sertifikasi sesuai ketentuan Ditjen Migas dan ICAO CORSIA, dan insentif yang proporsional, adopsi SAF di dalam negeri dapat dipercepat,” ujarnya.

Di sisi lain, Senior Managing Director Boeing Malcom An menyoroti bahwa upaya dekarbonisasi di sektor penerbangan membutuhkan pendekatan yang melibatkan seluruh industri. Boeing, kata dia, berupaya mewujudkan penerbangan yang lebih berkelanjutan melalui pesawat yang lebih baru dan efisien, energi yang lebih bersih, serta teknologi canggih.

Di kawasan Asia Tenggara, minat untuk mengubah minyak jelantah dan limbah pertanian menjadi bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan (SAF) terus meningkat. ""Kawasan ini memiliki sumber daya yang cukup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan bahan bakar sendiri, bahkan berpotensi memproduksi lebih untuk diekspor,” ujarnya.

Dari sisi sertifikasi, CEO Qualitas Sertifikasi Indonesia, Ryanza Prasetya menegaskan pentingnya International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) CORSIA dalam menjaga integritas dan keberlanjutan rantai pasok SAF. “Sertifikasi ini memastikan asal bahan baku, perhitungan emisi, dan ketelusuran di setiap tahap produksi berjalan transparan dan sesuai standar global,” ujarnya.

Pada kesempatan tersebut, Direktur Utama Pertamina Patra Niaga, Mars Ega Legowo Putra menyampaikan melalui penyelenggaraan Pertamina Sustainable Aviation Fuel Forum 2025, Pertamina Patra Niaga menegaskan komitmennya untuk berada di garis depan dalam pengembangan energi bersih bagi industri penerbangan.

Un progetto che consolida la leadership tecnologica italiana nel settore del Waste-to-Chemical e apre la strada al primo grande polo nordico dedicato al metanolo circolare.

Il cuore dell’iniziativa è la tecnologia NX Circular, sviluppata da MyRechemical, che consente di trasformare i rifiuti urbani e industriali in gas di sintesi di grado chimico, poi convertito in metanolo a ridotta impronta carbonica. Il processo si inserisce pienamente negli obiettivi europei di decarbonizzazione e nel quadro della Direttiva sulle Energie Rinnovabili (RED III), garantendo la produzione di un carburante conforme ai requisiti ambientali più stringenti.

Il metanolo prodotto potrà essere inizialmente utilizzato come combustibile marino, in linea con il regolamento FuelEU Maritime, consentendo agli operatori navali di ridurre drasticamente le emissioni ed evitare l’acquisto di crediti ETS o il pagamento di penali. A lungo termine, lo stesso metanolo circolare potrà diventare una materia prima strategica per la produzione di Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), in coerenza con il regolamento FuelEU Aviation, rafforzando così il contributo alla mobilità sostenibile del futuro.

In qualità di integratore tecnologico e fornitore di servizi, NextChem fornirà a Mana Group ed Equinor un’analisi dettagliata di fattibilità tecnica ed economica, che includerà la valutazione dei processi di gassificazione dei rifiuti e la purificazione del gas di sintesi necessario alla produzione di metanolo di alta qualità.

“Siamo orgogliosi di supportare questa partnership strategica, funzionale al potenziale sviluppo del primo grande progetto nordico di produzione di metanolo da rifiuti presso Mongstad, in Norvegia”, ha dichiarato Fabio Fritelli (nella foto), Managing Director di NextChem. “Il Nord Europa rappresenta un contesto ideale per progetti industriali replicabili e scalabili, con benefici ambientali e industriali tangibili”.

“Kilang Cilacap merupakan kilang dengan hasil produk terbanyak dibandingkan kilang milik Pertamina lainnya, meliputi BBM Perta Series, solar, LPG, dan avtur konvensional maupun SAF,” ujar Wahyu.
KPI menargetkan pada tahun 2027, kandungan sulfur pada produk BBM yang dihasilkan kilang Pertamina akan terus dikurangi.
“Masih dalam tahapan perencanaan itu misalnya Diesel Hydrotreater, kemudian GSH, Gasoline Selected Hydrotreater,” tutur mantan GM Kilang Cilacap tersebut.","INDRAMAYU – PT KIlang Pertamina Internasional (KPI) memastikan kualitas produk bahan bakar minyak (BBM) yang diproduksi sudah diuji secara ketat agar memenuhi spesifikasi standar. Uji kualitas produk BBM dilakukan di semua kilang yang dimiliki KPI dengan menggunakan mesin CFR (Cooperative Fuel Research) yang merupakan alat standar internasional yang digunakan untuk menguji ketahanan bahan bakar terhadap knocking (detonasi), terutama untuk menentukan angka oktan (RON) dan angka setana (Cetane Number).

“Alat pengujian di seluruh kilang yang ada di dunia menggunakan CFR. Ini single brand yang dari Amerika Serikat. Seluruh kilang Pertamina memiliki alat ini sehingga produk yang telah lolos pengujian dipastikan telah memenuhi standar internasional. Semua produk BBM kami sebelum dipasarkan sudah melewati proses pengujian ini dan telah tersertifikasi,” tutur Yulianto Triwibowo, General Manager Pertamina RU VI Balongan, di Indramayu, pekan lalu.

Yulianto menambahkan selain memenuhi standar kualitas BBM, operasional Kilang Cilacap sudah menerapkan standar keselamatan dan keamanan yang sangat tinggi. Apalagi, kata dia, kilang-kilang Pertamina ini usianya sudah cukup tua. “Kami di Pertamina terus melakukan berbagai improvement untuk menjaga keandalan kilang. Semua itu kami lakukan agar Pertamina tetap menjadi kebanggaan Indonesia. Walaupun banyak tantangan, kami tetap bekerja dengan tenang dan fokus,” kata dia.

Manager Engineering & Development Kilang Balongan Hadi Siswanto menjelaskan Kilang Balongan memiliki kapasitas 150 ribu barel per hari (bph), atau sekitar 14,2% dari kapasitas total kilang milik Pertamina. Produk utama Kilang Cilacap adalah Bahan Bakar Khusus (BBK) seperti Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Avtur Pertadex sebanyak 52%, BBM (Premium dan Solar) 26%, Propylene dan LPG masing-masing 6%, produk aviation sebanyak 1%, dan sisanya produk lain-lain (HMOC, Decant Oil, LCO Mix, dan GO Foam) sebesar 9%.

“Sebanyak 82% produk Kilang Cilacap memenuhi kebutuhan di DKI dan Jawa Barat, 12% wilayah lain, dan sebanyak 6% di ekspor ke Singapura berupa Decant Oil,” kata Hadi.

Sementara itu, General Manager RU IV Kilang Cilacap Wahyu Sulistyo Wibowo mengatakan Kilang Cilacap memproduksi semua produk BBM, mulai dari Perta Series, solar, avtur dan yang terbaru adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang berbahan minyak jelantah. Wahyu menjelaskan, sebelum dilempar ke pasaran, produk-produk BBM tersebut diuji terlebih dahulu di laboratorium internal Kilang Cilacap. “Pengujian tersebut termasuk dalam menentukan Research Octane Number (RON) pada BBM. Pengujian dilakukan menggunakan mesin CFR,” katanya.

Dia menjelaskan mesin CFR bekerja dengan mensimulasikan kondisi pembakaran di dalam mesin kendaraan, termasuk tekanan, suhu dan rasio kompresi yang dikontrol secara ketat, sehingga hasilnya dapat digunakan untuk memastikan kualitas bahan bakar sesuai standar,” ujar Wahyu, akhir pekan.

Menurut Wahyu, semua produk yang diuji dalam laboratorium dipastikan dengan kualitas baik, bahkan bisa melebihi spesifikasi standar. Misalnya, untuk BBM jenis Pertalite dengan RON 90, dalam pengujian di laboratorium hasil RON yang muncul di alat bisa 90,1 atau 90,2. “Jika angka yang muncul di bawah standar yang ditentukan, maka pengujian dilakukan lagi dari awal, hingga hasilnya sesuai. Kami tidak pernah menjual BBM ke masyarakat dengan spesifikasi lebih rendah dari yang ditentukan,” ungkap Wahyu.

Dengan begitu, ia meminta masyarakat tidak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI. Wahyu menjelaskan semua produk BBM tersebut telah diolah dengan pengawasan ketat, untuk memastikan kualitasnya paripurna sebelum didistribusikan. “Semua produk yang kami hasilkan terjamin kualitasnya, sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang ditentukan sehingga aman untuk digunakan masyarakat,” tandas Wahyu.

Selain pengujian di laboratorium internal, BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI juga diuji dilaboratorium eksternal, sebagai bentuk pengendalian mutu yang berkelanjutan. Salah satunya, pengujian dilakukan di Balai Besar Pengujian Minyak dan Gas Bumi (BBPMGB) LEMIGAS yang merupakan laboratorium independen, pada periode Agustus-September lalu.

Wahyu mengatakan, hasil pengujian tersebut menunjukkan kalau semua produk BBM olahan KPI memenuhi spesifikasi yang telar disyaratkan dalam Keputusan Direktur Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi, Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM). Adapun produk yang diuji di LEMIGAS diantaranya BBM jenis Pertalite, Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Pertadex, Biosolar dan Avtur atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang. “Hasil pengujian ini membuktikan kalau proses pengolahan di KPI tetap optimal dan menghasilkan produk energi yang sesuai dengan standar nasional,” kata dia.

Kilang Cilacap memiliki total kapasitas pengolahan 348 ribu bph yang terdiri dari dua Crude Distillation Unit (CDU). CDU-1 sudah beroperasi sejak 1976 berkapasitas 100 ribu bph dan CDU-2 beroperasi pada 1984 dengan kapasitas 200 ribu bph.

Pada tahun 1997, Kilang Cilacap melakukan revamping atau pengembangan, menambah kapasitas CDU-1 menjdi 118 ribu bph, dan CDU-2 menjadi 230 ribu bph. Dengan begitu, total kapasitas Kilang Cilacap menjadi 348 ribu bph. “Saat ini merupakan kilang terbesar milik Pertamina. Nanti, mungkin kedua setelah Proyek RDMP Balikpapan selesai dan diintegrasikan dengan kilang eksisting dengan kapasitas 360 ribu bph,” ungkapnya.

Selain itu, Kilang Cilacap memiliki Residual Fluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) mulai 2015 dengan kapasitas 62 ribu bph. Unit ini didesain untuk mengolah residu menjadi produk dengan nilai ekonomi tinggi seperti LPG, Propylene, Polygasoline (mogas dengan RON 98), Naptha (RON 92), Light Sycle Oil (LCO) danDecant Oil (DCO).

Sementara produk bahan bakar hijau (biofuel) diproduksi melalui Unit Treated Distillate Hydro Treating (TDHT). Pengolahan dilakukan secara co-processing antara Refined Bleached Deodorized Palm Oil (RBDPO), Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized Palm Kernel Oil (RBDPKO), maupun minyak jelantah (UCO). “Kilang Cilacap merupakan kilang dengan hasil produk terbanyak dibandingkan kilang milik Pertamina lainnya, meliputi BBM Perta Series, solar, LPG, dan avtur konvensional maupun SAF,” ujar Wahyu.

Kurangi Kandungan Sulfur

KPI menargetkan pengurangan kandungan sulfur pada produksi BBM. VP Process & Facility KPI, Edy Januari Utama, mengatakan peta jalan pengembangan kilang akan dilakukan dengan beberapa kategori. Pertama yakni memenuhi batasan spesifikasi, salah satunya kandungan sulfur. Dia mencontohkan, kadar sulfur pada produk Diesel awalnya sebesar 3.500 part per million (ppm), kemudian dikurangi menjadi 2.500 dan 2.000 ppm pada produk Biosolar. “Kadar sulfurnya selalu dikurangi menjadi lebih baik lagi,” katanya.

KPI menargetkan pada tahun 2027, kandungan sulfur pada produk BBM yang dihasilkan kilang Pertamina akan terus dikurangi. “Untuk itu aka nada beberapa proyek yang sudah disiapkan,” tuturnya.

Pertamina baru saja meluncurkan produk Diesel X melalui unit Gas Oil Hydrotreater di Kilang Balongan. Edy mengungkapkan, perusahaan tengah merencanakan unit yang sama untuk produk Gasoline alias bensin. “Masih dalam tahapan perencanaan itu misalnya Diesel Hydrotreater, kemudian GSH, Gasoline Selected Hydrotreater,” tutur mantan GM Kilang Cilacap tersebut.(LH)",https://www.dunia-energi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CML2629.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:22:48.110163

Addressing AASA’s 55th Annual General Assembly (AGA) in Lusaka, Zambia, Munetsi said for too long, African aviation has been underestimated — especially by Africans.
On supply chain, he noted that the global shortage of air- craft and parts has severely affected African airlines.
Manufacturers quote up to six-year delivery lead-times, which requires older, less efficient aircraft to be kept in service for longer.
Only by working together can we ensure Africa’s aviation sector finally takes off and becomes far more than a twoper cent player in the global market,” he concluded.","…excessive taxes, charges make travel expensive

The Chief Executive Officer of Airlines Association of Southern Africa (AASA), Aaron Munetsi, said airlines, airports, air navigation services, regulators and equipment suppliers all had a part to play in rewriting Africa’s aviation negative narrative and demonstrating that African carriers can hold their own globally.

This is coming as he lamented that Africa’s carriers face more than $220 million in additional supply chain-related costs this year alone, with a call that if governments genuinely want to democratise air transport, they should remove excessive statutory charges and taxes that have driven up costs, made ticket prices higher and pushed air transport beyond the reach of most Africans.

Addressing AASA’s 55th Annual General Assembly (AGA) in Lusaka, Zambia, Munetsi said for too long, African aviation has been underestimated — especially by Africans. He further noted that Africa is home to 1.4 billion people, the world’s youngest population and a growing middle class, but with just 2.2 per cent of the global air transport market share, “we are still idling on the run- way”.

The group called for a bold, collective effort to democratise and liberate the continent’s aviation sector through a series of interventions, including harmonising regulations, opening markets to competition, stabilising the industry supply chain, financial discipline, governance as well as fixing critical aviation infrastructure and related services.

Restoring confidence in Africa’s Skies, Munetsi out- lined AASA’s multi-pronged strategy for boosting Africa’s air transport sector, such as safety and standards, adding that Africa must harmonise oversight and recognise mutual licensing and certification — as the EU did in the 1990s — to support SAATM implementation and improve efficiency.

On supply chain, he noted that the global shortage of air- craft and parts has severely affected African airlines. Manufacturers quote up to six-year delivery lead-times, which requires older, less efficient aircraft to be kept in service for longer.

For financial sustainability, he called on state-owned airlines to be run with accountability, cost discipline, innovation and partnerships to drive better financial performance.

Munetsi stated that despite Africa’s small 2% share of global aviation emissions, governments should be facilitating investments in locally produced sustainable aviation fuel while their aviation infrastructure services should be improving operational procedures to help airlines reduce fuel burn and carbon emissions.

To him, empowering Africa’s youth, women, and innovators is key and requires investments in training, mentorship and inclusion, reiterating that in tandem, archaic protectionist practices and processes that restrict growth had to be stopped with governments rolling back excessive taxes and charges on air transport.

Munetsi raised concerns about operational inefficiencies and safety failures in South Africa, citing the on- going suspension of over 200 instrument flight procedures by Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS), which continues to disrupt airline operations and cost airlines millions of dollars in additional fuel, engine wear and maintenance, crew flight duty, flight operations sup- port, customer compensation and reputational damage.

AASA is worried that the glacial pace at which air- space management failures are being addressed meant the scale of the economic impact is not fully grasped. “The failure to design, manage and maintain air- space cannot be dismissed as an ‘inconvenience’.

It needs to be seen for what it is; an economic disaster which demands a commensurate emergency disaster response. The lack of urgency is reflected in the glacial pace at which approval renewals were being processed,” he emphasised.

AASA also called on governments to invest in digital border and customs systems and to relax restrictive visa regimes that deter travel. It also wants to see Mozambique and other governments with foreign reserves release airlines’ blocked funds and let local airlines access foreign currency to purchase aircraft spare parts and cover other dollar-priced costs.

“African aviation’s success depends on collaboration and shared responsibility. It’s time to stop talking and start improving. Only by working together can we ensure Africa’s aviation sector finally takes off and becomes far more than a twoper cent player in the global market,” he concluded.",https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BUSINESS-NEWS.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:23:01.042313

Satu tahun pemerintahan Prabowo-Gibran, terjadi gejolak geopolitik global yang mengancam pasokan energi dunia. Meski demikian, hal itu tidak menghalagi Pertamina selaku BUMN yang mampu menjaga ketersediaan energi dalam negeri secara berkelanjutan.

Menurut Direktur Utama PT Pertamina (Persero) Simon Aloysius Mantiri menegaskan, Pertamina berkomitmen penuh mendukung visi Asta Cita Pemerintahan Prabowo–Gibran, khususnya dalam mewujudkan kemandirian bangsa melalui swasembada energi.

“Pertamina terus menjalankan amanah Pemerintah untuk menjadi pemain kunci dalam menjaga ketahanan energi nasional di tengah meningkatnya kebutuhan energi dalam negeri,” ujar Simon lewat keteranagan resmi, Minggu 19 Oktober 2025.

Simon lalu memaparkan, kontribusi Pertamina dalam menjaga pasokan energi terlihat dari kinerja operasional yang terus menunjukkan tren positif, terutama di sektor hulu migas. Saat ini, Pertamina mengelola 24 persen wilayah kerja operator migas di Indonesia.

Produksi migas Pertamina terus meningkat dan kini mencapai 1,04 juta barel setara minyak per hari (MMBOEPD), terdiri dari produksi minyak 557 ribu barel per hari (MBOPD) dan produksi gas 2,8 miliar standar kaki kubik per hari (BSCFD) pada semester satu 2025.

Tak sampai di situ, Pertamina juga memperkuat cadangan energi nasional dengan melakukan survei seismik 3D dan pengeboran sumur eksplorasi.

Hasilnya, perusahaan energi pelat merah ini mampu mencatat tambahan sumber daya 2C sebesar 804 juta barel setara minyak (MMBOE) serta cadangan terbukti (P1) sebesar 63 juta MMBOE.

Sejumlah proyek strategis pun telah tuntas, seperti Stasiun Pengumpul Akasia Bagus (SP ABG) EP, Proyek Sisi Nubi, Proyek CEOR Lapangan Minas Area A Stage-1, dan Lapangan OO–OX. Berkat proyek-proyek ini, Pertamina kini menjadi kontributor utama produksi migas nasional sebanyak 69 persen untuk minyak dan 37 persen untuk gas.

Dorong Energi Bersih dan Rendah Karbon

Sejalan dengan arah kebijakan energi bersih Pemerintahan Prabowo–Gibran, Pertamina juga agresif mengembangkan energi baru terbarukan (EBT). Selama satu tahun terakhir, Pertamina berhasil menghadirkan inovasi bahan bakar rendah karbon, termasuk produksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) berbasis minyak jelantah (Used Cooking Oil/UCO) serta implementasi Biodiesel 40 persen (B40).

Selain itu, melalui subholding Pertamina New and Renewable Energy (PNRE), anak usaha PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Tbk (PGE) kini mengelola kapasitas panas bumi terpasang sebesar 727 MW (Megawatt) di enam wilayah operasi. PGE menargetkan peningkatan kapasitas hingga 1 GW (Gigawatt) dalam dua sampai tiga tahun ke depan, dan ditargetkan mencapai 1,7 GW pada 2034.

Dalam mendorong transisi menuju energi bersih, Pertamina juga meluncurkan Pilot Project Green Hydrogen (Hidrogen Hijau) Ulubelu. Proyek ini menjadi langkah awal dalam membangun ekosistem green hydrogen end-to-end, mulai dari produksi hingga pemanfaatannya untuk mendukung industri rendah karbon.

“Langkah ini menunjukkan komitmen Pertamina dalam menyediakan energi bersih dan menambah pasokan energi berkelanjutan untuk masa depan,” pungkas Simon.

Dukung Target Net Zero Emission 2060

Sebagai pemimpin di bidang transisi energi, Pertamina terus memperkuat kontribusi terhadap pencapaian target Net Zero Emission 2060.

Seluruh program dijalankan selaras dengan prinsip Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) dan berorientasi pada Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Pertamina Dampingi Menteri ESDM Tinjau Sumur Rakyat di Sumsel

Menteri Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) Bahlil Lahadalia melakukan kunjungan kerja ke Kabupaten Musi Banyuasin, Sumatra Selatan, Kamis 16 Oktober 2025.

Menteri Bahlil melawat ke Musi, Banyu Asin didampingi Direktur Utama PT Pertamina (Persero) Simon Aloysius Mantiri.

Adapun kunjungan kerja Bahlil bersama Pertamina kali ini bertujuan untuk meninjau ketersediaan LPG. Selain itu Bahlil dan Simon juga menyempatkan meninjau langsung lapangan sumur minyak rakyat yang beroperasi di wilayah tersebut.

Dalam kesempatan itu, Bahlil Lahadalia menyatakan bahwa implementasi Peraturan Menteri ESDM Nomor 14 Tahun 2025 tentang Kerja Sama Pengelolaan Bagian Wilayah Kerja yakni untuk Peningkatan Produksi Minyak dan Gas Bumi.

Melalui aturan ini, sumur minyak rakyat akan dikelola oleh koperasi, BUMD (Badan Usaha Milik Desa), atau pelaku usaha kecil dan menengah (UKM) milik masyarakat.

“Bapak Presiden memerintahkan kepada saya untuk memperhatikan keinginan rakyat dalam menciptakan lapangan pekerjaan, agar uang yang dihasilkan dapat berputar di masyarakat,” ujar Bahlil saat meninjau lapangan sumur rakyat di Kecamatan Keluang, Musi Banyuasin, dikutip dari keterangan resmi Pertamina, Jumat 16 Oktober 2025.

Lebih lanjut, Bahlil sempat mengingatkan pentingnya aspek keselamatan kerja dan kelestarian lingkungan, mengingat kegiatan eksplorasi dan produksi migas di lapangan rakyat memiliki risiko tinggi.

Selain meninjau sumur rakyat, Menteri ESDM Bahlil bersama Direktur Utama Pertamina Simon Mantiri turut mengunjungi pangkalan LPG Pertamina di Desa Sido Rejo.

Dalam dialog dengan pemilik pangkalan, Arif Setiawan, keduanya membahas ketersediaan pasokan dan kelancaran distribusi LPG di wilayah Musi Banyuasin.

Gubernur Sumatera Selatan Herman Deru, yang turut hadir dalam kunjungan tersebut, berharap Pertamina dapat mendukung keberlanjutan operasi sumur rakyat di daerahnya.

Wahyu menyampaikan, pengujian dilakukan menggunakan mesin CFR (Cooperative Fuel Research) yang merupakan alat standar internasional yang digunakan untuk menguji ketahanan bahan bakar terhadap knocking (detonasi), terutama untuk menentukan angka oktan (RON) dan angka setana (Cetane Number).

“Mesin ini bekerja dengan mensimulasikan kondisi pembakaran di dalam mesin kendaraan, termasuk tekanan, suhu dan rasio kompresi yang dikontrol secara ketat, sehingga hasilnya dapat digunakan untuk memastikan kualitas bahan bakar sesuai standar,” ujar Wahyu.

Ia menambahkan, semua produk yang diuji dalam laboratorium dipastikan dengan kualitas baik, bahkan bisa melebihi spesifikasi standar.

Wahyu mencontohkan, untuk BBM jenis Pertalite dengan RON 90, dalam pengujian di laboratorium hasil RON yang muncul di alat bisa 90,1 atau 90,2. Jika angka yang muncul di bawah standar yang ditentukan, maka pengujian dilakukan lagi dari awal, hingga hasilnya sesuai.

“Jadi RON serendah-rendahnya adalah 90 sesuai standar, tidak boleh kurang tapi bisa di atasnya. Kami tidak pernah menjual BBM ke masyarakat dengan spesifikasi lebih rendah dari yang ditentukan,” ungkap Wahyu.

Dengan begitu, ia meminta masyarakat tidak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI.

Wahyu menjelaskan semua produk BBM tersebut telah diolah dengan pengawasan ketat, untuk memastikan kualitasnya paripurna sebelum didistribusikan.

“Semua produk yang kami hasilkan terjamin kualitasnya, sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang ditentukan sehingga aman untuk digunakan masyarakat,” tandas Wahyu.

Selain pengujian di laboratorium internal, BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI juga diuji dilaboratorium eksternal, sebagai bentuk pengendalian mutu yang berkelanjutan. Salah satunya, pengujian dilakukan di Balai Besar Pengujian Minyak dan Gas Bumi (BBPMGB) LEMIGAS yang merupakan laboratorium independen, pada periode Agustus-September lalu.

Sebelumnya, praktisi industri migas memandang batalnya pembelian BBM dasaran atau base fuel oleh PT Vivo Energy Indonesia hingga PT Aneka Petroindo Raya (BP-AKR) dari PT Pertamina (Persero) mencerminkan tingginya standar kualitas bensin milik operator SPBU swasta.

Direktur Utama PT Petrogas Jatim Utama Cendana (PJUC) Hadi Ismoyo berpendapat kandungan etanol sebesar 3,5% yang ditemukan di dalam BBM dasaran atau base fuel yang ditawarkan Pertamina memang masih jauh di bawah ambang batas Ditjen Migas Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) di level 20%.

Akan tetapi, operator SPBU swasta dinilai memiliki kebutuhan BBM dengan spesifikasi tinggi, sehingga adanya campuran etanol dalam base fuel berpotensi mengganggu formula bensin milik badan usaha (BU) hilir migas swasta.

“Kasus ini menjadi makin jelas, bahwa spek base fuel walau secara umum tidak masalah, tetapi karena demi standar sebuah brand yang sudah demikian kuat, base fuel pun meminta spesifikasi yang excellent,” kata Hadi melalui pesan singkat, Kamis (2/10/2025).

Dalam perkembangannya, PT Pertamina Patra Niaga (PPN) angkat bicara soal polemik yang belakangan muncul terkait dengan campuran etanol dalam base fuel di tengah masyarakat.

Pj. Corporate Secretary Pertamina Patra Niaga Roberth MV Dumatubun mengatakan campuran etanol itu hal yang biasa dalam bisnis BBM dan lumrah digunakan di sejumlah negara seperti Amerika Serikat (AS), Brasil hingga Thailand.

“Penggunaan BBM dengan campuran etanol hingga 10% telah menjadi best practice di banyak negara seperti di Amerika, Brasil, bahkan negara tetangga seperti Thailand,” kata Roberth seperti dikutip dari siaran pers, Kamis (2/10/2025).

Selain itu, Roberth menambahkan, campuran etanol itu juga belakangan diadopsi sebagian negara untuk mendukung program pengurangan emisi karbon.

“Bagian dari upaya mendorong energi yang lebih ramah lingkungan sekaligus mendukung pengurangan emisi karbon,” kata Roberth.

Di sisi lain, Roberth menekankan pentingnya ruang negosiasi yang saling menghormati terkait dengan pengadaan base fuel tersebut dengan operator jaringan SPBU swasta.

“Kami memastikan seluruh produk BBM yang disalurkan sesuai dengan spesifikasi resmi pemerintah serta mekanisme pengadaan yang berlaku,” tuturnya.

Adapun, dua kargo BBM dasaran yang diimpor Pertamina mulanya ditujukan untuk dijual ke operator SPBU swasta. Kargo pertama tiba pada Rabu (24/9/2025), sedangkan yang kedua pada Kamis (2/10/2025).

Akan tetapi, kargo BBM dasaran dengan volume masing-masing 100.000 barel tersebut tidak laku terjual ke BU hilir migas swasta karena berbagai alasan. Vivo sebelumnya membatalkan pesanan 40.000 barel base fuel karena isu kandungan etanol 3,5%, sedangkan BP-AKR menyoal ketiadaan certificate of origin.",https://images.bloombergtechnoz.com/data/2025/03/image-20250329122420.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 06:57:31.862810

The project is part of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's broader push towards clean energy and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2035.

In an investor presentation post announcement of its second quarter earnings, Reliance said project development across the 5,50,000-acre site in Kutch is progressing well, with engineering and feasibility studies completed, and the site is currently in various stages of land development.

""Expected to start commissioning solar generation during the first half of the next year for captive requirements plus green fuels production,"" it said.

Four years ago, Reliance Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani announced a USD 10 billion investment in a 'new energy' business. That was seen as a notable change of tide, given the conglomerate's mega-scale petroleum refining operation that Ambani spearheaded back in the 1990s.

With that, Reliance began work on a new integrated renewable energy manufacturing hub named after the group's founder - the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex.

At the company's annual shareholder meeting this year, Anant Ambani - the chairman's youngest son - gave a glimpse into its scale. A build area four times the size of Tesla's gigafactory, a steel order large enough to build 100 Eiffel Towers and a stretch of cables enough to 'reach the moon and back'.

The gigafactories at Jamnagar - home to the company's refining and petrochemical complex - will produce gears used in generating electricity from sunlight and the battery value chain. Alongside, in Kutch, it is developing one of the world's largest single-site solar projects spanning 5,50,000 acres of arid land - three times the size of Singapore.

Reliance's clean energy plans span solar PV, battery storage, green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

The firm is on track to set up 20GWp of solar PV manufacturing capacity and 100GWh of battery giga-factory. Reliance has also pledged to produce 3 million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen by 2032, while manufacturing equipment like electrolysers, battery storage and solar panels in-house.

In the investor presentation, the company said it continues to gradually expand its solar photovoltaic giga-factory. ""Already commissioned 4 PV module lines, and the first cell line is expected to be commissioned soon,"" Reliance said, adding that it is on track to achieve its targeted capacity and further expand in a modular fashion.

The PV solar manufacturing chain includes production of polysilicon - high-purity silicon produced from metallurgical grade silicon (sand). This is followed by ingot and wafer creation - polysilicon being melted and cooled to form ingots (either monocrystalline cylinders or multicrystalline blocks). These ingots are then sliced into thin wafers, which form the base of the solar cell.

Then comes the cell manufacturing - silicon wafers are processed through various steps, including doping, cleaning, and coating. Laser scribing is used to pattern the cells, and copper ribbons are applied for electrical connections.

Multiple cells are connected together and laminated between sheets of glass and encapsulant to create a waterproof module, or panel. These modules are then assembled into arrays with racking systems, which are support structures for mounting them on areas receiving sunlight.

With sunlight being available only during daytime, Reliance is also setting up gigafactories for the battery value chain to provide round-the-clock power.

General Manager Kilang Cilacap, Wahyu Sulistyo Wibowo, mengatakan kilang ini memproduksi semua produk BBM, mulai dari Perta Series, solar, avtur, dan yang terbaru adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau avtur berbahan minyak jelantah (Use Cooking Oil/UCO).

Wahyu menjelaskan, sebelum disalurkan ke pasaran, produk-produk BBM tersebut diuji terlebih dahulu di laboratorium internal Kilang Cilacap. Pengujian tersebut termasuk dalam menentukan Research Octane Number (RON) pada BBM.

""Semua kilang yang ada di KPI punya standar yang sama. Kualitas produk yang diberikan ke masyarakat tidak pernah lebih rendah daripada spek migas yang ditentukan, karena kita tidak ingin pelayanan ke masyarakat itu tidak sesuai dengan yang kita janjikan,"" ungkapnya kepada awak media di Kilang Cilacap, Sabtu (18/10).

Pengujian dilakukan menggunakan mesin CFR (Cooperative Fuel Research) yang merupakan alat standar internasional yang digunakan untuk menguji ketahanan bahan bakar terhadap knocking (detonasi), terutama untuk menentukan angka oktan (RON) dan angka setana (Cetane Number).

“Mesin ini bekerja dengan mensimulasikan kondisi pembakaran di dalam mesin kendaraan, termasuk tekanan, suhu dan rasio kompresi yang dikontrol secara ketat, sehingga hasilnya dapat digunakan untuk memastikan kualitas bahan bakar sesuai standar,” jelas Wahyu

Wahyu menambahkan, semua produk yang diuji dalam laboratorium dipastikan dengan kualitas baik, bahkan bisa melebihi spesifikasi standar. Ia mencontohkan, untuk BBM jenis Pertalite dengan RON 90, dalam pengujian di laboratorium hasil RON yang muncul di alat bisa 90,1 atau 90,2.

Namun, jika angka yang muncul di bawah standar yang ditentukan, maka pengujian dilakukan lagi dari awal, hingga hasilnya sesuai.

“Jadi RON serendah-rendahnya adalah 90 sesuai standar, tidak boleh kurang tapi bisa di atasnya. Kami tidak pernah menjual BBM ke masyarakat dengan spesifikasi lebih rendah dari yang ditentukan,” ungkap Wahyu.

Dengan begitu, ia meminta masyarakat tidak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI. Wahyu menjelaskan semua produk BBM tersebut telah diolah dengan pengawasan ketat, untuk memastikan kualitasnya paripurna sebelum didistribusikan.

“Semua produk yang kami hasilkan terjamin kualitasnya, sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang ditentukan sehingga aman untuk digunakan masyarakat,” tandas Wahyu.

Selain pengujian di laboratorium internal, BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI juga diuji di laboratorium eksternal, salah satunya di Balai Besar Pengujian Minyak dan Gas Bumi (BBPMGB) LEMIGAS yang merupakan laboratorium independen, pada periode Agustus-September lalu.

Wahyu mengatakan, hasil pengujian tersebut menunjukkan kalau semua produk BBM olahan KPI memenuhi spesifikasi yang telar disyaratkan dalam Keputusan Direktur Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi, Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM).

BUMN energi ini mampu menjaga ketersediaan energi dalam negeri di tengah dinamika geopolitik yang mengancam pasokan energi global.

Direktur Utama PT Pertamina (Persero), Simon Aloysius Mantiri menegaskan komitmen Pertamina untuk terus berkontribusi dalam mendukung misi Asta Cita Pemerintahan Prabowo – Gibran, dengan mendorong kemandirian bangsa melalui swasembada energi.

Menurut Simon, kontribusi Pertamina dalam menjamin pasokan energi tercermin pada kinerja operasional yang terus menunjukkan tren positif, terutama di sektor hulu Migas yang menjadi tulang punggung ketahanan energi nasional.

“Saat ini, Pertamina mengelola 24 persen wilayah kerja operator migas di Indonesia. Kami terus menjalankan amanah Pemerintah dengan berperan sebagai pemain kunci dalam upaya menjaga ketahanan energi di tengah meningkatnya kebutuhan energi nasional,” ujar Simon.

Simon mengungkapkan, pembuktian kontribusi atas ketahanan energi ditandai dengan produksi migas Pertamina terus meningkat yang kini mencapai 1,04 juta barel setara minyak per hari (MMBOEPD), yang terdiri dari produksi minyak 557 ribu barel per hari (MBOPD) dan produksi gas 2,8 miliar standar kaki kubik per hari (BSCFD) per semester 1 tahun 2025.

Tidak hanya produksi, Pertamina juga mendorong anak usaha sektor hulu untuk agresif memperkuat cadangan untuk mendapat sumberdaya energi baru, baik melalui kegiatan Survei Seismik 3D maupun pengeboran sumur eksplorasi.

Hasilnya, Pertamina mendapat tambahan sumberdaya 2C (contingent resources) dengan realisasi 2C Validation sebesar 804 juta barel setara minyak (MMBOE) dan menambah cadangan migas terbukti (P1) sebesar 63 juta barel setara minyak (MMBOE).

Produksi dan cadangan migas Indonesia akan semakin kuat dengan tuntasnya proyek strategis Pertamina antara lain pengembangan Stasiun Pengumpul Akasia Bagus (SP ABG) EP, Proyek Sisi Nubi, Proyek CEOR lapangan minas di Area A Stage-1 dan proyek Lapangan OO-OX.

“Capaian tersebut semakin menguatkan posisi Pertamina sebagai kontributor utama produksi migas nasional, untuk minyak 69 persen dan gas 37 persen, sehingga dapat lebih optimal memasok kebutuhan energi nasional,” tambahnya.

Secara simultan lanjutnya, Pertamina juga berupaya mewujudkan swasembada energi dengan mengembangkan energi baru terbarukan.

Selama satu tahun pemerintahan Prabowo – Gibran, Pertamina berhasil melakukan inovasi teknologi untuk pengembangan produk bahan bakar rendah karbon.

Hal ini telah dibuktikan dengan keberhasilan kilang Pertamina dalam memproduksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel berbasis Minyak Jelantah (Used Cooking Oil/UCO) dan implementasi Biodiesel 40 persen (B40).

Dukungan Pertamina dalam ketahanan energi juga semakin terlihat, dengan komitmen Pertamina sebagai pemimpin dalam transisi energi. Sejalan Asta Cita Presiden Prabowo Subianto, yang mendorong optimalisasi pemanfaatan energi terbarukan, termasuk panas bumi.

Pertamina melalui anak usaha dari Subholding Pertamina New and Renewable Energy, PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Tbk (PGE) saat ini mengelola kapasitas terpasang sebesar 727 MW dari enam wilayah operasi.

PGE fokus dalam mewujudkan target 1 GW dalam 2–3 tahun ke depan dan 1,7 GW pada 2034.

Beyond electricity, PGE meluncurkan Pilot Project Green Hydrogen (Hidrogen Hijau) Ulubelu. Pertamina membangun ekosistem green hydrogen secara end-to-end, mulai dari produksi, distribusi, hingga pemanfaatannya untuk mendukung transisi menuju industri rendah karbon.

“Capaian tersebut semakin menunjukkan komitmen Pertamina dalam menyediakan energi bersih dan menambah pasokan secara berkelanjutan di masa depan,”ujarnya.

Pertamina sebagai perusahaan pemimpin di bidang transisi energi, berkomitmen dalam mendukung target net zero emission 2060 dengan terus mendorong program-program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Seluruh upaya tersebut sejalan dengan penerapan Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis dan operasi Pertamina.***",https://garuda.tv/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=135809&type=frame-og&hash=102581b277acc8c5f4fa6721e2c86bd4,N,,2025-10-19 02:56:21.344614

Upaya ini merupakan bagian dari Refinery Development Masterplan Program (RDMP) dan pembangunan kilang baru atau Grass Root Refinery (GRR) yang mulai dijalankan sejak 2014.

Vice President Corporate Communication PT Pertamina (Persero), Fadjar Djoko Santoso, menjelaskan bahwa saat ini Pertamina melalui PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI) mengoperasikan enam kilang yang tersebar di berbagai daerah, yaitu Kilang Dumai di Riau, Kilang Plaju di Sumatra Selatan, Kilang Balongan di Jawa Barat, Kilang Cilacap di Jawa Tengah, Kilang Balikpapan di Kalimantan Timur, dan Kilang Kasim di Papua Barat Daya.

“Keenam kilang yang beroperasi saat ini mampu mengolah minyak mentah hingga 1 juta barel per hari, dan menghasilkan berbagai jenis produk, BBM, LPG, Avtur, dan Petrokimia,” ujar Fadjar.

Revitalisasi dan Pengembangan Kilang

Untuk meningkatkan kapasitas pengolahan, Pertamina menjalankan proyek RDMP di Kilang Balongan dan Kilang Balikpapan. Sementara pengembangan di Kilang Cilacap dan Dumai diarahkan menjadi kilang hijau yang memproduksi bahan bakar ramah lingkungan seperti Pertamina Renewable Diesel (RD), Pertamax Green, dan Pertamina Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Melalui Kilang Plaju dan Kasim, Pertamina juga mendukung program pemerintah dalam produksi Biosolar B40.

Pada 2019, Pertamina menyelesaikan proyek Pertamina Langit Biru Cilacap yang bertujuan meningkatkan kualitas bahan bakar menjadi lebih ramah lingkungan. Sementara itu, proyek RDMP Balongan yang rampung pada 2022 berhasil meningkatkan kapasitas pengolahan dari 125 ribu barel menjadi 150 ribu barel per hari.

“Dengan kemampuan kilang eksisting, saat ini Pertamina tidak lagi mengimpor Solar dan Avtur,” ujar Fadjar.

Tahun 2025, proyek RDMP Balikpapan ditargetkan memulai uji coba operasi pada unit baru Residual Fuel Catalytic Cracking (RFCC). Melalui proyek tersebut, kapasitas total pengolahan kilang Pertamina ditargetkan meningkat menjadi 1,16 juta barel per hari.

“Penyelesaian proyek secara bertahap, diharapkan dapat memenuhi kebutuhan energi masyarakat, dan mengurangi impor,” jelas Fadjar.

Selain peningkatan kapasitas, RDMP juga dirancang untuk meningkatkan kompleksitas kilang atau Nelson Complexity Index dari 4,1 menjadi 8. Dengan demikian, produk yang dihasilkan akan lebih bervariasi dan memiliki kadar sulfur rendah sesuai standar Euro 5, yang dapat membantu mengurangi emisi karbon.

Pertamina juga menargetkan pembangunan kilang baru melalui proyek GRR Tuban di Jawa Timur dengan kapasitas pengolahan tambahan sebesar 300 ribu barel per hari.

Penguatan Industri Petrokimia

Selain pengembangan kilang BBM, Pertamina memperkuat bisnis petrokimia sebagai bagian dari upaya meningkatkan nilai perusahaan dan kontribusi terhadap negara.

Langkah ini dilakukan melalui anak usaha dan afiliasi, termasuk Grup Tuban Petrochemical Industries. Salah satu entitas di bawahnya, PT Trans-Pacific Petrochemical Indotama (TPPI), telah menyelesaikan peningkatan kapasitas produksi aromatik dari 600 ribu ton menjadi 780 ribu ton per tahun.

TPPI saat ini dikembangkan oleh PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI) melalui rencana pembangunan kompleks pabrik olefin yang ditujukan untuk menambah pasokan bahan baku plastik dalam negeri hingga 1,6 juta ton per tahun. Bila hasil kajian keekonomian menunjukkan prospek positif, proyek ini akan memperkuat industri hilir petrokimia nasional.

Selain itu, pengembangan juga dilakukan oleh PT Polytama Propindo di Balongan, Indramayu, Jawa Barat, yang menargetkan peningkatan kapasitas produksi petrokimia sebesar 300 ribu ton per tahun pada 2028.

“Selain itu, Pertamina berkomitmen untuk terus mengidentifikasi dan mengembangkan potensi produk petrokimia baru yang prospektif di Indonesia.

Leia abaixo os principais trechos da entrevista.

O que é a Itaipu Binacional hoje?

A Itaipu é uma revolução tecnológica. Imagine há 51 anos construir uma usina daquele tamanho, uma usina hidrelétrica. A maior usina hidrelétrica do mundo à época. Uma época que não existia software, não tinha computador, não tinha máquina científica. Os cálculos estruturais eram feitos na régua e à mão. É por isso até que Itaipu é mais resistente do que as outras, porque, na dúvida, colocavam um pouco mais [de cimento]. E ela é gigante. Chegou a representar 25% da produção de energia do Brasil. Itaipu é uma empresa pública que tem 50% do capital governo brasileiro e os outros 50% do governo do Paraguai.

Quais os planos da empresa para diversificar a geração de energia?

Nós temos investido muito em atualização tecnológica. São mais de R$ 5 bilhões de reais de investimento para atualizar todo o sistema de gestão de Itaipu e a maneira com que ela produz energia. Concomitante a isso, já há 20 anos, a Itaipu vem investindo em alternativas. Primeiro, em geração distribuída. Nós começamos a a produzir energia através do gás metano, no oeste do Paraná, onde há uma grande produção de suínos. Desenvolvemos essas alternativas a partir da geração distribuída. As leis brasileiras que tratam da geração distribuída surgiram a partir das experiências de Itaipu há 20 anos. Há uns 15 anos, nós começamos com as experiências do hidrogênio verde. O hidrogênio verde está num estágio muito avançado de pesquisa. Apresentaremos na COP30 um barco desenvolvido no nosso parque tecnológico, movido a hidrogênio verde. A partir da nossa experiência do biogás, a partir do nosso conhecimento de hidrogênio verde e com a geração de energia da hidroelétrica, nós estamos avançando muito agora no petróleo sintético para produção do SAF [[Sustainable Aviation Fuel, em inglês, o combustível sustentável de aviação que substitui o querosene fóssil].

E há investimentos em energia fotovoltaica?

Nós estamos agora fazendo uma experiência de placas solares sobre um pedaço do reservatório de Itaipu. E, com isso, nós vamos utilizar essa energia produzida para o consumo da usina, sobrando mais energia da usina para entregar à sociedade brasileira e à paraguaia.

Por que no Brasil há oferta abundante de energia e preços altos?

É um paradoxo. A produção de energia no Brasil mudou. A energia hidráulica, em 2010, representava 91% da geração no Brasil e, hoje, é só 60% do total. A geração térmica representava 9% em 2010 e, hoje, 6%. A eólica representava 4% e, atualmente, 7%. E a solar, que era zero, hoje, é quase 10%. A inovação tecnológica proporcionou o aumento de oferta de energia limpa, barata e de qualidade. Entretanto, essas fontes são intermitentes. Com a atualização tecnológica, ficou mais barato instalar as placas solares e mais pessoas têm comprado essa energia. Por outro lado, há demanda para energia firme nos horários de pico, ocasionando um fato novo. Há excesso de energia ofertada na rede em alguns horários e falta de energia em outro. Quando você tem um excesso de energia ofertada nas redes, por exemplo, entre 12h e 14h, você cria um congestionamento. Pense a rede de transmissão como uma avenida. Se você colocar muito carro, você vai criar um congestionamento. É isso que está acontecendo hoje. Com menos gente comprando energia das distribuidoras, o preço da energia para o restante da população aumenta.

Quais os planos e projetos que Itaipu apresentará na COP-30?

Até 2003, Itaipu só produzia energia. A partir de 2005, Itaipu passou a ter como missão gerar energia, preservar o meio ambiente e contribuir para o desenvolvimento sustentável do Brasil e do Paraguai. Itaipu começou a desenvolver políticas socioeconômicas que tornaram-se modelo no mundo. A empresa é premiada pela ONU, é reconhecida por outros países. Nós recebemos, frequentemente, visitas de representantes do governo de outros países para conhecer as nossas experiências socioambientais, que são muito bem sucedidas na preservação da nossa matéria-prima, que é a água, da contribuição ao desenvolvimento regional, e, principalmente na construção de parcerias, tanto na área rural como urbana. A nossa participação na COP está muito baseada nisso, em levar toda essa tecnologia acumulada nesses anos, nesses últimos 20 anos, para socializar isso com o resto do mundo.",https://midias.em.com.br/_midias/jpg/2025/10/19/1000x1000/1_dsc05081-990x557-60040995.jpg?20251019003153?20251019003153,N,,2025-10-19 02:56:39.090113

Wagner Sustainable Fuels, based in Toowoomba, also launched Australia’s first biofuel blending facility on Wednesday, and chief executive Matt Doyle says the nation could seize a big financial and environmental opportunity if it acts quickly.
In transport, for example, sustainable aviation fuel has been flagged as the major solution airlines will use to reach their 2050 net zero target, contributing 65 per cent of the emission reductions required.
“I’m very confident Australia will be delivering close to 10 per cent of our aviation fuel market needs in the early 2030s,” she says.

And a Queensland company at the vanguard of production is establishing a biofuels facility – one of three being built in the race to cut emissions from challenging industries.

Wagner Sustainable Fuels, based in Toowoomba, also launched Australia’s first biofuel blending facility on Wednesday, and chief executive Matt Doyle says the nation could seize a big financial and environmental opportunity if it acts quickly.

“Waste products will be the new oil,” he says.

“We, as a country, have a lot of waste products so we can be a major player in sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, and low-carbon liquid fuels in general.”

His prediction follows a $1.1 billion federal government investment in biofuel production and the launch of a public consultation into a national strategy for the burgeoning industry.

While momentum is growing, climate experts say biofuels remain difficult and costly to produce, and their widespread acceptance will require governments around the world to mandate their use.

Biofuels, also known as low-carbon liquid fuels, are made from renewable resources such as agricultural waste and can be used to reduce emissions from industries in which there are few other options.

In transport, for example, sustainable aviation fuel has been flagged as the major solution airlines will use to reach their 2050 net zero target, contributing 65 per cent of the emission reductions required.

Domestic airlines such as Qantas and Virgin Australia are already pursuing biofuel opportunities, Doyle says, as alternative technologies are not ready to go the distance.

“There have been a lot of studies done on electric planes, which are good for very short-haul [flights], but they can’t do any longer,” he says.

“Then there’s hydrogen in 2035 or 2040, but that will only be medium-haul. For long-haul, there’s no other solution other than sustainable aviation fuels out to 2050.”

The Toowoomba-based company is developing a sustainable aviation fuel production facility in Brisbane, co-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which is expected to produce 114 megalitres of fuel annually.

But the firm’s latest fuel-blending facility at Wellcamp Airport is using imported synthetic fuel to mix with standard jet fuel while waiting for domestic supplies to become available, Doyle says.

“We’re hoping our facility can be a beacon for the federal government to look at and say everything works.

“Then we can get on with making good policy that will grow the industry and benefit Australia.”

Support for biofuels is growing in Australia, with the government announcing a $1.1 billion, 10-year Cleaner Fuels Program in September to boost its production.

Consultation also opened this month for the development of a National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy to ensure Australia is producing materials needed to create renewable fuel.

After years “wasted in the climate wars”, the announcements are being welcomed by producers and potential users alike, says Bioenergy Australia chief executive Shahana McKenzie.

Despite the industry’s slow start, she says, Australia’s advantages, such as its strong farming sector, make it a natural biofuels leader in the Asia Pacific region.

“Australia is being looked at by all the other players in our region as the most likely contributor, either from a feedstock perspective or from an export perspective,” she says.

“It’s incredibly important that decarbonisation is actively taking place across all [nearby] jurisdictions.”

Australia already has three biodiesel and two ethanol refineries in operation, with three projects in development: Wagner’s Brisbane base, Ampol’s proposed renewable fuels facility in outer Brisbane, and Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses in Townsville.

Other projects are “progressing behind the scenes”, McKenzie says, to help the nation catch up to its potential.

“I’m very confident Australia will be delivering close to 10 per cent of our aviation fuel market needs in the early 2030s,” she says.

“In terms of the flow of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel in country, we are predicting the first project will deliver fuel in 2028.”

But Climate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley says there will be more challenges to adopting biofuel than just producing it.

Renewable fuels are significantly more expensive to produce than conventional varieties, he says, and will have to be mandated in some industries to ensure emission cuts.

“The cost of biofuels is between 50 and 500 per cent the cost of their fossil fuel equivalents, and that’s a huge impediment to their uptake,” he says.

“A lot of biofuels will go into the maritime and aviation industries, but that will only come about if you get mandates.”",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5755%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_smh_no_label_no_age_social_wm/655bde7f12ad1d18d87a6a94582a3026bf47d67d,N,,2025-10-18 23:56:11.098081

Dalam rancangan kebijakan tersebut, campuran SAF akan dimulai dari kadar 1%, dan secara bertahap ditingkatkan hingga 5% pada 2035. Langkah ini merupakan bagian dari komitmen Indonesia untuk menekan emisi karbon di sektor penerbangan dan mendukung agenda net zero emission (NZE).

🔹 Maskapai Siap Operasional, Tantangan Ada di Biaya

Sekretaris Jenderal Indonesia National Air Carrier Association (INACA), Bayu Sutanto, mengatakan secara teknis maskapai nasional sudah siap mengoperasikan pesawat dengan bahan bakar campuran SAF. Namun, dari sisi finansial, penerapan aturan ini masih menjadi tantangan besar.

“Secara operasional maskapai sudah siap, tapi secara finansial belum. Kenaikan biaya operasional akibat penggunaan avtur campuran SAF cukup signifikan, sementara harga tiket belum pernah disesuaikan sejak 2019,” ujar Bayu, Jumat (17/10/2025).

Bayu menegaskan, harga avtur SAF lebih mahal dibandingkan avtur konvensional, sehingga tanpa penyesuaian terhadap batas harga tiket, kebijakan ini bisa menekan profitabilitas maskapai.

🔹 Bahan Baku SAF dari Minyak Jelantah

Menurut Bayu, bahan baku SAF yang paling realistis di Indonesia saat ini adalah minyak jelantah (used cooking oil). Meski potensinya besar, tantangan utama justru terletak pada proses pengumpulan bahan baku, ketersediaan kilang pengolahan (refinery), serta distribusi SAF yang belum merata ke seluruh bandara.

“Kendala lain adalah harga avtur dan biaya operasional yang akan meningkat, sehingga berpotensi mendorong kenaikan harga tiket, terutama untuk rute-rute internasional menuju negara yang sudah mewajibkan penggunaan SAF,” tambahnya.

🔹 Usulan INACA: Implementasi Bertahap dan Sukarela

Untuk mengantisipasi lonjakan biaya, INACA mengusulkan agar implementasi SAF dilakukan secara bertahap dan sukarela (voluntary) pada tahap awal.

“Misalnya mulai dengan campuran 0,5%–1% dulu, dan hanya untuk penerbangan internasional dari dan ke Bandara Soekarno-Hatta (CGK) dan Ngurah Rai (DPS),” ujar Bayu.

INACA juga mendorong adanya regulasi pendukung seperti mekanisme carbon credit, carbon tax, serta insentif fiskal untuk membantu industri penerbangan bertransisi ke energi bersih tanpa membebani konsumen.

🔹 Aturan Masih Disusun Pemerintah

Hingga kini, rancangan peraturan terkait SAF masih dalam tahap finalisasi di Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM).

From congested ports to crumbling roads, Nigeria’s trade routes continue to be a source of frustration.","Nigeria’s 200 million youthful, entrepreneurial citizens can vault the nation from demographic promise to global competitiveness if bold, synchronised reforms now turn their talent, trade, and technology into a seamless, predictable engine of prosperity. This was the submission of the Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express, John Pearson in an interaction with Festus Akanbi on the sidelines of a media event- Global Trade Shifts- Spotlights Africa, and launch of DHL’s 2025 Global Connectedness Tracker in Johannesburg, South Africa, last week

Figeria sits on a rare confluence of promise — a young, restless population, vast entrepreneurial energy, a swelling workforce, and a strategic position at the heart of Africa. Yet, in the view of John Pearson, Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express, the country’s demographic blessing will only translate into prosperity if the right policies, partnerships, and infrastructure align to unlock its immense potential.

Speaking in Johannesburg at the unveiling of DHL’s 2025 Global Connectedness Tracker, Pearson told THISDAY that Nigeria’s future will depend on how it converts its people into productivity.

“You have over 200 million people, that’s not a challenge, it’s a superpower,” he declared. “But for that power to work, the systems, from education to logistics and regulation, have to move in the same direction.”

Human Capital: The Real Goldmine

At the centre of Pearson’s argument lies Nigeria’s human capital. With over 200 million citizens, half of them under 30, the country stands on a demographic goldmine. Pearson explained that DHL’s experience in Nigeria has shown the quality and competitiveness of local talent.

“We’ve been able to attract, retain, and grow fantastic Nigerian professionals,” adding that “Some of them have gone on to lead teams in other African countries. That tells you the calibre of people you have here.”

He pointed to DHL’s Certified International Specialist (CIS) programme, a leadership and training model applied consistently across all its global operations. “In Nigeria, our people go through the same training and development as their colleagues in Germany or India. It’s not watered down. That’s how we build global competence locally.”

However, Pearson noted that the wider Nigerian economy has yet to connect education to market realities. He emphasised that reforms must bridge the gap between academic training and industrial demand.

“The world of logistics, trade, and digital commerce is changing so fast. Nigeria’s universities and vocational institutions need to reflect that,” he said, pointing out that “We need to revive technical and apprenticeship programmes, bring industries into classrooms, and ensure graduates have practical skills, not just certificates.”

The DHL boss also underscored the importance of retention. “The continuous brain drain is a symptom, saying people leave when they can’t find stability or predictability at home. Salaries matter, but so do security, infrastructure, and a clear sense of direction.

Trade, Borders, and Bottlenecks

Few companies understand the pulse of trade like DHL. Pearson’s perspective on cross-border efficiency is blunt: Nigeria’s logistics arteries are clogged, and it’s costing the nation dearly.

“As a logistics company, our goal is to make the movement of goods seamless,” he said. “We work closely with customs; in some cases, officials even operate from our premises to speed up clearance. But many of the deeper challenges are systemic. No private company can fix them alone,” he said.

From congested ports to crumbling roads, Nigeria’s trade routes continue to be a source of frustration. Clearing goods from Apapa or Tin Can Island can take days, sometimes weeks, adding heavy costs that erode competitiveness. Pearson believes a “national logistics overhaul” is overdue.

“What Nigeria needs is simplicity and consistency,” he explained. “Simplify customs procedures, harmonise agency roles, digitise documentation, and you’ll see trade volumes and investor confidence rise almost immediately.”

He advocates the full activation of inland dry ports to relieve Lagos of its overwhelming cargo burden, as well as the creation of logistics hubs and cold-chain networks nationwide.

“Improving rail and road connectivity to neighbouring countries will also let Nigeria take real advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area,” he added.

E-Commerce: The New Frontier

In Pearson’s view, the digital revolution is redefining logistics as much as it is redefining business. “The click-and-ship culture is exploding,” he said. “We’re helping Nigerian merchants go global, optimising their websites, setting transparent pricing, and ensuring reliable delivery timelines.”

DHL, he explained, is building the infrastructure and advisory systems that enable local businesses to plug directly into global markets. Yet, the e-commerce ecosystem remains underdeveloped.

“Too many small businesses are still manual,” he observed. “No digital tracking, no online payment integration. And with poor internet, unreliable electricity, and chaotic address systems, last-mile delivery becomes a nightmare.”

For Nigeria to truly benefit, Pearson believes, the government must make broadband access and digital literacy national priorities. “Once small businesses can operate confidently online, their market stops being their neighbourhood; it becomes the world.”

Sustainability: Delivering the Future Responsibly

Pearson’s passion for sustainability is unmistakable. DHL, he said, has made global commitments to reducing its carbon footprint, investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuel and electric vehicles.

“In Nigeria, we’re already deploying solar-powered facilities and carbon-neutral warehouses,” he noted. “Our global goal is zero emissions by 2050, and that includes every market where we operate.”

However, Pearson acknowledged that Nigeria’s broader ecosystem remains far behind. “You can’t scale electric vehicles without reliable power or charging infrastructure,” he said. “Government incentives, like tax breaks for clean energy and partnerships for renewable grids, would accelerate adoption.”

DHL’s efforts, he argued, can serve as a template for others. “Sustainability shouldn’t be an afterthought. It’s part of competitiveness now. Customers want to know that their logistics partners care about the planet.”

Infrastructure: The Missing Link

Without physical infrastructure, even the best talent and technology falter. Pearson described infrastructure as the “circulatory system” of any modern economy, and Nigeria’s, he said, is weak.

“Ports are congested, roads are deteriorating, rail is underutilised, and warehouses are often outdated,” he said. “You can’t talk about efficient logistics without reliable arteries.”

He called for a National Logistics Master Plan, one that integrates roads, rail, ports, and production zones into a single coordinated framework. “Every delay on the road, every broken bridge, adds cost,” he said. “Fixing these things doesn’t just make trade faster; it makes businesses more competitive.”

Regulatory Consistency and Predictability

One of Pearson’s most persistent themes is predictability. “Investors can handle high costs,” he said, “but what they can’t handle is unpredictability.”

Frequent policy shifts, overlapping regulations, and opaque bureaucracy, he warned, remain Nigeria’s biggest deterrents to foreign investment. “If a business can’t predict clearance times, tariff levels, or regulatory changes, it can’t plan,” he said. “Predictability is the real investment incentive.”

Still, Pearson acknowledged positive examples. “Our collaboration with customs shows that private-public cooperation is possible,” he said. “It just needs to happen more often, with transparency, professionalism, and mutual trust.”

Empowering the SMEs

Beyond the large corporates, Pearson sees small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as the heart of Nigeria’s growth story. DHL’s GoTrade Initiative, he explained, was designed to help small exporters understand international standards, packaging, and logistics.

“We’re helping Nigerian SMEs connect directly to global buyers,” he said. “When small producers can access export finance, proper packaging, and reliable delivery, the entire economy benefits.”

He suggested that banks and government agencies complement such initiatives with affordable trade finance and insurance products. “Clusters of small producers can share logistics costs,” he said. “Incubators and mentorship programmes can also improve business management and export readiness.”

Digitalisation and Data: The Game Changer

To tie all these threads together, Pearson believes in data transparency. “Data is the new oil,” he said. “When you can measure port dwell times, clearance durations, and delivery success rates, you can fix inefficiencies.”

DHL’s use of route optimisation, scanner tracking, and real-time courier communication has significantly improved delivery performance. Nigeria, he argued, should adopt a similar culture of measurement and accountability.

“With reliable data, decisions become smarter, waste is reduced, and customers are happier,” he said.

The Path Forward

Pearson’s insights return to one central truth: predictability fuels prosperity. Investors, entrepreneurs, and workers all thrive when systems are stable and transparent. “Uncertainty kills momentum,” he said. “Predictability builds confidence and confidence drives growth.”

As Nigeria stands at the crossroads of potential and performance, the building blocks are visible: a youthful population, a vast market, creative entrepreneurs, and growing global attention. DHL’s experience, Pearson believes, is proof that progress is possible, with the right reforms.

“Education, infrastructure, digitalisation, sustainability, and regulatory stability, those are the five pillars,” he summarised. “If Nigeria focuses on these, it will move from a story of potential to one of performance.”

He paused, then added with a smile: “At DHL, we don’t just move parcels; we move economies. Nigeria can do the same, not just move goods, but move the entire continent forward.”",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/John-Pearson.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 23:56:17.329765

by Adekunle Agbetiloye (Business Insider Africa) Kenya Airways Plc is taking a bold step to show that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can be made and used right in Africa.

Kenya Airways is conducting flights using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends to test local production feasibility.

The first SAF-blend flight operated from Nairobi to Paris, using biofuel made from drought-resistant plants.

SAF production challenges include higher costs and the lack of local supply infrastructure.

Kenya Airways aims to gradually increase SAF usage to 10% across its fleet by 2030.

Kenya Airways Plc is taking a bold step to show that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can be made and used right in Africa.

The Nairobi-based airline will operate four return flights between October 14 and 21, each running partly on a SAF blend, as it tests the feasibility of producing the green fuel locally, according to Bloomberg.

The first of these flights took off on Tuesday from Nairobi to Paris, where new European rules require at least 2% SAF on all departing flights. For this journey, the airline used a mix of conventional jet fuel and a locally produced biofuel made from drought-resistant plants such as croton.

Kenya Airways was the first African carrier to operate a long-haul SAF-powered flight in 2023, using biofuel supplied by Italy’s Eni SpA.

But importing SAF is expensive. The green fuel can cost twice as much as regular jet fuel, and up to five times more for African airlines due to logistics and lack of local supply, according to CEO Allan Kilavuka.

Passengers in Africa are not yet willing to pay extra for lower-carbon flights, Kilavuka said. “so we need to find a way to reduce SAF production costs and hopefully get subsidies from organizations or governments.”

Attracting green capital

Kenya Airways will also operate SAF-powered flights from Nairobi to Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. At European airports, it will refuel with SAF, but the Cape Town return flight will use conventional fuel. The carrier aims to begin with 2% SAF across its fleet and gradually increase to 10% by 2030.

In 2007, the route became fully direct, solidifying Entebbe’s position as one of Emirates’ most important African destinations. The airline later upgraded its service in 2015 to the 777-200LR before transitioning to the flagship 777-300ER that serves the route today, delivering increased capacity and improved passenger comfort. ​

Strengthening Uganda’s Global Tourism Profile

Emirates’ partnership with the Uganda Tourism Board (UTB) has been integral to boosting inbound tourism over the past two years. Through joint campaigns highlighting Uganda’s world-class natural attractions, such as Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Murchison Falls, and the Rwenzori Mountains, the collaboration has promoted the country as a premier eco- and adventure tourism destination.

Since January 2025, passenger traffic on the Dubai–Entebbe route has grown by sixteen percent, with the majority of visitors connecting from key global markets including the United States, China, India, the United Kingdom, and Thailand. Uganda’s accessibility to international audiences through Dubai’s global hub has also supported its positioning as a safari and conference destination for Middle Eastern, European, and Asian travellers. ​

Investing in Uganda’s Future

Beyond connecting destinations, Emirates has played an active role in corporate social responsibility initiatives within Uganda. In 2024, the airline’s “Dubai 7s for Good” programme raised UGX 587 million (USD one hundred fifty-five thousand) to improve educational and sports facilities at North Road Primary School in Mbale. The project included building a new rugby pitch, installing sixteen solar-powered water stations, donating sports gear, and supporting environmental sustainability through community engagement.

These projects highlight the airline’s commitment to local development and its role as a corporate citizen in Uganda, simultaneously strengthening goodwill and building long-term partnerships with local stakeholders. ​

Showcasing Emirates’ Four-Class Boeing 777

Celebrating this milestone, Emirates operated a one-off flight to Entebbe on its four-class refurbished Boeing 777-300ER, part of the airline’s USD five billion cabin retrofit programme. The aircraft features Emirates’ new First Class Suites, Business Class, Premium Economy, and Economy Class, offering passengers in Uganda the latest innovations in in-flight luxury and design.

The static tour at Entebbe International Airport allowed VIP guests, including Uganda’s Minister of Works and Transport, General Edward Katumba Wamala, and Fred Bamwesigye, Director General of the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority, to explore the aircraft’s updated interiors. From fine-dining settings in Premium Economy to the exquisite lie-flat comfort of First Class, the unveiling signified a preview of the next generation of Emirates services that will gradually expand across global destinations, Uganda included. ​

Collaboration Driving Connectivity

As of October 2025, the Dubai-Entebbe corridor is served by three airlines, Emirates, flydubai, and Uganda Airlines, offering a combined total of twenty weekly flights. Emirates remains the only carrier offering premium First Class cabins, while flydubai provides supplementary frequencies via Dubai Al-Maktoum International Airport. Together, these carriers have strengthened Uganda’s air links with the Middle East, facilitating tourism, trade, and diaspora travel.

The route’s growing performance also supports the broader vision of Emirates to enhance regional connectivity between Africa and Asia, leveraging Dubai’s global status as an aviation nexus. The airline continues to invest in Africa, expanding routes and capacity to meet the continent’s rapidly growing demand for air travel and positioning itself as a key enabler of economic exchange. ​

Sustainability and Future Footprint

Emirates’ long-term vision for Uganda extends beyond capacity growth. The airline is investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnerships, renewable energy projects, and eco-friendly flight operations. As part of a dollar two hundred million investment commitment, Emirates is advancing research into sustainable propulsion and refining technologies, aligning with the UAE’s “Year of Sustainability” initiative. These efforts underscore the carrier’s pledge to balance environmental accountability with progress in global aviation.

With continuing fleet renewal and upgrades, Uganda will soon join other destinations served by Emirates’ next-generation aircraft and enhanced service offerings, ensuring that Entebbe remains an integral part of the airline’s international portfolio. ​",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/emirates-4.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 18:56:30.089728

Interisland air travel produces more than 50% of Hawaiʻi’s transportation emissions, and there is no existing technology to cut that to zero.
In a draft plan issued in June, the department identified the bio-jet fuel as the best solution for reducing aviation emissions.
But the aviation industry says electric airplane technology is limited and that the best tool is bio-jet fuel, known in industry parlance as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.
Last week, the Department of Transportation issued a final plan citing the use of SAF as its main strategy for aviation.","The Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation has made plant-based jet fuel a centerpiece of its final plan to reduce carbon emissions under an agreement with a group of Hawaiʻi teens who had sued the state over climate change.

The teens had objected to a draft plan to use the fuel – the airplane equivalent of bio-diesel – as a tool for implementing the settlement, which requires the state to eliminate all carbon emissions related to transportation in Hawaiʻi by 2045.

The settlement involves all forms of transportation, but aviation is the biggest problem. Interisland air travel produces more than 50% of Hawaiʻi’s transportation emissions, and there is no existing technology to cut that to zero.

The state’s plan follows litigation that started in 2022 when a dozen teenagers represented by Earthjustice and Our Children’s Trust sued the state, citing their right to a clean and healthful environment.

The suit also called for the department to do a better job working to meet the 2045 deadline, which was previously adopted by the Legislature and mandated by statute.

Gov. Josh Green settled with the teens to fanfare in June 2024.

The settlement called for the Department of Transportation to create a plan to meet the 2045 deadline. In a draft plan issued in June, the department identified the bio-jet fuel as the best solution for reducing aviation emissions. The teen plaintiffs objected, saying the bio-jet fuel wasn’t 100% carbon-free and carried other negative environmental impacts. Instead, they said the state should focus on electric airplanes.

But the aviation industry says electric airplane technology is limited and that the best tool is bio-jet fuel, known in industry parlance as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. The industry says SAF produces 50%-80% less carbon than regular jet fuel.

Last week, the Department of Transportation issued a final plan citing the use of SAF as its main strategy for aviation. The plan — which is part of an ongoing deliberative process that a panel of young residents will be able to participate in — cites a collaboration of the U.S. departments of transportation, energy and agriculture to produce enough SAF by 2050 to replace all traditional jet fuel used in the U.S. The department also said it will support a tax credit for SAF production in Hawaiʻi.

While the department’s final plan calls for numerous airport and air ground service changes to reduce emissions, such as buying more electric service vehicles and buses, the plan tacitly rejects the teens’ push for electric planes. The plan for electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft is limited to a “high-level market study.”

Ultimately, the study says, the goal of “zero emissions” from transportation by 2045 may be unattainable. It points to aviation, large cargo vessels and trucks as the biggest challenges.

While the plan says the department’s goal is to achieve “absolute zero emissions” as soon as possible, it also says, “There are some sectors of the transportation system that will be harder to decarbonize than others, and thus there is a need for interim solutions that are designed to reduce emissions while zero-emission solutions continue to be innovated and developed.”",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2024/08/17124332/240816-dc-Aircraft-6909.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 18:02:08.745032

Singapur führt grüne Ticketsteuer ein – nur eine Gruppe Reisender muss nicht zahlen

Fliegen ist nicht die sauberste Art zu reisen, das dürfte allen klar sein. Um die Flugemissionen einzudämmen, greift in Singapur, einem der Drehkreuze des internationalen Flugverkehrs, bald eine neue Ticketsteuer.

So unterschiedlich können die Entwicklungen sein: Nachdem vor wenigen Monaten Ryanair Schlagzeilen machte, weil die Airline heimlich die Buchungsoption auf Emissionsausgleich gestrichen hatte – niemand habe sie genutzt, so die Begründung –, geht es in Singapur in die andere Richtung.

Am 14. Oktober hat das Parlament des Stadtstaates der Schaffung einer neuen Ticketsteuer zugestimmt, die ab 2026 viele Reisende betreffen wird. Die Einnahmen aus der neuen Steuer sollen direkt in einen Fonds fließen, aus dem der zentrale Einkauf von nachhaltigem Kerosin – Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – finanziert werden soll.

Durch dieses umweltfreundlichere Kerosin, das aus erneuerbaren Rohstoffen wie Pflanzenölen oder Abfallstoffen hergestellt wird, sollen die CO2-Emissionen im Flugverkehr drastisch gesenkt werden. Singapur will damit nicht nur seine Klimaziele erreichen, sondern auch zu einem Vorreiter in der Luftfahrtbranche werden.

Im kommenden Jahr wird die neue Steuer in Kraft treten. Fluglinien werden dann verpflichtet sein, mindestens ein Prozent SAF zu tanken. Bis 2030 soll der Anteil auf drei bis fünf Prozent steigen.

Singapur mit neuer Ticketsteuer – Transitreisende bleiben verschont

Nur bei einer Gruppe Reisender macht Singapur eine Ausnahme: Transitreisende, die für die nationale Fluggesellschaft Singapore Airlines eine wichtige Einnahmequelle darstellen, sind von der Steuer befreit. Wer in Singapur also nur umsteigt und den Flughafen nicht verlässt, der kann die zusätzlichen Kosten künftig umgehen.

""The Straits Times"", eine Tageszeitung aus Singapur, schlüsselt auf, wie die Steuer je nach Flugdistanz gestaffelt werden soll. Die Angaben gehen demnach auf die Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) zurück:

Der Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) fungiert als globales Drehkreuz zwischen Asien, Australien, Europa, dem Nahen Osten und Nordamerika. Er wurde mehrfach als ""bester Flughafen der Welt"" ausgezeichnet und fertigte im vergangenen Jahr rund 68 Millionen Passagiere und circa 366.000 Starts und Landungen ab. In Bezug auf Passagiervolumen liegt er auf dem vierten Platz der internationalen Flughäfen.","https://www.watson.de/imgdb/1291/Z1200,675/1052507181874222",N,,2025-10-18 19:57:06.837373

“We are.” Magnifica Air Will Give the Ultra-Premium Segment a Brand New Way to Fly Magnifica Air is positioning itself as a hybrid between Gulfstream comfort and Delta reliability, blending high-touch hospitality with large-aircraft economics.
In that sense, Magnifica Air draws obvious comparisons to JSX, another US operator that has carved out a niche with private-terminal service and crowd-free flying.
If all goes to plan, Magnifica Air could become what JSX pioneered on a smaller scale, a new class of air travel for those who believe flying should still feel special.","A new American airline is taking shape with an ambitious plan to bridge the gap between private jet exclusivity and first-class commercial travel.

Magnifica Air, a Florida-based startup, officially unveiled its concept at the 2025 NBAA-BACE Convention in Las Vegas last week, and if all goes according to plan, the carrier could begin flying passengers by late 2027.

The company’s mission is simple yet bold: to make private-jet-style travel accessible to a wider audience, offering a high-end, all-first-class experience at a fraction of the charter price. Led by CEO Wade Black, Magnifica Air will operate as a Part 121 scheduled carrier and aims to deliver what Black calls “luxury travel that is seamless, personal, and unforgettable.”

“Magnifica Air is pioneering a new space between private aviation and first-class commercial travel,” said Black. “We combine the privacy and intimacy of a private jet with the cultural relevance and operational scope of a world-class airline. This is more than transportation—it’s a movement, redefining how discerning guests experience the skies.”

Luxury Air Travel: Redefining Your Journey

Launch Plans and Fleet Details

Magnifica Air plans to launch with a fleet of six Airbus aircraft, including four A220-300s and two A321neos. The aircraft are being leased through long-term agreements with Air Lease Corporation (ALC) and Azorra, with deliveries expected to begin in early 2027.

The jets will be sent to Comlux—a Swiss completion specialist known for its work on VIP and head-of-state aircraft—for luxury cabin conversions. These modifications will include hand-crafted seating, adaptive lighting, gourmet dining, and lie-flat first-class suites.

The A220s will feature around 54 lay-flat seats and two private suites, while the A321neos will have 44–46 seats, including four private suites and a rear in-flight lounge. There will be no overhead bins, giving the cabins a spacious, minimalist look more reminiscent of a Gulfstream than a traditional airliner.

“Air Lease is pleased to lease these new Airbus A220s and A321neos to Magnifica Air and be the first to provide brand-new aircraft to the airline,” said David Beker, Executive Vice President of Air Lease Corporation. “Magnifica plans to use them to redefine luxury air travel by making the journey on our aircraft a destination itself.”

The company’s partnership with Azorra also includes the purchase of two ex-EgyptAir A220s. The first will arrive at Comlux’s Indianapolis facility in December 2025 for an 18-month fit-out process, followed by the second in early 2027. Both types will use Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, and while Black acknowledged the previous reliability issues that led EgyptAir to retire the type, he added that the Azorra collaboration “puts us in pretty good shape.”

A Focus on Experience, Personalization, and Wellness

Magnifica’s model borrows elements from hybrid private-commercial aviation providers like JSX and Aero, but aims for a more upscale, personalized approach. Travelers will be picked up by black car service at home, greeted by name, and whisked directly to private terminals. A white-glove concierge will take luggage, and TSA-approved screening will be handled privately.

Guests will arrive just 30 minutes before departure, enjoy curated dining and wellness experiences in private lounges, and board via sprinter van or private ramp walk.

Once onboard, technology will drive personalization. Every guest’s preferences, from favorite meals and seat temperature to lighting and entertainment, will be pre-loaded into the system. Magnifica calls this the “curated journey,” where every touchpoint feels familiar and comfortable.

Upon arrival, baggage will be hand-delivered within 10–15 minutes, chauffeurs will be waiting curbside, and post-flight services will include lounge refresh opportunities and concierge follow-ups.

The airline will also debut “The Seven Club”, a membership-based loyalty program featuring Family and Corporate tiers. Members can choose among four levels—Airspace D, C, B, and A—and enjoy guaranteed fixed pricing, exclusive events, and full-service concierge access.

Sustainability as a Founding Principle

Sustainability is deeply embedded in Magnifica Air’s design philosophy. The airline will be carbon-neutral from day one, integrating over seven million gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its annual operations. It plans to start operations with a 50 percent SAF blend and achieve 100 percent SAF usage by 2030.

Beyond fuel, Magnifica will incorporate solar-powered lounges, a carbon offset program, and eventually hybrid-electric aircraft as part of its long-term fleet evolution.

“We don’t think of wellness or sustainability as add-ons,” said Black. “They are built into every layer of the Magnifica Air experience.”

The company will also introduce the world’s first commercial-scale surface purification system and a cabin air humidification system designed to help passengers feel more rested and refreshed after a flight.

Routes, Growth, and the Road Ahead

Magnifica Air expects to obtain its FAA Part 121 certificate by late 2026 and become fully operational by the third quarter of 2027. Initial routes will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Jose, with seasonal service to Napa Valley and, eventually, the Caribbean.

Pricing will reflect the exclusivity. A one-way ticket is expected to cost about twice that of a first-class fare, or roughly $20,000 to $25,000, according to Black. The airline will initially operate six to seven daily departures and expects to grow its fleet to 25 aircraft within four years.

Magnifica Air is backed by $150 million in initial capital from CIG Companies, its renewable energy-focused parent firm, and is currently in talks with additional investor groups.

For now, Magnifica plans to focus on intra-US travel.

“The temptation to fly internationally first provides additional complexity,” Black explained. “We will start domestically, build our program here, and grow from there.”

Magnifica’s long-term vision includes 50 aircraft and a mix of scheduled flights, VIP charters, and curated experience trips tied to major cultural and sporting events like Art Basel and Formula 1.

With predictive safety analytics, a “Collaborative Just Culture” for employees, and one spare aircraft for every four in service, Black says the airline is “designed for resilience and consistency.”

And while others have tried to launch luxury carriers before, he believes Magnifica Air’s foundation is stronger. “Previous entrants weren’t properly capitalized,” he said. “We are.”

Magnifica Air Will Give the Ultra-Premium Segment a Brand New Way to Fly

Magnifica Air is positioning itself as a hybrid between Gulfstream comfort and Delta reliability, blending high-touch hospitality with large-aircraft economics. Its promise is not just to move passengers from city to city, but to make the journey itself the destination.

In that sense, Magnifica Air draws obvious comparisons to JSX, another US operator that has carved out a niche with private-terminal service and crowd-free flying. But while JSX uses converted Embraer regional jets seating 30 passengers, Magnifica is taking a different route by using larger Airbus A220s and A321neos with spacious cabins that allow for lie-flat seating, private suites, and dedicated lounges on board.

CEO Wade Black believes this difference in scale and design will set Magnifica apart. “I’ve always felt like smaller regional jets weren’t the right platform for what we’re trying to do,” he said during a press briefing at the 2025 NBAA-BACE Convention in Las Vegas. “Space is part of the experience. You can’t deliver true luxury in a cabin that feels tight.”

By marrying the comfort and personalization of private aviation with the operational scope of a major airline, Magnifica Air aims to occupy a new space in the US market: one that sits above first class but below private charter, appealing to travelers who value privacy, efficiency, and indulgence in equal measure.

You can follow the carrier’s journey to launch via the Magnifica Air website.

If all goes to plan, Magnifica Air could become what JSX pioneered on a smaller scale, a new class of air travel for those who believe flying should still feel special.

Why Will Split Scimitar Winglets Work For Delta?","One of the world's most iconic carriers, Delta Air Lines, continues to invest in its aircraft capabilities and performance. The Atlanta-based carrier favors Split Scimitar Wingletson its Boeing 737-800 and 737-900ER airplanes. This is through a partnership with Avition Partners Boeing (also known as APB), which develops an upgrade to the current APB ubiquitous Blended Winglet.

The move is expected to improve not only overall fuel efficiency but also deliver savings in the overall consumption of aviation jet fuel and improve the carriers' operational efficiency. Delta already operates one of the largest airline fleets in the world and has an extensive network of domestic and international flights from its various US hubs.

APB Winglet Products At Delta

The decision to add Split Scimitar Winglets to the carrier's 737 family of aircraft comes at a time when the airline had already installed the APB winglet products on a range of its current fleet, albeit the ubiquitous Blended Winglets. These are currently flying on the Boeing 737-800, 737-900ER, 757-200, 757-300, and Boeing 767-300ER.

Currently, the ubiquitous Blended Winglets are a widespread wingtip device, which is common across most modern aircraft. These winglets support a smooth transition across the wing while reducing drag. This provides improved fuel efficiency and, as a result, adds additional range for the aircraft.

As a comparison, Split Scimitar Winglets feature both an upward and downward pointing fin, which creates a weaker vortex on the wing tip, resulting in improved fuel efficiency, reduced drag, and, as a result, a significant reduction in the overall carbon emissions of each flight.

Ubiquitous Blended Winglets

These are designed with one upward fin and are a common sight on popular aircraft around the world, including the Boeing 737, 757, and 767. The design is smooth and features curved extensions that blend right onto the wing's edge. These have been engineered to reduce drag by reducing the formation of the airplane's wingtip vortices. These vortices are swirling air masses that create aircraft drag.

The smooth design allows a more aerodynamic aircraft, which has been shown to increase the operating aircraft's fuel efficiency, which, as a collective result, will save airlines billions of dollars in annual operating costs. Not only will they save airlines in their pocket, but also ensure the plane's longitudinal and directional stability, which allows the aircraft to handle smoother landings, especially in wild weather such as high winds.

The Ubiquitous Blended Winglets were first introduced in the early 2000s and have been installed and adopted on aircraft around the world. Developed by Aviation Partners, the manufacturer first installed these onto the 737, and subsequently, they are now a feature on new aircraft at the assembly line, but can also be retrofitted onto existing aircraft.

Split Scimitar Winglets

First certified in 2014, Aviation Partners' joint venture with Boeing allowed a blended winglet design, which was first offered on the 737NG. Its success led to similar designs being developed for the 757 and 767. The split scimitar is designed with an aerodynamically shaped cap, with a ventral strake that extends downwards. This is proven to save more fuel, add additional range, and even increase in overall payload.

The dual-blade design is unlike normal standard winglets, given its upward and downward blades that optimize airflow. The design allows the plane to create a weaker vortex, lowering the overall drag of the airplane. This has resulted in increased fuel savings, as planes are shown to lower fuel burn by 1.6% to 2.2% per aircraft. This enhanced performance stimulates fuel savings for airlines, given their increased payload and better operational performance.

Many of the world's largest airlines have already adopted these winglet designs, with Europe's largest budget carrier, Ryanair, being one of the biggest adopters of the split scimitar winglet. Other airlines, such as United Airlines and Qantas, have also led to the retrofit of these on existing aircraft, while accepting new deliveries of planes with these already installed. Aeromexico also has the Split Scimitar winglets on its Boeing 737-800 fleet.

Other Carriers' Adoption Of The Split Scimitar Winglet

United Airlines invested in the split scimitar winglet due to the attraction of increased fuel efficiency, which would, as a result, mean lower operational costs. The design provides around 2% of fuel savings, and is fully implemented across the carrier's 737, 757, and 767 fleet. The lower emissions mean that these planes are now more fuel-efficient, improving the airline's carbon footprint.

Qantas Airways, the flag carrier of Australia, also opted for the split scimitar in a bid to improve its fuel burn across its 737-800 aircraft fleet. The significant savings expected from these will lead to a significant annual fuel saving for the airline's balance sheet. The carrier program of work to install the split scimitar winglet at Qantas is expected to run through until some stage in 2026.

This retrofit at Qantas will see the fleet of its narrowbody Boeing 737s have its winglets gradually replaced, cementing these popular aircraft into the next decade of operations. The red-tailed airline is fitting the winglets on all 23 of its Boeing 737-800s. These aircraft are deployed on domestic routes, while also providing capacity on short-haul international services such as to New Zealand, Indonesia, and other South Pacific nations.

Why Will Split Scimitar Winglets Work For Delta?

Atlanta-based Delta is investing in the development and installation of split scimitar winglets, in a bid to not only help improve the fuel efficiency of its Boeing 737 aircraft, but also lower the airline's carbon footprint. These winglets achieve improved operational efficiency due to their design being reshaped in the traditional blended design. Reduction in drag is a big factor for airlines being able to improve operational handling, as high-pressure air spills onto the lower pressure of the tip.

This creates vortices that sap energy from the jet, but the downward strakes weaken these vortices, so, compared to blended winglets, this design is far superior. With Delta looking to improve its efficiency, this also supports its goal of reducing its carbon emissions, reminding the industry that it remains committed to finding ways to develop cleaner, greener ways to fly. Delta has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and is striving to do so through the initiatives detailed below.

The maximized efficiency produces long-haul savings, with the airplanes being able to operate longer flights, which is why we are now seeing the carrier introduce the 737-900ER and 737-800 on longer services. Given that fuel is a major operating cost for airlines, these improvements result in billions of dollars shaved off carriers' yearly fuel bill.

What's Next?

While Delta partnered with Aviation Partners in 2015, the latest move to acquire additional APB winglet products is evident in the carrier's dedication to ensuring sustainable air travel. There is a solid environmental argument for this investment, with the winglets reducing overall fuel consumption on any aircraft that has the split scimitar or even blended winglet fitted. Delta Air Lines is one of the world's largest airlines and one of America's 'Big Three' carriers.

The new partnership will see benefits that not only trickle to the airline's bottom line, but also to the passengers' tickets. Understanding the economics of fuel reduction and optimized performance should result in lower operating costs for the airline, meaning cheaper airfares for travelers.

The split scimitar winglet will see Delta reduce its overall per passenger emission while improving the overall onboard experience, not just in feel-good factor, but also lower the effects of strong jet streams and air vortices that can affect the enjoyment of the flight, but also reduce the amount of carbon emissions that the aircraft would have once produced when carrying more drag.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blended-winglets-are-great-but-delta-air-lines-thinks-these-winglets-are-better.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-18 14:56:36.829724

Ini adalah langkah teknologi dan lingkungan yang cukup berani di tengah upaya global pengurangan emisi.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) adalah bahan bakar pesawat yang dibuat dari sumber non-fosil seperti :

minyak goreng bekas (used cooking oil),

limbah pertanian,

lemak hewan,

biomassa, atau bahkan

karbon daur ulang dari atmosfer (melalui teknologi carbon capture).

Berbeda dari avtur konvensional yang berasal dari minyak bumi, SAF dapat mengurangi emisi karbon hingga 80% selama siklus hidupnya, tergantung pada bahan baku dan proses produksinya.

Detail Informasi :

Pertamina, perusahaan energi milik negara, sudah mulai memproduksi SAF dari minyak goreng bekas (used cooking oil/UCO) dan merencanakan konversi dua kilang agar kapasitas produksinya naik.

Pemerintah menyusun regulasi untuk implementasi awal 1% SAF pada 2026, dengan target peningkatan bertahap menjadi hingga 5% pada 2035.

Potensi produksi UCO di Indonesia cukup besar: diperkirakan 3-4 juta kiloliter per tahun.

Mengapa Ini Penting :

Teknologi & Lingkungan: Penggunaan SAF merupakan integrasi teknologi energi baru dan pengurangan emisi untuk sektor penerbangan yang selama ini sulit dikurangi.

Industri dan Produksi Lokal: Pemanfaatan UCO sebagai bahan baku membuka peluang ekonomi baru, meningkatkan nilai tambah limbah, serta memperkuat rantai industri domestik.

Posisi Indonesia di Kancah Global: Langkah ini menunjukkan kesiapan Indonesia untuk masuk dalam arus teknologi energi bersih dan menjadi bagian dari solusi global perubahan iklim.

Kesiapan Infrastruktur & Regulasi: Regulasi baru dan konversi kilang menunjukkan bahwa aspek teknologi dan kebijakan sedang digarap bersamaan — bukan hanya janji tapi juga tindakan.

Tantangan dan Catatan :

Menerapkan SAF tinggi-teknologi masih menghadapi kendala seperti harga produksi, efisiensi proses, dan regulasi yang siap pakai.

Meski potensi UCO besar, logistik pengumpulan, pengolahan, dan standar mutu SAF harus dijaga agar kualitasnya layak untuk penerbangan.

Industri penerbangan dan maskapai harus bersiap dengan infrastruktur baru (misalnya, penyimpanan, distribusi SAF) dan perubahan operasional.

Kenaikan dari 1% ke target 5% hingga 2035 menunjukkan bahwa ini adalah perjalanan panjang, bukan solusi instan.

Langkah untuk menerapkan 1% SAF pada 2026 adalah langkah teknologi strategis yang menggabungkan inovasi energi, lingkungan, dan industri. Meski masih banyak tantangan, ini memberi sinyal bahwa Indonesia tidak hanya menjadi pengguna teknologi, tetapi juga bisa menjadi pionir di kawasan untuk penerapan teknologi “bersih” di sektor penerbangan.(FA)",https://ifakta.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2648.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 15:56:47.688281

The deal follows an earlier order for 30 A350s placed in April 2024, effectively doubling the airline’s total wide-body backlog to 60 aircraft.

The agreement converts a Memorandum of Understanding signed earlier this year into a confirmed purchase. With this, IndiGo becomes one of the largest future A350 operators in Asia, positioning itself for an international expansion that goes far beyond its familiar regional routes.

A Clear Shift Beyond Domestic

For nearly two decades, IndiGo built its success on the strength of short-haul and domestic efficiency. Its fleet of over 370 Airbus A320neo and A321neo aircraft has made it one of the world’s largest single-aisle operators. But this latest order shows that the airline is no longer content being only a regional carrier.

The A350-900, with its long range and efficiency, gives IndiGo the capability to fly nonstop to Europe, Australia, and even North America, all key future markets as India’s outbound travel demand continues to rise. According to Airbus, the aircraft’s advanced aerodynamics and next-generation engines allow a 25% reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions compared to previous-generation wide-bodies.

Words from the Top

Speaking about the deal, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said that finalizing this additional order is “a strong confirmation of our belief in India’s aviation potential.” He described that “converting the MoU into a firm order reflects confidence in the future of Indian aviation and strengthens its long-haul strategy.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus Executive Vice President of Sales for Commercial Aircraft, called the announcement “a testament to IndiGo’s confidence in the A350 platform.” He highlighted how the aircraft’s efficiency and comfort make it a perfect fit for the airline’s upcoming long-haul phase.

Backstory

IndiGo first made headlines in April 2024 when it placed its initial order of 30 A350-900s, marking its first step into the wide-body market. Those aircraft are due for delivery beginning mid-2027, intended to launch the carrier’s first direct long-haul routes.

The airline’s history with Airbus goes back to its founding in 2006, when it placed a record order for 100 A320s even before operating its first flight. It continued its massive single-aisle expansion with a 250-aircraft order in 2015 and a 500-aircraft deal in 2023, which remains the largest single aircraft order in aviation history.

Now, with the A350 program, 6E is clearly preparing for a new phase. The combination of A321XLRs and A350-900s will give it both medium and long-range flexibility to reach new destinations across continents.

The Bigger Picture for India’s Aviation

India’s aviation market is growing faster than almost any other in the world. In 2024 alone, more than 160 million domestic passengers were recorded, while international traffic rose sharply as more Indians began traveling abroad for business and leisure.

This latest order ties in well with the government’s “Vision 2047” plan that aims to position India as a major global aviation hub. With the A350s, 6E can finally take on the long-haul game — going head-to-head with the big Middle Eastern players that have long owned the India–Europe and India–US corridors.

For Airbus, India has turned into a key pillar in its global strategy. The planemaker has been steadily pumping investments into the country’s aviation ecosystem, from local suppliers to training centers and pilot development programs, many of which play straight into IndiGo’s long-term growth story.

Aircraft Details & Sustainability Goals

The Airbus A350-900 features a typical two-class layout seating between 300 and 350 passengers. It’s equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines—among the world’s most efficient large turbofans—and has a range of around 8,000 nautical miles.

The aircraft is also fully certified to operate on up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today, with ongoing efforts toward 100% SAF capability by 2030. IndiGo, like other global carriers, has pledged to gradually increase its SAF usage over the coming decade.

While the airline hasn’t yet disclosed its cabin configuration or branding strategy for the A350 fleet, industry speculation points toward a full-service long-haul division under the IndiGo umbrella — possibly with premium seating layouts unlike its all-economy narrow-body jets.

Looking Ahead

The first of IndiGo’s A350-900s is expected to enter service in 2027, marking the airline’s official step into the wide-body space.

While Airbus will deliver the remaining aircraft gradually over the coming years, 6E hasn’t yet announced its first long-haul destinations. Many in the industry expect them to start by exploring routes into Europe and East Asia, with further expansion to North America possible as the fleet and infrastructure mature.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68f39798cd5ea2cef1920279_IndiGo%20Orders%2030%20A350-900s.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 10:56:18.248530

He emphasized that green buildings and green transport are key pillars in Vietnam’s green economic growth strategy. Beyond reducing emissions and saving resources, they also foster technological innovation, improve living standards, and enhance national competitiveness.

In both 2024 and 2025, Vietnam saw strong growth in the number of certified green buildings and eco-friendly vehicles.

By the end of Q3 2025, the country had around 600 certified green buildings, totaling nearly 17 million square meters of floor space.

In transportation, Vietnam recorded 183,240 electric cars and 974 electric buses on the road.

Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City lead the nation with more than 38,400 electric cars each. The two cities also operate 317 and 507 electric buses respectively.

Other provinces such as Da Nang, Hai Phong, Thanh Hoa, and Khanh Hoa are also witnessing rapid growth, contributing to Vietnam’s green transition and sustainable development goals.

Transport sector must pivot to electric and biofuel sources

Discussing emission-reduction potential in the transport sector, Le Van Dat, Deputy Director of the Strategy and Personnel Training Academy (under the Ministry of Construction), noted that between 2014 and 2023, road transport accounted for over 85% of Vietnam’s total passenger and freight volume.

The country currently has over 7 million cars and nearly 78 million motorbikes, along with hundreds of thousands of vessels in maritime, inland waterway, and aviation sectors.

The transport industry consumes over 95% of its energy from fossil fuels and emits an estimated 45.8 million tons of CO₂ annually-second only to the industrial sector.

Under Vietnam’s third Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 3.0), the country aims to replace traditional fuels in road transport with biofuels and electricity by 2030.

For the rail sector, electric trains are being implemented in urban areas from 2019 to 2025, while hydrogen is expected to be adopted by 2040. By 2050, diesel, electric, and hydrogen-powered locomotives are projected to account for 40%, 10%, and 50% of the total fleet respectively.

In inland waterway transport, electricity and hydrogen are expected to be introduced starting in 2035.

For aviation, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will begin to be used from 2035, expected to supply around 10% of the sector’s total energy demand.

Vietnam must build a full green investment ecosystem

In the construction materials sector, Nguyen Thi Tam, Director of the Center for Equipment, Environment and Labor Safety (under the Institute of Building Materials), said the goal by 2030 is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 15.03%, equivalent to 23.2 million tons of CO₂.

With international support, emissions could be cut by up to 20.06%, or 30.97 million tons of CO₂.

To achieve this, the sector is adopting new technologies, utilizing waste in production, optimizing processes, and researching carbon capture innovations.

In parallel, institutional and policy tools are being developed-such as low-emission standards, carbon credit mechanisms, and the establishment of a carbon market.

Ta Duc Binh, representative of the Institute of Strategy and Policy for Agriculture and Environment (under the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment), warned that climate change is progressing at an alarming rate, requiring decisive action from policymakers and investors.

According to the World Bank, Vietnam will need around 368 billion USD by 2040 to achieve net-zero emissions.

The story of Brazil’s biofuel journey is one of persistence, innovation, and vision.","Brazil has emerged as a global leader in sustainable biofuels, setting an example for countries working to decarbonize their energy systems while supporting economic growth and social development. The country’s long-standing commitment to renewable energy is rooted in decades of consistent government policies, innovation, and collaboration between the public and private sectors. Brazil’s experience, particularly with ethanol made from sugarcane and biodiesel produced from soybeans, provides valuable lessons for the world on how to build a successful and sustainable bioenergy sector.

The success of Brazil’s biofuel journey began in the 1970s, when the government launched initiatives to reduce dependence on imported oil. Over time, this evolved into a well-structured system that includes the RenovaBio program and the “Fuel of the Future Law.” These legislative frameworks have encouraged the widespread use of biofuels through financial incentives, clear regulations, and mandatory blending targets. As a result, Brazil has managed to significantly lower its carbon emissions and increase its energy security while strengthening the agricultural economy. The widespread use of flexible-fuel vehicles, which can run on either pure ethanol or a gasoline-ethanol blend, has been one of the most visible signs of success. This approach has provided consumers with affordable, low-carbon mobility options while promoting domestic renewable energy.

Brazil’s model shows how thoughtful policies can de-risk investments and create a stable business environment. Clear and consistent rules have encouraged cooperation between the government, private investors, and research institutions. This collaboration has driven innovation, leading to improvements in both production efficiency and environmental sustainability. Farmers, fuel producers, and vehicle manufacturers all play a role in this integrated system, ensuring that biofuels contribute meaningfully to national development goals.

However, Brazil’s biofuel industry continues to face certain challenges. One of the key concerns is managing land use effectively. The expansion of biofuel production must not come at the expense of food security or lead to deforestation and habitat loss. Policymakers and industry leaders must ensure that agricultural practices remain sustainable and that environmental safeguards are in place to protect sensitive ecosystems. Additionally, global fluctuations in fossil fuel prices can affect the competitiveness of biofuels. Maintaining policy stability and long-term planning is crucial to sustain investor confidence and ensure continuous progress in the sector.

Despite these challenges, Brazil is now focusing on the next generation of biofuels that promise even greater environmental and economic benefits. The country is investing in advanced technologies such as second-generation (2G) ethanol, which is produced using sugarcane straw and bagasse—agricultural residues that would otherwise go to waste. This approach not only improves resource efficiency but also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions further. Another area of innovation is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which aims to decarbonize the aviation industry, one of the hardest sectors to electrify. These emerging biofuels represent the next frontier of Brazil’s energy strategy and are expected to play a critical role in achieving net-zero goals.

The broader lesson from Brazil’s experience is the importance of global cooperation. As countries around the world transition toward cleaner energy systems, biofuels can make a substantial contribution. Experts estimate that sustainable fuels could provide at least 20% of the world’s total energy consumption by 2050 if countries adopt supportive policies and share best practices. Brazil’s achievements demonstrate that large-scale adoption of biofuels is possible when clear policies, technological innovation, and public-private partnerships align toward common goals.

The story of Brazil’s biofuel journey is one of persistence, innovation, and vision. It shows that renewable energy can power both economic and environmental progress. By building strong sustainability standards and encouraging collaboration across nations, the global community can follow Brazil’s lead in turning climate ambition into tangible results. Brazil’s experience continues to inspire policymakers worldwide to view bioenergy not just as an alternative fuel source, but as a cornerstone of a sustainable and inclusive energy future.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pexels-photo-923953.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 10:56:32.379825

That do-it-yourself energy moment is real enough to spark curiosity. The bigger story, though, lives in commercial plants, refinery-ready feedstocks, and airline and shipping buyers that are already purchasing fuels made from waste carbon.

The result is a practical pathway from post-consumer plastics and even captured CO₂ to usable fuels and petrochemical feedstocks that meet industry specifications. The science behind sunlight-driven microwave-assisted pyrolysis is well documented, and it provides a friendly on-ramp to explain the mature routes the industry is scaling today.

Before we dive into the four routes that already work, you will see two patterns. First, large buyers care about specifications and reliability. Second, policy definitions decide who can claim recycling content and who earns fuel credits. Together, those two forces explain why some projects scale quickly while others stay in the lab.

Seven Fast Facts Proving Plastic-to-Fuel is Already Real

Hydrothermal plants are scaling now: Mura Technology announced a 50,000-ton-per-year Hydro-PRT® facility on Jurong Island, Singapore, positioned to process more than 60,000 tonnes of plastic waste annually as it expands.

Electrified cracking just hit a milestone: Coolbrook cracked 100 percent plastic-waste pyrolysis oil directly to ethylene and propylene at a pilot scale, while maintaining stable operation.

Conditioning trains make waste oils “cracker-ready”: Technip Energies commercialized Pure.rOil purification to remove contaminants and align boiling ranges for steam crackers.

CO₂-to-fuel is already commercial: The Kassø e-methanol plant in Denmark was inaugurated May 13, 2025, at 42,000 tonnes per year, with offtake tied to deep-sea shipping.

Aviation buyers are investing: United Airlines invested in Twelve, which produces power-to-liquid E-Jet fuel from CO₂ and water using renewable electricity.

CO₂-to-methanol deployments span multiple sites: Carbon Recycling International lists commercial and licensed projects that convert CO₂ into methanol at an industrial scale.

Frontier research is moving quickly: Recent reviews outline microwave-assisted pyrolysis fundamentals and photoreforming routes that turn plastics into hydrogen and valuable chemicals using sunlight.

Fast-conversion case studies show plastic waste turned into jet fuel in under an hour, scalable routes for plastic waste turned into hydrogen, and a bench-scale plastic waste fuel reactor that liquefies mixed streams into usable fractions.

Four Real Pathways that Already Work

Hydrothermal Conversion to Drop-In Hydrocarbons

How it Works

Hydrothermal processes expose plastics to high-temperature, high-pressure water. The supercritical water breaks long polymer chains into shorter hydrocarbons that can be refined into petrochemical feedstocks or fuel cuts. This approach tolerates mixed streams better than many catalytic routes and produces liquids that integrate into existing infrastructure.

Where it is Scaling

Mura’s Hydro-PRT plants showcase the model: site near industrial hubs, convert hard-to-recycle streams, and output stabilized liquids for downstream units. The Jurong Island project in Singapore is the latest expansion, sized at 50,000 tonnes per year with growth plans beyond 60,000 tonnes.

What Buyers Want

Refiners and petrochemical players want stable composition, tight impurity control, and predictable boiling ranges. Hydrothermal liquids can be conditioned to meet those needs, which is why you see projects co-located with crackers and refineries. For background on policy definitions that affect marketing claims, see our explainer on mass-balance rules in the European Union and the evolving U.S. regulatory posture on waste units.

Systems thinking spans industrial capacity and cleanup, from the UK’s biggest recycling plant processing hard-to-sort feedstocks to the Manta Ocean-Cleaning Yacht generating onboard energy from recovered debris.

Pyrolysis Oil to Steam Crackers with Electrified Cracking

How it Works

Thermal pyrolysis converts mixed plastics into a liquid commonly called pyrolysis oil. To feed that oil to a steam cracker that makes ethylene and propylene, operators must remove chlorine, oxygenates, metals, and fine solids, and in some cases trim the boiling range. Commercial purification trains now exist to perform that conditioning step.

Industrial Proof

Conditioning Is Productized: Technip Energies markets Pure.rOil, a purification platform that treats a wide range of pyrolysis oils so they can run in liquid-feed steam crackers.

Electrified Cracking Removes the Dilution Crutch: Coolbrook demonstrated cracking 100 percent plastic-waste pyrolysis oil in its RotoDynamic Reactor, delivering ethylene and propylene with stable coking behavior. That simplifies traceability and makes circular content easier to track.

Why it Matters

When cracker-grade specifications are met, pyrolysis oil can become a circular feedstock for new plastics, not just a combustion fuel. Small-scale energy use is already practical, with melting plastic waste into fuel to heat homes complementing a modular plastic waste fuel reactor that upgrades packaging into liquid fuel cuts.

Plastic-to-Hydrogen when Gas Beats Liquids

How it Works

There are multiple routes to hydrogen from plastics, including gasification with steam reforming, catalytic pyrolysis with in-situ reforming, and advanced processes that co-reform plastic-derived gases. These systems are useful when feedstocks are highly contaminated, when siting favors distributed units, or when hydrogen credits and local demand improve project economics.

Recent Signals

A growing body of 2025 literature consolidates catalysts, yields, and integration options for plastic-to-hydrogen, and field trials continue to refine performance on mixed streams. Those reviews provide mechanism diagrams and techno-economic guardrails you can cite in procurement and policy conversations.

Where it Fits

Hydrogen routes can be attractive near heavy transport corridors or industrial clusters that already consume hydrogen. Hydrogen pathways are maturing, with plastic waste into hydrogen detailing catalytic routes, and the world’s first waste plastic hydrogen plant illustrating how contaminated streams become clean H₂.

Sunlight and Electrons: The Frontier Moving from Lab to Pilot

Photoreforming With Sunlight

Researchers are rapidly improving catalysts that use sunlight and water to convert plastics into hydrogen and platform chemicals like formate and acetate in a process more commonly known as sunlight-driven microwave pyrolysis. These systems operate at low temperatures and pair naturally with renewable power. Recent reviews summarize pretreatment steps, reaction mechanisms, and stability challenges.

Electro-Routes You Should Watch

Electrified approaches, including joule-heated or plasma-assisted reforming, are being explored to co-convert plastics and CO₂ into syngas precursors for fuels. While these methods remain pre-commercial, they provide an important bridge between low-value waste streams and high-value molecules that heavy industry can use.

Who Buys, Why the Market is Growing, and What Decides the Winning Route

Selecting the right plastic-to-fuel pathway starts with knowing who will buy the output of the green e-fuels revolution and why. Marine carriers seek e-methanol that slots into port logistics, airlines fund power-to-liquid SAF to meet blend and safety rules, and petrochemicals demand cracker-grade liquids for circular polymers. With buyers defined, feedstock quality, energy prices, and policy incentives determine which technology wins in a given region, from plastic-to-hydrogen near industrial hubs to pyrolysis-to-cracker routes inside petrochemical clusters.

Shipping’s E-Methanol Momentum

Deep-sea shipping needs dense liquid fuels that move through existing logistics while meeting tougher emissions targets, which is why e-methanol is gaining traction. Denmark’s Kassø facility began commercial operations on May 13, 2025, supplying certified e-methanol produced from renewable power and captured CO₂. Early bunkering for vessels such as Laura Maersk signals real demand rather than pilot-only activity, and port infrastructure is scaling to handle methanol alongside conventional marine fuels.

What Bunkering Looks Like in Practice

At Kassø, solar-powered electrolysis pairs with biogenic CO₂ capture to synthesize methanol that is stored on site and transferred via standard bunkering hoses to container ships. Transparency on inputs and certification enables shipowners to count emissions reductions toward fleet targets, turning e-methanol into a practical decarbonization lever for ocean freight.

Aviation’s Power-to-Liquid Moves

Airlines operate under strict safety and energy-density constraints, so they are investing in power-to-liquid suppliers that make sustainable aviation fuel from CO₂ and water using renewable electricity. Investments like United Airlines backing Twelve demonstrate how carriers secure future supply, diversify beyond bio-based SAF, and push producers toward fuel specs that fit existing engines and airport fueling systems.

Jet-range molecules are achievable quickly, as plastic waste into jet fuel methods demonstrate rapid deconstruction kinetics and plastic waste fuel reactors document controllable distillation curves for circular polymer or fuel applications.

Petrochemicals Seek Circular Feed

When the objective is to make new plastics instead of combusting fuels, petrochemical buyers require cracker-grade liquids derived from waste plastics. This depends on two industrial capabilities. First, commercial oil-conditioning trains remove chlorine, oxygenates, metals, and heavy tails so the liquid meets steam-cracker requirements. Second, electrified steam-cracking pilots have shown that waste-plastic pyrolysis oil can be processed without relying on fossil diluents, which improves traceability for circular content and simplifies accounting for recycled material.

Carbon-To-Chemicals is Now a Market

Beyond fuels, carbon utilization is producing commodity chemicals. Commercial and licensed CO₂-to-methanol projects already convert point-source CO₂ into a platform molecule used in fuels and chemical manufacturing. Parallel progress in polymers shows how carbon captured from industry can reappear as polypropylene-grade outputs, tightening the loop between emissions and everyday materials.

Why Household and Enterprise Solutions Align

Decentralized systems like biodigesters cut methane at the home or community level, while energy-efficient aviation facilities reduce operational footprints across complex logistics. Both ends of the spectrum point to the same conclusion. Waste carbon becomes valuable when the conversion route fits local feedstocks, the offtake is real, and the policy framework rewards the environmental attributes that markets are willing to buy.

Regulatory Reality Check: The Rules that Pick Winners

Europe’s Mass-Balance Accounting Shapes What Counts

The European Commission launched a 2025 consultation to define how chemically recycled content in single-use plastic beverage bottles should be calculated through mass balance. This is a pivotal definition. If fuel use is excluded from recycled-content claims for bottles, projects will often favor routes that produce cracker-grade liquids for polymer loops rather than fuels. The Commission’s summary explains the accounting intent and the push for a level playing field across technologies. Review the official notice and industry briefs for the current wording and timing.

What that Means for Investors

If your revenue model depends on “recycled content” claims, mass-balance rules determine whether a given output stream qualifies. That is why companies pursuing pyrolysis-to-cracker and hydrothermal liquids often colocate with existing petrochemical assets in Europe. A conservative reading of the Commission’s consultation suggests polymer-loop outputs can be easier to credit than combusted fuels for bottle content targets. Cross-check the language before locking your product slate.

U.S. Compliance Context for Waste-to-Fuel Projects

The EPA finalized an Other Solid Waste Incineration (OSWI) rule in June 2025, effective August 29, 2025. While the rule targets incineration units, it influences how developers classify and permit certain waste-processing configurations. Developers should review the Federal Register text and EPA backgrounders to understand monitoring, emissions control, and siting implications for their specific technology stack. Start with the Federal Register entry and EPA OSWI pages for authoritative details.

Practical Takeaway on U.S. Siting

Compliance categories can shift a project’s cost structure and timeline. Teams should plan early for emissions testing, recordkeeping, and local permitting dialogues, especially when the configuration integrates thermal steps that regulators may scrutinize. Keep language precise in public communications to avoid conflating chemical recycling with incineration.

Route Selector: How To Choose the Right Sustainable Fuel Conversion Path

One rule governs everything: context decides the winner. The optimal route depends on four variables that interact locally: feedstock quality, energy price, nearby buyers, and policy definitions. When those are mapped correctly, the most efficient and sustainable pathway usually becomes obvious.

What Determines The Best Route

Feedstock: purity, polymer mix, contamination, moisture, and volume stability

Energy & Utilities: electricity price and carbon intensity, available steam, water, and heat

Offtake & Logistics: proximity to hydrogen users, steam crackers, ports, or airports

Policy & Credits: recycled-content accounting, fuel carbon intensity standards, hydrogen incentives

Start With Feedstock And End Use

Mixed, Dirty, Or Variable Streams with Local Hydrogen Demand

Choose: Plastic-to-hydrogen routes.

Why it fits: These systems tolerate contamination, can be distributed near end users, and can stack clean-hydrogen credits where they exist.

Best locations: Industrial hubs and heavy-transport corridors that already consume hydrogen for refining, chemicals, steel, or fleet fueling.

Execution tip: Secure a nearby H₂ buyer and grid-connection plan, then size the unit to match steady waste inflow and hydrogen demand.

Access To A Steam Cracker Or Petrochemical Complex

Choose: Pyrolysis-oil conditioning targeting circular polymer loops.

Why it fits: Meeting cracker specifications unlocks high-value offtake and enables verifiable recycled-content claims inside plastics supply chains.

Best locations: Chemical parks with liquid-feed crackers and utilities for pretreatment, hydrotreating, and impurity control.

Execution tip: Budget for a full conditioning train and quality assurance. Align with a cracker operator on acceptable ranges for chlorine, oxygenates, metals, and boiling curves.

Regions With Strong CO₂ Fuel Credits and Low-Cost Renewable Power

Choose: CO₂-to-e-fuels such as e-methanol for marine use or power-to-liquid SAF for aviation.

Why it fits: Policy rewards low-carbon molecules and early plants are already operating with offtake agreements from shipping and airlines.

Best locations: Grid nodes with abundant renewables, available CO₂ sources, and port or airport infrastructure.

Execution tip: Lock power purchase terms and carbon intensity baselines early. Match plant size to firm offtake and certification requirements.

Markets Where Recycled-Content Claims Are Essential

Choose: Routes that trace outputs into polymer loops rather than combustion.

Why it fits: In programs where bottle-content accounting excludes fuel use from recycled-content claims, polymer-to-polymer pathways score better.

Execution tip: Track mass-balance rules closely, align auditing and chain-of-custody systems, and coordinate communications so claims match the local standard.

Putting It All Together: A Quick Decision Flow

Is reliable H₂ demand within trucking distance and are feeds mixed or dirty → pursue plastic-to-hydrogen.

Is a steam cracker nearby with appetite for circular liquids → invest in pyrolysis-oil conditioning for polymer loops.

Is cheap, clean power available and CO₂ credits strong → develop CO₂-to-e-fuels for shipping or aviation.

Are recycled-content claims central to revenue or regulation → bias toward polymer-loop outputs and mass-balance alignment.

Use this selector as a checklist in project scoping. Map your local variables, run sensitivity on power price and policy credit values, validate offtake specifications with buyers, and the winning route will emerge with far less friction.

The Bottom Line on Waste Carbon: What Smart Buyers Know Now

Sustainability has grown up. The popular DIY clips are a useful spark, yet the real story sits in contracts, certifications, and plants that turn waste plastics and captured CO₂ into fuels and feedstocks that meet buyer specifications.

Everyday infrastructure contributes alongside corporate hubs, with Biodigesters That Recycle Household Waste lowering household emissions and Ryanair’s Eco-Friendly Hangar Facility optimizing energy use across ground operations.

Shipping is already bunkering e-methanol in Denmark. Aviation is investing in power-to-liquid suppliers to secure future SAF. Petrochemicals are conditioning pyrolysis oils and testing fully circular, electrified cracking runs.

Policymakers are defining how recycled content is counted and how waste units are permitted, which directly affects what scales first.

This ultimately signaled a decisive move into the world of long-haul flying. The airline's CEO, Pieter Elbers, ultimately said that the deal supports IndiGo's goal of becoming a global player by 2030 and aligning with India's aviation hub ambitions.

The aircraft type promises a roughly 25% lower fuel burn, operating cost, and Carbon Dioxide output than previous-generation rival jet models. The plane can also operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, with a target of 100% currently in the works for 2030. Airbus noted impressive market growth in India, with Airbus A350 orders totaling more than 1,400 from 63 customers by September 2025.

A Deeper Look At The Specifics Of This Deal

IndiGo's firm order for a set of 30 Airbus A350-900s is set to lift its A350 backlog to 60 aircraft, and it is notable on several fronts. This order very quickly converts a Memorandum of Understanding from June, and it signals a strong conviction in the airline's decision to make a pivot into the long-haul market. IndiGo has historically been a very successful low-cost regional carrier, but this shift highlights the airline's strong interest in making an entry into the long-haul market, according to the latest reports from manufacturer Airbus.

The Airbus A350's long-range capabilities, cabin comfort, and roughly 25% advantage in terms of fuel burn make it a good choice for an airline looking to cater to a new kind of long-haul travelers. The jet's exceptional route economics and ability to operate with nearly 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel make it exceptionally capable in relation to earlier-generation competitors. The carrier will now begin the challenging part of planning which long-haul destinations it is looking to fly to.

What Is IndiGo's Plan For Entering The Long-Haul Market?

IndiGo is pursuing a sequenced and risk-managed pivot into long-haul travel. This is relatively unique for an airline that operates on a low-cost model, given the typical higher expenses associated with long-haul intercontinental flights. The airline is starting by layering partnerships across its network to offer diverse one-stop access to destinations across Europe. The airline is then looking to wet-lease Boeing 777-300ER models to build up experience operating services between Delhi, Mumbai, and Istanbul.

Next, IndiGo added a small ""Stretch"" premium cabin on Airbus A321neos to test paid upsell potential and condition customers for two-class services. The airline's fleet architecture is based on a true long-haul model with some future Airbus A321XLR jets that will enable flights on long and thin routes. This will soon be followed by Airbus A350-900s starting in 2027, with this new order bringing the total number of airframes to 60.

The airline's network strategy will leverage Delhi and Mumbai as super-feed hubs, opening up European services first before broader Asia-Pacific and North America moves. Codeshares also fill gaps until the Airbus A350 arrives to provide scale and long-range capabilities. There are some risks associated with the execution of this long-haul fleet strategy. This includes improved slot access at primary gateways, and potential delivery delays could also slow down the airline's planned timeline.

What Does All Of This Mean For Passengers?

Passengers will now have access to more nonstop flights from India to Europe. Later expansion plans call for the airline to add flights to Asia-Pacific destinations and to North America, which will further expand the carrier's long-haul reach. Passengers traveling with IndiGo on long-haul services can anticipate competitive base fares, but an unbundled model that will require them to pay for pretty much everything extra.

In the near term, one-stop connectivity will continue to improve via the airline's partners. Medium-haul routes will use the Airbus A321XLR that features ""Stretch"" seats offering extra comfort. The Airbus A350 does offer top-of-the-line cabin comfort, so its introduction to service will mark an improvement over the 777-300ERs, which it will initially use.

The airline will operate two principal hubs using this aircraft.

“South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business,” Gruber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday.
It wouldn’t be a standalone ethanol plant, he said, but it could be a jet fuel plant that uses corn oil or ethanol, or be used as a chemical production plant.
Gruber sees a future where 70 of the nation’s approximately 180 ethanol plants use designs like Gevo’s to convert to jet fuel production.
The specter of eminent domain sparked landowner opposition, litigation and political activism in South Dakota, leading to the ban.","The leader of the company that abandoned its immediate plans to build a $2.6 billion ethanol-based jet fuel plant in Lake Preston said Friday that South Dakota is no longer a friendly place to do business.

In 2022, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber stood alongside South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, then the lieutenant governor, at the ceremonial groundbreaking for the project, billed as the largest economic development project in state history.

This week, Gruber and his Colorado-based company announced plans for a smaller jet fuel facility at an ethanol plant in Richardton, North Dakota.

Gevo bought the plant a year ago in the wake of South Dakota pushback on a carbon sequestration pipeline that was critical to the company’s Lake Preston business plan.

“South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business,” Gruber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday. “Everything is oppositional. North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.”

Gruber said his company still hopes to build something on the 200-odd acres it owns in Kingsbury County at some point in the future. It wouldn’t be a standalone ethanol plant, he said, but it could be a jet fuel plant that uses corn oil or ethanol, or be used as a chemical production plant.

Gruber sees a future where 70 of the nation’s approximately 180 ethanol plants use designs like Gevo’s to convert to jet fuel production. Demand is growing, he said, and the U.S. can’t keep up with the petroleum-based refineries it has.

That’s long-term, though. Whether the Lake Preston site is a part of that conversation or is used for another offshoot of Gevo’s operations is also a ways off.

At this point, after watching opposition to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline drive policy changes over the past three years, Gruber said he’s wary of engaging South Dakota leaders.

In 2022, he said, there was strong support in state leadership for both the pipeline and Gevo’s Net Zero-1 complex in Kingsbury County.

Then the political winds shifted.

“Having lived through the change, I’m not doing that again,” Gruber said.

Carbon sequestration drives business

Summit Carbon Solutions had hoped to gather carbon dioxide from ethanol plants across multiple states and deliver it via underground pipe to a site in North Dakota for sequestration. In doing so, the company would cash in on federal carbon capture tax credits.

Gevo, were it to build its operations in Lake Preston and connect to that line, would be able to lower the carbon emissions of its jet fuel, boosting its value in certain markets.

Sustainable jet fuel developer moves priority from SD to ND amid Summit pipeline delays

Gevo’s North Dakota plant sits atop the same formation that would be used to sequester carbon by Summit. This year, Gevo’s been pumping the carbon from that plant underground and selling carbon credits to other companies that want to offset their carbon footprint. Sequestering carbon also lowers an ethanol plant’s carbon score, so Gevo can sell it for more in some areas.

Gruber said the company can also sell carbon to fossil fuel companies in North Dakota’s oilfields for use in enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas underground to force more crude oil toward a well.

“We did good by buying that plant,” Gruber told Searchlight.

Summit, meanwhile, is in limbo. Gov. Rhoden signed a bill banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies this year. Eminent domain is the legal process by which land access can be obtained for use in projects that benefit the public, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. The specter of eminent domain sparked landowner opposition, litigation and political activism in South Dakota, leading to the ban.

The Public Utilities Commission denied Summit’s permit application twice, but the company vowed to reapply.

Issue splits governor candidates

On Thursday, Rhoden said he’s glad to hear that Gevo may still build in South Dakota. He also said signing the eminent domain ban for carbon pipelines was the right thing to do in response to citizen concerns, and that Summit has a chance to “reset” its plans and work with landowners.

Rhoden has not announced if he’ll be a candidate to keep his job in 2026, but he’s spent much of his first year in office on an “Open for Opportunity” tour to meet business leaders across the state.

South Dakota Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, was the first Republican to announce his intention to run for governor. He’s been among the loudest opponents of the carbon pipeline.

Hansen said he’s not saddened to hear about Gevo’s shift to North Dakota. He pointed to a $12.2 million tax rebate authorized for Gevo by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development in 2023 and said companies ought to be able to thrive in South Dakota without incentives.

“This is yet another example of what I’ve been fighting against: politicians and bureaucrats in the Governor’s Office of Economic Development getting duped by green-energy and other scams — abusing so-called ‘economic development’ programs to hand out our tax dollars to out-of-state corporations.”

Hansen said South Dakotans “want our money back,” and that “corporate welfare waste” would end if he were elected governor.

Gruber said Friday, however, that Gevo never used its tax rebate, because it was predicated on building the Net Zero-1. Since that hasn’t happened, “we have not taken any money from South Dakota.” Josie Harms, Rhoden’s spokeswoman, confirmed that Gevo hasn’t collected any state money, and that it has paid sales taxes on anything it purchased in South Dakota to prepare the site.

Nothing has been done to the land for about two years.

Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

Another Republican candidate for governor, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, also leaned in on opposition to publicly funded economic development incentives in his statement on Gevo. He said companies that want to locate in South Dakota should “share our values” and be able to “succeed without politicians putting their fingers on the scale.”

“As governor, I will attract businesses, large and small, who will come here on fair terms,” Doeden said in a statement. “Businesses that move here should do so on their own two feet without demanding hundreds of millions in state subsidies or abusing residents in the process.”

Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who’s also declared his candidacy for governor in 2026, has talked recently about wanting to make South Dakota’s business climate more friendly again. This week, he sent out a press release on a “Data Centers Done Right” initiative, which he said would incentivize their placement in South Dakota and make the state “be a national leader in the AI revolution.”

Hansen and Doeden each responded to that announcement by saying they’re opposed to tax breaks.

Johnson, in a statement on the Gevo situation, said anti-development attitudes are the reason the state lost ground in the latest iteration of CNBC’s “America’s Top States for Business” rankings.

“Unfortunately, this isn’t the only project looking to leave South Dakota,” Johnson wrote. “Our state has slid down the rankings to the 35th best state for business. South Dakota has many strengths, but if we are going to meet our potential, we’ll need vision and a plan.”

Robert Arnold, the only declared Democratic candidate for governor, said South Dakotans have made their feelings on the carbon pipeline clear. But he also said he’d like to see Gevo follow through and build in South Dakota.

“I hope that we haven’t turned this industry completely away from us and we can negotiate a deal down the road,” Arnold said in a statement.

Lake Preston anticipated loss

Lake Preston Mayor Donna Bumann said pipeline opposition wasn’t an issue in her community.

“For the farmers in our area that Summit has connected with, it’s been quite positive,” Bumann said. “I realize that’s not the same in other areas.”

Gevo trumpets cash on hand, growth potential for sustainable jet fuel in earnings call

Bumann said her community had embraced Gevo and the benefits its proposed jet fuel plant promised. In a presentation offered to investors last year, the company included a slide that said Net Zero-1 would return $170 million annually to the South Dakota economy, create 1,300 short-term and 100 long-term jobs, partner with universities to promote science education and draw graduates to its operations, and pay area farmers a premium for corn.

“We are hopeful that, in due time, circumstances will make it possible for Gevo to move forward,” Bumann said.

Kingsbury County Commission Chairman Kyle Lee wasn’t surprised by the news, either.

“Once the state said that they weren’t going to allow for Summit to do any eminent domain, I think we knew that was going to end up being the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Lee said.

Net Zero-1’s footprint would’ve included an ethanol plant, a plant to turn that ethanol into jet fuel, and a wind farm proposed by a company called Zero6. It also spurred East River Electric Cooperative to invest in a switching station near the Gevo site, meant to help service the company’s power needs.

This month, however, Zero6 pulled its application for interconnection from the Southwest Power Pool’s queue. The Southwest Power Pool manages the wholesale power market for the central U.S.

Chris Studer of East River Electric said the cooperative will still build its switching station and use it to serve existing customers.

“We weren’t just building lines to serve Gevo,” Studer said, but he added that the upgrades will ready the area for any large-scale industrial project that might come along.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gevo-1-e1683764863266.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 01:56:08.709546

Are we seeing a broader crystallisation phase for the IP Group portfolio?","IP Group PLC (LSE:IPO) CEO Greg Smith joined Proactive to discuss the company’s strategic outlook, recent exits, and high-potential investments.

Topics include future royalty streams from obesity drug programs, portfolio realisations, and IP Group’s backing of clean tech innovator OXCCU.

Here, we take a closer look at what was said.

Proactive: Greg, very good to speak with you this morning. With Pfizer acquiring Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, how meaningful could future royalty income from these obesity drug programs be for IP Group?

Greg Smith: This is quite an interesting development. So this is something that we spoke a little bit about at our half-year results. As a part of our business, we have some patents that we license and manage, and this is one of those examples. I think the announcement that Pfizer was acquiring Metsera has shone an additional light on this area of our business — something we feel has been a little bit overlooked by the market.

So we felt it deserved a bit of an update in the spirit of our commitment to transparency. Pfizer is paying almost $5 billion upfront to acquire Metsera and its anti-obesity drug programs. It’s interesting for IP Group because we are the licensor of the fundamental underlying technology behind their lead compounds and a number of others. If those compounds successfully progress through phase two, phase three, and reach the market, then we could benefit from some quite substantial royalties on drug sales. So it's a significant potential source of future value for IP Group and its shareholders.

Proactive: Metsera’s lead drug is heading into phase three next year. When might IP Group realistically start seeing milestone payments or royalties from this pipeline?

Greg Smith: Interestingly, Metsera recently said they’re accelerating the timetable due to strong progress. They’re targeting getting the phase three trial up and running by the end of this year, which is good news. Analyst forecasts suggest first sales might come in 2029 or 2030.

The majority of our value would come once sales begin, so 2029, 2030 and beyond. It’s worth pointing out these compounds were produced by Professor Stephen Bloom at Imperial College London. Back in 1996, his team discovered that GLP-1 suppresses appetite, laying the groundwork for these therapies. So it’s a high-quality source, which is why we're particularly excited about this opportunity.

This is a very big market, and the drugs have the potential to impact hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of patients. It’s another great example of how IP Group backs developments that target big markets with human impact and significant financial return potential.

Proactive: Does this potential royalty stream change how you think about IP Group's growth model — from being an early-stage investor to holding longer-term revenue interests in late-stage assets?

Greg Smith: It’s an interesting question. It could be of such magnitude over time that we need to think about how we articulate this in our strategy and monetisation plans for shareholders. Ongoing long-term revenue streams fit well with the long-term business model we have at IP Group. It’s one of the benefits of having a permanent capital vehicle that can invest over the long term and grow businesses to material value.

Proactive: It's been a busy period for IP Group. You announced three successful exits recently, including the sale of Monolith to Nasdaq-listed CoreWeave. Are we seeing a broader crystallisation phase for the IP Group portfolio?

Greg Smith: You probably remember that 2022 and 2023 were tough years for the venture market. Last year, we bucked the trend with good progress on realisations — around £160 million in 2024. That included major exits like Featurespace to Visa and Garrison Technology to Everfox.

There’s increasing confidence within IP Group that our portfolio is maturing and attractive for exits, especially in areas suitable for M&A. The CoreWeave exit is another example of the portfolio’s quality. It probably wasn’t a company many shareholders knew about, yet we delivered a strong financial result.

At our full-year results, we said we’re confident in achieving over £250 million in realisations from our private portfolio between 2025 and 2027. This is another positive sign in that direction.

Proactive: Greg, you're also investing £4 million into OXCCU as part of a broader fundraising. Encouraging to see your portfolio getting lots of third-party interest?

Greg Smith: Yes. Exits are the end of the line — that’s where we recycle capital into buybacks or reinvest in the next generation of value-creating companies.

OXCCU is one of those. They’ve just closed a $28 million funding round. What’s interesting is the breadth and depth of investors — including Safran Corporate Ventures and International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent of British Airways. Also involved were other clean tech investors like Clean Energy Ventures from the US.

It’s great to be in a financial position to support this business into its next growth stage. They're based in Oxford and have their proving plant on Oxford Airfield. Many airlines are now committing to including SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) in their fuel mix by 2030, 2040 and 2050.

IAG said they want 10% of their fuel mix to be SAF by 2030 — and that’s not far off. So this investment helps them meet that commitment. The regulatory and industry drivers suggest a bright future for OXCCU. It’s a great example of a British company tackling global problems and attracting strong specialist investment.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzEwXC8yMDI1LTEwLTE3LTE2LTEyLTEwLTE5MDE1ZThjMjcyMjA1YWQxMDhkYWUzYzIyZjMwNWY4LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-10-18 10:56:48.360530

Finally, we provide eco-travel tips and explain key flight information to guide travelers in sustainable exploration.

Air France, Delta, Lufthansa, and United Airlines Lead Sustainable Travel Efforts

In the past, the aviation sector has played a major role in contributing to worldwide emissions, but there are changes to consider in the hopes of eco-friendly customers. The primary carriers in the field recognize the need to introduce effective emissions mitigation plans and put them into action. Market players such as Air France, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, and United Airlines developed new and creative methods to minimize the levels of embedded emissions. For these carriers, the levels of embedded emissions are likely to decrease annually, as they use biofuels and other Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) frameworks and engage in various approaches to carbon offsetting.

Air France’s Commitment to Sustainable Aviation

Air France, the leading airline to put SAF into action, shows the impact positive measures can take on the climate, shifting to a more innovative and greener approach. Air France predicted to use more than 43,953 of SAF in 2024 and decrease 150,000 CO2 emissions. This shows Air France’s will and determination in the airline’s promise to climate mitigation greenery. It shows advancement to the projected 2030 10% of the Air France global fuel mix use SAF as a carbon mitigation strategy blend while increasing the positive aviation climate impact. Air France loophole travelers use greener methods and minimized the impact of their carbon footprint.

Delta Airlines Sustainablity Initiatives

Lufthansa is also focused on decreasing carbon emissions and the use of sustainable aviation fuels. In 2024, this airline saved 71,952 tonnes of CO₂ emissions. In the upcoming years, this airline plans to release 200 new, more sustainable planes that are expected to enter the aviation industry by 2030. This signifies that passengers flying with this airline, can enjoy their trip and green travel without sacrificing their safety and comfort.#### United Airlines’ Green Aircraft Program

United Airlines also is also becoming environmentally sustainable. In 2024, United blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with regular jet fuel. United plans to have net-zero emissions by 2050. Other investments to improve sustainability with green technologies include aircraft. Passengers traveling with United can relax knowing that the airline is cutting down the carbon footprint.

France Urges World Bank to Stick to Climate Finance Goals

The airline industry is becoming more sustainable and the hospitality industry is also just starting to become more sustainable. Much more on the global scale still needs to be done to prioritize investments focused on climate change. France is one of the global climate change leaders.

France’s Advocacy for Climate Finance

Despite some countries–including the United States–pressuring the World Bank to no longer provide climate finance, France has actively been encouraging the World Bank to continue. France endorses the World Bank’s new target of 45% of climate finance as an improvement from the previous 35%. Since the consequences of climate change are worse than they have ever been, France believes that climate finance is necessary so developing countries can make a more sustainable transition.

The Role of the Hospitality Industry in Sustainability

As the airline industry works towards a more sustainable future, so is a part of the hospitality industry. Major hotel chains such as Marriott, Accor Hotels, and Hilton are trying to lessen their impact on the environment by implementing energy-efficiency, conserving water, and waste reduction. For travelers in search of more environmentally friendly accommodations, these hotel chains are leading the way with their green building certifications and commitment to build more sustainable hotels.

Marriott Hotels: In 2024, Marriott started a new sustainability program aimed at cutting down on water and energy used at all of its hotels and resorts worldwide. Marriott is also going green-moving waste and responsibly sourcing materials. People looking for a greener stay will feel good about eco-friendly options with a stay at Marriott.

Accor Hotels: Since releasing a new sustainability plan, aimed at an overall 30% reduction in carbon emissions expected to be completed by 2030. Several eco-friendly initiatives have begun with solar power, new energy efficient appliances, and promoting sustainable tourist packages for visitors.

Hilton Hotels: Hilton is also doing the same. It is also doing the same by decreasing their negative impact on… waste reduction—in this case, a water saving plan. Eco-conscious stays would be informed through eco-positive stays.

Travel Tips for Eco-Friendly Tourism

The encouraging impact on sustainability within the global tourism sector must be mirrored by travelers. The following travel tips help close the gap to minimize one’s negative (carbon) footprint.

Pick Sustainable Airlines and Flights

To lower your carbon footprint, fly with airlines that use sustainable aviation fuel and participate in carbon offset programs. Air France, Delta, Lufthansa, and United Airlines have made strides in decreasing their emissions and improving sustainability in aviation, so these are the airlines to fly with.

Stay in Eco-Friendly Hotels

When making reservations, look for hotels that focus on sustainability. The Marriott, Accor, and Hilton chains focus on eco-friendly practices, such as making use of energy-saving bulbs, conserving water, and reducing waste. These hotels help support the green initiatives of the sustanability of the hospitality industry.

Take Public Transport and Walk

When you reach your destination, use public transportation or walk instead of renting a car. Many cities have great transit options, including electric buses and eco-friendly metro systems that have a lower environmental cost than private vehicles. By choosing these options, you can greatly lower the emissions of your trip.

Bring Only What You Need

When you carry too much luggage, it will increase the weight of the airplane, and it will need more fuel. While traveling, you should try and pack the bare minimum! Using a carry-on bag will help keep your luggage and the weight of your flight down. Also, you should always choose digital tickets and mobile boarding passes to conserve paper.

What Tourists Need to Know About Sustainable Travel in France

France is a wonderful place to visit. From the streets of Paris to the French Riviera, it is full of stunning and diverse places. There is something for everyone, and this is part of the reason France is one of the most popular places to travel in the world. Tourists should also keep in mind France’s growing concerns about overtourism and it’s negative environmental impacts.

Best Time to Visit France

The best opportunity to visit France is during the spring (April to June) or fall (September to October) because these months allow for comfortable temperatures. The crowds dwindle, and the ambiance is calmer, which is perfect for sustainable tourism. The peak tourist months are the summer months, where the tourism centers are overcrowded- for instance the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower.

Visit the Underrated Areas

By all means, feel free to visit the Eiffel Tower and Palace of Versailles, but do also visit the less crowded tourist areas. The Loire Valley, Provence, and Alsace are perfect for this because these areas provide a genuine, crowd-free experience of France and alleviate environmental stress on the key attractions.

Stay at Eco-Friendly Hotels

As I mentioned, you can reduce your carbon footprint by staying at eco-friendly hotels such as those belonging to the Accor Group, Marriott, and Hilton. Most of these hotels are recognized with “green certifications”- a clear sign that they responsibly carry out their operations.

Air France, Delta, Lufthansa, and United Airlines are leading the way in sustainable travel, embracing eco-friendly practices to reduce their carbon footprint. As France urges the World Bank to uphold climate finance goals, the airline and hospitality industries are joining forces to create greener travel experiences for tourists worldwide.

For All Passengers, the Future is Sustainable Travel

With the global focus on climate change, the airlines and hospitality sectors are the first to respond to the challenges of sustainability. Emission reductions and the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies by Air France, Delta, Lufthansa, and United Airlines creates confidence among travelers that their flights support the efforts of building a more sustainable future.

Simultaneously, France’s support of climate finance initiatives at the World Bank enables developing nations to receive the funds necessary to mitigate climate change. With the increase in the popularity and ease of access to sustainable travel, this is the perfect time for travelers to engage in eco-friendly behaviors. Flying with a sustainable airline and booking with a green hotel positively impacts the future of travel.

China has approved another three biofuel refiners to export sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by issuing them quotas, according to trade sources and a Chinese consultancy, a move that could see exports to Europe increase.

While Europe, the world’s second-largest aviation fuel market, has yet to set a mandate for the usage of greener fuel, Chinese biofuel firms are building more SAF plants and targeting the continent as a top export destination. China’s Ministry of Commerce, which is responsible for quota issues, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Shandong Haike Chemical, Shandong Sanju Bioenergy and Bain Capital-backed EcoCeres were awarded export quotas for a total of 788,000-828,000 metric tons a year, according to three industry and trade sources, and Chinese commodities consultancy JLC in a report.

Shandong Sanju Bioenergy was allotted around 158,000 tons and Shandong Haike Chemical 370,000 tons, while EcoCeres received 260,000-300,000 tons of export permits, the sources and JLC said.

This brings the total amount of SAF quotas issued so far in 2025 to around 1.2 million tons, including the first such permits allotted to Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech.

It is not compulsory for the new recipients to fully utilise the allotted permits by the end of 2025, according to the JLC report, but it is also unclear if the companies need to re-apply for quotas next year.
