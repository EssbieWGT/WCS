Assessing India’s Readiness for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The feasibility study, carried out under ICAO’s ACT-SAF Programme, examines the potential for producing and utilising drop-in SAF within India. Key areas of assessment include domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, necessary infrastructure, and policy readiness.

By integrating global best practices with India’s unique socio-economic and environmental context, the report outlines a strategic roadmap to establish a robust domestic SAF market.

A two-day workshop accompanying the launch brought together stakeholders from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), industry participants, and multiple government departments, demonstrating a unified whole-of-government approach towards sustainable aviation development.

Government Commitment and Strategic Targets

Union Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu highlighted SAF’s crucial role in decarbonising India’s aviation sector. The Minister stated, “SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonise the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO2 emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional fuel”.

He reiterated India’s ambitious blending targets - aiming for 1percent SAF blending by 2027, 2 percent by 2028, and 5 percent by 2030 - in line with the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) mandate.

The Minister pointed to India’s abundant biomass resources, including over 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, to meet its domestic SAF demand and even emerge as an exporter.

Milestones and Economic Benefits

Naidu commended critical progress made so far, such as the designation of COTECNA Inspection India as the country’s first SAF certification body and the certification of Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery as India’s first SAF producer.

He underscored that SAF production will contribute significantly to reducing India’s crude oil imports and cutting emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually.

88 Airports Transitioned to Green Energy Usage

Secretary of Civil Aviation Samir Kumar Sinha highlighted that India operates one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient aircraft fleets globally and that 88 airports have transitioned entirely to green energy usage, setting exemplary standards.

Director General of Civil Aviation Faiz Ahmed noted that India is currently the world’s third-largest aviation market, with passenger traffic expected to double to 500 million by 2030. He lauded the SAF Feasibility Study as a critical tool that will provide strategic insights necessary to shape India’s national SAF policy framework, ensuring aviation growth aligns with sustainability goals.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/09/03/sustainable-aviation-fuel-a-practical-solution-to-decarbonise-the-aviation-sector-goi-2025-09-03-16-21-52.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 00:56:09.815126

The announcement was made during the 10th Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) held in Vladivostok from September 3–6, Caliber.Az reports via Russian media.

The company said its proprietary technology relies on synthesising complex esters from renewable organic feedstock using hydrogen. The resulting biocomponents are comparable to conventional aviation fuel in performance while offering improved environmental characteristics.

“This new fuel is aimed at reducing the aviation sector’s environmental impact,” the company stated. Development was carried out by specialists at Gazprom Neft’s Industrial Innovation Technology Center in Saint Petersburg.

Levan Kadagidze, Head of Gazprom Neft’s Commercial Department, noted that the next steps include laboratory and bench testing of the SAF fuel at leading aviation institutes across Russia.

Alaska Air Group is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as “ALK.”","As visitors to Maui step outside Kahului Airport to begin their vacation, they’ll be greeted by hundreds of potted trees lining courtyards, baggage claim and walkways. The young mango, plumeria, ʻulu, puakenikeni and dozens of other plant varieties are part of a large initiative to revegetate properties in Lahaina, Kula and other neighborhoods that were devasted by the 2023 wildfires.

This week, 20 Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines volunteers potted 80 more trees that are now lining the lawn outside the airport’s TSA checkpoint. Hawaiian Airlines also announced a new $30,000 donation to Treecovery Hawai‘i, adding to its previous $50,000 foundation grant to the Maui nonprofit behind the tree-growing effort on the Valley Isle. Once matured, trees will be transported and gifted to families and businesses impacted by fires that destroyed over 20,000 trees in Lahaina and 300 acres in Kula.

Kahului Airport is among the latest of 28 grow hubs Treecovery has sprouted from Hāna to Kapalua, half of which were created in partnership with resorts. Treecovery also has an operation in Kapalua that serves as a grow hub, educational space for kamaʻāina, and a site to host corporate groups that want to help pot trees, and a farm within the 25-acre Hua Momona Farms and Foundation to support residents facing food insecurity. Additionally, the group works with the Lahaina Restoration Foundation and Moku‘ula and Mokuhinia to provide native Hawaiian trees at all the historic locations in Lahaina.

To raise funds, Treecovery accepts donations and has partnered with artists, including Dale Zarella, who is carving burned logs, and ukulele-maker Steve Grimes, with half of sales proceeds benefiting the nonprofit.

The need for trees is growing as communities rebuild. As of last week, 55 new homes have been completed, with 486 building permits issued and hundreds more being processed by the county, according to Maui Recovery. Treecovery recommends planting trees once projects are finished, and Murasako said trees have been delivered to 20 homes so far. Residents are encouraged to apply to receive trees. They can also request native Hawaiian trees managed by the University of Hawaiʻi Maui College School of Agriculture.

The project was under development by Shell Nederland Raffinaderij B.V., a subsidiary of Shell plc. As originally planned, the facility would have the capacity to produce 820,000 metric tons per year of SAF and renewable diesel.

Shell announced in September 2021 a final investment decision on the project and construction began the following year. At that time, the biorefinery was expected to begin operations in 2024. In July 2024, Shell announced it was pausing on-site construction “to address project delivery and ensure future competitiveness given current market conditions.”

Following an in-depth commercial and technical evaluation to reassess the project’s competitiveness, Shell on Sept.3 announced it will no longer proceed with the project.

“As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products,” said Machteld de Haan, downstream, renewables and energy solutions president at Shell. “This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritize our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders”

“We continue to believe that low carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system,” De Haan added. “Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world's largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).”

Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with Shell and Portland International Airport (PDX), has taken delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into the PDX fuel system, marking the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at PDX. This achievement not only expands Delta’s SAF footprint but positions PDX – owned and operated by the Port of Portland – to capitalize on the continued growth of SAF across the U.S.

The batch of more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF was made in the U.S. from waste-derived feedstock. Shell supplied the neat SAF shipment to Zenith Terminal in Portland where it was blended with traditional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements, then delivered to PDX via barge, truck and pipeline. Earlier this month, the blended SAF entered the airport’s privately owned fuel supply system.

“Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel,” said Charlotte Lollar, Delta’s SAF director. “By working with Shell and the Port of Portland to tap into existing infrastructure, we’re able to access SAF at more airports and continue to prove its viability and ultimately scale it in a way the industry needs.”

“We're excited about this step toward bringing Sustainable Aviation Fuel to PDX. It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities,” said Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger. “We're looking forward to working with our partners to make sure state and local policies support development of the infrastructure and market needed to bring SAF here on a larger scale – and unlock all of the health and environmental benefits it offers.”

Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland. Delta is also working at the federal level and across key states to advocate for continued and new government incentives that will increase production, improve cost-competitiveness and make SAF more accessible at scale. In 2022, Oregon U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, then Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, championed enactment of the first federal SAF incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and creating the current fuel-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. 40B and 45Z provided the initial policy frameworks for state level incentives emerging across the country and 45Z was extended by the U.S. Congress this year through 2029.

The bill, which would legalize E15 immediately upon the governor’s signature, now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for final approval. California is the only state in the nation that does not currently allow the sale of E15.

“With today’s passage of AB30, California is taking a big step toward lower gas prices and a cleaner, more sustainable future for families across the state,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. “Many other states have already seen the benefits of E15—healthier air, better engine performance, and cost savings at the pump. Now, California drivers are on the cusp of experiencing those same advantages, and we urge Gov. Newsom to sign the bill into law as quickly as possible. E15 will provide relief at the pump for Californians who continue to face the highest gas prices in the country.”

Cooper continued, “We applaud the California legislature for swiftly passing this critical bill, and we especially thank the bipartisan California Problem Solvers Caucus for bringing awareness and attention to this issue. AB30’s sponsors, Assemblymembers David Alvarez and Heath Flora, also deserve special recognition for their leadership in opening the California marketplace to more affordable, cleaner fuel options.”

“California’s regulatory agencies have reviewed the E15 gasoline blend for nearly eight years and have yet to issue any rulings,” said Assemblymember Alvarez. “This unnecessary holdup has prevented California’s drivers from accessing a cleaner, more affordable fuel option that’s already approved across the country. AB 30 sends a clear message: Californians cannot afford to wait while bureaucracy stalls progress. This bill delivers economic benefits to Californians struggling with high fuel prices, and I am especially grateful to the Problem Solvers Caucus for their partnership on this commonsense solution.”

Recent studies show E15 could save California drivers $2.7 billion annually, or $200 per household, and significantly cut the emissions of tailpipe pollutants that create smog and contribute to illness and disease.

Gov. Newsom has expressed his support for legalizing E15, saying last year that “there is massive potential for this [E15] to be a win-win for Californians: lowering gas prices by up to twenty cents per gallon while keeping our air clean.”

RFA has been leading the effort to secure E15 approval in California for the past seven years, Cooper noted, beginning with the 2018 initiation of a “multimedia evaluation” of E15 in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and other ethanol industry stakeholders. While California’s recently finalized 2025-2026 state budget includes funding for CARB to complete the E15 approval process, AB30 allows the fuel to be sold while CARB’s work progresses.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/1438/1000/Calif+roads.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 18:56:58.736621

SAF is an alternative jet fuel made from renewable sources that can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by more than 80%, when compared to conventional jet fuel' + drupalSettings.data.extlink.extLabel + '. Existing jet fuel infrastructure can be leveraged to deliver SAF to airports today, and it is safe to use in current aircraft engines. However, the technology to produce it remains nascent, so it is expensive and not widely available. In fact, there is not enough SAF in production today to fuel the world's airlines for a single week. This is why the work to scale SAF and bring it to new markets, like Portland, is so important.

Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland. Delta is also working at the federal level and across key states to advocate for continued and new government incentives that will increase production, improve cost-competitiveness and make SAF more accessible at scale. In 2022, Oregon U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, then Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, championed enactment of the first federal SAF incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and creating the current fuel-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. 40B and 45Z provided the initial policy frameworks for state level incentives emerging across the country and 45Z was extended by the U.S. Congress this year through 2029.

This delivery represents the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at PDX, building on Delta’s broader SAF strategy, which includes previous deliveries to hubs like Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) and Detroit (DTW). This milestone also reflects the airline’s ongoing efforts to expand SAF availability and prove its repeatability and scalability across diverse airport systems.

Delta maintains a strong and growing presence in Oregon, underscored by the airline’s strategic operations at Portland International Airport (PDX). From PDX, Delta offers Oregonians nonstop service to nearly all of Delta’s hub airports, providing customers with more than 300 one-stop destinations. With nearly 4,500 employees based in the Pacific Northwest, Delta is committed to making a difference in the communities where we live, work and serve through our partnerships with key local and national community engagement organizations.",https://news.delta.com/sites/default/files/styles/twitter_share_1200/public/2023-08/jmzvtyxn_xp1b1l4i_h264_8128k.mp4.00_02_36_07.still012.jpg?itok=0vwByq2F,N,,2025-09-03 18:57:03.909781

Undertaken under the ICAO ACT-SAF Program, the feasibility study assesses the potential for producing and utilizing drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in India. It evaluates domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, infrastructure and policy readiness and the enabling conditions needed to establish a robust domestic SAF market.

Drawing upon international best practices and tailoring them to India’s socio-economic and environmental context, the report provides a roadmap for sustainable fuel adoption.

The study is being deliberated at a two-day workshop at Udaan Bhawan, New Delhi, with participation from ICAO, EASA, DGCA, industry partners, and multiple government departments, reflecting a whole-of-government approach towards SAF.

Welcoming stakeholders to this landmark event, the Minister underscored SAF’s critical role in advancing India’s sustainable aviation growth. He reaffirmed India’s readiness to become self-sufficient in SAF production, targeting 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in line with the CORSIA mandate.

The Minister stated, “SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonize the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional fuel”.

He further highlighted that with over 750 million metric tons of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tons of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter.

Shri Ram Mohan Naidu pointed to important milestones already achieved, including the designation of COTECNA Inspection India Pvt. Ltd. as the country’s first SAF certification body and the certification of Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery as India’s first SAF producer.

The Minister emphasized that SAF production will not only reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tons annually, but also boost farmers’ incomes by creating a strong value chain for agricultural residue and biomass.

“Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India is on track to become the world’s largest domestic aviation market. With a collaborative approach, we are committed to positioning India as a leader in green aviation”, Minister Shri Ram Mohan Naidu added.

The Secretary underlined that global warming is a collective challenge and mitigating its impact is a shared responsibility. He reiterated India’s commitment to the UNFCCC framework and emphasized that India already operates one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient aircraft fleets in the world. He also noted that 88 airports have already transitioned to 100% green energy usage, setting benchmarks for global best practices.

Starting with a feasibility study, the companies have formalized a dedicated spin-off structure to accelerate the development of this innovative route based on Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) technology — a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based production routes.

For Moeve, this initiative represents a strategic step forward in developing a differentiated route to e-SAF, distinct from the Fischer-Tropsch pathway. The process enables to convert e-methanol into e-SAF through the production of sustainable olefins. This pathway offers synergies such as economy of scale and a flexible approach to scaling low-carbon aviation fuels, a crucial need given that aviation contributes approximately 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions globally. Advancing such alternatives is essential to decarbonizing one of the hardest-to-abate sectors.

At the same time, sustainable olefins serve as essential intermediates for a broad range of low-carbon chemical applications, including polymers and materials used in packaging, mobility, consumer goods, and industrial sectors.

“This initiative marks a strategic step forward in Moeve’s ambition to lead the development of new low-carbon value chains,” said Carlos Barrasa, Executive Vice President of Commercial and Clean Energies at Moeve. “By advancing sustainable methanol-based pathways, we are enabling the future production of e-SAF while also supporting the transformation of the chemical industry through cleaner feedstocks. The Global Impact Coalition provides the collaborative platform and vision needed to drive these breakthrough innovations at scale.”

Charlie Tan, CEO of the Global Impact Coalition, said: “This spin-off exemplifies the power of cross-industry collaboration to advance low-carbon chemicals and sustainable aviation fuel. We are uniting leading companies like Moeve around a shared vision for sustainable methanol-based feedstock, setting a precedent for how industrial transformation can be achieved at scale.”

Now operating as a spin-off from the Global Impact Coalition, the project continues its feasibility study, which is set to run through late 2026. This phase will assess the technical and economic potential of building a first-of-its-kind sustainable olefins production facility in Europe, leveraging MTO as a next-generation process for low-carbon industrial transformation.

With Europe’s chemical sector facing structural challenges — including high energy costs and increasing regulatory pressure — the development of innovative, low-carbon industrial assets offers a timely opportunity to modernize production and regain industrial competitiveness. Simultaneously, as the global green methanol market is set to triple by 2030, this initiative is positioned to benefit from emerging sustainable methanol markets worldwide.

Faced with weak market conditions, the company last year suspended construction of the renewables biofuel factory in Rotterdam that was intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and diesel from waste.

“As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive,” Machteld de Haan, Shell’s downstream, renewables and energy solutions president, said in a statement.

The project was first announced in 2021 as part of plans to help Europe meet internationally binding emissions reduction targets.

Shell and rival UK energy giant BP have been walking back various climate objectives and focusing more on oil and gas to raise their profits, which has drawn criticism from environmental activists.

More than half of the facility’s capacity was intended to produce SAF — a biofuel made from plant and animal materials like cooking oil and fat which produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel.

Under plans to tackle climate change, the EU requires airlines to gradually increase the amount of SAF they use to power planes.

Airlines, however, complain that SAF is not widely available and too expensive.

— Charlie Tan, CEO of the Global Impact Coalition

GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, September 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Global Impact Coalition (GIC), a CEO-led coalition committed to advancing a circular, net-zero future for the chemical value chain, announces the launch of a dedicated spin-off structure to advance its Sustainable Olefins project. Starting with a feasibility study, this marks the first step toward exploring a new methanol-based route to electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) and low-carbon chemicals in Europe.

A group of GIC member companies have joined forces to evaluate the technical and economic potential of using methanol-to-olefins (MTO) technology as a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based production processes. The group will assess the viability of converting sustainable methanol into olefins, the essential building blocks of fuels and advanced materials. The newly formed spin-off structure is designed to facilitate deeper collaboration, explore investment, and prepare the groundwork for potential project development.

“Transforming how we produce essential building blocks like olefins is key to reducing emissions in the chemical sector and related value chains, such as aviation” said Charlie Tan, CEO of the Global Impact Coalition. “The announcement today signals the growing momentum toward transforming the global chemical sector at a time when new technologies are urgently needed to meet climate and business goals.”

By converting sustainable methanol into sustainable olefins, the MTO approach offers a scalable, electrifiable alternative to conventional steam cracking. Sustainable olefins are essential to manufacturing low-carbon polymers and materials used in packaging, mobility, consumer goods, and industrial applications. Utilizing e-methanol, the MTO process enables the production of e-SAF, offering a flexible, scalable pathway to decarbonizing one of the hardest-to-abate sectors: aviation.

As demand for low-emission feedstocks rises and regulatory drivers—such as recycled content requirements, sustainable material mandates, and SAF targets—increase, the market for sustainable olefins is poised for rapid growth. With the global green methanol market expected to triple by 2030, this spin-off is well positioned to benefit from the rise of sustainable methanol.

Shell won't restart construction of a Rotterdam biofuels facility, as the global market for the fuel faces a yearslong slump.

The British energy giant said Wednesday that it conducted a commercial and technical evaluation and deemed the project no longer competitive.

""It became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers' need for affordable, low-carbon products,"" Machteld de Haan, president of Shell's downstream, renewables and energy division, said.

Shell took a $780 million impairment when it temporarily paused on-site construction work at the energy and chemicals park--expected to become one of the largest in Europe--in July 2024. It started the project in 2022 and green-lit it a year prior.

Before construction was halted, the Rotterdam biofuels facility was expected to produce 820,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste.

The move comes after Shell rival BP halted two biofuel projects and scaled back plans on others last year, amid rising competition from new imports, particularly from China. Sweden and Finland's decisions to reduce the minimum threshold for renewable-fuel concentration in fuel or heating oil also contributed to the glut of biofuels.

Shell said it invested 6.5 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in energy-transition projects in the Netherlands over the past few years, including a renewable-hydrogen plant and a carbon-dioxide storage project.

Naidu was speaking at the release of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Feasibility study for India, which assesses the potential for producing and utilizing drop-in SAF. He welcomed the stakeholders, and underscored SAF’s critical role in advancing India’s sustainable aviation growth.

“SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonize the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional fuel,” an official release quoted the minister as saying.

The study was prepared by the Ministry of Civil Aviation in association with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and with support from the European Union.

Meanwhile, the study is being deliberated at a two-day workshop at Udaan Bhawan, New Delhi, with participation from ICAO, EASA, DGCA, industry partners, and multiple government departments, reflecting a whole-of-government approach towards SAF.

Naidu reaffirmed India’s readiness to become self-sufficient in SAF production, targeting 1 percent blending by 2027, 2 percent by 2028 and 5 percent by 2030 in line with the CORSIA mandate.

The study evaluates domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, infrastructure and policy readiness and the enabling conditions needed to establish a robust domestic SAF market.

Drawing upon international best practices and tailoring them to India’s socio-economic and environmental context, the report provides a roadmap for sustainable fuel adoption.

The minister further highlighted that with over 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter.

Naidu pointed to important milestones already achieved, including the designation of COTECNA Inspection India Pvt. Ltd. as the country’s first SAF certification body and the certification of Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery as India’s first SAF producer.

Overcoming production barriers The most significant obstacles to large-scale SAF production stem from both supply constraints and economic factors.
Financing SAF To lower SAF costs, the aviation industry must develop a full value chain approach — from feedstock sourcing through production to offtake agreements.
This model attracts infrastructure-style investors who can provide capital at lower costs, essential to scaling the industry.
Government subsidies and support also play a pivotal role, not only through mandates but also via fuel production incentives and funding for technology development.","As the aviation industry races toward ambitious net-zero emissions goals by 2050, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) stands at the forefront of decarbonising air travel. Yet, despite its promise, SAF currently accounts for less than 1 percent of global jet fuel demand, with steep cost premiums and production challenges limiting widespread adoption.

Overcoming production barriers

The most significant obstacles to large-scale SAF production stem from both supply constraints and economic factors. “SAF currently makes up less than 1 percent of global jet fuel demand,” Roland Berger, the global management consultancy firm, explained, underscoring how early the market still is. The cost disparity remains stark, with SAF priced four to five times higher than conventional jet fuel, deterring broad uptake.

The predominant SAF pathway today, Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), is relatively cost-effective but faces scalability limits due to finite sustainable feedstocks. “HEFA is the most cost effective today, but faces scalability challenges because of limited availability of sustainable feedstocks,” the company continued. Emerging technologies like Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and other advanced pathways show promise for greater scalability but are burdened with high production and technology costs, slowing commercialisation.

The inconsistent global policy environment compounds these challenges. While regions such as Europe have strong mandates like ReFuelEU driving SAF uptake, others, notably the U.S., lack federal mandates, creating a fragmented market landscape.

Airlines have a critical role in breaking through these barriers. “Partnering with suppliers and exploring appropriate contracting frameworks is essential,” the source explained. Airlines can adjust contract structures to longer timeframes — 10 years or more — which helps de-risk long-term capital projects for producers. Fixed-price contracts, rather than pricing tied to fluctuating Jet-A fuel costs plus premiums, provide revenue certainty, encouraging more investment.

Strategic co-investment also plays a vital role. “By investing into production, airlines can secure offtake volumes and reduce capital costs,” the consultancy outlined. Additionally, airlines can facilitate collaboration among infrastructure and debt investors, alongside regulators, to accelerate technology readiness and bring down costs for advanced SAF pathways.

Financing SAF

To lower SAF costs, the aviation industry must develop a full value chain approach — from feedstock sourcing through production to offtake agreements. “The key to lowering SAF costs is to build and invest across the full supply chain and pair this with long-term fixed price contracts,” the organisation laid out . This model attracts infrastructure-style investors who can provide capital at lower costs, essential to scaling the industry.

Increasing certainty across the supply chain reduces overall production costs. “Ideally, these arrangements should be shareable to clearly showcase the strength of the demand signal.”

Investment returns vary by project stage. Airlines can invest in early-stage projects, targeting levered internal rates of return (IRRs) similar to other growth equity investments. Projects nearing final investment decisions, where construction and offtake are more secure, typically target lower returns similar to other infrastructure investments to reflect the lower risk. Fully operating assets with contracted offtake represent the lowest risk and thus lower IRR thresholds. Airlines can also invest in complementary infrastructure, such as blending and delivery systems, with variable returns.

Such involvement is not without risk, but it also offers airlines an opportunity to influence production scalability directly. “Increasing stability and certainty to offtake chains helps bring down costs,” the firm stated, highlighting the importance of equity stakes and long-term contracts.

Global strategies

With SAF pricing and policy support varying widely by geography, airlines must leverage their networks and procurement mechanisms like book-and-claim systems to optimise costs. “In Europe, ReFuelEU mandates blending, which leads to higher SAF prices, whereas US incentives reduce local production costs, resulting in lower price premiums,” Roland Berger expressed.

European airlines face geographic constraints under regional mandates, limiting book-and-claim use to some extent. Yet, book-and-claim systems are effective for exceeding mandatory blending targets through voluntary commitments, enabling airlines to leverage corporate willingness to pay for emissions abatement. Airlines can also source SAF from regions with cost advantages and apply those credits toward compliance with global frameworks like CORSIA.

Innovative procurement strategies are proving vital in securing supply and lowering risk. Early in the SAF market, consortia such as SAFUG helped airlines commit volumes and align sustainability standards. “Initiatives like SABA have pushed market education and voluntary SAF adoption by connecting corporate customers with SAF certificate providers,” the organisation said. These platforms have promoted book-and-claim systems that decouple environmental attributes from physical fuel delivery, helping close the cost gap for voluntary demand.

Contract structures also matter. Traditional short-term deals with floating prices are giving way to longer-term fixed-price contracts with risk-sharing mechanisms linked to incentives like those in the U.S. “Some contracts include price collars with floors and ceilings, easing project financing risks,” they noted. Equity deals represent the highest form of risk sharing, attracting more generalist investors and de-risking the sector.

Together, these innovations strengthen supply chains and offer airlines tools to manage price volatility. Hedging strategies, including contracts pegged to power prices for PtL or ethanol futures for alcohol-to-jet pathways, are gaining traction and expected to evolve as the market matures.

Scaling SAF

The path to scaling SAF sustainably without eroding airline profitability involves several integrated steps. Reducing production costs through technological innovation and economies of scale is fundamental. “This includes lowering electrolyser costs, expanding renewables, and improving bio-feedstock availability,” the firm said. Government subsidies and support also play a pivotal role, not only through mandates but also via fuel production incentives and funding for technology development.

Airlines, in turn, must secure scalable production by backing advanced technologies and accessing low-cost capital. They need to send strong demand signals with long-term contracts and equity stakes, monetise SAF through differentiated customer offerings, and leverage global policy frameworks to approach cost parity with conventional fuels. Risk management through structured contracts and financial tools is essential.

This multifaceted strategy ensures SAF moves from a niche sustainability solution toward becoming a mainstream, financially viable fuel — a vital step if aviation is to meet its net-zero commitments by mid-century.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Page-12-shutterstock_2438041735-copy-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 12:56:57.539682

The aviation industry is in the midst of an important transformation. With rising global awareness around climate change, airlines are seeking ways to balance growth in air travel with the urgent need to reduce emissions. Hawaiian Airlines has now taken a meaningful step by introducing sustainable aviation fuel on selected flights between Osaka and Honolulu.

This initiative is not only about meeting regulatory expectations but also about reshaping the way passengers view long-haul international travel. By embedding sustainability into their daily operations, airlines are signaling a future where flying responsibly becomes the new norm.

Hawaiian Airlines Introduces SAF on Osaka to Honolulu Flights

On August 29, 2025, Hawaiian Airlines announced the integration of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into its daily flights connecting Osaka-Kansai International Airport and Honolulu. The arrangement has been made possible through a partnership between its parent company, Alaska Air Group, and Cosmo Oil Marketing, a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings.

The first deliveries have already begun at Kansai International Airport, fueling Hawaiian’s Airbus A330 aircraft. For the airline, this marks a milestone moment, as it is the first time SAF has been included in its fuel operations. According to the airline, SAF can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared with conventional jet fuel.

Why Japan Matters in This Move

Japan has long been a critical international market for Hawaiian Airlines. The daily service between Honolulu and Osaka supports not only tourism but also cultural and business exchanges between Japan and Hawai‘i.

In comments accompanying the announcement, Alanna James, Sustainability Innovation Director at Hawaiian Airlines, expressed appreciation for Cosmo Oil’s commitment to developing locally sourced SAF. This local connection is vital, as it demonstrates how sustainability efforts can be woven into regional supply chains, reducing dependency on imported fuels and creating new economic opportunities.

Building a Sustainable Supply Chain in Japan

The SAF being supplied under this agreement has its origins in a Japanese government-backed program. In 2021, Cosmo Oil Marketing received support from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to create a supply chain model for SAF production. The chosen feedstock is used cooking oil, collected from households and businesses across Japan.

What makes this initiative remarkable is the circular economy element. By transforming everyday waste into aviation fuel, the program not only addresses carbon emissions but also promotes responsible resource use. It sends a strong message that sustainability is not just about new technologies but also about rethinking how existing materials are managed and repurposed.

Certified for a Cleaner Future

The SAF supplied to Hawaiian Airlines will carry ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU certifications, confirming compliance with international sustainability and carbon reduction standards. These certifications ensure transparency and accountability, making it clear that the fuel is not just greener in name but also in practice.

Cosmo Energy Group’s facility will become the first in Japan to mass-produce SAF, creating a blueprint for other countries to follow. Partnerships like these highlight the importance of both innovation and collaboration in meeting global climate goals.

Voices from the Collaboration

The partnership has been welcomed with optimism by both Hawaiian Airlines and Cosmo Oil Marketing.

Naoki Takayama, President of Cosmo Oil Marketing, noted that SAF is a key decarbonization tool for aviation. He emphasized the company’s commitment to helping build a decarbonized society, with this agreement serving as a starting point for broader adoption of SAF in Japan and beyond.

Hawaiian Airlines echoed this sentiment, reiterating its ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. This long-term commitment is supported by a multi-pronged strategy that includes SAF adoption, technological innovation, and modernizing its aircraft fleet.

The Broader Picture of Sustainable Aviation

This development is part of a larger movement in aviation. Airlines across the world are testing, investing, and scaling SAF as one of the most viable solutions to decarbonize flight operations. Unlike experimental fuels, SAF can already be used in existing aircraft with minimal modification, making it a practical option for rapid deployment.

By selecting a key route such as Osaka to Honolulu for its first SAF operations, Hawaiian Airlines is showing that sustainability can align with commercial viability. This route carries a mix of leisure travelers, business passengers, and cultural exchange visitors, many of whom are increasingly conscious about the environmental footprint of their journeys.

Toward a Net-Zero Ambition

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines, both with histories spanning more than 90 years, are using this initiative as an opportunity to reinforce their values. Their joint statement highlighted a shared mission of connecting communities while safeguarding the environment.

The commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 places both carriers ahead of many industry peers. It sets an example for how airlines can simultaneously focus on growth and responsibility, balancing commercial goals with environmental stewardship.

A Glimpse Into the Passenger Experience

While the technical aspects of SAF adoption are critical, there is also a human dimension. Travelers booking Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka to Honolulu flights can now feel assured that their journey is contributing to a greener planet. Although the shift may seem subtle today, it builds momentum for a future where environmentally responsible choices are seamlessly built into the travel experience.

The airline’s Airbus A330 aircraft on this route can carry 278 passengers. Every flight powered partly by SAF represents not just reduced emissions but also a step toward normalizing sustainability in aviation.

Conclusion

The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel on Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka to Honolulu flights is more than a technical upgrade. It is a statement of intent, a sign of collaboration across industries and nations, and a step toward reshaping air travel into a force for positive environmental change.

As the aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its impact, stories like this provide hope. They show that progress is possible when airlines, governments, and energy providers work together to unlock solutions. The journey toward net-zero aviation is far from complete, but initiatives such as this highlight the path forward.

India is currently the world’s third-largest aviation market, with passenger traffic set to double to 500 million by 2030. Naidu shared that India aims to become self-reliant in SAF production, having the target set for 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in line with the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) mandate. CORSIA is a market-based mechanism to achieve carbon-neutrality in aviation developed by ICAO.

“India is on track to become the world’s largest domestic aviation market. With a collaborative approach, we are committed to positioning India as a leader in green aviation,” Naidu added.

The feasibility study examines India’s potential for producing SAF, by assessing the availability of domestic feedstock, and feasible production pathways. The study also seeks to evaluate preparedness of infrastructure and policy.

The study was prepared by Ministry of Civil Aviation and International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO.) The study was commissioned by European Union as part of the ICAO’s Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) programme.

Under this series, the EU is conducting a total of 16 studies, of which India is a part of. The other countries where the study was conducted included Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote D’Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, and Ethiopia.

The India feasibility study started in November last year, and according to the ministry, the prepared report will be discussed at a two-day workshop at Udaan Bhawan, New Delhi, with participation key stakeholders including representatives from ICAO, EASA, DGCA, industry partners, and multiple government departments.

Naidu shared that the COTECNA Inspection India Pvt. Ltd. has been designated as India’s first SAF certification body. Additionally, Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery has been certified as the country’s first SAF producer.","https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india/2025-05-15/islgv8wx/Kinjarapu-Ram-Mohan-Naidu.jpeg?rect=0,46,1975,1037&w=1200&ar=40:21&auto=format,compress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100",N,,2025-09-03 08:56:47.560955

It said at the time that SAF could make up more than half of the plant’s output, with the rest being renewable diesel, made from used cooking oil, waste animal fat and other industrial and agricultural residual products. It also planned to use sustainable vegetable oils, given a shortage of suitable waste feedstocks.

De Haan said: “We continue to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system. Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel.”

Shell said that last year it “traded over 10 billion litres of low carbon fuels and sold ten times more than we produced”, becoming “one of the world’s leading suppliers of SAF” with almost a fifth of total sales in North America and Europe.

However, Sawan had already sounded the alarm over the economics of SAF. He said earlier this year that the take-up of SAF in the aviation industry was less than 0.1 per cent and its growth would depend on government action.

“The reality is that SAF is more expensive and therefore unless there are mandates — obligations on either customers or airlines — it is difficult to see a penetration that is going to be massive,” he said, warning that “airlines will not simply erode their bottom lines for the sake of it”.

Shell’s net carbon intensity

Also, in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI), which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.

Shell’s net-zero emissions target

Shell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period, respectively, and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly, the outlook reflects our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio, efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.

Forward-Looking non-GAAP measures

This announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.

Ram Mohan Naidu has announced, reports The Hindu businessline.

SAF, which is made from renewable sources or waste, is seen as a key step toward greener aviation.

Naidu said India has a natural advantage in this sector. “Our location gives us the chance to become an exporter, and we also have plenty of raw material available,” he noted.

Currently, India has more than 750 million metric tonnes of biomass and around 230 million metric tonnes of surplus farm residue.

“India has the potential to be a global leader in SAF production,” the Minister said, adding that the country could produce more than its domestic demand and emerge as a major exporter.

He also pointed out that the SAF industry could create 1.1 to 1.4 million jobs across the value chain, reduce India’s crude oil import bill by $5–7 million every year, and raise farmers’ income by 10–15 per cent through the use of crop residue.

Naidu said India’s skilled workforce and strong manufacturing base would make SAF more affordable compared to other regions. But he admitted that pricing remains a challenge.

“Right now, SAF is costlier than normal jet fuel. To make it cheaper, we need to increase production,” he explained.

Industry estimates show that SAF costs two to six times more than conventional jet fuel. Still, Naidu highlighted strong demand within India, driven by the fast-growing aviation sector. The country’s refining capacity also allows it to export half of its aviation turbine fuel production.

SAF is expected to play a key role in meeting India’s future fuel needs. Aviation turbine fuel demand is likely to rise to 15–16 million tonnes by 2030, and nearly double by 2040.

“SAF is an essential part of our strategy to make aviation sustainable. It offers a practical solution to cut emissions right now,” Naidu said.

The upcoming SAF policy will also draw from a feasibility study carried out by the Centre along with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

SAF is an important part of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). India has not joined its voluntary phase (2021–2026), but Indian carriers will need to comply with offset requirements from 2027.

The government plans to start with a one per cent SAF blend in jet fuel in 2027, increase it to two per cent in 2028, and reach five per cent by 2030.

Indian Oil Corporation recently received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery—an important step toward large-scale production, certification, and distribution.

However, industry experts say the lack of supporting infrastructure and ecosystem makes SAF production costly. Large investments are needed to set up facilities, but financing remains limited, especially in the early stages.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-09-03 08:57:16.724993

The move to scrap the project in Rotterdam marks another setback for its biofuel designs, after the company cancelled a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project on Singapore’s Bukom Island in March 2023.

It comes amid a wider shift away from renewable energy projects in the oil and gas sector as fossil fuel companies pursue higher profits.

In March last year Shell watered down a key emissions target, setting out a plan to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade compared with its previous goal of 20%.

Shell began construction of the plant in Rotterdam in the Netherlands in 2021, initially expecting to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels, with plans to bring it online in April 2024. This was later pushed back to 2025.

Machteld de Haan, the company’s head of downstream, renewables and energy solutions, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders.”

She added that the company continued “to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system” and that Shell was “one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel”.

Biomass, agricultural residue and used cooking oil are among the key feedstocks that can be tapped for production of SAF, which can be used as a drop-in fuel for aircraft.

The civil aviation ministry in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and with support from the European Union have prepared an SAF feasibility study for India.

The study assesses the potential for producing and utilising drop-in SAF in India. It evaluates domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, infrastructure and policy readiness and the enabling conditions needed to establish a robust domestic SAF market, the ministry said in a release on Wednesday.

Drawing upon international best practices and tailoring them to India's socio-economic and environmental context, the report provides a roadmap for sustainable fuel adoption, it added.

The study was undertaken under the ICAO's Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels programme (ACT-SAF) initiative.

""With over 750 million metric tonne of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonne of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter,"" he said.

The minister also said that SAF production will not only reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually but also boost farmers' incomes by creating a strong value chain for agricultural residue and biomass.

Ashley Kelty, a leading analyst at Panmure Liberum, said it was “another nail in the ideological coffin for SAF and biofuels”.
Britain alone consumes about 11m tonnes of aviation fuel a year and emissions soared to 37m tonnes in 2024 – more than double the 16m tonnes seen in 1990.
That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.
Despite the decision, Shell said it remained committed to a low-carbon future.","Shell has abandoned plans to build a biofuels factory in the Netherlands, dealing a blow to Europe’s hopes of decarbonising the aviation industry.

The oil giant has scrapped the project after pausing work on the site last July, with a review concluding that the plant was too expensive and “insufficiently competitive”.

Under its proposals, the plant in Rotterdam was designed to be one of Europe’s biggest converters of waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel.

The decision to axe construction will pose a significant challenge for Europe as it seeks to reduce the environmental impact of flying.

It also marks the latest step in Shell’s shift away from net zero, as the company scales back green investment to focus more on oil and gas.

Ashley Kelty, a leading analyst at Panmure Liberum, said it was “another nail in the ideological coffin for SAF and biofuels”.

He said: “It means that SAF is going to be more expensive, limited in supply and therefore difficult for airlines to justify using.”

The take-up of green jet fuel – which is produced from waste materials such as used cooking oil – has struggled in recent years amid faltering production, which has kept prices high.

Machteld de Haan, Shell’s downstream, renewables and energy solutions president, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders.”

It marks a considerable turnaround for Shell, which only announced the biofuels project in 2021.

At the time, the company said it was transforming 14 oil refineries into five low-carbon energy sites to meet growing demand from the transport sector.

This formed part of a target to “reduce the production of traditional fuels by 55pc by 2030 and provide more low-carbon fuels such as biofuels for road transport and aviation, and hydrogen”.

However, these targets have been dashed as part of a pivot away from renewables, posing a problem for Europe’s airlines.

Aviation is the most climate‑intensive form of transport and its growth means its emissions have been growing faster than any other mode of transport.

Britain alone consumes about 11m tonnes of aviation fuel a year and emissions soared to 37m tonnes in 2024 – more than double the 16m tonnes seen in 1990.

That is set to grow even faster in the next two decades.

The UK Government has attempted to reverse this by ordering airlines to use 10pc of SAF by 2030.

However this requirement, also in effect across Europe, requires a network of refineries which are not yet materialising.

Shell’s decision to abandon the Rotterdam project is just the latest of several such schemes to fail.

In 2022, Boris Johnson – the prime minister at the time – announced a new policy known as “jet zero” to enforce a minimum threshold of green fuel use.

He also pledged the construction of a minimum of five new SAF plants, which have not been built.

It means the only company making SAF in the UK is the Phillips 66 refinery on Humberside in North Lincolnshire – and its output is just 20,000 tonnes a year.

That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.

Despite the decision, Shell said it remained committed to a low-carbon future.

Ms de Haan said: “We continue to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system. Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including SAF.”

Its bio-based subsidiary BBGI (Bio-Based Green Innovation) announced a THB 2 billion (USD 61.6 million) investment in developing bio-LNG. The company is also partnering with government agencies to explore the production of algae-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Turning wastewater into renewable with lower-carbon bio-LNG

Amid global decarbonization efforts, Bangchak sees growing demand for biofuels. BBGI plans to use wastewater generated from its ethanol and methyl ester production processes, converting it into biogas through anaerobic fermentation before refining it into bio-LNG. Compared with fossil-based LNG, bio-LNG has a smaller carbon footprint.

According to BBGI CEO and President Daechapon Lersuwanaroj, the company will source wastewater and solid residues from ethanol plants in Kanchanaburi and Khon Kaen. “This marks a significant step towards advancing the use of renewable energy from wastewater,” he said.

BBGI’s partners include Singapore’s Keppel Corporation and waste-to-energy firm CleanEdge Resources. The company initially planned to supply bio-LNG as marine fuel for Keppel’s fleet, but due to the long lead time and engine technology upgrades required for fuel switching, BBGI is pivoting toward power generation instead—using bio-LNG to produce renewable electricity.

Daechapon added that data center operators, given their energy-intensive operations, have also expressed interest in bio-LNG. BBGI’s bio-LNG facility is slated to begin operations in 2027, with a planned output of 100 tons per day.

Expanding biofuels to meet shipping and aviation needs

While BBGI’s new plant will not supply marine fuel, Thailand’s government has been pushing major players to scale up biofuel solutions. Both Bangchak and state-owned PTT are actively developing Bio-VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil) to support the shipping sector in meeting IMO decarbonization targets.

In addition, BBGI signed an MoU with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) on Sept. 2 to jointly study algae-based SAF. Testing will be conducted at Bangchak’s Phra Khanong refinery in Bangkok. Microalgae and other algae strains are rich in lipids, which can be refined into biofuels.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1756888072163019293.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 08:58:43.687003

Faced with weak market conditions, the company last year suspended construction of the renewables biofuel factory in Rotterdam that was intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and diesel from waste.

""As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive,"" Machteld de Haan, Shell's downstream, renewables and energy solutions president, said in a statement.

The project was first announced in 2021 as part of plans to help Europe meet internationally binding emissions reduction targets.

Shell and rival UK energy giant BP have been walking back various climate objectives and focusing more on oil and gas to raise their profits, which has drawn criticism from environmental activists.

More than half of the facility's capacity was intended to produce SAF -- a biofuel made from plant and animal materials like cooking oil and fat which produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel.

Under plans to tackle climate change, the EU requires airlines to gradually increase the amount of SAF they use to power planes.

Airlines, however, complain that SAF is not widely available and too expensive.

Shell warned investors last year that its second-quarter had suffered a significant write-down owing to the shelved project.

The meeting, chaired by civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu, was attended by aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha, ICAO representatives, DGCA officials, oil companies and representatives from Boeing and Airbus.

Policy framework and blending targets

Officials told Hindustan Times that the workshop will help shape a policy framework and implementation steps to ensure India meets its SAF blending targets. These include 1 per cent of total fuel for international flights by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030.

Indian Oil’s Panipat refinery has already been certified as the country’s first SAF producer, with production expected to begin by the end of the year.

“The workshop is expected to finalise policy and implementation steps, ensuring India meets its SAF blending targets while reducing crude oil imports by an estimated $5–7 billion annually and boosting farmer incomes through the use of crop residue,” an official said.

Growth and supply potential

India’s aviation sector carried 240 million passengers in 2024, with numbers projected to double by 2030. Fuel consumption is expected to reach 16 million tonnes by 2030 and 31 million tonnes by 2040.

Officials said SAF could play a central role in balancing aviation growth with emissions reduction, with potential lifecycle emission cuts of up to 80 per cent.

Advt

“India is well positioned to become a global leader in SAF, because of its large agricultural base, availability of surplus biomass and strong refining capacity. Estimates suggest India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2040, more than domestic demand, opening export opportunities and creating up to 1.4 million green jobs,” another official said.

Wider decarbonisation efforts

At present, 88 airports in India run entirely on green energy. Bengaluru airport holds the highest level of global carbon accreditation, while Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad airports are carbon neutral.

Advt

Alongside SAF, India is also pursuing green hydrogen initiatives. Cochin airport has set up what it says is the world’s first airport-based hydrogen production facility, and companies including NTPC and Indian Oil Corporation are working on large-scale SAF and hydrogen projects.

An off-take agreement is an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer’s upcoming goods.","Given its share of greenhouse gas emissions, decarbonising the aviation industry is considered vital in the long-term transition to net zero and achieving the goal of limiting the increase in global warming to 1.5% above pre-industrial levels as per the Paris Agreement. One of the key ways to achieve this is through making eco-friendly aviation fuel alternatives more viable. Piper Alderman’s client is a key partner in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance (SAFFA), a joint venture with major airline carriers. SAFFA’s goal is to accelerate the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by investing in projects that are technologically mature and commercially viable. Our client specialises in financial advisory and capital raising services within the financial sector.

Piper Alderman acted for our client in relation to the establishment of a private equity fund for SAF. Each investor in the fund entered into an off-take agreement from the project refinery for the supply of aviation fuel. An off-take agreement is an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer’s upcoming goods.

One of Australia’s major airline carriers, represented by Minter Ellison, was the lead negotiator for the terms of the off-take. The investment by this carrier and the other airlines, and the negotiations of the various off-take arrangements, raised a number of complex competition law issues. This is primarily because it is illegal for businesses to make contracts, arrangements or understandings that substantially lessen competition. There is potential for Limited Partnership Agreements and Off-take Allocation Agreements, such as those used in the SAFFA, to be scrutinised under competition laws to ensure they don’t unfairly restrict competition or harm consumers.

Piper Alderman reviewed and provided competition law advice in relation to the Limited Partnership Agreement and the Off-take Allocation Agreement. Given that the investors in the fund were airline competitors, we had to ensure that the arrangements set out in the agreements did not breach the cartel conduct provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act. The agreements therefore needed to be drafted within the exceptions to the cartel conduct provisions.

The SAFFA fund made its first investment in April 2024 in US-based technology company Crysalis Biosciences, which aims to renew chemical manufacturing infrastructure with innovative fuel and chemical production technologies. The investment was only made after the parties were comfortable that all competition law risks had been successfully addressed.",https://piperalderman.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/corporate-banner.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 07:56:11.443500

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, Iowa Biodiesel Board, and Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship have spoken out to commend her leadership in renewable fuels.

Ernst has served in the U.S. Senate since 2015 and is the first female combat veteran to serve in the chamber. Ernst currently serves on several Senate committees, including the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; the Subcommittee on Conservation, Forestry, Natural Resources and Biotechnology; and is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development, Energy and Credit. Over the past decade, Ernst has championed numerous renewable fuel initiatives, including those related to E15 availability, biofuels infrastructure, renewable fuel tax incentives and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The IRFA honored her advocacy for agriculture. “From the Iowa Senate to U.S. Senate, Sen. Ernst has been a relentless champion for renewable fuels and farmers,” said Monte Shaw, executive director of the IRFA. “Her dedication to expanding access to renewable fuels and defending Iowa’s agricultural economy has made a real difference. Sen. Ernst was literally the tip of the spear in defending the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) from refinery exemptions and in pushing for year-round E15. However, it’s important to remember she’s not done yet. Congress must pass year-round E15 this year to provide farmers a lifeline during these difficult times. Plus, her recent bill to update fuel retailer compatibility standards could take years off of the transition to E15. On behalf of all IRFA members, I sincerely thank Senator Ernst for her service and wish her the best in her next chapter.”

The IBB stressed Ernst has left a lasting mark on biodiesel and rural Iowa. “We congratulate Senator Joni Ernst on her service in the Senate and express heartfelt appreciation for her unwavering support of biodiesel producers, soybean farmers and rural communities,” said Grant Kimberley, executive director of the IBB. “She has a deep understanding that homegrown clean fuels like biodiesel are vital to Iowa’s economy and American energy security, and her leadership has ensured that the voice of our industry was heard loud and clear in Washington.

“From fighting to uphold and grow the Renewable Fuel Standard to leading efforts on the critical federal biodiesel tax incentive, Senator Ernst consistently stood with rural Iowa,” he continued. “Her advocacy made a real difference for farmers, producers and consumers alike. She has helped safeguard markets for Iowa soybeans, defend rural jobs and champion cleaner air through greater use of renewable fuels. Those impacts will be felt long after her time in the Senate.

“While her departure closes a significant chapter, it also sets the stage for new leadership and renewed opportunity,” Kimberley added. “We are grateful for the foundation she helped build and we look forward to continuing our work with another key champion, Senator Chuck Grassley, as well as with Iowa’s next generation of senators to advance biodiesel as a solution.”

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig also praised Ernst’s for her work in agriculture. “Sen. Ernst has been a tireless advocate for Iowa, and a strong voice for our farmers, rural communities, and all who call this state home,” Naig said. “From expanding markets for biofuels to championing rural small businesses and fighting burdensome federal regulations, she has never stopped working to make sure Iowa’s values and priorities are heard in Washington.

While I’m sad to see her step away, I’m grateful for her service, her leadership, and her friendship, and I wish her the very best in her next chapter.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Ernst_Aug25_e517423b00.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 20:56:13.287659

In short, moisture content has a direct line to profitability and sustainability.

Yet for many biomass producers and power plants, moisture is still managed reactively through lab sampling, visual inspection, or outdated sensor technology. These legacy methods not only introduce costly delays but also fail to capture the rapid moisture variability typical of biomass feedstocks. As the bioenergy sector evolves, so too must its approach to moisture control.

The hidden costs of moisture mismanagement

Improper moisture levels in biomass feedstocks can undermine operational efficiency. If the material is too wet, combustion becomes incomplete, emissions rise, and calorific value plummets. The extra energy required to evaporate excess moisture during burning directly translates to higher fuel usage and operating costs. In pellet manufacturing, excess moisture compromises densification, leading to weak, crumbly pellets that underperform in both combustion and storage.

Conversely, biomass that’s too dry can be brittle, abrasive, and difficult to process. In pellet mills, variations of just 1% in moisture content can throw off amperage loads on main drives, forcing frequent recalibration and increasing equipment wear. When moisture varies by more than 3-5%, producing a consistent, durable pellet becomes nearly impossible.

Then there’s the matter of safety. Fine biomass particles with low moisture content are more prone to combustion and dust explosions. On the other end of the spectrum, sticky, wet biomass can cause clogs in conveyors and silos, risking unplanned downtime. The cumulative effect of these inefficiencies is significant: reduced yield, elevated maintenance, higher emissions, and increased capital spend.

Where and when moisture matters most

In biomass production, moisture monitoring is not a one and done task. It must occur at multiple points in the process, with the most critical stages including:

Incoming feedstock: Moisture content at the point of entry affects not only drying efficiency but also pricing and combustion value. Undetected high moisture biomass can lead to overpaying for material with less usable energy.

Before and after drying: Real time moisture feedback allows operators to dynamically adjust dryer temperatures and retention times. This minimizes fuel usage and helps prevent over drying, which can create dust, fines, and unnecessary mechanical strain.

Pre-pelletization: Precision is paramount at this final stage. Even a small deviation in moisture can dramatically alter pellet sheen, density, and durability. Properly calibrated in-line sensors ensure consistent output quality and reduce off-spec batches.

The ability to maintain moisture within optimal thresholds, typically 6–10% for wood pellets and under 20% for biomass combustion, can transform the economics of a facility. Operators gain tighter control over energy use, product quality, and equipment longevity.

Why traditional methods fall short

Despite the high stakes, many biomass operations still rely on periodic lab testing or operator intuition to assess moisture content. These methods are slow, inconsistent, and inherently reactive. Visual inspections, still surprisingly common in some facilities, are subjective and prone to human error. Manual sampling and lab testing, while more reliable, introduce significant time delays. By the time an out-of-spec moisture level is detected in the lab, large quantities of material may already be processed, stored, or shipped, leading to preventable waste or product rejection.

In an effort to modernize, some facilities use technologies such as radio frequency (RF), oven weight loss, or contact probes. While these offer incremental improvements over manual methods, they remain vulnerable to variability in biomass materials. For example, RF and probe systems often struggle to deliver consistent results when particle size, bulk density, or material color shifts. There are factors that fluctuate widely in wood chips, agricultural residues, or mixed biomass feedstocks. These technologies also tend to require frequent recalibration or maintenance, reducing uptime and operator confidence in the data they provide.

Traditional measurement approaches also fall short when it comes to scalability. Batch testing cannot deliver 100% product inspection or offer actionable, in-line feedback. Operators are left to extrapolate based on incomplete data, making it harder to fine tune drying cycles, control combustion conditions, or ensure consistency in final pellet quality.

In contrast, near-infrared (NIR) moisture sensors overcome these limitations through non-contact, continuous scanning. NIR analysis eliminates the need for collecting and drying samples, while also avoiding chemical exposure and labor intensive processing. By enabling real time measurement directly on conveyors, silos, or pellet presses, these sensors allow biomass producers to detect moisture variability instantly and adjust on the fly. The result is faster decision making, reduced waste, lower energy use, and more predictable product performance.

The solution lies in non-contact, near-infrared (NIR) technology that measures moisture continuously, unaffected by material heterogeneity or conveyance method. Instead of estimating trends, manufacturers can now see exactly what’s happening inside their processes, moment to moment. One company leading this transformation is MoistTech, global leader in moisture measurement and control, whose IR3000 series sensors are purpose built for industrial applications like biomass. These sensors provide real time, in-line moisture data using NIR technology that requires no contact with the material. With rugged design, one time calibration, and drift-free operation, the IR3000 excels in high dust, high vibration environments typical of pellet plants and biomass power stations.

Unlike older sensors that require frequent recalibration, MoistTech’s systems maintain consistent accuracy over time, helping operators act on reliable data without pausing production. Because the sensors are unaffected by changes in particle size, material flow height, or color, they deliver repeatable results across a wide variety of biomass feedstocks. More importantly, the sensors can be integrated at multiple points in the production line, before and after the dryer, on conveyors, or near the pellet press, to deliver a holistic view of moisture trends. When connected to plant control systems, they enable closed loop automation that responds instantly to moisture deviations, optimizing performance without manual intervention.

This level of insight does more than prevent spoilage or inefficiency. It helps facilities cut drying costs, reduce fire hazards, minimize emissions, and increase product consistency. In a market increasingly focused on ESG metrics, real time moisture control isn’t just a quality improvement, it’s a sustainability strategy.

A clear path to smarter operations

Biomass production is a balance between energy efficiency, equipment reliability, and product quality. Moisture is at the center of this balance. Variations in moisture content affect everything from grinding resistance to combustion emissions and pellet durability to electrical load on motors. Adopting continuous moisture monitoring through advanced NIR sensors transforms that challenge into an opportunity. Operators can eliminate guesswork, reduce energy consumption, streamline compliance, and boost throughput, all without increasing overhead.

Moisture management doesn’t have to be reactive. When monitored in real time, moisture becomes one of the most controllable, high impact variables in a biomass facility. And in an industry where margins are tight and expectations are high, that control is a serious advantage.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Moist_Tech_Sept251_34da6d1961.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 20:56:17.627856

EDMOND, OK, UNITED STATES, September 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Green Fuels Operating (GFO), a subsidiary of Clean Refineries Inc., and Eden Carbon Solutions Pty Ltd announced today a groundbreaking partnership that will transform how refineries convert carbon dioxide emissions into valuable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership grants GFO exclusive North American rights to Eden's proven carbon capture and synthesis technology, positioning the companies to revolutionize fuel production across the continent.

The partnership combines Clean Refineries’ Net-Zero Emissions Technology (NZET) with Eden's advanced CO₂-to-fuel conversion system, creating a revolutionary approach to sustainable fuel production.

The patented technology Eden utilizes operates through a three-stage process that captures and converts CO₂ into premium transportation fuels. The system uses Hot Potassium Carbonate (HPC) absorption technology—proven in hundreds of industrial installations—to capture over 95% of CO₂ emissions from flue gases at dramatically lower energy costs than traditional methods.

""Our technology captures carbon dioxide and converts it into high-performance fuels using hydrogen and precision-engineered chemical pathways—delivering a scalable, infrastructure-ready solution for deep decarbonization,"" explained Gavin Rodel, CEO of Eden Carbon Solutions. ""We capture CO₂ from any source—whether it’s our partner’s refinery or a nearby cement plant—and combine it with renewable hydrogen to create the building blocks for ultra-clean jet fuel.""

Clean Refineries’ NZET technology provides the ideal foundation for Eden integration. Unlike conventional refineries that boil oil at extreme temperatures over 1,000°F with massive energy requirements, NZET facilities use precision molecular separation in a low-temperature closed-loop, zero-toxic-emission design.

""The NZET system already achieves an unprecedented emission reduction compared to traditional refining,"" stated Derek Williamson, CEO of Green Fuels Operations. ""By integrating Eden's technology, we’re not just eliminating our remaining emissions—we’re becoming carbon sinks that actively remove CO₂ from the atmosphere while producing premium fuels.""

Consider a typical deployment: A 20,000 barrel-per-day NZET refinery integrated with Eden technology could process CO₂ from a nearby coal plant, converting what would be 2.2 million tons of annual emissions into approximately 220 million gallons of feedstock for high-value SAF production.

Market Transformation at Scale

With exclusive rights across Mexico, Canada, and the United States, the partnership addresses a massive market opportunity. North America's industrial sector emits over 6.8 billion tons of CO₂ annually, while airlines desperately seek sustainable fuel supplies to meet regulatory mandates and corporate commitments.

""This partnership doesn’t just solve one problem—it solves three,"" noted Williamson. ""We help heavy industry manage their carbon liabilities, provide airlines with certified sustainable fuel, and create a profitable new business model for refineries. It’s a true win-win-win scenario.""

Immediate Implementation Plans

The first integrated facilities are planned for development within 24 months, with sites under evaluation in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Alberta. Each location has been selected for proximity to both CO₂-intensive industries and aviation fuel markets, ensuring efficient aggregation and distribution.

Getting There Visitors to the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport will take the same exit off of Interstate 376 that they do now.
Future Growth at the Airport Beyond the new terminal project, Pittsburgh International Airport has its sights on several other innovations.","It all began with a scribble on the back of a receipt.

When Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis was discussing with other aviation leaders her dilemma about what to do about Pittsburgh’s way-too-big-and-outdated airport, Jeff Fegan, former CEO of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, had an idea.

He made the bold suggestion of moving the landside terminal building over to the airside terminal — making it one complex. Why do you need two buildings, connected by a half-mile tram? He illustrated his idea on the back of a restaurant receipt dated April 2, 2015.

“I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s a great idea,’” Cassotis recalled at the time. The scribble evolved into a rough blueprint for the $1.7 billion terminal that is on track to open this fall.

City and regional leaders see the new terminal as a way of reintroducing Pittsburgh to the world — and the city will get that opportunity in a big way next April, when the NFL Draft is expected to draw 700,000 to the Steel City.

“For us, from a travel perspective, the airport is oftentimes the very first impression and the very last impression that a lot of travel consumers have of the destination,” says Jared Bachar, president and CEO of VisitPittsburgh. “Travel is a $6.8 billion sector in Allegheny County alone, supporting 40,000 jobs. So having an airport that is world class, that is cutting edge, is absolutely critical to everything that we’re trying to do to continue to move in a direction of being hyper-competitive as a travel destination across the board.”

The design is quintessentially Pittsburgh. Signs are in black and gold. A pedestrian bridge and tunnel — patterned after the Fort Pitt Tunnel and Bridge — connects landside operations with the airside terminal. The undulating roof mirrors the region’s rolling hills. A larger and more comfortable meet-and-greet area at baggage claim acknowledges the charming habits of Pittsburghers who come inside to pick up their loved ones, friends and colleagues — a practice that Cassotis says is “rare” these days at airports. The restaurant and retail corridor is packed with local brands.

When the current terminal opened in 1992, The New York Times called it the “airport of the future.” It served as a model for other airports around the world. It also was built to be the largest connecting hub for US Airways; it was a place where 80% of travelers simply changed planes.

At its peak in the mid-’90s, the airport served 21 million passengers per year. But in 2004, as US Airways struggled through two bankruptcies, it abruptly canceled its lease for the hub.

That led to the loss of two-thirds of its passengers. And with that action, PIT became an origin-destination airport, meaning travelers flew out of Pittsburgh and returned to Pittsburgh. Now, about 10 million are using the airport each year; only 2% are switching planes.

The new 811,000-square-foot terminal, which broke ground in October 2021, is “right-sizing” and modernizing the airport for Pittsburgh’s future, airport officials say. By eliminating the half-mile tram that links the two terminals, passengers will be able to go from curb to gate in half the time it takes them now. And the airport will save $25 million a year in operating and maintenance costs, says Paul Hoback, chief development officer and executive vice president of the Allegheny County Airport Authority.

“The whole point was to redefine what it means to be an airport, and what it means to its community and to a global industry,” Cassotis told a group of international aviation leaders meeting at the new terminal in May.

The design of the new terminal, developed by Gensler + HDR in association with Luis Vidal + Architects, follows trends across the aviation industry: New terminals or airport spaces are bringing in more natural light and greenery and adding outdoor spaces. They’re creating sustainability, enhancing comfort and wellness and tailoring design, artwork and amenities to the specific city.

In a major preparation for the new terminal, a dress rehearsal of sorts will be held on Sept. 20 in which 2,000-2,500 volunteers will be testing all aspects of the airport. PIT hired Daniel Bryan, an industry consultant who has overseen similar tests at airports around the world, to lead the tests here. When PIT put out the call for volunteers in late June, it expected 3,000 to 4,000 people to respond; instead, 18,000 signed up. Bryan will be helping to select the volunteers who will best represent all types of travelers — families, those with disabilities, those who don’t have smartphones or aren’t technologically savvy, business folks and the leisure traveler.

The airport also has scheduled a Community Open House for the public from noon to 7 p.m. on Oct. 11 for people to explore at their own pace all aspects of the new terminal.

When opening day arrives, the switchover will occur during the few hours in the middle of the night between when the last flights of the previous day depart and arrive, at about 11 p.m,, or later, to when the first flights depart on opening day before dawn. The roads to the new terminal are finished, and new directional signs are up. Just a single strip of Jersey barriers needs to be moved to open up the new roadway to the new terminal.

Cassotis is confident the new terminal will be well-received.

“It’s going to work for the passengers,” she says. “It’s going to work for the people who work here. It’s going to work for the people who pick up and drop off. And it’s going to work for our partners.”

The Design

When PIT officials embarked on the terminal project, they brought in architectural teams with the aim of finding and building collaboration first before considering design.

“We wanted to find a firm that was going to be very collaborative — but also disruptive a little bit, and not avoid conflict because we believe conflict was something that could help elevate the design,” Hoback has said.

They selected a pair of global firms – Gensler + HDR and Luis Vidal + Architects.

The next step was getting them acquainted with the Steel City — to show them what made Pittsburgh Pittsburgh. Bill Flanagan, senior advisor for the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, took them on a bus ride around the city. They looked at the city skyline from Mount Washington; they walked through Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens; they toured the universities; they drove through neighborhoods.

The firms came up with a design theme based on their observations: Nature, Technology, Community — or NaTeCo.

You see nature in the steel columns shaped like trees that stretch to the ceiling in the departure area. You see it in the tall windows and wavy, wood-like ceiling (the panels are actually made of metal to look like wood; developers learned that the wood could warp) that bring in natural light, cutting down on the use of electricity. You see it in the constellation lighting. And you see it in other greenery and the four outside terraces.

Each of the terraces — two before the security checkpoint and two post-security — will be filled with native plants, walkways and benches. Rainwater will be collected and recirculated to water the landscaping, says Chad Willis, the authority’s vice president of planning, environmental and sustainability at PIT.

“The use of nature — natural light, ventilation, color, vegetation, outdoor activity — all those things are very rare in an airport, and this will be one of the very first airports in the world to take advantage of all these possibilities,” architect Luis Vidal said in an airport video.

Another aim of the design is to reduce travel stress. “We’re trying to reduce stressors and stimuli as much as possible,” Siri Betts-Sonstegard, senior vice president of experience and design for the airport authority, said on a recent tour of the new terminal.

“We can’t be a completely quiet airport, but we’re trying to reduce, [for example,] sound coming out of speakers — we put that into our concession agreements … We’re really creating a sense of calm, because we know [that] travel can be difficult.”

PM Managing Editor Sean Collier contributed to this report.

Ticketing & Security

The airline ticket counters are in the main lobby, where passengers enter the airport for departures. Each airline counter will have a lower section accessible to wheelchairs. Improved signage, lighting and design aim to help more quickly guide travelers through this area.

From there, travelers will follow signs or the constellation lighting in the ceiling to the security checkpoint. The distance between the individual lights in the ceiling narrows as they progress toward the checkpoint — serving as a decorative wayfinding tool.

There are 12 public Transportation Security Administration lanes (double the number of what’s in the main security area now), including lanes for TSA PreCheck, CLEAR and Priority boarding. The number of lanes dedicated to each will vary according to demand; there’s also an additional line exclusively for staff and airline employees.

With state-of-the-art scanning equipment, travelers no longer will have to remove phones, tablets, laptops or liquids, Hoback says. And, because of a change recently made by the TSA, they don’t have to remove their shoes, either.

Peak waiting times to get through the new TSA lanes have been estimated to be no more than 30 minutes, he says.

Once through security, passengers will walk 160 feet across a bridge and through a tunnel — which emulates the entrance to Downtown through the Fort Pitt tunnel — to get to the airside terminal, with its shops, restaurants and gates. A wall of video screens on each side of the bridge will present wayfinding information and more. Once passengers get through the tunnel, they’ll take escalators or elevators down to the center core of the airside terminal to the gates.

Checked baggage will be handled on the terminal’s ground floor, where robots will be assisting TSA agents in their inspections of suspicious bags and those that trigger alarms. Currently, the agents have to pick up a suspicious 50-pound bag, take it to another belt, open it, inspect it and then manually return it to another belt.

“We will have 41 robots in this airport that do all of that,” Hoback says. “The TSA agent will never have to lift up that bag, which is certainly a safety issue” and can cause back injuries for the agents. He added that PIT will be one of a handful of airports using robots in this way.

Getting There

Visitors to the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport will take the same exit off of Interstate 376 that they do now. They will enter the airport property on a similar horseshoe-shaped roadway as they do now — it will just go deeper into the property. And they’ll use the same exit out of the airport property as they do now.

In fact, passengers may not even notice much change as they use the new airport roadways —- and airport officials say that is by design.

Passengers will be directed by overhead signs to parking options (including a new garage, with more than 3,200 spaces for public parking — tripling the number of covered parking spaces currently at the airport), or to a double-decker bridge on the front of the terminal that will separate traffic into three levels. The top is for departures, like it is now. The middle is for arrivals, dedicating space to passenger pickup. The bottom level will be for all rideshares, taxies, vans and buses.

Gone will be the current confusion at the baggage-claim level, in which passenger pickup is on one side of the building and public transportation, rideshares and taxis are on the other.

Regarding parking, there now is a designated cell-phone lot where drivers can park at no cost while waiting to pick up arriving passengers. It will be near the entrance to the airport property and will be called the Free Wait Lot, where motorists can wait, for free, for up to an hour.

There are 2,800 spaces in the Terminal Lot, a surface lot next to the terminal, plus those in the new Terminal Garage. The garage will offer a “smart parking system” that will assist drivers in finding open spaces on the four floors of public parking. Travelers would walk to the terminal from these two areas. More parking will be available in the airport’s Shuttle lots, currently known as the long-term, extended and economy lots. From here, travelers must take shuttles (with new, bigger buses) to the terminal. The bus shelters will be heated, and buses have been upgraded to better accommodate those with disabilities.

Shopping & Dining

Over the last year, new stores have opened or expanded in the airside terminal. More are yet to come — in a combination of local businesses and national chains.

Many of the 15 new stores and restaurants being added were requested by local travelers and visitors. “We’ve listened to what our travelers wanted — a balance between showcasing not only our local brands, but also having the availability of unique and respected national and international brands,” says Travis McNichols, chief operations officer for the Allegheny County Airport Authority.

“We know many different types of travelers go through our airport every day, and we want to ensure that our offerings meet the needs of everyone that we serve.”

Even before the switch to the new terminal, these new retail and dining options opened their doors.

Hammer Made — A men’s clothing retailer founded in Minneapolis, Hammer Made has about 10 locations in malls and airports around the country. This location, the first in the Pittsburgh area, opened in July in Concourse B.

Duquesne Supply Co. — This Pittsburgh-centric gift shop carries such items as: locally made Tabbara Chocolates, Sarris candies, Pittsburgh Popcorn Co. products, Una Biologicals and Spectrum Fudge; mugs, shot glasses, keychains and more bearing “Pittsburghese” terms including “nebby” and “yinz”; hot sauces, OMG Pretzels and more.

Sambazon Acai Bowls — Found in many airports and universities around the country, this Brazilian-influenced chain offers acai bowls, smoothies and other healthy options.

Champion City Sports — This shop offers Steelers, Penguins and Pirates gear and memorabilia, an interactive sports simulator and all sorts of gifts. It also has collaborations with Build-A-Bear and Vera Bradley franchises.

MAC Cosmetics — A national cosmetic company, MAC also has counters at area Macy’s, Nordstrom and Ulta locations.

Jimmy John’s — A national sandwich-shop chain.

More stores and restaurants are due to open before the new terminal debuts, including the region’s second location of Shake Shack, a fast-casual restaurant based in New York. It is slated to open in the former McDonald’s spot in the center core in September.

Mineo’s Pizza, a Squirrel Hill institution, also will be in the center core. Two locally owned coffee chains are planned: Convive Coffee, which will be opening in Concourse A, and two locations of Wexford-based Cafe Conmigo, in the center core across from Sarris candies (opening in early September) and in the meet-and-greet area. Also in the center core will be Mi Casa Cantina, at the entrance of Concourse B; Bad Egg Breakfast Bar, a breakfast spot found in other airports; and Stack + Press Delicatessen.

The Gates

Seating in most areas has been upgraded to be more comfortable and to include in-seat device chargers. Original artwork also has been added to the gate areas.

Bathrooms along the concourses have been modernized or are undergoing improvements. In particular, stall doors are being changed to open out rather than in — to allow ample space inside for carry-on luggage. Each concourse will include a nursing room, as well as a bathroom with an adult changing table.

Presley’s Place, a 1,500-square-foot room that provides a quiet, peaceful spot for people with sensory sensibilities and their families, will remain near Gate A9. It opened in 2019 after a PIT heavy equipment operator dropped a comment in the CEO suggestion box asking the airport to provide a quiet place for children like his son, Presley, who has autism. The room is now serving as a model for other airports around the world.

Kidsport, a 2,100-square-foot aviation-themed play area for children, is being revamped in collaboration with the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh and will reopen in Concourse C.

Baggage Claim & Meeting Spaces

One of the major changes in the upgraded baggage system involves the distance the checked luggage will now travel from plane to baggage carousel — it’s being reduced from 8 miles to 3, Hoback says. The carousels also are larger.

Does that mean that the bags will be waiting for passengers as soon as they arrive at baggage claim? Not necessarily, Hoback says. Passengers will have a much shorter distance to walk from plane arrival to baggage claim — absent the tram ride — so they’ll get there in less time.

But there will be a circular bar, two outdoor terraces and other amenities at baggage claim to help pass the time. It’s part of the expanded meet-and-greet area, named Welcome Point, which addresses the “Community” part of the NaTeCo theme. Pittsburghers like to park their cars and go inside to wait for loved ones or friends rather than just picking them up at the curb, Hoback says.

“We want a place for families [or] business partners to be able to wait,” Cassotis says, “so they would have access to the landside terraces, free security, great views of the airfield.” She calls the practice of face-to-face meetings “lovely.”

From baggage claim, those seeking rental cars will head to the Customer Service Building out front. They’ll then walk through a covered pedestrian walkway to the parking garage, where the rental cars are parked to be picked up.

Art & Amenities

Pittsburghers will be pleased to see the return of the Alexander Calder mobile called “Pittsburgh,” which is now hanging in the atrium of the departures area. It had hung in the airside terminal since 1992 — and since 1959, at the older airport in Moon.

The piece, designed with paddle-like forms suspended on metal rods that rotate with air currents, won first place in the 1958 Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary Paintings and Sculpture (now known as the Carnegie International) at the Carnegie Museum of Art. After the exhibition, it was purchased by G. David Thompson, who donated it to Allegheny County; at times it traveled to exhibitions around the world, including to Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain. Calder, who was born outside of Harrisburg, died in 1976 at age 78 in New York City.

Three statues now greet travelers at the entrance of the landside terminal: George Washington, 19th-century investigative journalist and world traveler Nellie Bly and Pittsburgh Steelers legend Franco Harris. Harris definitely will be placed in the new terminal; at press time, officials were trying to figure out places for the other two. Still up in the air is whether there will be places for the replica of the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton (provided by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History) or Miss Pittsburgh, the restored Waco 9 airplane that made the first airmail flight from Pittsburgh to Cleveland.

The Hotel

The 11-story, 338-room Hyatt Regency is the only hotel on airport property, and it has been connected to the landside terminal via a peoplemover since it opened in 2000. It loses that connection once the new terminal opens.

A system of shuttles will run between the hotel and the new terminal. These are being paid for through a settlement reached on June 27 between the Allegheny County Airport Authority and owners of the Hyatt Regency. That settlement includes a payment of $152,000 to Hyatt Regency owners MCSW Penn Hospitality LLC the first year and increases in subsequent years to cover the costs.

Floor Plans

These are the floor plans of the departures and arrivals levels of the new landside terminal.

Future Growth at the Airport

Beyond the new terminal project, Pittsburgh International Airport has its sights on several other innovations.

It’s the first airport in the world to be solely powered by its own 23-megawatt microgrid with an on-site natural gas plant and a solar panel field that is being doubled in size. By 2027, it hopes to have more than 20,000 solar panels stretched over 20 acres of landfill property that can’t be used for any other purpose. When expanded, the solar field will produce 7.7 megawatts of power; 4.3 megawatts of that will supply energy to the regional electric grid, giving the community additional renewable energy.

In June, the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which owns and runs the airport, announced it is partnering with New Jersey-based Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel to develop the first on-airport sustainable aviation fuel production facility in the nation. Once built, the facility is expected to produce more than 100 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel each year to meet local and regional commercial and cargo needs at PIT and for other entities.

According to Avina’s press release, the plant — which will employ hundreds of full-time workers when it opens — will have a carbon intensity that is at least 65% lower than that of conventional jet fuel. It will use KBR’s PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology — developed and owned by Swedish Biofuels AB and licensed globally by KBR, which is headquartered in Houston.

Since 2019, the authority also has been developing Neighborhood 91, a 195-acre advanced manufacturing campus on the western end of the airport’s 8,800 acres. The Regional Industrial Development Corp. is handling property management and business attraction for the site.

Among the businesses opening on airport property near Neighborhood 91 (named to represent an extension of Pittsburgh’s 90 neighborhoods) is Mainspring Energy, a Menlo Park, California-based company that plans to produce 1,000 low-emissions linear power generators per year. Its 292,000-square-foot facility — slated to open in 2027 — is expected to employ 600 people.

At press time, airport officials had made no decision about what would happen to the current landside terminal — whether it would be reused for other purposes or torn down.

The airport also sees expansion in its cargo operations; the manufacturing companies at Neighborhood 91, for example, can benefit from their close proximity to cargo operations that can ship their products around the world, says Sara Innamorato, Allegheny County executive.

“They’ve been incredibly creative and innovative,” she says about the authority’s vision. “They have pushed the bounds of what that authority can do, and now it’s time for Allegheny County economic development to bring the right partners around the table to make sure that we can continue to build on that success and build out that campus to really put us on the map.

“There’s a lot of opportunity that is adjacent to the new terminal that is very exciting for the growth of our entire region.”",https://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/content/uploads/2025/09/q/y/tmp-arrivals-constellation-lightingwebp.jpeg,N,,2025-09-02 15:56:21.326272

EDMOND, OK, UNITED STATES, September 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Green Fuels Operating (GFO), a subsidiary of Clean Refineries Inc., and Eden Carbon Solutions Pty Ltd announced today a groundbreaking partnership that will transform how refineries convert carbon dioxide emissions into valuable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership grants GFO exclusive North American rights to Eden's proven carbon capture and synthesis technology, positioning the companies to revolutionize fuel production across the continent.

The partnership combines Clean Refineries’ Net-Zero Emissions Technology (NZET) with Eden's advanced CO₂-to-fuel conversion system, creating a revolutionary approach to sustainable fuel production.

The patented technology Eden utilizes operates through a three-stage process that captures and converts CO₂ into premium transportation fuels. The system uses Hot Potassium Carbonate (HPC) absorption technology—proven in hundreds of industrial installations—to capture over 95% of CO₂ emissions from flue gases at dramatically lower energy costs than traditional methods.

""Our technology captures carbon dioxide and converts it into high-performance fuels using hydrogen and precision-engineered chemical pathways—delivering a scalable, infrastructure-ready solution for deep decarbonization,"" explained Gavin Rodel, CEO of Eden Carbon Solutions. ""We capture CO₂ from any source—whether it’s our partner’s refinery or a nearby cement plant—and combine it with renewable hydrogen to create the building blocks for ultra-clean jet fuel.""

Clean Refineries’ NZET technology provides the ideal foundation for Eden integration. Unlike conventional refineries that boil oil at extreme temperatures over 1,000°F with massive energy requirements, NZET facilities use precision molecular separation in a low-temperature closed-loop, zero-toxic-emission design.

""The NZET system already achieves an unprecedented emission reduction compared to traditional refining,"" stated Derek Williamson, CEO of Green Fuels Operations. ""By integrating Eden's technology, we’re not just eliminating our remaining emissions—we’re becoming carbon sinks that actively remove CO₂ from the atmosphere while producing premium fuels.""

Consider a typical deployment: A 20,000 barrel-per-day NZET refinery integrated with Eden technology could process CO₂ from a nearby coal plant, converting what would be 2.2 million tons of annual emissions into approximately 220 million gallons of feedstock for high-value SAF production.

Market Transformation at Scale

With exclusive rights across Mexico, Canada, and the United States, the partnership addresses a massive market opportunity. North America's industrial sector emits over 6.8 billion tons of CO₂ annually, while airlines desperately seek sustainable fuel supplies to meet regulatory mandates and corporate commitments.

""This partnership doesn’t just solve one problem—it solves three,"" noted Williamson. ""We help heavy industry manage their carbon liabilities, provide airlines with certified sustainable fuel, and create a profitable new business model for refineries. It’s a true win-win-win scenario.""

Immediate Implementation Plans

The first integrated facilities are planned for development within 24 months, with sites under evaluation in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Alberta. Each location has been selected for proximity to both CO₂-intensive industries and aviation fuel markets, ensuring efficient aggregation and distribution.

Julie de Cevins, the Daher Group’s chief sustainability officer, stated: “Daher’s climate policy is a clear response to the climate emergency.","Staying true to its founding values as a committed and responsible family-owned business, Daher is taking a major step forward in its sustainable development strategy by adopting an ambitious and structured climate policy.

This new initiative is designed to accelerate the transition toward a low-carbon future, aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

As a unique player in the aerospace value chain – with activities ranging from aircraft manufacturing to industrial logistics – the Daher Group recognizes its responsibility in driving the sector’s environmental transformation.

This distinctive positioning enables the Group to act on multiple fronts, working directly with its entire ecosystem: customers, suppliers, partners, and employees.

In a context where the aerospace industry faces major challenges related to energy transition, Daher intends to lead by example. With a long-term vision and collective mobilization, the Group places climate action at the center of its priorities – serving both current and future generations.

This climate policy is built on four complementary pillars:

Reducing carbon emissions from operations

Daher is committed to significantly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, aligned with the 1.5C target set by the Paris Agreement. The goal is clear: a 50 percent reduction in emissions from operations between 2022 and 2032, with the first step of a 23 percent reduction from 2027.

To achieve this, the Group is focusing on energy efficiency: the application of electrification, the adoption of lower-carbon energy sources (such as sustainable aviation fuels/SAF and biofuels), and the optimization of its processes and facilities.

Engaging suppliers in the transition

Recognizing that climate performance also depends on upstream activities, Daher places its suppliers at the core of its strategy. By 2027, the Group will assess the carbon maturity of its 50 highest-emitting suppliers, expanding this analysis to the top 100 by 2032.

Daher will work to ensure reliable CO₂ data for its upstream emissions in the Paris Agreement’s Scope 3 emissions category by collecting data from its most impactful Tier 1 suppliers.

Representative CO₂ data will be integrated into the Group’s management and reporting tools.

The objective is to co-develop emission reduction pathways for the Paris Agreement’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 categories with these partners, aligned with the Agreement’s 1.5C target.

Reducing emissions from products and services

Daher is taking action on three fronts to reduce the carbon footprint of its products and services.

The Group has committed to developing a lower-carbon aircraft by 2027, while also continuously improving the energy efficiency of its airplanes and increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels in its own flight operations.

The share of SAF blended with conventional kerosene will exceed 10 percent by 2027, reaching 20 percent by 2032. Daher also supports initiatives to authorize SAF blends above 50 percent to accelerate the sector’s transition.

In parallel, Daher is heavily investing in innovation to make its products lighter in weight. At least 50 percent of its research and development budget is dedicated to research in composite materials, with the goal of delivering lighter aerostructures for future aerospace programs. By the end of 2027, eco-design testing and training will be conducted to integrate these principles from the design phase.

Finally, the Group is enhancing the energy efficiency of its services and transportation operations, while promoting the use of biofuels in ground operations.

Research and development investments will continue to optimize tools and transportation methods, with a clear commitment to offering more sustainable services to its customers.

Adapting activities to climate risks

Daher also is anticipating the impacts of climate change on its infrastructure. By the end of 2027, comprehensive physical risk mapping will be conducted for its sites, as well as those deemed critical in its value chain. Based on this assessment, an adaptation plan will be defined by 2032 for the most exposed sites to strengthen their resilience to climate hazards and ensure operational continuity.

Julie de Cevins, the Daher Group’s chief sustainability officer, stated: “Daher’s climate policy is a clear response to the climate emergency. It reflects our commitment to act with methods, ambition, and responsibility. Every employee has a role to play in this collective effort. Progress will be tracked regularly, with annual carbon footprint mapping to ensure transparency, effectiveness and continuous improvement in our actions.”

LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) has announced a significant breakthrough in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, expanding its capability to produce SAF via the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. This innovation offers a sustainable palm oil substitute, leveraging LanzaTech's versatile technology for decarbonization efforts across various sectors. The development was collaboratively achieved with the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB and the Mibelle Group.

The breakthrough involves a unique dual fermentation technology that transforms waste CO₂ gases into alcohol and further into a palm oil-like fat using non-GMO oil yeasts in a secondary fermentation process. This process addresses the environmental challenges associated with palm oil, such as deforestation and biodiversity loss, by providing a sustainable alternative.

The collaboration between LanzaTech, Fraunhofer IGB, and Mibelle Group marks a significant milestone in the cosmetics industry, as the palm oil substitute replicates essential functional properties needed. The development also introduces a novel route to the HEFA pathway for SAF production, circumventing the sustainability and supply challenges currently present with conventional oil crops and waste oils.

The Environmental Challenge and the Innovative Solution

Palm oil is a critical raw material due to its high yield, long shelf life, and heat resistance. However, the global dependency on palm oil has resulted in extensive deforestation, biodiversity loss, and significant CO₂ emissions, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable alternatives. LanzaTech's technology addresses this challenge by transforming waste CO₂ gases into a palm oil substitute, reducing the environmental impact associated with palm oil production.

Addressing Aviation's Decarbonization Challenge

Alcohol from the LanzaTech process is already an ideal feedstock for SAF production. Via the Alcohol to Jet Process, LanzaTech’s technology enables the production of advanced sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and when the ethanol is made from CO₂ and green hydrogen, e-fuels. The versatility of LanzaTech's technology could potentially now extend into another route to SAF, namely the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway: transforming ethanol into synthetic oils that function as alternatives to conventional HEFA feedstocks.

This innovation advances LanzaTech’s position at the forefront of the rapidly expanding SAF market, offering airlines and fuel producers a new tool in their decarbonization arsenal while demonstrating how circular carbon solutions can transform entire industries.

With mounting global pressure to reduce carbon emissions, developing and scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production has become increasingly urgent. SAF, a fully certified jet fuel made from nonpetroleum feedstocks, can be used in existing aircraft engines and transported via current infrastructure, making it a vital tool for aviation decarbonization. However, the success of SAF depends not only on its usage but also on the methods used in its production.

Today’s Standards and Challenges

ASTM International plays a crucial role in ensuring the credibility and reliability of SAF production methods. Its approval of eight fully synthetic SAF production pathways provides the foundation for the industry's sustainability efforts. These pathways can utilize various renewable feedstocks, including used cooking oil, municipal solid waste, woody biomass and ethanol, each converting materials to jet fuel through specific chemical processes using heat, water and hydrogen. Each pathway has different feedstock requirements, capital costs and carbon reduction potentials. Further, each pathway has different limitations on the blending ratio with conventional jet fuel (5%-50%).

The most commercially mature pathway is hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), which starts with oils, fats or greases and converts that material to jet fuel by treating it with hydrogen (hydroprocessing). The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) method converts solid biomass or waste into syngas and then into liquid fuels. Alcohols derived from biomass fermentation (e.g., ethanol or butanol) or from chemical transformations (e.g,. methanol) can be converted into jet fuel through dehydration and oligomerization for the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathways. HEFA, FT and ATJ pathways, each approved for 50% blending with conventional jet fuel, represent the most promising options for significant carbon intensity reductions.

SAF demand is projected to increase tenfold by 2030, reaching over 7 billion gallons annually. However, this will still only represent about 5% of global jet fuel demand, indicating significant room for growth. While HEFA currently dominates the market with a 95% share due to relatively low deployment costs, it faces mounting feedstock availability challenges.

The U.S. produced 23 million tons of HEFA feedstock in 2024, with soybean oil making up 57% of the domestic supply. Used cooking oil remains limited by small-scale collection, while animal fats are concentrated in states like Nebraska, Texas and Iowa. Transporting these feedstocks to facilities, especially in western states like California, can raise carbon intensity scores and logistics costs, further straining scalability. These challenges, combined with HEFA SAF’s premium price—already two to four times higher than conventional jet fuel—underscore concerns about its long-term viability and highlight the need to diversify SAF pathways for sustainable growth.

Turning Waste into Wings

Fuel producers are actively exploring alternative pathways with more abundant feedstocks to meet the growing demand for SAF. FT pathways, particularly waste gasification, show significant promise by using abundant, low-cost feedstocks like municipal, agricultural and forest waste. This conversion of waste into valuable fuel could have a substantial positive impact on both the environment and the aviation industry. However, FT processes remain more expensive than HEFA, primarily due to higher capital costs per unit of production capacity and more complex production processes.

Any plant with this more costly technology must find ways to optimize resource use and maximize output to remain economically viable. A potential opportunity for increased economic stability at these plants lies in the byproduct. FT plants making SAF will produce up to 20% byproduct of renewable naphtha or liquid petroleum gas (LPG). While these materials can reduce carbon intensity in fossil fuels or as chemical feedstocks, their economic value falls short of SAF. Additionally, FT plants that process gasified waste are often located far from potential buyers of naphtha or LPG, further complicating their monetization.

Biofuel engineers are making notable progress in increasing the economic viability of FT by finding new opportunities for its low-value byproducts. Emerging technologies for renewable naphtha include using it for an integrated hydrogen unit that turns renewable feed sources into hydrogen with low greenhouse gas emissions. One add-on chemical process can upgrade renewable naphtha and LPG into aromatic SAF, a molecule type that FT does not make but is needed in jet fuel. Both the HEFA and FT pathways only produce paraffinic SAF. A way to produce this type of molecule from a low-value byproduct would unlock the economic viability of distributed FT and HEFA plants, enabling their widespread adoption.

Adding the Aromatics

Conventional jet fuel contains both paraffinic and aromatic molecules. The aromatics are ring-shaped molecules necessary for the fuel’s physical properties. ASTM standards require that finished jet fuels contain between 8% and 25% aromatics. Currently, only a 50% blend of FT SAF with conventional jet fuel is approved by ASTM, so fossil jet fuel provides the aromatics for these blends. However, ASTM and the industry are moving toward higher SAF blends—eventually to 100% drop-in synthetic SAF—where no blending with fossil jet is required. Processors will face a critical challenge in finding a source for the aromatics. This is crucial to ensure that their fuel will not require continued blending with fossil fuels, highlighting a key challenge in the future of SAF production.

Even before the 100% SAF becomes a reality, a producer that can offer a fully fungible product like drop-in SAF with a molecular composition matching that of a fossil jet fuel would be able to use common carrier pipelines and fuel storage facilities, saving costs and making it easier for the airports and airlines to use their product.

A significant way to decrease the cost-per-unit of FT SAF and increase the technology's economic viability is to increase the value of the byproducts. With 20% of the plant's output transformed from low-value naphtha and LPG to high-value aromatic SAF, this technology increases the plants revenue by anywhere from 10% to 20%. Including this add-on technology would make the FT plant a better investment, produce more cost-competitive SAF with conventional fuels, and enable a fully synthetic, 100% drop-in-ready product that can be sold directly to airlines without blending, once ASTM-approved.

Setting a New Standard

SAF is a crucial element in aviation's mission to reduce carbon emissions, offering a scalable solution that works with existing infrastructure while addressing waste management challenges. Meeting the International Air Transport Association's net-zero emissions goal by 2050 will require substantial investments in SAF technologies and infrastructure, with estimates suggesting investments in the hundreds of billions of dollars across the supply chain.

The pathway to sustainable aviation involves multiple parallel approaches. While HEFA technology has paved the way for initial SAF adoption, the industry must diversify its production methods to meet future demand. FT pathways, despite challenges in initial capital costs and waste management integration, offer auspicious opportunities. By optimizing byproduct utilization and effectively processing solid waste, this technology addresses multiple environmental challenges simultaneously: reducing aviation emissions, managing municipal waste and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.

As the industry continues to evolve, integrating waste-to-fuel technologies with existing infrastructure and developing new processing capabilities will be crucial. These advancements will not only support aviation's sustainability goals but also contribute to a broader circular economy, where waste materials become valuable resources. With continued investment in research, development and scaling of these technologies, the aviation industry can work toward a future where sustainable fuel is not just an alternative, but a new standard.

Algae, notably microalgae, have potential to be a feedstock for green aviation fuel production as it has a high content of lipids, which contain oils that can be turned into biofuels.
Bangchak is conducting a test run of its SAF factory located near its oil refinery in Phra Khanong district of Bangkok.","A plan to turn wastewater into bio-liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG), a new fuel for power generation, is expected to be finalised in two years under a 2-billion-baht budget allocated by BBGI, the biotechnology arm of the Thai energy conglomerate Bangchak Corporation.

Also known as liquefied biomethane, bio-LNG is a biofuel made from biogas through a process called anaerobic digestion, which can potentially replace fossil fuel-derived LNG.

BBGI plans to make bio-LNG from wastewater and solid waste from its ethanol production plants in Kanchanaburi and Khon Kaen provinces, said chief executive and president Daechapon Lersuwanaroj.

A process to produce ethanol and methyl ester, two key biofuels used to blend with gasohol and diesel respectively, results in wastewater. The company wants to upcycle the unwanted water, making it an alternative fuel.

“This marks a significant step towards advancing the use of renewable energy from wastewater,” said Mr Daechapon.

BBGI is cooperating on the bio-LNG production project with Singapore-based Keppel, a global asset manager and operator, and CleanEdge Resource, which specialises in industrial wastewater treatment and waste-to-energy plant development.

BBGI initially intended to supply bio-LNG to ships operated by Keppel, but later decided to adjust the plan by providing it for power generation because changing ship fuels is time-consuming, as vessels must replace their engine technology.

LNG, heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil are widely used by ships, but these fuels emit more carbon dioxide than bio-LNG.

According to Mr Daechapon, the bio-LNG factory is scheduled to start operations in 2027 and is designed to have a production capacity of 100 tonnes a day.

Operators of data centres, which require a huge amount of electricity, are also interested in bio-LNG as a renewable source of cleaner energy, he said.

In another development, BBGI on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives for a joint study on the use of algae to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a biofuel for aircraft.

Key to this recovery is Boeing's strategic realignment, including the acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems, a major supplier of 737 MAX fuselages.
Competitive Positioning: Boeing vs. Airbus While Boeing's 737 MAX has gained traction, Airbus's A320neo family remains a formidable competitor.
Certification delays for the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants, now expected in 2026, could disrupt delivery schedules.
Investment Implications For investors, Boeing's 737 MAX order represents more than a short-term win—it signals a sustainable recovery anchored in operational discipline and market demand.","The recent 30-aircraft order for Boeing's 737 MAX from Macquarie AirFinance, the aircraft leasing arm of Australia's Macquarie Group, has reignited discussions about Boeing's operational resilience and its ability to capitalize on long-term demand in commercial aviation. This deal, which expands Macquarie AirFinance's 737 MAX order book to 70 aircraft, underscores a critical shift in market sentiment. For investors, the question is no longer whether Boeing can recover from its post-2019 grounding crisis but how it will sustain its momentum in a competitive landscape dominated by Airbus's A320neo family.

Operational Resilience: A New Benchmark for Boeing

The 737 MAX order reflects renewed confidence in Boeing's production capabilities. Deliveries for the 70-aircraft order are scheduled through 2032, a timeline that aligns with Boeing's stated goal of scaling up production to 52 aircraft per month by 2030. This long-term delivery schedule is a testament to Boeing's ability to stabilize its supply chain and address quality control issues that plagued the program in recent years.

Key to this recovery is Boeing's strategic realignment, including the acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems, a major supplier of 737 MAX fuselages. This move has reduced bottlenecks in critical components and provided greater control over production timelines. Additionally, Boeing's adoption of real-time data analytics for inventory management has mitigated the “bullwhip effect” in its supply chain, ensuring smoother operations.

Financial metrics further support this narrative. Boeing's stock has surged 32.12% year-to-date in 2025, reflecting investor optimism. The company's cash reserves of $23 billion and a 63% reduction in second-quarter losses compared to 2024 signal improved fiscal discipline. Analysts project adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to reach $11.92 by 2029, driven by the 737 MAX's dominance in the single-aisle market.

Long-Term Demand: The 737 MAX as a Fleet Modernization Engine

The 737 MAX's 20% reduction in fuel use and carbon emissions compared to older models positions it as a linchpin for global fleet modernization. Boeing's 2025 Commercial Market Outlook forecasts a need for 33,000 new single-aisle aircraft over the next two decades, with the 737 MAX family expected to capture a significant share.

Macquarie AirFinance's CEO, Eamonn Bane, emphasized the 737 MAX's role in enabling sustainable and cost-effective aviation solutions. This aligns with broader industry trends: airlines and lessors are prioritizing fuel efficiency and environmental compliance, particularly as carbon offset regulations tighten. The 737 MAX's versatility—capable of carrying up to 210 passengers and operating on routes up to 3,500 nautical miles—makes it a strategic asset for both short- and medium-haul operations.

Competitive Positioning: Boeing vs. Airbus

While Boeing's 737 MAX has gained traction, Airbus's A320neo family remains a formidable competitor. In July 2025, the A320neo family recorded only three orders, but its backlog of 7,128 aircraft (as of July 2025) reflects its entrenched market position. The A321neo variant, in particular, has attracted 214 orders in 2025, driven by its extended range and larger capacity.

However, Boeing's recent order momentum—30 737 MAX orders in July 2025, compared to the A320neo's three—suggests a narrowing gap. Airbus's production rate of 38 aircraft per month (matching Boeing's current output) is expected to increase to 75 units by 2027, but supply chain constraints and engine shortages may delay this target. Boeing's focus on incremental production increases (42 units by late 2025, 47 by year-end) appears more aligned with current demand and supplier readiness.

Risks and Opportunities

Despite Boeing's progress, challenges persist. Certification delays for the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants, now expected in 2026, could disrupt delivery schedules. Additionally, labor disputes in Boeing's defense unit and global supply chain volatility remain risks.

Yet, Boeing's strategic partnerships—such as its expansion into the Asia-Pacific market and investments in sustainable aviation fuel—position it to capitalize on long-term trends. The company's collaboration with airlines like United and Delta, which now report improved transparency and delivery predictability, further strengthens its credibility.

Investment Implications

For investors, Boeing's 737 MAX order represents more than a short-term win—it signals a sustainable recovery anchored in operational discipline and market demand. The aircraft's role in fleet modernization, combined with Boeing's financial stability and production scalability, makes it a compelling long-term play.

However, caution is warranted. The 737 MAX's success hinges on maintaining production stability and navigating regulatory hurdles. Investors should monitor Boeing's ability to meet its 52-unit-per-month target by 2030 and its progress in securing certifications for newer variants.

In conclusion, Boeing's strategic turnaround is gaining traction, but its sustainability will depend on its ability to outpace Airbus in innovation and execution. For now, the 737 MAX order from Macquarie AirFinance is a strong indicator that Boeing is not just recovering—it is redefining its competitive edge in the post-pandemic aviation era.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-02 11:57:00.760610

The plan involves creating a multinational company that would tackle a common environmental challenge while helping airlines meet international targets to cut emissions, reports Noticias Ambientales.

Under guidelines from the International Civil Aviation Organization, airlines must begin decarbonizing operations in 2027. Officials see sargassum as a promising raw material for sustainable aviation fuel, part of Mexico’s push toward a circular and low-carbon economy. The initiative is being driven by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat).

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel costs more than triple the price of conventional jet fuel. To close that gap, the state-owned Airports and Auxiliary Services (ASA) has announced a multimillion-dollar expansion of its Cancun plant, which produces biofuel from waste oil and could eventually process sargassum.

The plan would turn one of the Caribbean’s most troublesome macroalgae into an energy source. Each year, massive quantities of sargassum blanket beaches across the region, harming ecosystems, damaging tourism, and creating health risks.

Experts, however, caution that fuel production alone will not solve the problem. They argue that broader policies are needed, including safer collection methods, more research into the algae’s life cycle, and strategies that balance environmental protection with the well-being of coastal communities.

In Quintana Roo, sargassum has already disrupted marine habitats, killing fish, turtles, and corals by blocking oxygen in the water and releasing toxins as it decomposes. Its buildup also threatens human health, as workers who manually clear beaches face exposure to harmful gases.

Tourism, the state’s economic lifeline, is heavily impacted as hotels and local authorities spend millions each season on beach cleanup. The worsening influx of sargassum, fueled by climate change and ocean pollution, has led to repeated calls for a national emergency declaration to ensure federal resources and coordinated action.

Without structural measures, experts warn, the growing tide of sargassum will continue to place severe pressure on ecosystems and coastal communities.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-5.png,N,,2025-09-02 11:57:47.749623

Seeing the appetite and potential among Taiwan SMEs for green and sustainable finance solutions, CUB has responded with a range of products and strategies that position the bank at the forefront of advancing Asia’s low-carbon future.

In its home market, CUB focuses on the sustainability needs of SMEs, introducing various initiatives to support decarbonization and business transition. To enhance carbon reduction efficiency, CUB partnered with Taiwan’s first legal entity to obtain carbon inventory verification accreditation—the Metal Industries Research & Development Centre—to provide technical support and accelerate the industry’s transition to net-zero.

CUB tailors engagement models based on industry type, company size, carbon emissions and ESG maturity, conducting thematic engagement scenarios to address practical decarbonization needs and strengthen clients’ net-zero capabilities. In December 2024, CUB launched Taiwan’s first “SME Sustainable Finance Partner Project,” offering incentives such as cash flow services, foreign exchange deposit benefits, and preferential lending rates to encourage SMEs to adopt greener practices.

Additionally, CUB pioneered sustainability-linked payroll solutions, motivating corporate employees to participate in green business practices such as energy conservation and carbon reduction, thereby enhancing internal sustainability awareness.

Exporting Taiwan’s Green Finance Know-how to Support Regional Transformation

In overseas markets, CUB focuses on the sustainability needs of project-based and large enterprises, promoting regional low-carbon transition through green loans, sustainability-linked financing, and social responsibility lending.

In Singapore, CUB partnered with leading renewable energy company Apeiron Bioenergy at the end of 2023 to launch its first green trade finance facility. The full loan amount was dedicated to supporting the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), demonstrating CUB’s concrete actions in the clean energy sector.

In Vietnam, CUB structured several green loan initiatives, including green building financing for ICT sector companies, participation in a syndicated loan for VP Bank (with at least 50% of proceeds allocated to green or social projects), and sustainable financing for public water utilities and wind power development—highlighting its impact across diverse industries.

Further reinforcing its commitment to green corporate finance in the region, CUB hosted the “ESG: Challenges and Practices in Sustainable Development” forum on Earth Day 2025 in Vietnam. The event gathered over 80 industry leaders to explore global and local ESG trends and challenges. The forum showcased CUB’s 20-year presence in Vietnam and its role as a key partner in corporate sustainability transformation. During the event, CUB introduced its “Cathay One” one-stop transition finance platform, designed to help enterprises conduct carbon inventories, formulate decarbonization strategies, and access green financing—enhancing their resilience and competitiveness in the face of climate risks.

These achievements build on CUB’s milestone in 2022, when it became the first Taiwanese bank to sign a sustainability-linked loan in the Philippines, underscoring its determination and action in promoting green finance across Southeast Asia.

Leading ESG Disclosure in Asia’s Financial Sector

CUB is the first commercial bank in Asia to participate in CDP’s Corporate Banking Programme, helping corporates systematically assess carbon emissions, climate risk management, decarbonization targets, and governance frameworks to meet growing transparency demands from global investors and supply chains. In 2024, CUB further distinguished itself as the only Asian bank invited to join CDP’s SME Technical Working Group.Through this opportunity, CUB provided insights and advice that helped shaped CDP’s approach to SMEs, including the development of the SME questionnaire.

After the launch of the SME questionnaire in 2024, CUB invited over 150 companies to participate in the programme. Through the joint efforts of participating enterprises, CDP experts, and CUB colleagues, a total of 121 companies completed the questionnaire and received CDP scores—resulting in a response rate of over 80%, significantly higher than the global supply chain average of around 66%. Notably, 110 of these companies were first-time participants.

The European Commission’s 2021 proposal sought to align energy taxation with climate goals by phasing out fossil-fuel exemptions and taxing the most polluting fuels at higher minimum rates; Parliament is consultative on tax files while the Council decides by unanimity. The draft also points to implications for companies already navigating other rules.

In aviation, ReFuelEU Aviation requires a 2% share of sustainable aviation fuel in 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and 20% by 2035; carriers including Lufthansa have introduced environmental surcharges of roughly €1–€72 per ticket depending on route and cabin; IATA has estimated about $1.2 billion in SAF purchases in 2025 to meet mandates.

In shipping, the sector entered the EU Emissions Trading System on 1 January 2024 with surrender obligations phased in at 40% for 2024 emissions payable in 2025, 70% for 2025 and 100% from 2026; carriers including Maersk have implemented ETS-linked surcharges; FuelEU Maritime started in 2025 with a requirement to reduce the greenhouse-gas intensity of marine energy starting at 2% in 2025 and scaling up through 2050.

The European Union is considering a proposal to delay taxes on jet fuel for an additional 10 years as it struggles to balance the levy against economic and political realities

Shipping, too, is being mulled for continued tax breaks. This would effectively keep both industries exempt from EU-wide excise duties until at least 2035.

“In 2035, the Commission should examine the possibility of taxation of air navigation and waterborne navigation and propose amendments to this Directive, where appropriate,” noted the draft document seen by Reuters.

The draft plan highlights the political challenges of implementing carbon pricing in two of Europe’s most carbon-intensive transport sectors. For their part, airlines argue that any taxation risks doing more harm than good.

From Fit for 55 to a decade-long tax holiday

The proposal stems from the reform of the Energy Taxation Directive, first tabled in the EU’s Fit for 55 climate package in 2021. That package aimed to remove long-standing exemptions on kerosene used in commercial aviation, phasing in minimum excise duties to align the tax regime with climate targets.

But it requires the unanimous support of all 27 member states, and progress has been slow. Countries with strong tourism industries, shipping sectors, or peripheral geographies have consistently pushed back, warning of economic fallout.

Denmark, which currently holds the EU presidency, is now brokering a compromise that would postpone the introduction of aviation fuel taxes until 2035. Small aircraft and private pleasure boats could be subject to duties sooner.

Europe’s airlines push back against jet fuel tax

Europe’s airlines are unlikely to be satisfied with a ten-year reprieve. They view any fuel tax as a misguided policy altogether. Industry group Airlines for Europe (A4E) has repeatedly opposed the idea of an aviation fuel tax, warning it would fragment the EU’s single aviation market and distort competition.

“Climate policy regulation in the form of sector-specific taxes, levies, or bans is ecologically and economically counterproductive,” A4E Deputy Managing Director Lauren Donceel wrote in a position paper for the industry group in 2023.

“They reduce the aviation industry’s capacity to invest and innovate whilst potentially shifting CO2 emissions to other regions. Carbon pricing is already applied to aviation through the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and globally through CORSIA. Moreover, many airports in Europe apply differentiating fees for more polluting aircraft.”

The organisation argues that carriers are already paying heavily for carbon through the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which by 2030 will cost airlines over €10 billion annually.

Instead, A4E points to European airlines’ direct investment in decarbonisation. Its members plan to spend €14.8 billion on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and €165 billion on new aircraft by the end of this decade.

Deloitte study: SAF mandates could widen cost gap

The adoption of SAF by airlines comes with its own complications, including limited production and high costs, which also raise concerns.

A4E recently commissioned a study by Deloitte, which examined the economic effects of the ReFuelEU SAF mandate—requiring airlines to blend 2% SAF in 2025, rising to 6% by 2030.

The report, “Creating a Level Playing Field for Decarbonisation in Aviation,” warned that without measures to level the playing field, EU carriers could face a 15% cost disadvantage on key EU–Asia routes compared with competitors flying through non-EU hubs, such as Istanbul or Dubai.

Deloitte’s modelling suggested that as much as 26% of the expected emissions reductions from ReFuelEU could be offset by so-called “carbon leakage,” with passengers choosing itineraries that avoid EU carriers or hubs to escape SAF-related costs.

To address this, the consultancy proposed a SAF Border Adjustment Mechanism (SAF-BAM), mirroring the EU’s broader carbon border levy. Such a system would ensure connecting flights through non-EU airports carry the same SAF-related cost burden, eliminating leakage while restoring competitiveness “without raising consumer prices overall.”

Airlines cry out as environmentalists cry foul

While airlines warn of competitiveness risks, green groups argue that fuel tax exemptions are environmentally harmful subsidies. With aviation emissions projected to rise in the coming decade, campaigners say delaying taxation until 2035 undermines the EU’s net-zero target.

The debate highlights a central dilemma: how to decarbonise aviation without pricing Europe’s carriers out of global markets.

A decision on the tax holiday proposal is expected by November 2025. For now, Europe’s aviation sector remains caught between mounting decarbonisation costs, political pressures, and the need to stay competitive in a global industry where policies differ by region.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Finnair-partners-with-Neste-to-refuel-with-SAF-at-Helsinki.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 06:56:17.202194

Electrolysers (10 MW) powered by renewable-energy sources will be used to split desalinated water into green hydrogen and oxygen.","JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Project development funding for the Prieska Power Reserve Project is being partly sourced from the German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), South Africa’s State-owned Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), which has also approved development funding to the project, has outlined in an advertisement.

The green-hydrogen-linked Prieska project, which is located outside Prieska in the Northern Cape, aims to produce 80 000 t of green ammonia a year. It is owned by Mahlako, a women-owned empowerment consortium, and Cenec, a Bloemfontein-based emission energy company that designs and manages solar and wind energy plants. Initiated by Mahlako and Cenec, the project is on privately owned farms of about 1 900 ha, which are sites earmarked for renewable-energy generation.

While these generation sites are located outside Prieska, a town on the south bank of the Orange river, the green ammonia chemical processing will be located within the industrial area in Prieska, on land owned by the Siyathemba local municipality.

The 14 500 t/y green hydrogen content will be produced by a 120 MW electrolyser, and renewable-energy sources, made up of 180 MWp of solar PV and 136 MWp of wind power, will power the electrolyser. The project includes a 45 MW battery storage system to ensure continuous 24-hour operation.

Mining Weekly can report that although green hydrogen generation and platinum group metals (PGMs) generally go hand-in-hand and although South Africa hosts most of the world’s PGMs, no explicit reference is made by the IDC to the use of PGM-based proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers and fuel cells.

Interestingly, PEM’s global recognition has just been emphasised in a World Platinum Investment Council LinkedIn note, which points out that the US-based clean energy technology firm Ohmium International has opted for PEM, with this observation from Ohmium CEO Markus Tacke: “Our latest Lotus Mark 3 PEM electrolyser system is transforming the economics of green hydrogen production.”

In addition. Plug Power president and CEO Andy Marsh has pointed out to Engineering News & Mining Weekly in a Zoom interview that PEM technology is at the heart of everything that Plug Power, a US Nasdaq-listed company, does. Plug Power has been a prime mover in the US’s platinum catalysed green hydrogen and fuel cell economy and Marsh points out that the adoption by US business of this planet-friendly way of doing things is because it pays to do so.

Plug Power built and operates the US’s largest liquid green hydrogen plant, a 15-t-a-day liquid hydrogen plant that uses 40 MW of Plug’s platinum- and iridium-catalysed electrolysers.

Plug Power is involved with more than 80 000 forklift trucks being powered by the 250 hydrogen fuelling stations it has built. Between Walmart and Amazon, there are about 150 sites that use Plug Power’s PEM technology to operate around the clock and with the help of Plug Power’s technology, these companies talk about moving 8% to 10% more pallets an hour, while also being users of clean energy that mitigates against climate change.

PEM electrolysers generate the green hydrogen by splitting water, including sea water, into hydrogen and oxygen.

Then fuel cells, which are also catalysed by PGMs, convert the green hydrogen into green electricity for mobility or stationary uses.

Moreover, the flexibility provided by liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technology, which is being developed by the South Africa-linked German company Hydrogeneous, provides the oily skin for green hydrogen to be transported, stored and traded in the same way as oil and gas is currently. Very fortuitously, LOHC ensures that green hydrogen can be transported and stored using existing liquid fuel infrastructure, including ships, tanks and trucks. By offering a versatile and adaptable solution for hydrogen transport and storage, LOHC is said to unlock the full potential of hydrogen as a clean and sustainable energy source.

“Africa's green hydrogen journey has just begun. By fostering collaboration between government entities, universities, and the private sector, we can unlock the immense potential of this clean energy source. Imagine a future where African ports become green hydrogen hubs, powering ships and industries with clean fuel. It's an achievable dream, but only through collaborative action,” Engineering Centre of Excellence head Tauqeer Ahmed has pointed out.

SOLAR POWER

Not that long ago, solar power was regarded as too expensive to implement, despite Africa’s abundance of sunshine, but now cheap solar is powering the energy boom of the entire continent of Africa, with major renewables growth in South Africa.

As with solar in the past, in some circles green hydrogen is still seen as needing to come steeply down the cost curve.

In this regard, it can be pointed out that effort, not unlike that applied to solar, is under way in places that include the province of Hunan, a home of green revolution, as well as elsewhere in China.

A direct South African link with Hunan is through the company SANY, which provides heavy industry equipment including from its considerable South African base. This base is clearly visible to motorists on the way to Gauteng’s East Rand.

It can be pointed out that Hunan is also the place where electrified vehicle mobility as well as green railway transport is being advanced.

PRIESKA FUNDING

Regarding the Prieska project, it can be pointed out that part funder KfW, which was formed in 1948 after the Second World War, is committed to improving economic, social and environmental living conditions across the globe while the IDC, established in 1940 through an Act of Parliament, is fully owned by the government of South Africa.

This project, the IDC reports, plans to take advantage of South Africa's competitive advantage in the renewable-energy market and use South Africa’s abundant solar and wind resources to produce green hydrogen and ammonia.

By doing so, the IDC adds that it will contribute “substantially to local and national socioeconomic development objectives” and create 400 jobs on reaching commercial stage.

Green hydrogen is an energy carrier that is produced using renewable electricity and water in an electrolyser.

Market applications for green hydrogen include the production of green chemicals such as green ammonia, mobility solutions, sustainable aviation fuel, marine bunker fuel and the decarbonisation of 'hard to abate' sectors of the economy. Examples of these sectors are green steel production, cement manufacturing and petrochemical production.

In developed markets, the green hydrogen economy has created significant job opportunities – a development that South Africa aims to replicate, the IDC points out in the advertisement that does not reveal the extent or terms of the funding being provided by itself and KfW.

In addition to the Prieska project, green hydrogen- and green ammonia-related projects include the the Hive green ammonia export project at Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape, Keren Energy green development near Vanrhynsdorp, in the Western Cape, and a related fuel cell and electrolyser component manufacturing facility project in Gauteng is Isondo Precious Metals.

Keren Energy CEO George van Rensburg has reported that the front-end engineering design (FEED) study and bankable financial model for the project have been completed, with most of the permits for the project in place. The project site has also been secured through a long-term lease.

The Keren project team aims to reach financial close by the end of this year, with production anticipated to start in the first half of 2028.

The total investment required for the project’s full development is around R1-billion.

In the first phase of production, Keren Energy aims to produce about 800 t of green hydrogen a year.

REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS

Earlier this year, a request for proposal (RFP) process was launched to inform the FEED study for a fully integrated green hydrogen project at the East London Industrial Development Zone (ELIDZ), in the Eastern Cape.

Green Hydrogen Solutions (GHS), through its project company GHS Green Hydrogen ELIDZ, is seeking input from leading equipment suppliers for the project. Distinguished by its closed-loop system design, the project will use desalinated seawater to produce high-purity green hydrogen for industrial and commercial customers.

With abundant feedstock potential, strong policy direction, and international cooperation, India is well-positioned to influence the global aviation industry’s transition to low-carbon fuels.
Conclusion India’s sustainable aviation fuel journey is no longer a distant ambition.","The aviation industry is entering a decisive decade in its journey toward decarbonisation. India, with its vast agricultural resources and growing energy innovation, is taking significant steps to align with global sustainability frameworks. A recent collaboration between the Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) signals a pivotal shift.

This partnership is focused on developing capacity across sugarcane-producing states to support the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). By embedding internationally recognised certification standards, India is preparing its supply chains to meet the environmental and traceability demands of modern aviation.

Why Sugarcane Matters for SAF

Sugarcane has long been central to India’s rural economy. Now it is also emerging as a key contributor to cleaner skies. Ethanol derived from sugarcane can be upgraded into SAF, reducing reliance on fossil-based jet fuel.

By focusing on Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, the country’s top sugarcane producers, the initiative aims to connect local agricultural strengths with global aviation’s urgent need for low-carbon fuels. This approach also offers new opportunities for rural communities to participate in the bioeconomy.

Building Capacity with Certification

At the heart of this initiative is the RSB ICAO CORSIA Certification. This globally respected framework ensures that SAF is not only produced but also sourced and tracked responsibly across the supply chain.

The certification guarantees three crucial outcomes:

Responsible feedstock sourcing to avoid environmental harm

Full supply chain traceability to build trust in the fuel’s origins

Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that aligns with international aviation goals

By adopting these standards, India is laying the foundation for a credible and future-ready SAF ecosystem.

Empowering Farmers and Local Enterprises

Beyond technical compliance, the collaboration places strong emphasis on education and outreach. Workshops tailored to regional contexts will train farmers, mill workers, and small enterprises.

This knowledge-sharing effort is especially valuable for smallholder farmers, who often face challenges in adopting new technologies. With the right tools and training, they can become active contributors to a greener aviation future.

Such empowerment also strengthens rural livelihoods, ensuring that sustainability does not come at the expense of equity.

Grassroots Leadership for a Global Goal

The success of this programme rests not only on technology but also on the people who drive it. By building grassroots leadership within sugarcane supply chains, the initiative ensures that SAF adoption is deeply rooted in local realities.

This creates a model where sustainability, economic inclusion, and technological advancement move together. India’s sugar-based bioenergy sector thus becomes more than just a producer of fuel—it evolves into a driver of social progress.

India’s Role in the Global SAF Landscape

India has already established itself as a founding member of the Global Biofuels Alliance, showing its commitment to leadership in sustainable energy. The new partnership between ISMA and RSB strengthens this position by creating practical pathways for SAF development.

With abundant feedstock potential, strong policy direction, and international cooperation, India is well-positioned to influence the global aviation industry’s transition to low-carbon fuels.

A Balanced Approach to Energy Transition

The SAF Horizon project, supported by Boeing, reflects a holistic vision. It recognises that environmental responsibility must go hand in hand with economic resilience. By balancing sustainability with social equity, the initiative sets a precedent for what a just energy transition should look like.

This balance also mirrors the broader goals of sustainability consultancies worldwide, ensuring that every technological leap is matched with responsibility toward people and the planet.

Conclusion

India’s sustainable aviation fuel journey is no longer a distant ambition. With the ISMA–RSB partnership, the country is creating a framework where sugarcane producers, local enterprises, and global aviation stakeholders collaborate toward a shared goal.

The project illustrates how local agricultural strengths can be harnessed to solve global challenges. It also shows that sustainability is not only about reducing emissions but about creating inclusive opportunities and building resilient systems.

As India continues to invest in SAF capacity-building, it is shaping a future where cleaner skies, stronger rural communities, and international cooperation come together seamlessly.

A battery giga factory, starting in 2026, will scale from 40 GWh to 100 GWh annually, while an electrolyser giga factory will expand to 3 GW capacity for green hydrogen production. Reliance also plans to develop one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects in Kutch, spread over 5,50,000 acres, capable of meeting 10 per cent of India’s electricity demand within a decade.

By 2032, the company targets production of 3 MMTPA of green hydrogen equivalent, along with green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel for domestic use and exports.

“Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world’s largest Conventional Energy complex and the world’s largest New Energy complex,” Mukesh Ambani said, calling it the face of “New Reliance and New India.”

Reliance Industries Ltd is accelerating its pivot away from fossil fuels with a sweeping clean energy strategy. The company plans to launch a mega battery manufacturing plant by 2026, build a solar power project larger than Singapore, and achieve 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen capacity by 2032.

Making his first appearance at Reliance’s Annual General Meeting, Anant Ambani — the youngest son of chairman Mukesh Ambani and executive director of the company — outlined a vision to create the world’s most integrated new energy ecosystem, spanning “from sand to electrons to green molecules.”

Fully Integrated Green Energy Platform

Reliance is investing in every link of the clean energy chain:

Solar modules to generate electricity from sunlight.

Advanced batteries to store renewable power.

Electrolysers to produce green hydrogen by splitting water molecules.

Giga factories to manufacture hydrogen and its derivatives, including green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Biofuels derived from organic waste.

According to Anant Ambani, these facilities will enable round-the-clock renewable energy supply and support both domestic use and exports of clean fuels.

The centrepiece of this transformation is the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex in Jamnagar, already home to Reliance’s massive oil refining operations. Once complete, it will be the world’s largest integrated clean energy hub, producing solar modules, batteries, and hydrogen derivatives at unparalleled scale.

Reliance has already started scaling its solar PV manufacturing line at Jamnagar to 20 GWp capacity, which would make it the largest single-site solar facility in the world. The company has rolled out its first 200 MW of high-efficiency HJT modules, which offer higher energy yields and lower degradation compared to conventional panels.

In parallel, construction of battery and electrolyser giga factories is underway. The battery plant, set to start production in 2026, will begin with 40 GWh annual capacity and eventually expand to 100 GWh. The electrolyser facility, also targeted for 2026, will scale up to 3 GW per year and enable globally competitive hydrogen production.

Mega projects in Gujarat

Reliance’s clean energy ambitions are concentrated in Gujarat. In Kutch, the company is developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects, covering 550,000 acres — nearly three times Singapore’s land area. At peak installation, Reliance expects to deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers per day. Within a decade, this single project could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity demand.

The Jamnagar and Kandla ports will provide the critical infrastructure backbone, enabling Reliance to export green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. By 2032, the group aims to produce the equivalent of 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually, establishing India as a hub for affordable clean fuels.

Beyond solar and hydrogen, Reliance is scaling its compressed biogas (CBG) operations. The company has set an ambitious target of over 500 CBG plants by 2030, with a combined capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per year. At its Bioenergy Technology and R&D Centre in Jamnagar, Reliance is developing next-generation enzymes, microbial solutions, and high-yield crops to enhance biogas productivity.

Anant Ambani also highlighted the company’s agrivoltaics model, which integrates solar and biogas production on the same land. By capturing carbon dioxide from CBG plants, these hubs will become centers for producing green chemicals. The approach, he noted, delivers a “triple value” — generating renewable gas, electricity, and boosting rural incomes for farmers.

The move would postpone taxation until 2035 and extend the long-standing tax breaks enjoyed by these sectors.
The overhaul is part of the stalled revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, first adopted in 2003 to set EU-wide minimum excise rates.
Shipping operators make a similar case for renewable marine fuels, citing both high production costs and supply bottlenecks, according to Euractiv.
Because EU tax policy requires unanimous approval, any one member state could block the draft.","The European Union is considering a 10-year exemption from energy taxes on aviation and shipping fuels, according to a draft proposal obtained by Reuters. The move would postpone taxation until 2035 and extend the long-standing tax breaks enjoyed by these sectors.

The draft, prepared under Denmark’s rotating EU presidency, would only impose minimum taxation before 2035 on small aircraft with up to 19 seats and on private pleasure boats. Larger airlines and shipping companies would remain exempt during the decade-long transition. Negotiators are scheduled to debate the text in Brussels on Friday, with the presidency aiming for a deal by November.

The overhaul is part of the stalled revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, first adopted in 2003 to set EU-wide minimum excise rates. The European Commission’s Green Deal proposal in 2021 sought to phase in fuel taxation across transport sectors, but repeated pushback from governments has delayed progress.

Industry groups have mounted intensive lobbying campaigns. Airlines argue that without tax relief, uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will remain minimal because it currently costs two to five times more than conventional kerosene. Shipping operators make a similar case for renewable marine fuels, citing both high production costs and supply bottlenecks, according to Euractiv.

The Commission’s own assessments note that ending exemptions could generate billions in revenue while providing incentives for cleaner fuels. Still, countries heavily dependent on tourism and maritime trade remain cautious, warning that higher transport costs could weaken growth.

Because EU tax policy requires unanimous approval, any one member state could block the draft. Diplomats involved in the talks told Reuters that northern states are more inclined to support taxation, while southern tourism economies remain strongly resistant.

Delta Air Lines DAL also featured in the news, courtesy of its decision to add two routes to European destinations from Boston as it aims to bolster its European network. Meanwhile, Frontier Airlines ULCC plans to add 20 new routes to its schedule from late fall, aiming to strengthen its position in the ultra-low-cost segment.

Alaska Air Group ALK, the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, meanwhile, signed an environment-friendly deal with Cosmo Oil Marketing. An expansion-related update was also available from Southwest Airlines LUV over the past week.

Recap of the Most Recent Important Stories

1. At Allegiant Travel, the July scheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 10.3% from the July 2024 levels. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service rose 11.5% year over year. Although traffic improved on a year-over-year basis, it failed to outpace capacity expansion. As a result, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) in July 2025 declined to 86.6% from 87.5% a year ago.

For the total system (including scheduled service and fixed-fee contracts), Allegiant carried 10.1% more passengers in July 2025 than in the same period of the previous year. System-wide capacity improved 10.8% in July 2025 on a year-over-year basis.

2. Expanding Boston’s gateway to Europe, Delta announced that it will start new nonstop service from Boston to Madrid and Nice. While flights on the Boston-Madrid route will start operating from May 16, 2026, those connecting Boston and Nice will take to the skies from May 17. While the Boston-Madrid flights will operate daily, the ones on the Boston-Nice route will operate three times a week.

DAL will utilize its Airbus A330-900neo jets to operate on both routes. Following the addition of the new routes, Delta will serve 12 European destinations from Boston. DAL has been constantly looking to expand its presence in Boston, having nearly tripled its service in Boston in a span of two decades. Apart from the introduction of the new routes, DAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has also decided to expand its service on the Barcelona-Boston and Milan-Boston routes next year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

3. Following the sales agreement between Alaska Air and Cosmo Oil Marketing, Hawaiian Airlines intends to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel on flights between Osaka, Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii. Fuel deliveries at Kansai International Airport will mark the first time Hawaiian Airlines has introduced SAF. The use of SAF has the potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. Apart from highlighting ALK’s environment-friendly approach, the move is also aimed at strengthening tourism between Japan and Hawaii. Additional traffic on this tourist-friendly route is likely to buoy ALK’s top line.

4. Southwest Airlines has extended its flight schedule through June 3, 2026. The extended schedule includes more routes to new places. As part of the expansion, Southwest Airlines will operate flights to the island of St. Maarten, beginning April 7, 2026. The addition of St. Maarten marks LUV’s first new international destination since 2021. St. Maarten comprises two parts: the Netherlands' constituent country of Sint Maarten, alongside the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Martin. Southwest Airlines also announced an interline partnership with EVA Air, a subsidiary of the Evergreen Group, to expand seamless travel between Asia and North America. EVA Air is the third airline partner to be announced by the Dallas-based LUV.

5. Frontier Airlines has decided to bring its service to the top 20 metro areas in the United States. As part of the expansion exercise, ULCC has decided to add 20 new routes from Detroit, Houston, Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte and Dallas. Further growth is expected at ULCC next year. With many of the new routes overlapping with Spirit Airlines’ key markets, ULCC is likely to be a major gainer if Spirit Airlines collapses, according to a CNBC report. Spirit Airlines filed for bankruptcy last year. Despite an initial restructuring, the situation did not improve with Spirit warning last month that it may not survive another year without further cash infusions.

Airline Stocks’ Performance

The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The proposal involves the creation of a multinational company with countries from Central America and the Caribbean, a measure that would not only address a shared environmental issue but also provide an alternative to the international obligation to reduce emissions from commercial flights.

The International Civil Aviation Organization established that airlines must progressively decarbonize their operations starting in 2027. In this context, the utilization of sargassum as a raw material emerges as a strategic opportunity. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) is driving the plan as part of the transition to a circular and low-carbon economy.

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel costs more than three times the price of conventional jet fuel. To narrow this gap, the state-owned company Airports and Auxiliary Services (ASA) has announced a multimillion-dollar investment to expand its plant in Cancun, where biofuel will be produced from waste oil and, in the future, from sargassum.

The project would allow for an energy use of one of the most problematic macroalgae in the Caribbean, which covers thousands of kilometers of beaches each year, generating significant environmental, economic, and social impacts. However, experts warn that fuel production alone does not solve the risks associated with its massive accumulation on the coasts.

## An ecological alternative to harness this macroalgae

The utilization of sargassum as sustainable fuel is proposed as a promising alternative to convert an environmental liability into an energy opportunity. However, experts insist that the key lies in designing comprehensive policies: from safer collection systems to investments in research to better understand the cycle of this macroalgae.

In a scenario of global climate crisis, the challenge is not only to transform waste into energy but also to ensure that the solutions consider both environmental protection and the well-being of the communities that depend on the sea.

**[Sargassum environmental challenge in the Caribbean](https://noticiasambientales.com/innovacion/reinventando-el-sargazo-como-el-caribe-esta-convirtiendo-su-mayor-problema-ambiental-en-una-solucion-innovadora/)**

The uncontrolled arrival of sargassum in Mexico and other Caribbean countries has altered the dynamics of coastal ecosystems. The accumulation of tons of algae on beaches causes the death of fish, turtles, and corals by hindering water oxygenation and releasing toxic substances during decomposition. These processes deteriorate essential habitats for marine biodiversity.

The impact also affects human communities. In Quintana Roo, beach cleaning is largely done manually and under unsafe conditions for workers. The decomposition of sargassum produces gases that can cause respiratory and skin problems, turning collection into a health risk.

Furthermore, the presence of large volumes of algae directly affects tourism, the region’s main economic driver. Hotels and municipalities invest millions of pesos each season in removing sargassum, but the phenomenon continues to intensify due to climate change and pollution that fuels its proliferation in open sea.

The declaration of a national emergency, repeatedly requested, aims to ensure resources and federal-level coordination to tackle the problem. Without structural measures, the pressure on ecosystems and coastal communities will continue to increase.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/09/sargazo-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-09-01 16:56:09.653501

This article was curated together with Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) — India’s only durable carbon removal (CDR)-focused industry coalition.

India’s climate policy landscape is undergoing a pivotal transformation. Recent developments signal a shift from ambition to action, with foundational frameworks now taking shape across emissions management, carbon markets, international cooperation, and climate finance.

1. Mandatory Emission Intensity Targets For High-Emission Industries

The Government of India has issued draft rules under the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023, introducing mandatory Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity (GEI) targets for five hard-to-abate sectors: Aluminum, Iron & Steel, Petroleum Refineries, Petrochemicals, and Textiles. Entities that outperform their targets can earn tradable carbon credits, while those that underperform must purchase credits or face penalties.

This is a critical step toward operationalizing India’s carbon market and providing clarity to industry. The draft notification is open for public comments for 60 days from its publication.

2. India–Japan Joint Credit Mechanism (JCM): A Bilateral Boost For Decarbonization

India and Japan are reportedly finalizing a Joint Credit Mechanism (JCM) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, enabling Japanese firms to invest in and deploy carbon-reduction technologies in India to receive emission reduction credits. Target sectors include solar energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This partnership offers India a strategic opportunity to channel international finance into underdeveloped clean energy sectors (potentially including CDR) and leverage Japanese technical expertise. Read more on the India–Japan JCM here.

3. Climate Finance Taxonomy: A New Framework For Capital Allocation

India’s Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has released a Draft Climate Finance Taxonomy, a landmark step toward aligning financial flows with climate goals. The taxonomy aims to guide investments into mitigation, adaptation, and transition activities.

4. The State of Punjab Begins Journey Towards Using Biochar Carbon Removal To Abate Air Pollution

The Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) and GDi Partners, with support from the Punjab Development Commission, Open Philanthropy, and the Nand & Jeet Khemka Foundation, co-organized a pivotal convening in April on “Biochar for Crop Residue Management & Climate Resilience” in Punjab. The event featured a Biochar Developers Showcase and panel discussions on policy, scaling, and finance, fostering connections and collaborative pathways for large scale biochar adoption in Punjab. Please find the key takeaways from the discussion here.

Looking Ahead

These policy shifts mark a directional progress for India’s climate strategy. By embedding emissions intensity targets, enabling international credit mechanisms, laying the groundwork for climate-aligned finance, and climate resilient agricultural supply chains, India is creating the enabling environment needed for CDR to scale responsibly and equitably.

The Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) remains committed to supporting this transition by fostering research, field validation, and pilot projects that advance the carbon removal ecosystem in India.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-01 13:56:30.166047

Toshikatsu Fukunaga, CEO of Panasonic HVAC Europe, highlighted the importance of the investment: “At Panasonic, we see Europe as particularly advanced when it comes to sustainability, and therefore the acceptance of sustainable energy solutions. Our investment into the Pilsen factory demonstrates both our confidence in the growth of the market and our ability to anticipate and meet future demand.”

The expansion also integrates a new R&D center in collaboration with the Technical University of Ostrava and the University of West Bohemia. By 2028, the local team will manage the full development lifecycle of air-to-water heat pumps, supported by advanced robotics, AI-driven automation, and close coordination with Panasonic’s global network.

Radek Vach, Business Planning Director at Panasonic HVAC CZ, noted: “By placing further R&D capabilities and production together on the same site, we’ll be able to ensure that the factory is able to rapidly and nimbly anticipate and respond to the evolving needs of this key market. There will also be cost savings associated with reduced logistics, in addition to the speed and flexibility associated with bringing R&D and production together.”

Paul Kenny, Director General of the European Heat Pump Association, underscored the wider market impact: “The heat pump sector is boosting Europe’s energy security, our economy and our path to decarbonisation by replacing fossil fuel imports with a clean, locally made and locally powered solution. Today’s factory reopening is both a big step forward on that journey and a clear message to decision-makers from one of the world’s leading companies, that the future is bright in European manufacturing and that heat pumps will inevitably be at the heart of our future global energy system.”

With the European heat pump market valued at €12.2 billion in 2024 and forecast to exceed €71 billion by 2034, Panasonic’s investment in Pilsen positions the company as a central player in Europe’s transition to clean heating and cooling solutions.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Panasonic-Invests-348m-in-Czech-Heat-Pump-Factory.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 20:56:22.010843

Since 2005, this modified aircraft – capable of flying with five engines – has played a vital role in developing cutting-edge engines such as the Trent 1000 and Pearl 10X.

It made history in 2021 by flying a Trent 1000 powered entirely by 100% sustainable aviation fuel and played a key role in the subsequent certification of its durability enhancement package, which will more than double time on wing.

Its final mission, completed in July 2025, supported the company’s Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) engine demonstrator, marking a significant step towards delivering more efficient and sustainable engines.

John Knight, director of test and experimental engineering within Rolls-Royce’s Engineering, Technology & Safety (ET&S) division, explained: “With more than 2,000 hours of testing under its belt, the Flying Test Bed has been a workhorse for us over the last 20 years, helping us push the boundaries on engine development.

“Whilst we say a fond farewell to our Queen of the Skies, we continue to innovate in testing with a combination of flying test beds, ground testing, and advanced digital modelling.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One FTB test with a difference took place in 2021, when it was used to test a Trent 1000 engine running on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, while its other three RB211 engines ran on “standard” jet fuel. The three-hour 54-minute flight from Tucson Airport, Arizona over Texas and New Mexico confirmed there were no engineering issues and was part of our wider, and now-completed, programme to confirm our in-production engines are compatible with 100% SAF.

Notably, this test was a key enabler to Virgin Atlantic’s world’s first transatlantic flight in 2023 using 100% SAF with a Trent 1000-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

This made Rolls-Royce the first jet engine manufacturer to publicly confirm all our in-production engines for long-haul aircraft and business jets are compatible with 100% SAF and was an important milestone for both Rolls-Royce and the wider aviation industry. It also provided further evidence of our commitment to becoming a net zero company by 2050 and supporting our customers to do the same.

At the time, Simon Burr, group director of ET&S, said: This is an important milestone, not just for Rolls-Royce, but also for the wider civil aerospace industry. We hope the success of these tests provides a level of technical validation that supports those who seek to invest in the production of 100% SAF going forward.”

UltraFan

From carbon/titanium fan blades to low-emission combustion systems, the FTB has been instrumental in validating UltraFan technologies under real-world conditions.

In 2014, a set of composite carbon/titanium (CTi) fan blades – designed for Advance and UltraFan engine designs – successfully took to the skies for the first time incorporated into the FTB, marking another major milestone for the programme.

More recently, the FTB has enabled Rolls-Royce to complete the latest phase of flight testing for its Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys). The insights gathered directly support UltraFan development by reducing risk and enhancing maturity of future combustion systems.

By testing these critical technologies in flight, the FTB ensures systems are ready for the next-generation of engines.

Pearl 10X

The FTB’s most noticeable test configuration came with the testing of the Pearl 10X. This engine is the third and most powerful member of the market-leading Pearl engine family for the business aviation market and has been optimised to exclusively power Dassault’s new flagship aircraft, the Falcon 10X. In order to complete its rigorous flight test programme, our teams had to design a bespoke pylon to enable it to sit on the FTB’s starboard wing, alongside two RB211s. On the port wing was a third RB211 and a Trent 1000, giving the FTB its unique and eye-catching five engine setup. While the cockpit contained engine controls for all five engines, the pilots focused on the RB211s and Trent 1000, while a Pearl 10X engine operator sat on the engineering deck next to the flight test engineer and controlled that engine, all the time maintaining continuous headset communication with the cockpit.

This testing programme showed the incredible flexibility of the aircraft, as well as the ingenuity of our people and partners to make the configuration work.",https://www.aero-mag.com/image-assets/273280ab777bccf9a0a3fa5a23fc7072.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 12:56:15.062101

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a critical tool in this transition, but its viability as a long-term investment hinges on balancing regulatory pressures, production scalability, and strategic corporate partnerships.

The Cost Conundrum of Green Mandates

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has been a vocal critic of policies that prioritize speed over feasibility. The EU’s mandate to import SAF from outside Europe, for instance, has been labeled “a great green scam” by IATA Director General Willie Walsh, who argues that the policy ignores the carbon footprint of transporting SAF across continents [1]. In 2025, SAF costs in Europe are 4.2 times higher than conventional jet fuel—a jump from 3.1 times in 2024—largely due to compliance fees imposed by suppliers under EU and UK regulations [2]. These fees, which IATA calls “profiteering,” have added $1.7 billion in costs to airlines this year alone [3].

The association warns that such mandates risk stifling innovation by diverting capital from research and development to compliance. IATA estimates that achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will require $4.7 trillion in investment, a figure that should not be inflated by policies that prioritize political expediency over economic realism [1].

Strategic Partnerships as a Path Forward

British Airways, however, offers a counterpoint to IATA’s skepticism. The airline has signed multi-year SAF supply agreements with companies like EcoCeres and Twelve, aiming to use at least 10% SAF by 2030 under the UK government’s mandate [4]. These partnerships leverage waste-based feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, to produce SAF with up to 80% lower lifecycle emissions than traditional jet fuel [4].

But British Airways’ strategy goes beyond procurement. The airline and its parent company, IAG, are co-investing in SAF production facilities to reduce costs and secure supply chains. This approach mirrors IATA’s call for government incentives over mandates, as private-sector investment can drive economies of scale. For example, British Airways’ parent company has committed to funding SAF plants that convert non-competitive feedstocks into fuel, a move that could lower production costs and increase availability [5].

Scalability Challenges and Market Realities

Despite these efforts, scalability remains a major hurdle. SAF currently accounts for just 0.7% of global airline fuel consumption in 2025, and production must increase exponentially to meet regulatory targets [3]. The industry faces three key constraints:

1. Feedstock Limitations: Waste-based biomass, the primary feedstock for SAF, is finite and often diverted from other renewable energy sectors [4].

2. Supply Chain Complexity: Producing SAF requires integrating disparate logistics networks for feedstock collection, refining, and distribution—a process that is both capital-intensive and geographically fragmented [2].

3. Cost Barriers: Even with co-investment, SAF remains 4.2 times more expensive than conventional fuel, deterring widespread adoption without subsidies [2].

Regulatory Dynamics: A Double-Edged Sword

The tension between mandates and incentives underscores a broader debate: Should regulators enforce strict SAF quotas, or should they prioritize market-driven solutions? IATA advocates for the latter, urging governments to harmonize global SAF policies to avoid a patchwork of conflicting regulations [3]. For instance, the EU’s focus on importing SAF has created a “carbon leakage” risk, where airlines shift operations to regions with laxer environmental rules [1].

British Airways’ experience suggests that a hybrid approach—combining targeted mandates with financial incentives—could work. The airline’s partnerships are supported by UK government grants for SAF infrastructure, illustrating how policy can align with private-sector goals [5].

Conclusion: Weighing Risks and Opportunities

For investors, SAF presents a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The sector’s growth is contingent on resolving three key questions:

1. Can production costs be slashed through technological innovation and scale?

2. Will governments shift from punitive mandates to incentive-based policies?

3. Can airlines like British Airways replicate their partnership models across the industry?

The answers will determine whether SAF becomes a cornerstone of aviation’s green transition or a cautionary tale of overambitious regulation. For now, the path forward requires a delicate balance—leveraging corporate innovation while pushing for regulatory frameworks that prioritize practicality over political theater.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 12:56:18.346636

– AU$100 million+ committed to SAF from the AU$400 million Climate Fund.","(SYDNEY) Qantas has stepped up its clean-fuel push with a run of 2025 moves that put sustainable aviation front and center on trans‑Tasman and long‑haul routes, while pressing Canberra for policy support to build a homegrown supply chain.

In May, working with Sydney Airport and Ampol, the carrier completed Australia’s largest-ever commercial importation of SAF, landing nearly 2 million litres of unblended SAF from Malaysia for blending and use in Sydney’s fuel system. The batch is being blended at about 18% with conventional jet fuel and is set to power roughly 900 Qantas and Jetstar flights between Sydney and Auckland. Qantas estimates those operations will cut about 3,400 tonnes of carbon dioxide—roughly the same as taking 800 cars off the road for a year—showing how targeted use of sustainable aviation fuel can deliver real, near-term cuts even as wider industry change takes time.

Recent commitments and operational context

Qantas says this is not a one-off. In August, the airline announced it will use more than 100 million litres of SAF per year from Los Angeles International Airport for the next three years, a major boost to its international uptake.

Over the past financial year (July 2024–June 2025), Qantas reported:

– Lower fuel costs overall but higher total fuel consumption.

– Average SAF use of 181 barrels per day (about 0.2% of total fuel burned), up 5% from 172 barrels per day the prior year.

This is a small share but represents a steady lift in a system that depends on strict testing, supply chain adjustments, and airport infrastructure.

Funding, partnerships and strategic goals

Qantas frames these steps as part of a broader climate plan anchored by its AU$400 million Climate Fund. More than AU$100 million from that pool is now directed at SAF and other decarbonisation work.

Key strategic elements:

– Scale up supply quickly where possible.

– Prove demand through real-world use on scheduled flights.

– Help build first local plants able to produce large volumes at competitive prices.

Notable investments and partnerships:

– In April 2025, Qantas and Airbus invested AU$15 million in Climate Tech Partners, a venture fund focused on early-stage SAF technologies.

– Sydney Airport signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Qantas targeting 50% of all fuel uplift at the airport coming from SAF by 2050.

Coalition building and demand signaling

Qantas leads a SAF coalition with 15 major Australian and global companies, including Australia Post, Accenture, ANZ, BCG, Commonwealth Bank, Deloitte, Fortescue, IMC, ING Australia, PwC Australia, Raytheon Australia, Sydney Airport, Woodside Energy, and Xero.

Many coalition members use a book‑and‑claim model—an accounting approach that lets them pay to support SAF used on certain flights even if their employees’ flights do not physically use that exact fuel. The aim is to speed demand signals while the physical supply chain catches up.

Targets and regulatory context

Public targets:

– 10% SAF in Qantas’s total fuel mix by 2030

– 60% by 2050

– Net Zero by 2050

These align with global aviation regulator direction and international mandates such as Europe’s ReFuelEU policy and the UK’s planned SAF mandate, which are raising blend levels and driving production targets.

Economic and national benefits of onshore production

Qantas argues onshore production could deliver broad national benefits:

– Potentially add about AU$13 billion to GDP per year by 2040

– Support around 13,000 jobs in feedstock supply

– Create about 5,000 roles at new facilities

Benefits include fuel security, turning local waste streams and sustainable crops into jet fuel to buffer against global oil shocks and supply bottlenecks. Fiona Messent, Qantas’s Chief Sustainability Officer, called SAF the airline’s most workable near-term decarbonisation tool, stressing jobs, resilience, and long-term cost control from building capacity onshore.

Airbus partnership and government asks

Airbus has become a close partner. Julie Kitcher, Airbus’s Chief Sustainability Officer, has said scaling SAF requires new ways of working across the sector and that Australia is well placed to lead.

Joint asks to government:

– Direct incentives and research grants for the first two to three domestic producers.

– Ongoing support for 10–15 years to lower investment risk and accelerate industry build-out.

Existing SAF contracts and passenger impact

SAF history and supply:

– Qantas began buying SAF in 2022 (London Heathrow and California).

– Current contracts supply around 10 million litres/year from Heathrow and 20 million litres/year from California.

– New Los Angeles commitment: >100 million litres/year for three years (starting 2025).

Passenger experience:

– The shift is largely invisible to passengers: blended fuel meets strict standards, burns cleanly in existing engines, and requires no changes to aircraft hardware.

How SAF is processed and delivered at Sydney

The process at Sydney follows a clear chain:

1. Importation: Unblended SAF arrives at a local terminal such as Ampol’s Kurnell facility.

2. Blending: SAF is mixed with conventional jet fuel at about 18%.

3. Testing and Certification: Strict lab testing and certification to meet aviation standards.

4. Distribution: Certified blend enters the airport’s supply network and is loaded onto aircraft.

5. Usage and Reporting: Airlines use the blend on scheduled flights and track emissions savings.

This May shipment will power about 900 Sydney–Auckland flights, providing a pilot large enough to deliver measurable emissions cuts and to prove operational readiness.

Scale-up: from imports to industry build‑out

Qantas’s Climate Fund (AU$400 million) plus AU$100 million+ directed to SAF aims to bridge early pilots and steady supply.

The airline’s pitch to government:

– Focus support on a limited number of first producers to reach commercial output sooner.

– Align Australia with the US and Europe, where public policy already drives early SAF plants.

Analysis from VisaVerge.com notes that markets with long-term support attract the first commercial refineries, while late movers face higher catch-up costs or continued import reliance.

Regional economic and workforce impacts

Qantas forecasts:

– AU$13 billion annual GDP boost by 2040

– Roughly 18,000 combined jobs across feedstock and facilities

Skills needed range from chemical engineering and quality control to logistics and project finance, requiring training programs and regional planning to match plant build-outs.

Policy stakes and recommendations

Industry position:

– Targeted production incentives

– Support for research and early engineering

– Clear, bankable rules lasting 10–15 years

Environmental groups welcome momentum but urge:

– Faster action

– Robust feedstock rules to ensure sustainability and prevent competition with food production

Market dynamics and corporate demand

Corporate travel buyers are monitoring SAF closely; many have emissions goals and can use book‑and‑claim to support SAF now.

As volumes grow, corporations will expect broader physical access to blended fuel and routes covered by SAF, including across Asia.

Qantas’s coalition provides a forum to coordinate demand and share costs to keep the early market viable.

Technical, logistical and safety considerations

The May import shows the detailed nuts-and-bolts required:

– Import paperwork, blending, lab testing, certification, and on‑airport distribution must align.

– Each step includes safety checks to ensure blended fuel meets global standards.

– Operational data from the Sydney–Auckland flights will help engineers and teams refine processes before larger volumes arrive.

Airports and energy companies will need hardware upgrades as blends rise:

– Storage tanks, pipelines, and blending equipment must meet safety and quality rules.

– Sydney’s early moves, supported by Ampol, indicate upgrades are manageable with planning.

Timeline and next milestones

Planned and expected developments:

– Planned biofuel facilities in Queensland and New Zealand, with output expected around 2028.

– To reach 10% SAF by 2030, local plants must feed major Australian airports within a few years, complementing imports.

– Australian government may announce production incentives and R&D backing within 12–18 months—policy certainty would help final investment decisions.

Summary — headline numbers and outlook

Key figures:

– Nearly 2 million litres of unblended SAF imported into Sydney (May 2025).

– Blended at about 18%, supporting roughly 900 flights and trimming ~3,400 tonnes of CO2.

– Qantas SAF average: 181 barrels per day in 2024–25 (up 5% year on year).

– >100 million litres/year locked in from Los Angeles for three years.

– AU$100 million+ committed to SAF from the AU$400 million Climate Fund.

– AU$15 million invested with Airbus into a venture fund for early-stage tech.

– MoU with Sydney Airport aimed at 50% SAF uplift by 2050.

These moves will not deliver net zero overnight but show a practical path to cutting aviation emissions while protecting long‑haul connectivity. If government policy supports the first local plants with incentives and R&D backing, Australia could transition from buyer of imported blends to regional producer—supporting jobs, fuel security, and more affordable SAF over time.

For travelers: aircraft, pilots and safety standards remain the same — the change is in the tanks.

By 2030, all Airbus aircraft and helicopters will be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF.

The A220 delivered to Air France came from Airbus’ Mirabel site in Canada where SAF management is done using mass balance.

""In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO₂ emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,"" said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada.

""And we're pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year.

“On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.""

Air France’s first A220-300s are part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft and began flying in its network in October 2021.

Alongside the capability to use SAF, these aircraft can deliver up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO₂ emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft.

Airbus has been using SAF in its operations for nearly a decade and has committed to increasing the share of SAF used to power its internal operations to at least 30% by 2030.

Platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM bring all that information together, helping operators shift from reactive fixes to proactive decisions that save time and money.
Hackers have started targeting building systems because they can be entry points to larger networks.
The rise of platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM reflects that change.","Commercial real estate is changing fast. What used to be a world of static systems and manual oversight is now shifting toward data-driven, automated environments. In 2025, that shift is only going to accelerate. Technology like edge computing and machine learning isn’t just for tech-forward developers anymore — it’s becoming the baseline for efficient, resilient buildings.

1. Edge computing: Decisions made on the spot

Think of edge computing as putting the “brain” of a building closer to where things happen. Instead of sending every piece of data to a remote server, the system processes much of it on-site.

Why does that matter? Because it lets buildings react in real time. Air conditioning adjusts when a meeting room fills up. Lighting dims as natural sunlight floods in. And if a sensor notices a mechanical issue, the system can trigger maintenance alerts immediately instead of waiting for overnight data syncing.

The bonus? It also cuts bandwidth use and keeps more sensitive building data in-house, which is increasingly important as cybersecurity standards tighten.

2. Machine learning: From numbers to action

Every modern building generates more data than most teams know what to do with. Machine learning changes that by spotting patterns humans can’t.

Over time, these systems learn what “normal” looks like for a specific building. They can flag subtle signs of equipment wear or tweak schedules for elevators and HVAC to better match actual use. Platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM bring all that information together, helping operators shift from reactive fixes to proactive decisions that save time and money.

It’s interesting to see how these tools change throughout time. The algorithms alter when tenant behavior changes or occupancy changes, so the building maintains working smoothly without anyone having to manually update every setting.

3. Regulations pushing smarter systems

New energy and emissions rules are showing up everywhere, from major cities to smaller municipalities. For CRE operators, that means keeping closer tabs on how buildings perform and proving compliance with hard data.

Smart systems simplify that. Real-time energy dashboards and automated reports turn what used to be weeks of manual checks into a streamlined process. For operators, it’s less about chasing compliance and more about using that same data to cut costs and improve sustainability scores — a win on both sides.

4. Making buildings feel better

Tenants don’t care about “edge nodes” or “ML models” — they just want spaces that work. Smart buildings are starting to deliver on that.

Imagine walking into your office and finding your preferred temperature already set. Or an app that tells you where the nearest meeting room is. These aren’t simply neat new items; they’re small, useful things that make buildings nicer and easier to get about.

And operators don’t have to step in all the time because the systems handle a lot of the fine-tuning in the background.

5. Cybersecurity: The quiet backbone

With more connected devices comes more risk. Hackers have started targeting building systems because they can be entry points to larger networks.

That’s why CRE operators are putting money into rigorous access controls, encryption, and networks that don’t trust anyone. These changes aren’t very spectacular, but they are incredibly necessary. Tenants want to know that their safety and information aren’t at risk because of systems that aren’t effectively safeguarded.

6. Breaking down system silos

Older buildings often run HVAC, lighting, and security on completely separate platforms. Integrating those systems used to be expensive and clunky. Now, open APIs and standardized protocols make it possible to connect them without replacing everything.

That means operators can get a full view of building performance — and make changes faster — while avoiding the cost of ripping out legacy systems.

7. Maintenance before breakdowns

One of the most practical benefits of smarter buildings is predictive maintenance. Instead of waiting for equipment to fail, sensors flag small changes that suggest trouble ahead — a slight vibration in a pump, or unusual motor temperatures.

Addressing these issues early avoids costly breakdowns and keeps tenants happier because downtime is rare. Over time, it also extends the lifespan of expensive systems, saving operators money.

8. Preparing for the unexpected

Resilience is becoming more and more important because of things like bad weather and power disruptions. Smart systems are also making things better here.

In an emergency, automated systems can adjust the flow of electricity, turn off systems that aren’t needed, or help people get to safety. Microgrids and on-site energy storage can keep vital services running even if the main grid goes down. It’s the kind of planning that helps when things don’t go as planned.

9. People first, tech second

A move toward human-centered design is what connects all of these themes. Technology is finally becoming invisible, operating in the background to make buildings safer, more efficient, and more comfortable.

The rise of platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM reflects that change. These technologies do more than just crunch figures; they help teams administer their buildings in a way that seems natural and responsive, not overbearing or too complicated.

Conclusion

The smartest buildings won’t have the most sensors or the most impressive dashboards by 2025. They’ll be the ones that make things go more smoothly, cut down on energy waste, and develop places that people really like.

Edge computing will keep decisions local and fast. Machine learning will help us make sense of all the data we have. Regulations can be a pain, but they will make the sector use better, more environmentally friendly methods. If operators are willing to accept this change, they will get facilities that are efficient, flexible, and ready for whatever comes next.",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skyline.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 11:56:32.811824

Strategic Investment in Clean Aviation Technology

Qantas has said that sustainability remains a ‘key priority’ for the airline group, adding that it has committed more than AU$100 million to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other decarbonisation projects. The investment represents a substantial commitment from the carrier as it works toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, aligning with the broader aviation industry’s ambitious climate targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The Australian carrier recently expanded its SAF uptake from Los Angeles, with a commitment to use more than 100 million litres of SAF over the next three years. This commitment forms part of a broader strategy that includes sourcing SAF from multiple international locations, including London’s Heathrow Airport and California-based suppliers.

In addition to direct fuel procurement, Qantas said that it also recently invested AU$15 million in ClimateTech Partners, a venture capital fund that supports climate-focused businesses and projects. This strategic investment demonstrates the airline’s commitment to fostering innovation across the broader sustainable aviation ecosystem.

Building Australia’s Domestic SAF Industry

One of the most significant aspects of Qantas’s sustainability strategy involves developing a local sustainable aviation fuel supply chain. On the domestic front, a partnership with Sydney Airport and a number of large corporate customers enabled the ‘largest ever importation of SAF into the country’, Qantas said, a move that served as a test of Sydney’s fuel infrastructure and demonstrated industry commitment in developing a local SAF supply chain, as well as supportive policy to enable greater SAF production in Australia.

The Qantas Group and Airbus will invest up to US$200 million to accelerate the establishment of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Australia in a landmark agreement. Due to the lack of a local commercial-scale SAF industry, Australia is currently exporting millions of tonnes of feedstock every year, such as canola and animal tallow to be made into SAF in other countries.

The airline has also made strategic investments in domestic production facilities. Agricultural by-products including sugarcane will be turned into jet fuel through investment from the Qantas Group, Airbus and the Queensland Government, at a Queensland biofuel production facility being developed by Jet Zero Australia in partnership with leading sustainable aviation fuel technology company LanzaJet. This facility is expected to produce up to 100 million litres of SAF annually once operational.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel Technology

Sustainable feedstocks include wastes for which the carbon has already been accounted in the use of the primary product or has been absorbed from the atmosphere in its production. Sustainable feedstocks are broken down through chemical processing before being built back up into a long chain hydro-carbon – making a sustainable jet fuel.

Sustainable fuels cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 80 per cent compared to traditional kerosene and are the most significant tool airlines currently have to reduce their impact on the environment – particularly given they can be used in today’s engines with no modifications. This compatibility with existing aircraft technology makes SAF a crucial bridge solution as the aviation industry develops longer-term zero-emission technologies.

Comprehensive Carbon Reduction Strategy

Beyond SAF investments, Qantas has restructured its approach to carbon offsetting. Qantas has also made adjustments to its Voluntary Carbon Program, with some 70% of its carbon portfolio now comprised of nature-based products, and half of that linked to an Australia-based project. This shift reflects growing industry recognition of the importance of high-quality carbon credits and local environmental benefits.

The airline has also expanded its community engagement initiatives. Elsewhere, Qantas has also expanded its community partnerships, signing a new four-year agreement with Surf Life Saving Australia and a three-year partnership with the Australian Red Cross, as well as donating some AU$2 million in grants to regional community groups.

Strong Financial Performance Underpins Sustainability Investment

The group reported a 15% increase in underlying profit before tax for the full year, to AU$2.39 billion, and said that it expects ‘ongoing strong travel demand’ into at least the first half of its current financial year. This robust financial performance provides Qantas with the resources necessary to invest heavily in sustainability initiatives during a critical period for aviation decarbonisation.

“For everyone across the Qantas Group, this year has been all about delivery,” commented CEO Vanessa Hudson. “While we are pleased with the progress we are making, we remain focused on further improving our performance and continuing to deliver for our customers, people and shareholders.”

Explosive Growth in Global SAF Market

Qantas’s investments come at a time of extraordinary growth in the global sustainable aviation fuel market. The sustainable aviation fuel market is estimated at USD 2.06 billion in 2025. It is projected to reach USD 25.62 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 65.5%. This represents one of the fastest-growing segments in the energy sector, driven by increasing regulatory pressure and airline commitments to net-zero emissions.

The global sustainable aviation fuel market was valued at USD 1.7 billion in 2024 and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 46.2% from 2025 to 2034. The aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, with growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions.

Regulatory Drivers and Industry Collaboration

The rapid expansion of SAF adoption is being driven by increasingly stringent environmental regulations worldwide. The European Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market is experiencing significant growth, driven by stringent environmental regulations and ambitious decarbonization targets set by the European Union. The ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates a progressive increase in SAF blending, starting at 2% in 2025 and aiming for 70% by 2050.

Qantas has joined an alliance of airlines, an aircraft manufacturer, and energy and financing companies to help accelerate global production of aviation biofuel. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance (SAFFA) fund has been formed with anchor-investor Airbus as well as Air France-KLM, Mitsubishi HC Capital Inc., BNP Paribas, Associated Energy Group, and Burnham Sterling Asset Management.

Industry Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite the promising growth trajectory, the SAF industry faces significant challenges. Their greatest concerns centre on the availability and cost of sustainable aviation fuel, along with geopolitical tensions and the tariffs associated with growing protectionism. Currently, SAF can cost several times more than conventional jet fuel, making industry collaboration and government support crucial for scaling production.

The actions that industry and governments across the world take this year will be vital to ensure the aviation sector remains on the right flight path to meet internationally agreed targets, including reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5% by 2030 and attaining net-zero international aviation by 2050.

Strategic Positioning for the Future

The Qantas Group, which has committed to using 10 per cent SAF in its overall fuel mix by 2030, is sourcing SAF overseas, including 15 percent of its fuel use out of London currently and 20 million litres each year for flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Australia from 2025. This diversified sourcing strategy positions Qantas to meet its sustainability targets while supporting the development of global SAF supply chains.

We’ve established Australia’s first coalition program to support the efforts to reduce the environmental impact of aviation through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Climate action is more effective together, and the Qantas Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition program offers our corporate partners the opportunity to help contribute to the development and future use of SAF.

As the aviation industry navigates the complex challenge of decarbonisation, Qantas’s substantial investment in sustainable aviation fuel represents both a strategic business decision and a commitment to environmental leadership. With the global SAF market projected to grow exponentially over the next decade, early investments in production capacity and supply chain development could provide significant competitive advantages while supporting the industry’s broader sustainability goals.

The success of these initiatives will be crucial not only for Qantas’s own net-zero ambitions but also for establishing Australia as a key player in the global sustainable aviation fuel market, potentially creating thousands of jobs and billions in economic value over the coming decades.

Green Energy Revolution Takes Center Stage

The largest project is Green Energy Mozambique, a US$3 billion industrial park in Sofala province that represents the centerpiece of the country’s ambitious energy transition strategy. The complex is expected to generate 10,000 direct jobs and boost production of key materials including aluminum, steel, cement, batteries, and solar panels, positioning Mozambique at the forefront of Africa’s renewable energy manufacturing sector.

This massive industrial development aligns with Mozambique’s broader $80 billion energy transition strategy announced by President Filipe Nyusi at COP28, which aims to leverage the country’s vast renewable resources to position it as a sustainable investment destination and regional energy hub by 2050.

The Green Energy Mozambique project reflects growing international confidence in the country’s renewable energy potential. With 23,000 GW of solar potential and global horizontal irradiation varying between 1,785 and 2,206 kWh/m²/year, Mozambique offers some of the most attractive conditions for solar development in Africa.

Foreign Investment Surge Demonstrates Confidence

More than 88% of total investment was directed to Sofala province, far ahead of the capital Maputo, reflecting a strategic shift toward developing the country’s industrial corridors and leveraging its extensive coastline and deep-water port infrastructure.

Foreign capital accounted for US$3.2 billion of the total investment, with contributions from investors spanning 25 countries. The funds mainly target industry, transport, communications, and services sectors, demonstrating international confidence in Mozambique’s economic prospects despite ongoing challenges.

According to UNCTAD data, Mozambique ranked fourth in Africa for foreign direct investment inflows in 2024, reaching US$3.55 billion, up from US$2.5 billion in 2023 when it placed sixth. This significant improvement positions the country among Africa’s most attractive investment destinations.

The investment surge comes as Mozambique’s national electrification program has achieved remarkable progress, with electricity access rates rising from 31% in 2018 to 60% in 2024, according to Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM). This improvement in basic infrastructure has enhanced the country’s appeal to industrial investors.

Economic Recovery After Multiple Challenges

Prime Minister Levi said the results show the Mozambican economy is rebounding after climate shocks and post-election tensions, with the private sector driving growth. The investment approval figures represent a significant achievement considering the challenges Mozambique has faced, including the aftermath of the $2 billion hidden debt scandal that rocked the country in 2016, devastating cyclones, and ongoing insurgency in the gas-rich northern Cabo Delgado province.

The country’s GDP growth is projected at 3% for 2025, recovering from 1.8% in 2024 and building on the 5.4% growth achieved in 2023. While modest, this trajectory represents steady progress for an economy that has weathered significant storms.

Strategic Policy Reforms Drive Investment Climate Improvement

The investment boom reflects the success of comprehensive reforms implemented by the Mozambican government. In recent years, Mozambique has pursued systematic reforms to attract capital, including the creation of the Investment and Export Promotion Agency (APIEX) and the adoption of a new investment law in 2023.

The revised investment law (nr. 8/2023) establishes new tax incentives for businesses, includes provisions to facilitate the transfer of land use rights (DUATs), and implements reforms specifically designed to encourage foreign direct investment. The country now offers comprehensive tax and customs incentives, along with special economic zones focused on agriculture, aquaculture, and less-developed regions.

These reforms have streamlined the investment process significantly. Foreign direct investment up to USD 250,000 no longer requires prior authorization from the Bank of Mozambique and only needs registration with commercial banks handling the transactions, reducing bureaucratic barriers that previously deterred smaller investors.

Massive Infrastructure Development Program

The investment approvals are supported by major international funding commitments that will provide the infrastructure foundation necessary for sustained economic growth. The World Bank recently approved the $100 million ASCENT Mozambique project, supplemented by an additional $31 million from the Mozambique Energy for All Multi-Donor Trust Fund, aimed at accelerating sustainable energy access across the country.

This project will provide new electricity access to nearly one million people, offer improved cooking solutions to 90,000 individuals, and connect 68 schools, clinics, and other public facilities over six years. Such infrastructure development is crucial for supporting the industrial expansion envisioned in the approved investment projects.

Additionally, the African Development Bank provided $2.5 million through its Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) to develop renewable energy resources, including feasibility studies for solar floating power plants and energy battery storage systems across 10 sites.

Energy Sector Transformation Drives Growth

The energy sector represents the cornerstone of Mozambique’s economic transformation strategy. The country has already commissioned 125 MW of solar power plants under public-private partnerships, with 60 MW already connected to the national grid through projects like Mocuba and Metoro.

Major international energy companies are making substantial commitments to Mozambique’s energy future. The consortium of EDF, TotalEnergies, and Sumitomo Corporation was selected to develop the massive 1,500 MW Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower project on the Zambezi River, representing one of the largest renewable energy investments in Southern Africa.

This project will contribute significantly to regional energy security while establishing Mozambique as a green energy hub for southern African countries. The development reflects the growing international recognition of Mozambique’s strategic importance in the regional energy landscape.

Natural Gas Resources Complement Renewable Strategy

While renewable energy dominates the current investment focus, Mozambique’s vast natural gas reserves continue to attract significant international attention. The country possesses 180 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, representing the third-largest reserves in Africa.

The Mozambique LNG project, despite facing security challenges in Cabo Delgado province, remains a cornerstone of the country’s long-term economic strategy. The project, which received a Final Investment Decision of US$20 billion in 2019, involves plans for approximately 65 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas through a two-unit liquefaction project with expansion capacity of up to 43 million tonnes per annum.

The European Union’s consideration of natural gas as a transitional green energy source has further enhanced the investment attractiveness of Mozambique’s gas sector, potentially opening new avenues for sustainable financing of gas-to-power projects.

Financial Support Mechanisms Strengthen Investment Appeal

Prime Minister Levi highlighted the launch of a US$250 million mutual guarantee fund during the FACIM fair to support economic recovery and expand private sector participation. This fund represents a crucial financial mechanism to de-risk investments and encourage broader private sector engagement in the country’s development priorities.

The guarantee fund complements other international financial support mechanisms, including the IMF’s $456 million program approved in May 2022, which aims to reinforce Mozambique’s economic recovery while addressing challenges related to debt sustainability and encouraging good governance.

The country is also working with the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) on a second compact valued at approximately $500 million over five years, demonstrating sustained international confidence in Mozambique’s reform trajectory.

Regional Integration and Strategic Location

Mozambique’s geostrategic location as the gateway to landlocked countries in Southern Africa continues to attract logistics and transport investments. The country’s extensive coastline with deep-water ports, including the strategic ports of Maputo, Beira, and Nacala, positions it as a critical hub for regional trade flows.

The development of industrial corridors, particularly the Nacala corridor mentioned in the government’s energy strategy, represents a key component of the country’s approach to integrated development that combines infrastructure, energy, and industrial development in coordinated packages.

Domestic investment, while smaller at US$144 million, reflects growing confidence among local entrepreneurs and businesses in the country’s economic trajectory. This domestic participation is crucial for ensuring that economic growth benefits are broadly distributed across Mozambican society.

Challenges and Risk Mitigation Strategies

Despite the positive investment momentum, Mozambique continues to face significant challenges that require careful management. The ongoing insurgency in Cabo Delgado province, while primarily affecting the northern regions, continues to create security concerns that impact investor confidence, particularly in the extractive industries.

The country remains classified as being in debt distress, although its debt is assessed as sustainable on a forward-looking basis according to the African Development Bank. Poverty remains high at an estimated 74.5% in 2023, with about 24 million people living in poverty, highlighting the critical importance of ensuring that new investments translate into broad-based economic benefits.

Climate vulnerability represents another ongoing challenge, with Mozambique ranking among the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. However, the focus on renewable energy and climate-resilient infrastructure development in the current investment wave demonstrates the government’s commitment to building resilience while pursuing growth.

Future Outlook and Investment Prospects

The achievements announced during FACIM 2025 align with Mozambique’s strategy to strengthen its appeal to international investors while building local capacity and ensuring inclusive economic growth. The combination of policy reforms, international financial support, and major infrastructure investments creates a foundation for sustained economic expansion.

The success of the Green Energy Mozambique project and other major investments approved in the first half of 2025 could serve as catalysts for additional investment flows, particularly if the projects demonstrate successful implementation and positive returns for investors.

Looking ahead, Mozambique’s commitment to achieving universal energy access by 2030, combined with its vast renewable energy potential and strategic location, positions the country to play an increasingly important role in Africa’s economic development and energy transition.

The government’s ability to maintain political stability, continue implementing reforms, and effectively manage the security challenges in the north will be crucial factors determining the success of this ambitious investment program and the country’s broader economic transformation goals.

The investment approvals announced in H1 2025 represent more than just economic statistics – they signal Mozambique’s emergence as a serious contender in Africa’s race for sustainable development and energy leadership, offering hope for millions of citizens seeking prosperity after years of adversity.

By 2032, millions of tonnes of green hydrogen—and its derivatives—could be flowing from Jamnagar.","When Reliance Industries dropped its blockbuster plan at the 2025 AGM, it wasn’t just another corporate update—it was a signal flare. India’s gearing up to turbocharge hydrogen production and rewrite the playbook on sustainable energy. Under the fresh leadership of Anant Ambani, the aim is to fire up a battery gigafactory by 2026 and ramp green hydrogen output to three million tonnes a year by 2032. And they’re doing it all at Jamnagar in Gujarat, the same campus already famous for housing one of the world’s biggest refineries.

From Refineries to Renewables

It’s wild to think that the sprawling site where Dhirubhai Ambani kick-started Reliance back in 1966—dominating oil refining and petrochemicals—is now morphing into the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex. With seamless road and marine links to Kandla port, Jamnagar is perfectly poised to feed both homegrown demand and export markets. The burning question? How fast can this pivot propel India toward its National Green Hydrogen Mission of five million tonnes by 2030, all while accelerating industrial decarbonization?

Battery Gigafactory by 2026

First up on the clean-energy hit list is a state-of-the-art battery gigafactory. Reliance plans to crank it up within two years, churning out advanced lithium-ion cells at gigawatt-hour scale. These batteries will do more than store power—they’ll smooth out the ups and downs of solar and wind, shore up industrial storage, and juice up transport applications. Thanks to the massive scale at Jamnagar, the idea is to slash costs, secure domestic supply chains, and make a real dent in industrial decarbonization.

Scaling Green Hydrogen

The real headline, though, is the gargantuan push into green hydrogen. By 2032, they’re targeting three million tonnes a year, all made via water electrolysis powered by solar and wind. On-site electrolysers will split water into hydrogen and oxygen with zero carbon emissions. That hydrogen can feed steel mills and fertilizer plants or turn into derivatives like green ammonia and methanol, making it a linchpin for deeper decarbonization and building out robust hydrogen infrastructure.

An Integrated Clean Fuel Ecosystem

What really makes Reliance’s strategy stand out is full value-chain integration. Beyond batteries and electrolysers, they’ve mapped out:

Solar module production to generate clean electricity

Electrolyser factories churning out gear for massive hydrogen production

Conversion plants for green ammonia and methanol

Units dedicated to sustainable aviation fuel, targeting one of the toughest sectors to decarbonize

By weaving all these pieces together, Reliance aims to capture value at every step, cut inefficiencies, shorten supply chains, and pump out export-ready fuel derivatives.

Strategic Ripples

This isn’t just about hitting lofty numbers. We’re talking new jobs and high-tech manufacturing skills pouring into Gujarat, sparking fresh industrial clusters around Jamnagar. On the home front, reliable battery storage and a steady hydrogen supply will boost grid stability and trim fossil-fuel dependence. On the global stage, exporting green ammonia and methanol could swing trade balances in India’s favor, cementing its status as a go-to clean-energy supplier.

Of course, there are hurdles: keeping these new fuels cost-competitive against traditional options, scaling electrolysis technology, and building out comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure. But Reliance’s big move dovetails with a worldwide rush—governments and companies alike are racing to lock in green-hydrogen ground before the market standards snap into place.

The Road Ahead

Come 2026, we should see the first batteries rolling off the line. By 2032, millions of tonnes of green hydrogen—and its derivatives—could be flowing from Jamnagar. The true test will be whether this end-to-end approach can drive down costs, spark exports, and help India—and Reliance—lead the global clean-energy transition. One thing’s for sure: this pivot is worth watching.",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/resized-1756490719682.jpeg,N,,2025-09-01 10:56:36.492519

The regulatory reforms, privatization efforts, and strategic partnerships are creating a fertile ground for international investment.","Kenya’s oil sector is undergoing a transformative phase, marked by regulatory reforms, privatization initiatives, and strategic partnerships that are reshaping the investment landscape for international energy firms. As the country moves closer to commercializing its long-anticipated oil reserves, the opportunities for foreign investors are expanding, but so are the complexities of navigating a rapidly evolving market.

A Regulatory Framework Designed for Investment

The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) has been central to Kenya’s efforts to create a transparent and investor-friendly environment. By the end of 2025, EPRA aims to finalize seven key upstream regulations, including local content requirements, cost management, and environmental standards. These rules mandate foreign firms to partner with local companies, prioritize Kenyan goods and services, and invest in staff training and research collaborations with Kenyan institutions [1]. Such provisions not only align with global best practices but also ensure that foreign investment contributes to local economic development.

The emphasis on local content is particularly significant. For instance, Gulf Energy’s acquisition of Tullow Oil’s assets in the South Lokichar Basin—a project expected to produce 100,000 barrels per day by 2026—has already demonstrated the importance of local partnerships. Gulf Energy’s ability to secure regulatory approval for its Field Development Plan (FDP) hinges on its commitment to these local content requirements [2].

Privatization and Market Liberalization

Kenya’s privatization agenda is another critical entry point for international investors. The government’s decision to launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) in September 2025, offering up to 65% of its shares to the public, signals a broader push to open the energy sector to private capital. This move is part of a sweeping privatisation plan aimed at raising funds for the 2025/2026 budget and deepening Kenya’s capital markets [3].

The KPC IPO is not just a financial milestone but a strategic one. By partnering with Capital FM to communicate its sustainability and energy efficiency initiatives, KPC is positioning itself as a modern, transparent entity—a model that could attract both institutional and retail investors [4]. For international firms, this privatization trend underscores the potential for long-term partnerships in infrastructure and logistics, particularly as Kenya seeks to expand its oil export capabilities.

Strategic Partnerships and Collaborative Models

Kenya’s energy sector is increasingly defined by strategic alliances between local and international players. The National Oil Corporation of Kenya (NOC) has recently partnered with RUBiS Energy Kenya, a non-equity strategic partner, to revitalize its operations. This collaboration includes financial support, technical expertise, and plans to rebrand and expand NOC’s retail network [5]. Such partnerships highlight the value of hybrid models that combine foreign capital with local market knowledge.

Similarly, Kenya’s renewed oil supply agreement with Gulf state-owned giants—Saudi Aramco, Emirates National Oil, and Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation—extends a 180-day credit framework for fuel imports, ensuring energy security while providing fiscal flexibility [6]. These agreements, which build on Kenya’s historical ties with the Gulf, illustrate how international firms can leverage existing relationships to secure a foothold in the market.

The Road Ahead: Licensing Rounds and Renewable Synergies

Kenya’s upcoming oil and gas licensing round, scheduled for September 2025, will offer 10 exploration blocks to international firms, signaling the government’s intent to accelerate resource development [7]. This round, coupled with the anticipated commercialization of the Lokichar Basin by 2026, creates a window for firms to secure exploration rights before the market matures.

However, Kenya’s energy strategy is not solely focused on oil. The country is also a leader in renewable energy, with strong progress in geothermal, solar, and clean cooking solutions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has highlighted Kenya’s commitment to universal electricity access and its pioneering role in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) [8]. For international firms, this dual focus on traditional and renewable energy presents opportunities to diversify their portfolios, particularly as global demand for cleaner energy grows.

Conclusion: A Market at the Crossroads

Kenya’s oil sector is at a pivotal juncture. The regulatory reforms, privatization efforts, and strategic partnerships are creating a fertile ground for international investment. Yet, success will depend on firms’ ability to navigate a complex landscape that balances commercial interests with local development goals. For those willing to engage deeply—with a focus on collaboration, sustainability, and adaptability—Kenya offers not just a market, but a platform for shaping the future of energy in Africa.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 10:56:45.813302

By Farhiya Farah

The Africa Climate Summit I (ACS I), held in Nairobi from 4–6 September 2023, was positioned as Africa’s moment to reclaim its influence in global climate diplomacy.

Building on the outcomes of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Nairobi Summit centred on climate finance, locally led solutions, nature-based approaches, and green energy.

The resulting Nairobi Declaration mapped out policy and financing pathways for a unified African position, called for reforms to global financial systems, and tasked the African Union Commission (AUC) with developing an implementation framework.

While institutionalising ACS as a biennial AU process was a breakthrough, critics, including the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), argued that the Declaration fell short by failing to consolidate political will and adequately centre frontline communities.

Concerns included underfunding, overreliance on carbon markets, and limited inclusion of civil society and Indigenous peoples.

Gaps identified after Nairobi

Despite significant pledges (USD 26 billion), the Nairobi Summit revealed three key gaps:

Insufficient finance: Funding fell far short of the promised USD 100 billion annually. Adaptation remained underfunded, and access to finance was often slow, complex, and costly.

Division among African states: Some countries advocated for continued fossil fuel use and reliance on carbon markets, while others pushed for a cleaner, faster energy transition.

Weak inclusion: Civil society, Indigenous communities, and local actors felt sidelined, undermining legitimacy.

Progress Since Nairobi.

Despite the shortcomings, four areas of progress have emerged:

Loss and Damage Fund: Established at COP28, hosted by the World Bank, with initial pledges to support water, health, and early warning systems.

Mission 300: A World Bank Group and AfDB initiative to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030, with new financial backers. However, clean cooking remains underfunded.

Carbon Market Infrastructure: The AfDB launched an Africa Carbon Credit Support Facility to help countries establish MRV systems and ensure high-integrity credits.

AU Cadence: The ACS was institutionalised as a biennial AU event, and Kenya has advanced implementation through regulatory and policy frameworks — including the Climate Change (Carbon Markets) Regulations 2024, a National Cooking Transition Strategy (2024–2028), geothermal projects, and a Green Hydrogen Strategy.

ACS II in Addis Ababa (2025) – Expectations

The upcoming ACS II (September 8–10, 2025) in Addis Ababa is expected to consolidate Nairobi’s gains ahead of COP30 in Belém, Brazil. It faces heightened pressure to demonstrate delivery, especially in finance, nature protection, and fair transition planning before updated NDCs in 2025/26.

Key Proposals for Addis Ababa

AU Delivery Scoreboard: A quarterly, public “report card” showing progress on energy, cooking, finance disbursement, carbon market deals, and safeguards.

Finance Architecture Reform: Channel at least USD 100 billion in Special Drawing Rights through AfDB, set MDB lending stretch targets, add climate “debt-pause” clauses, and publish clear timelines.

Energy & Grids Roadmap: Reaffirm the 300 GW renewable energy by 2030 goal with detailed cross-border corridor and storage plans.

Article 6 Starter-Kit: Develop standard AU-wide templates and safeguards for carbon trading, ensuring integrity and benefit-sharing for communities.

Trade & Compliance Facility: Help African exporters adapt to the EU’s CBAM and EUDR rules and develop Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and green shipping corridors.

Broader Implications for African Climate Advocacy

The biennial ACS process gives Africa 18–24 months to design projects, adjust enabling frameworks (procurement, tariffs, safeguards), and then check progress. To ensure credibility and inclusivity, Addis Ababa must:

Put people at the centre: Fund youth-led initiatives, dedicate clean-cooking funds, and enshrine FPIC for Indigenous communities.

Back local solutions with real finance: Scale mini-grids, solar home systems, and clean cooking into full national programs; set up one-stop national “front doors” for climate finance; and budget for nature as infrastructure.

Ensure fairness and transparency: Adopt clear benefit-sharing rules, effective complaints mechanisms, and public disclosure of carbon/nature finance distribution.

Conclusion

The Nairobi Summit raised ambition but left gaps in finance, unity, and inclusivity. Addis Ababa must move from promises to delivery, with measurable outputs such as megawatts on the grid, households accessing clean cooking, finance disbursed on time, and community-benefiting carbon deals.

Nairobi promised; Addis must deliver.

The recent announcement by DHL Express and Cathay Pacific highlights a progressive step toward cleaner skies. Their agreement to use 2,400 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through Cathay’s subsidiary, Air Hong Kong, reflects an intent to lower greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the region’s journey toward sustainable aviation.

This collaboration is more than just a fuel deal. It signals a shift in how global logistics and air cargo leaders are embracing innovation to reduce environmental impact. By drawing attention to real-world solutions, such partnerships encourage both industry and society to rethink the future of transport.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

Aviation is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize. Aircraft rely heavily on fossil-based jet fuel, and emissions from aviation account for a significant share of global greenhouse gases. Sustainable aviation fuel presents a near-term solution by reducing lifecycle emissions compared to conventional fuel.

Yet, despite its promise, SAF makes up less than one percent of the world’s jet fuel consumption. Scaling its production and adoption is critical if the industry wants to meet climate goals. Partnerships like the one between DHL and Cathay are important because they create real demand that encourages producers and suppliers to expand capacity.

The Scope of the Agreement

The SAF secured under this partnership will be used for Air Hong Kong flights departing from key Asian hubs:

Seoul Incheon International Airport

Tokyo Narita International Airport

Singapore Changi Airport

These airports are central to regional and global logistics. By incorporating SAF on routes leaving such strategic gateways, the impact becomes visible across multiple trade corridors. It demonstrates that sustainability can be woven into operations without compromising efficiency.

A Signal of Industry Leadership

DHL and Cathay Pacific are not new to sustainability discussions, but this agreement elevates their commitment into tangible action. Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations and Aviation in Asia Pacific at DHL Express, underscored the importance of scaling SAF. He noted that while SAF is still a small fraction of global jet fuel, increasing its use is vital to drive momentum for production and demand.

In practical terms, this sends a message to other cargo carriers, passenger airlines, and logistics companies: decarbonization is possible when businesses invest in alternatives and commit to scaling them.

Building Momentum in Asia

Asia is both a hub of economic activity and a region heavily affected by climate challenges. The decision to expand SAF usage here is symbolic as well as strategic. It aligns with broader efforts across the region to transition toward cleaner energy and supports governments aiming to reduce emissions without stifling economic growth.

This regional focus is also significant because Asia hosts some of the world’s busiest airports. Small steps taken here can amplify global results, given the volume of traffic and trade passing through. By embedding SAF into these supply chains, companies help normalize sustainable practices within international commerce.

The Broader Ripple Effect

Adopting SAF in aviation does more than reduce emissions from individual flights. It sends a signal across multiple sectors:

Fuel producers are encouraged to scale up SAF production and explore new feedstocks.

Airports are motivated to develop infrastructure to support SAF fueling.

Policy makers are shown that industry actors are serious about sustainability, which can shape regulatory support and incentives.

Customers gain confidence that logistics and transport partners are aligning with their own sustainability goals.

These ripple effects multiply the influence of a single agreement, showing how one partnership can inspire systemic change.

Making Sustainability Practical

For businesses, the question often is how to balance environmental responsibility with operational performance. The DHL and Cathay Pacific deal illustrates that sustainability is not abstract. It is about making practical decisions today that move industries closer to a low-carbon future.

Air cargo is indispensable for global supply chains, from e-commerce to critical medical shipments. Making this sector greener without slowing it down is essential. SAF provides a realistic pathway, and its adoption by leading players proves that environmental responsibility and commercial necessity can align.

Lessons for the Industry

Other companies within aviation and logistics can learn key lessons from this partnership:

Collaboration is essential – airlines, cargo carriers, and fuel producers must work together to make SAF viable at scale.

Regional strategies matter – targeting specific hubs can maximize impact and visibility.

Transparency builds trust – openly sharing commitments and actions builds credibility with customers and regulators.

Early adopters set the tone – those who act first influence the pace of adoption across the entire industry.

Looking Ahead

This deal between DHL and Cathay Pacific is unlikely to remain an isolated move. As climate pressures mount and stakeholders demand accountability, more aviation players will need to embrace SAF. The challenge lies in expanding supply, reducing costs, and ensuring that sustainability remains a central element of business strategy.

By proving that SAF can be integrated into major cargo operations across Asia, DHL and Cathay are paving the way for broader adoption. What begins as a single agreement today can become an industry-wide norm tomorrow.

Conclusion

The partnership between DHL Express and Cathay Pacific to use sustainable aviation fuel represents a forward-looking commitment to greener skies in Asia. While challenges remain in scaling SAF production, such initiatives highlight that progress is possible when leaders choose action over hesitation.

For the aviation sector, the road to net zero will require bold steps, creative partnerships, and consistent investment. By leading from the front, DHL and Cathay show that sustainability and efficiency can go hand in hand. The hope is that this momentum continues, inspiring others across the industry to join the journey toward cleaner air transport and a more sustainable global future.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-9.svg,N,,2025-09-01 13:56:37.426758

The conversations throughout the event made it clear that the country’s agribusiness is moving at full speed, driven by ambitious goals that reflect its central role in shaping the future of sustainable energy. However, the consensus among most discussions is that agricultural strength alone will not be enough to achieve these objectives. Longstanding challenges such as infrastructure bottlenecks and limited access to capital remain, while new demands from the green economy, such as traceability, diversification of feedstocks and sustainability certification, add further complexity.

Here are the highlights of what we learned at the event.

Industry participants were optimistic about Brazil’s biodiesel sector, with growing momentum toward higher blend mandates. The government’s current target of B15 is expected to move toward B20 in the coming years, with participants suggesting that even B25 could be viable in the medium term.

The implementation of higher mandates was seen as both a growth opportunity and a challenge.

While it would reinforce Brazil’s role as a global biofuels leader, speakers highlighted the need for continued investment in refining capacity, logistics and quality assurance to ensure smooth adoption at scale.

Feedstock expansion positions Brazil as a global growth driver

Optimism extended beyond biodiesel and into the wider feedstock market. Brazil’s soybean crushing and production continue to expand at a pace above the global average, reinforcing its position as a critical supplier for both domestic consumption and international demand.

Some panelists noted that diversification of feedstocks (e.g., corn oil, animal fats and future-generation inputs such as used cooking oil) will be essential to secure supply for a growing biofuels sector. While soy remains dominant, the industry is actively seeking ways to mitigate risks tied to land use and environmental pressures by broadening its feedstock base.

Traceability and certification emerge as key challenges

As global markets tighten sustainability requirements, the region’s biofuels industry faces increasing pressure to implement robust traceability and certification systems. Some discussions assessed the role of technologies such as blockchain and satellite monitoring in guaranteeing transparency across the supply chain.

Participants warned that without consistent standards and enforcement, Brazilian exporters could face market access risks in regions such as Europe and North America, where regulators and consumers are increasingly demanding verified low-carbon products.

Infrastructure and financing remain bottlenecks

Despite strong growth prospects, speakers acknowledged that infrastructure limitations continue to weigh on the competitiveness of Brazil’s biofuels sector. Access to capital markets was also highlighted as a barrier, with financing costs and credit availability remaining uneven across different regions of the country.

Public-private partnerships and targeted government incentives were pointed out as potential solutions, with calls for greater collaboration to unlock investments in logistics and processing facilities.

Brazil seen as cornerstone of global decarbonization

The overarching theme of the conference was Brazil’s strategic importance in the global decarbonization agenda. With abundant agricultural resources, expanding production capacity and growing policy support, the country is well positioned to play a central role in meeting rising global demand for renewable fuels.

Speakers highlighted that Brazil’s scale and resource base give it a competitive advantage few regions can match, while also reflecting upon the fact that global expectations are rising quickly.

It became clear that the road ahead will not be one without obstacles. However, participants agreed that the resilience of South America’s agribusiness, combined with stronger collaboration across government, finance and industry, will be essential to sustaining growth.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2025/07/greenenergy-immingham-biofuel-plant.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 09:56:17.109263

The facility will later be modularly scaled up to 100 GWh per annum, announced Anant Ambani, executive Director of RIL, during the company’s annual general meeting recently.

The battery factory is located within the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which also houses gigafactories for solar modules and electrolyzers.

Ambani said RIL’s electrolyzer gigafactory is also scheduled to start production by the end of 2026. This facility will have the capacity to scale up to 3 GW per year, enabling cost-competitive production of green hydrogen at a global scale. The electrolyzer plant is backed by exclusive global technology partnerships and RIL’s in-house capabilities.

The solar PV manufacturing facility at the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex is already operational. It has successfully produced its first 200 MW of high-efficiency heterojunction technology (HJT) solar modules. “These modules are demonstrating industry-leading performance—delivering 10% higher energy yield, 20% better temperature tolerance, and 25% lower degradation,” said Ambani. RIL plans to scale this facility to 10 GW of annual solar PV manufacturing capacity in the coming quarters, with further expansion to 20 GW, making it the largest and most integrated single-site solar manufacturing complex in the world.

Together, these platforms will create a multi-pronged, gigawatt-scale clean energy ecosystem housing solar, battery storage, and green hydrogen production equipment all under one roof. “This integrated approach not only delivers scale but also builds a competitive edge in cost, technology, and supply chain resilience, positioning Reliance to capture significant value as the global energy transition accelerates,” said Ambani.

“Reliance will be the world’s only fully integrated, self-sufficient new energy company,” he added.

Ambani said that work on the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is progressing at a record pace. It will be unmatched globally in size, scale and integration. The Complex spans 44 million square feet of built-up area, equivalent to four times the size of the Tesla Gigafactory.

With this, Jamnagar becomes the cradle of both the world’s largest conventional energy complex and the world’s largest new energy complex.

RIL is also developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects in Kutch, Gujarat, spanning 550,000 acres of arid land, three times the size of Singapore. At peak construction, the site will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery storage containers daily. “This will be among the fastest installations globally. [Once operational] this single site could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity needs within the next decade,” said Ambani.

RIL’s marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla will connect seamlessly with solar and hydrogen production sites at Kutch, facilitating large-scale export of green hydrogen and its derivates as the company scales up to 3 million metric tons per annum of green hydrogen by 2032. “We will produce and export green ammonia, green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel. This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives. While our initial focus will be to meet Reliance’s own large captive demand, we plan to scale up to 3 million metric tons per annum of green hydrogen by 2032. This will unlock a powerful growth engine for global markets,” said Ambani.",https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/09/RIL-1200x603.png,N,,2025-09-01 11:57:14.155038

This valuation reflects a stock priced for optimism, given the company’s mixed financial performance and its strategic pivot toward renewable fuels and circular economy solutions. While the stock’s elevated P/E ratio raises questions about affordability, its operational transformation and industry tailwinds suggest a compelling case for long-term investors willing to navigate near-term volatility.

Financial Performance: A Tale of Two Segments

Darling’s Q2 2025 results underscored the duality of its business model. The Feed segment delivered robust performance, generating $135.9 million in adjusted EBITDA, driven by favorable pricing and stable raw material volumes [2]. This resilience contrasts sharply with the struggles of the Fuel segment, where Diamond Green Diesel (DGD)—its 50/50 renewable fuels joint venture—saw adjusted EBITDA plummet by 44% year-over-year to $42.6 million [1]. The decline stemmed from regulatory uncertainty, including delays in Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing and the transition from the blenders tax credit to the producer’s tax credit [4].

Despite these challenges, Darling’s balance sheet remains a bright spot. The company reduced net debt and achieved a leverage ratio of 3.34X as of June 28, 2025 [1]. Institutional ownership of 94.44% further signals confidence in its strategic direction [4].

Operational Transformation: From Waste to Value

Darling’s operational overhaul in 2025 is anchored in two pillars: renewable fuels and value-added protein products. The company’s DGD joint venture, a leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), sold 467.8 million gallons in H1 2025 at an average EBITDA of $0.22 per gallon [1]. With SAF plants operating at or near capacity and regulatory tailwinds like the 45Z tax credit extension to 2031, DGD’s margins are poised to recover [3].

Equally significant is Darling’s foray into the health and wellness market. The recent non-binding term sheet to form Nextida—a collagen and gelatin joint venture with Tessenderlo Group—highlights its ambition to monetize waste streams from animal agriculture into premium ingredients [1]. This move aligns with growing demand for plant-based and sustainable proteins, offering a new revenue stream beyond traditional waste management.

Industry Tailwinds and Regulatory Catalysts

The renewable fuels sector is undergoing a structural shift. U.S. policy developments, including the proposed Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) of 5.25 billion gallons and Trump-era biofuel blending mandates, are expected to boost feedstock prices and demand for green diesel [1]. Darling’s CEO, Randall Stuewe, has emphasized that these changes position the company for stronger performance in H2 2025 and beyond [1].

However, risks persist. Small refinery exemptions (SREs) and overcapacity in the biofuel market could dampen demand, as evidenced by Darling’s revised 2025 EBITDA guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion [5]. Analysts remain divided, with a consensus price target of $47 (38% upside) but a wide range from $36 to $50 [2].

Valuation: High P/E, Low ROE, and a Debt-Neutral Balance Sheet

Darling’s P/E ratio of 51.76 [2] is well above the S&P 500 average, reflecting investor expectations for future growth. Yet its Return on Equity (ROE) of 2.45% [2] is underwhelming, suggesting limited shareholder returns. The Debt-to-Equity ratio of 0.90 [3] indicates moderate leverage, but refinancing risks could emerge if interest rates rise.

For the stock to justify its current valuation, Darling must deliver on its operational transformation. The success of DGD’s SAF business, the scalability of Nextida, and the company’s ability to navigate regulatory headwinds will be critical.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on the Future

Darling Ingredients at $33.96 is a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The stock’s valuation is stretched, but its strategic alignment with renewable fuels and circular economy trends offers asymmetric upside. Investors who can stomach near-term volatility—such as SRE-related demand fluctuations or RIN price swings—may find value in Darling’s long-term vision. As the company executes its transformation, the key question remains: Can it convert waste into wealth faster than its peers?",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 07:56:10.941664

The WRI examined more than 1,000 sustainability goals set by nearly 700 of the world’s largest companies and found that while most have put in place targets related to climate and nature, people are often left out of the story – just 3% have set commitments to improve working conditions or invest in skills development.

Fit for the future

“If you are building a supply chain for the future, you can’t just cut emissions — you have to factor in the billions of people doing the work,” commented Eliot Metzger, WRI’s director of sustainable business and innovation.

“Right now, most large companies are overlooking the needs of the people essential to transforming their supply chains. This not only undermines companies’ sustainability targets but also the stability of their supply chains and their reputation.”

‘Elephant in the Boardroom’

According to the WRI‘s study, entitled Elephant in the Boardroom: People Are Missing in Corporate Supply Chain Goals, people-centred supply chain goals could focus on areas such as improving workplace safety through training and equipment, providing upskilling programmes, and ensuring fair pay and predictable timetables.

‘These actions can directly improve worker well-being while strengthening the resilience of the supply chain,’ the WRI noted.

It also found that around 90% of supply chain goals set by corporates ‘force’ smaller suppliers to comply with sustainability objectives without offering the support needed to meet them. It advocates for a partnership-based approach to emphasise mutual value.

‘This would involve larger companies engaging with suppliers to understand concrete challenges — such as financing equipment upgrades or training and retaining skilled workers — and then designing goals that provide the necessary support for suppliers to transition toward more sustainable operations,’ the WRI added.

Speaking at RIL’s annual general meeting on August 29, Anant Ambani, the company’s executive director said the solar park being built in Gujarat’s Kutch could meet nearly 10% of India's electricity needs within the next decade.

He, however, did not specify the total installed capacity planned for the solar project. Industry experts told Moneycontrol that the project would easily be upwards of 10 gigawatt (GW). To make the availability of renewable energy from the solar park round-the-clock, RIL is also setting up battery energy storage systems (BESS) at the site.

Also read: Government to make battery storage a must for renewable projects.

“In Kutch, Gujarat, we are developing one of the world's largest single-site solar projects spanning 5,50,000 acres of arid land – three times the size of Singapore. At peak, we will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. This will be among the fastest installations globally,” Ambani said.

He stated that the renewable energy produced in this solar park will be used for RIL’s plans to produce green hydrogen, green ammonia, green methanol and SAF. All these products need pure renewable energy in their respective production processes.

In Kutch, RIL also plans to build facilities for production of green ammonia, green methanol, and SAF. “Our marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla will connect seamlessly with solar and hydrogen at Kutch,” Ambani said adding that the company will also export the three new energy products mentioned above.

“This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives. While our initial focus will be to meet Reliance's own large captive demand, we plan to scale up to 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green hydrogen equivalent production capacity by 2032, thereby unlocking a powerful growth engine for global markets,” he said.

Reliance Industries is among the few companies that has secured incentives under India's National Green Hydrogen Mission for both green hydrogen production and electrolyser manufacturing.

Besides, RIL has also won incentives for solar module manufacturing under India's Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in both the first and second tranches, securing allocations of over Rs 19 billion in the first round and Rs 30.98 billion in the second round to develop integrated poly-to-module manufacturing facilities.

Hawaiian Airlines is taking a major step toward greener skies by introducing sustainable aviation fuel on its Osaka–Honolulu flights, a move made possible through a partnership with Cosmo Oil Marketing. This initiative aims to cut carbon emissions by up to 80% per flight, demonstrating how airlines can reduce their environmental footprint while continuing to connect passengers across continents.

Hawaiian Airlines (HA) is pioneering eco-friendly air travel by deploying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on its routes between Honolulu, Hawai’i, and Osaka, Japan.This initiative comes through a strategic agreement between HA’s parent company, Alaska Air Group Inc., and Cosmo Oil Marketing Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings Co., Ltd. Deliveries of SAF at Kansai International Airport (KIX) are scheduled to start this month, marking a milestone for the airline as it deploys SAF for the first time. Hawaiian Airlines highlights that SAF can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, demonstrating the airline’s commitment to lowering its environmental footprint.

While the use of sustainable aviation fuel is still emerging in the United States, its growth trajectory in 2025 is notable. Policies at both federal and state levels, alongside ambitious airline targets, are driving adoption, yet SAF consumption remains a small fraction of total aviation fuel use. Experts point out that the expansion of SAF production is essential to achieving broader decarbonization goals in the aviation sector.

Rapid Expansion of SAF Production

SAF production in the U.S. has surged over recent years. From a modest 2,000 barrels per day in 2020, production climbed to approximately 19,000 barrels per day by 2023, equating to nearly 277 million gallons annually. Forecasts suggest production could reach 51,000 barrels per day by the end of 2025, which would exceed 770 million gallons annually. Despite this impressive growth, SAF currently represents less than 0.7% of total U.S. aviation fuel consumption, with overall jet fuel use surpassing 16 billion gallons per year.

The majority of new SAF output comes from co-processing renewable diesel in existing plants, a method that allows faster scale-up without building entirely new facilities. Industry analysts predict that if more facilities undergo conversion, annual SAF capacity in the U.S. could exceed 5 billion gallons within the next decade. Such an increase would provide the aviation sector with a meaningful path toward cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

Airlines Lead the Charge in SAF Adoption

Major U.S. carriers are staking significant claims in SAF procurement. United Airlines (UA) has locked in long-term contracts for 2.9 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, planning to deploy 10 million gallons in 2025, tripling the volume used in 2022. Delta Air Lines (DL) has inked offtake contracts for 910 million gallons, targeting a 5% SAF blend across its fleet by 2030. Meanwhile, American Airlines (AA) holds 620 million gallons in future SAF purchase agreements and initiated regular annual deliveries in 2024.

Other airlines, including JetBlue (B6) and Air Canada (AC), have smaller but steadily expanding SAF programs. Notably, Air Canada plans to deploy 20.5 million gallons of Neste SAF in 2025, which represents roughly 1% of its total fuel requirements. These initiatives underscore the aviation sector’s growing reliance on SAF as a viable climate solution.

Beyond Commercial Airlines

Sustainable aviation fuel is increasingly being adopted across cargo, business, and military aviation sectors.Cargo carriers, business aviation operators, U.S. military branches, and startups are increasingly investing in SAF production, storage, and fueling infrastructure. These developments signal a broader recognition of SAF’s potential to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and contribute to national climate targets.

Industry observers note that SAF deployment faces challenges, including high production costs, limited infrastructure, and the need for continuous policy support. However, partnerships like the one between Hawaiian Airlines and Cosmo Oil Marketing demonstrate how strategic collaborations can accelerate adoption. By integrating SAF into its Osaka-Honolulu flights, Hawaiian Airlines not only reduces its carbon emissions but also sets an example for other international carriers seeking sustainable fuel solutions.

Hawaiian Airlines will use sustainable aviation fuel on Osaka–Honolulu flights, cutting carbon emissions by up to 80% while keeping global travel seamless.

As airlines move toward achieving net-zero emissions, sustainable aviation fuel offers a practical, immediate solution to reduce greenhouse gases without disrupting international travel. Hawaiian Airlines’ SAF deployment is a step in the right direction, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges of building a more sustainable aviation ecosystem. With continued investment and innovation, SAF could transform the industry, paving the way for greener skies in the coming decade.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rana_Singh_A_Hawaiian_Airlines_B-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 07:56:14.629631

Bei der Antwort auf diese Frage kommen früher oder später immer nachhaltige Treibstoffe ins Spiel, im Jargon Sustainable Aviation Fuels genannt, kurz SAF. Sie sind die schnellste Möglichkeit, Emissionen zu senken. Viele Airlines brüsten sich darum damit, möglichst viel davon zu tanken - während sie gleichzeitig darauf hinweisen, dass die Verfügbarkeit gering und die Preise zu hoch sind.

Aber wer nutzt wirklich viel SAF - und wer gar nicht? Die International Airlines Group IAG hat Nutzungsdaten für nachhaltige Kraftstoffe analysiert. Und hat sie öffentlich gemacht. Denn: Mit 162.000 Tonnen im Jahr 2024 nutzte der Konzern, zu dem unter anderem British Airways, Iberia, Vueling und Aer Lingus gehören, weltweit die größte Menge.

Lufthansa Group erst auf Rang sechs

Wie groß die getankte Menge von IAG ist, zeigt der Vergleich mit der Konkurrenz. Laut den Daten des Konzerns, die laut Robinson auf Angaben der einzelnen Airlines beruhen, landet Air France-KLM auf Platz zwei mit rund 110.000 Tonnen, gefolgt von DHL mit 100.000. Wichtig: Die einzelnen Werte für Airlines außer IAG basieren auf einer Annäherung anhand der Grafik des IAG-Mitarbeiters - es handelt sich nicht um die absolut exakten Zahlen. IAG möchte diese nicht herausgeben.

Dann folgen mit großem Abstand mit etwa 50.000 Tonnen United Airlines und mit 40.000 Tonnen Delta Air Lines. In den USA ist die Versorgung mit nachhaltigem Kerosin besser als anderswo. Allerdings dürfte sich die Situation aber in nächster Zeit nicht bessern. Denn die Trump-Regierung stoppte alle Anreize, mit denen zuvor die Förderung und Nutzung von SAF verbunden war.

Air France vor Lufthansa

Lufthansa Group brachte es laut der IAG-Analyse auf rund 35.000 Tonnen und landet gemessen am absoluten Verbrauch damit auf dem weltweit sechsten Rang. Am Golf fiel nur Qatar Airways mit einer zweistelligen Menge auf. Rund 10.000 Tonnen waren es 2024.

Deutlich wird auch, wer gar nicht mitzieht: 37 Prozent der Airlines weltweit berichteten 2024 von keinerlei SAF-Einsatz – eine Verbesserung gegenüber 2023, als es noch 52 Prozent waren.

“Our city was honored to be chosen for this new Airbus A220, a new-generation aircraft.","On August 25, 2025, Air France received its 46th Airbus A220-300 in Paris, following the aircraft’s delivery flight from Airbus’ Mirabel final assembly plant in Canada. The ferry flight marked a first for both the type and the airline, as the aircraft was delivered with a blend containing 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), certified directly by Airbus.

A statement issued by the carrier said, “This milestone reflects the Air France-KLM Group’s commitment to accelerate the decarbonization of air transport. This landmark flight not only confirms Airbus’ capability to provide Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) directly to customers and operators but also supports the industry’s commitment to decarbonisation. With PoS credits for a 50% SAF blend applied through the mass balance process, this ferry flight conducted by Air France’s 46th A220-300 named “Vaison-La-Romaine” (and registered F-HPNU) represented more than 25 tonnes reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels.”

Alongside performing the groundbreaking SAF flight, another joint initiative between the Group and the manufacturer is enabling Airbus employees to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel by supporting the production of SAF. This voluntary commitment is part of Air France-KLM’s “SAF Corporate” program, which facilitates the financing and purchase of SAF. Since joining the program in November 2023, Airbus has cut its emissions by more than 2,000 tons of CO₂ through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF.

Both the addition of more A220s plus the increasing use of SAF are ways in which Air-France-KLM Group is aiming to modernize the airlines’ respective fleets and to use more environmentally friendly measures to make flying greener in the future. SAF “plays a central role in reducing the carbon footprint of air transport, allowing at least a 65% reduction in CO₂ emissions over the full life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel. Air France-KLM is among the world’s top three SAF users and applies a strict sourcing policy, where only fuel that does not compete with human food supply, does not contribute to deforestation, and is not produced from palm oil is selected,” added the airline statement.

Fleet renewal progress

The enlargement of the Airbus A220 fleet is part of a wider fleet renewal plan at Air France and is described as “a cornerstone of the Group’s transformation strategy. With fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions reduced by 20% per seat-kilometer compared with previous-generation aircraft, the Airbus A220 embodies this ambition.”

Air France-KLM has nearly 200 new-generation aircraft (A220, A320neo, A321neo, A350, and Boeing 787) on firm order, and in 2024 alone, the Group took delivery of 41 new-generation aircraft across all its airlines. These major investments, which total more than €2 billion ($2.1 billion) per year, are said by the airline to be contributing to a fleet that, by 2030, will be composed of up to 80% new-generation aircraft. Air France’s first A220-300s, part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft, have been flying on its medium-haul network since October 2021.

What the parties say

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability, Air France-KLM. “Combining the two is only logical, and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game-changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress.”

“Since the announcement of the first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) delivery at Airbus site in Canada, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights, this achievement solidifies Airbus’ commitment to using SAF for internal operations as well as customer ferry flights across all its commercial aircraft assembly sites and delivery centers worldwide.”

“In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,” said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada.”And we’re pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year. On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.”

A town celebrates the A220 naming

The naming of the newest aircraft to join the Air France fleet has brought some joy to the people of the town of Vaison-La-Romaine, located north of the city of Avignon in the region of Vaucluse. Even the mayor of the town has embraced the naming of the aircraft after his town and has posted on the town’s social media page to celebrate the occasion.

“Our city was honored to be chosen for this new Airbus A220, a new-generation aircraft. ‘Vaison-la-Romaine’ is now part of the Air France fleet alongside other cities such as Arras, Rivesaltes, and Colmar, and will fly around the world at an altitude of 10,000 meters. A dizzying figure!” said the post (in French).

Additionally, to celebrate the christening of F-HPNU, in partnership with the Vaison Ventoux Provence tourist office, the town will be marking the naming of the aircraft by unveiling a 1/100th scale model of the Airbus A220 in a few weeks in front of the fresco of the municipal gymnasium of the Ulysse Fabre sports complex located in the town itself.

From pioneering low-emission LNG infrastructure to delivering global megaprojects using modular construction and renewable-powered e-drive systems, Shaul explains how McDermott is addressing the energy trilemma: energy security, affordability, and sustainability.

How critical is the role of natural gas and LNG in supporting the energy transition and ensuring energy security?

Natural gas and LNG are absolutely essential to the global energy transition. While carbon-free energy production is the ultimate goal, natural gas plays a critical role in achieving interim decabonisation milestones, such as net-zero. That’s where LNG comes in. It is widely considered a bridge fuel that provides energy security and a reliable, lower-emission alternative to coal and oil, while bridging the gap as renewable and other carbon-free infrastructure continues to scale up.

At McDermott, we support this transition by delivering full project lifecycle services from concept to commissioning and fully integrated engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction (EPFC) solutions designed to reduce emissions and improve efficiency across the LNG value chain. For example:

Low-carbon LNG facilities: McDermott is pioneering the development of LNG plants with up to 95% reduction in operational emissions and 65% reduction in construction-related emissions.

Modular execution: Our modular fabrication approach optimises plot plan space, provides execution certainty and reduces the carbon footprint associated with traditional construction.

E-drive systems: By integrating electric drive systems powered by renewable energy, McDermott’s LNG solutions can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95% compared to gas turbine-driven LNG facilities.

Global reach and scalability: With strategically located fabrication yards and execution offices, we optimise delivery based on regional priorities, ensuring efficiency and sustainability.

Could you give us an overview of your project pipeline and recent milestones?

One of our key projects is the Woodfibre LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada, which is set to be among the world’s lowest-emission LNG plants. Using imported hydroelectric power, a renewable source, the project significantly reduces emissions and exemplifies our commitment to low-carbon delivery through modularisation and integrated project execution.

We are also nearing completion of the first LNG train at the Golden Pass LNG Export Project in Sabine Pass, Texas, with Trains 2 and 3 to follow. The project represents over 15 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG capacity. Once complete, it will bring McDermott’s total large-scale LNG trains delivered on the US Gulf Coast to nine —the second most of any contractor. It demonstrates our ability to execute some of the world’s largest and most complex projects.

Beyond Woodfibre and Golden Pass, McDermott has a strong global LNG portfolio. At Freeport LNG, our team and its joint venture partners delivered three pre-treatment trains, a liquefaction facility with three trains, a second loading berth, and a 165,000 m3 full-containment LNG tank. Each LNG train at the Freeport LNG facility produces around 5.1 Mtpa of LNG and incorporates cutting-edge e-drive systems, including the world’s largest electric motor-driven refrigeration compressors—three 75 MW electric motors per train, which significantly improves North America’s energy export capabilities.

These e-drive systems offer significant benefits: reduced emissions, faster restarts, increased operating flexibility, and improved year-round efficiency.

What are the ways in which your company is powering a sustainable future?

McDermott is leveraging its global scale and breadth of capabilities to support decarbonisation across the energy industry. In addition to e-drive systems powered by renewable energy in LNG facilities, we are also focusing on other critical low-carbon focus areas including HVDC substations for offshore wind; low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia; carbon capture and utilisation; and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Currently, McDermott is delivering Europe’s first green steel project for Stegra in Boden, Sweden, and executing FEEDs (front-end engineering design) for Clean Hydrogen Work’s Ascension Clean Energy blue ammonia project in Louisiana and the Exploits Valley Renewable Energy Complex (EVREC) in Newfoundland.

Recent stock analysis highlights a combination of strong fundamentals, high valuation concerns, and mixed technical indicators, leaving both institutional and retail investors divided on the company’s short-term prospects.

Investor Sentiment on Republic Services

According to the latest outlook, Republic Services finds itself in a technical neutral zone. While the company has reported steady earnings growth — including a 9.15% year-over-year rise in earnings per share and over 10% profit growth — analysts remain cautious. The stock’s price-to-earnings ratio, currently above 152, signals that the market is pricing in high expectations for future performance.

This high valuation raises concerns about whether Republic Services can sustain such momentum, especially in a volatile global economic landscape. Investors are increasingly adopting a “wait-and-see” strategy, monitoring whether the company can justify its premium valuation through consistent earnings and operational efficiency.

Fundamentals: Strengths and Weak Spots

From a fundamentals perspective, Republic Services shows mixed results. On the positive side, the company maintains a strong profit margin of over 31% and a quick ratio above 2.4, signaling healthy liquidity. Additionally, both institutional and retail investors have shown continued confidence, with inflows exceeding 50% across the board.

However, there are areas of concern. The company’s long-term debt-to-working-capital ratio stands at 7.06%, reflecting a higher level of financial risk. Its operating cycle of more than 40 days suggests challenges in efficiency when compared to leaner competitors. These factors, combined with the elevated valuation, add to the uncertainty around Republic Services’ immediate stock trajectory.

Technical Market Signals

Technical indicators for Republic Services present a similarly divided picture. Recent chart patterns, such as a Bearish Engulfing and a MACD Death Cross, point toward potential downside pressure. Yet, bullish signals like a Golden Cross and Marubozu White pattern suggest there may also be opportunities for upward reversals.

This tug-of-war between bearish and bullish signals reinforces the notion that Republic Services is in a transitional phase. Analysts caution investors to track upcoming earnings announcements and broader market developments before making aggressive moves.

Broader Market Factors

Beyond company-specific performance, global developments are also influencing sentiment around Republic Services. For instance, increased focus on sustainable aviation fuel and the renewable energy sector presents long-term opportunities for waste management leaders. At the same time, geopolitical instability and global economic slowdowns may weigh on demand for waste and recycling services in the short term.

This initiative aims to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector and align with global climate goals set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

As part of a broad effort to promote eco-friendly aviation practices, the South Korean government has proposed a mixture of SAF in all international flights, starting at 1% SAF blend by 2027. This move is seen as a step toward meeting the global aviation industry’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050.

Government Support for SAF Development

The government of South Korea is backing the transition to sustainable aviation fuels with financial incentives and tax breaks. These measures are designed to encourage local fuel producers to ramp up their SAF production capabilities. Additionally, the government plans to assist the oil refining industry by easing the financial burden of producing SAF.

SAF production in South Korea is believed to be production in South Korea is believed to be potentially transformative in a global context, and projections within the industry illustrate the global demand for SAF is set to exponentially increase from a mere 240,000 tonnes in 2022 to 18.35 million tonnes by 2030. Such a growth is attributed to the rising demand for more sustainable aviation.

Airlines Taking Early Steps Toward SAF Use

Several South Korean airlines are already on the path to incorporating sustainable aviation fuel into their operations. Major carriers such as Korean Air have committed to using a blend of SAF for international flights. The plan includes using SAF for one international route per week starting this year. This gradual integration is an important first step toward the broader goal of using SAF in all international flights by 2027.

The percentage of SAF used in these flights is low, but remains fundamental in addressing SAF’s availability in the future. Producers of aviation fuel have begun to assurance that these fuels will be readily available within a reasonable time frame.

Why SAF Matters for the Environment

Sustainable aviation fuel is considered a vital component in the fight against climate change. Traditional jet fuels contribute heavily to global carbon emissions. By using SAF, airlines can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as SAF is made from renewable sources such as plant oils, waste oils, and even carbon capture technology.

Experts claim that advanced SAF is one of the most advanced solutions for achieving carbon neutrality in aviation. With regards to conventional jet fuel, advanced SAF, if developed, would be able to reduce the lifecycle carbon emission of aviation fuel by as much as 80%.

Challenges in SAF Production and Cost

Despite its potential, the production of SAF faces some significant hurdles. Currently, the cost of producing SAF is much higher than that of traditional jet fuel. The South Korean government plans to address this issue by providing financial incentives and encouraging local production.

The oil refining industry also faces challenges in scaling up SAF production to meet the increasing demand. However, government support is expected to ease some of these burdens, allowing the industry to adapt to the growing demand for greener aviation fuel.

The Global Aviation Industry’s Carbon Neutrality Goal

The push for Sustainable Aviation Fuel is part of a larger international effort to reduce aviation’s environmental impact. The ICAO has set ambitious goals for the aviation industry, with a target of carbon neutrality by 2050. This means the industry must significantly cut its greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades.

Having SAF included in South Korea’s international flights by 2027 is quite an advancement and aims towards the fulfillment of the international objectives. The adoption and patronage of the SAF assists in lowering the country’s emission from the aviation sector.

Collaboration Among Airlines and Fuel Producers

The collaboration between airlines and fuel producers will be crucial to the success of this initiative. South Korean airlines are working together to ensure a steady supply of SAF for international flights. The aviation industry, in partnership with government entities, aims to develop infrastructure for SAF production, storage, and distribution.

Actively engaging upon with relevant entities for a sustained period is believed to yield fruitful results in resolving challenges regarding the scaling up production of of SAF, thereby aiding the aviation industry in fulfilling its future sustainability objectives.

Impact on the Future of Aviation

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel by South Korea represents a turning point for the global aviation industry. It signals a shift towards greener energy sources and a more sustainable future for air travel. The broader global adoption of SAF will likely follow, helping to pave the way for a carbon-neutral aviation industry.

If the positive trend continues among global airlines and oil companies regarding South Korea’s lead, the aviation industry will, in the near future, standardize the use of alternative fuels, thus boosting emission reduction and improving the sustainability of air transport.

Bottom Line

South Korea’s move to incorporate Sustainable Aviation Fuel into all international flights by 2027 is a significant step in the right direction for the aviation industry. This initiative aligns with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and meet climate goals. With government support, collaboration between airlines and fuel producers, and a growing demand for greener alternatives, the future of aviation looks brighter and more sustainable than ever.

The geopolitical ramifications of a radially altered global aviation industry, should sustainable aviation fuel technologies be successfully implemented, are massive. The example of South Korea could be instrumental for other countries attempting to decarbonize aviation, and provide them with insight fuel for a more sustainable model of aviation for the future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/South-Korea-Introduces-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 06:56:31.350553

Tuy nhiên, giá nhiên liệu máy bay tại Mỹ vẫn chịu ảnh hưởng từ xu hướng giá toàn cầu.","Mùa cao điểm du lịch Hè 2025 đã chứng kiến một biến động quan trọng trên thị trường năng lượng.

Lượng nhiên liệu máy bay nhập khẩu từ châu Á vào châu Âu đạt mức kỷ lục, đồng thời tạo ra nhiều tác động đa chiều đối với giá nhiên liệu, nhu cầu đi lại và chiến lược năng lượng của Liên minh châu Âu (EU).

Theo Financial Times, dẫn nguồn từ công ty phân tích dữ liệu năng lượng Vortexa, chỉ riêng từ đầu tháng 8, gần 11,5 triệu thùng nhiên liệu máy bay đã được vận chuyển từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc sang châu Âu.

Đây là con số kỷ lục, mặc dù thấp hơn một chút so với các mức cao nhất trong tháng 6 và 7, nhưng vẫn duy trì ở mức áp đảo trong lịch sử nhập khẩu.

Nhìn vào bức tranh toàn cảnh, xu hướng này không chỉ phản ánh sự dồi dào nguồn cung từ Viễn Đông, mà còn cho thấy nhu cầu hồi phục mạnh mẽ của thị trường châu Âu sau đại dịch.

Một nhà giao dịch nhiên liệu máy bay cấp cao nhận định: “Khối lượng xuất khẩu từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc đang ở mức kỷ lục. Đây vừa là câu chuyện về nguồn cung, vừa là về nhu cầu.”

Bối cảnh thị trường nhiên liệu toàn cầu

Sau đại dịch COVID-19, ngành hàng không toàn cầu phục hồi nhanh chóng nhưng không đồng đều. Nhu cầu nhiên liệu máy bay tại châu Âu, Mỹ và châu Á đã quay trở lại mức trước đại dịch, nhưng các yếu tố địa chính trị, chiến tranh và lạm phát toàn cầu tạo ra những biến động đáng kể về giá nhiên liệu.

Mùa Hè 2022, giá nhiên liệu máy bay tăng lên gần 1.200 USD/tấn khi xung đột Nga - Ukraine làm gián đoạn chuỗi cung ứng năng lượng, đặc biệt là từ Nga, nhà cung cấp chính của dầu mỏ và nhiên liệu hàng không cho châu Âu.

Đến mùa Hè 2025, giá nhiên liệu bay tại châu Âu chỉ còn khoảng 700 USD/tấn, giảm gần 40% so với mức đỉnh, nhờ nguồn cung từ châu Á dồi dào và sự điều chỉnh sản lượng của OPEC+.

Theo Eurocontrol, số chuyến bay trong mùa Hè 2025 dự kiến tăng ít nhất 5% so với cùng kỳ năm 2024, phản ánh nhu cầu đi lại bằng hàng không trở lại mạnh mẽ.

Việc giá nhiên liệu giảm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho các hãng hàng không châu Âu vận hành với chi phí thấp hơn, đồng thời khiến mục tiêu hạn chế bay nhằm giảm phát thải trở nên khó đạt hơn.

Lượng nhập khẩu kỷ lục từ châu Á

Dữ liệu của Vortexa cho thấy, chỉ riêng trong tháng 8, gần 11,5 triệu thùng nhiên liệu máy bay đã được chuyển từ châu Á sang châu Âu, chủ yếu từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc.

Đây là lần đầu tiên khối lượng nhập khẩu từ Viễn Đông đạt mức kỷ lục trong lịch sử, cho thấy sức mạnh sản xuất và xuất khẩu của các nhà máy lọc dầu hiện đại tại châu Á.

“Khối lượng nhập khẩu từ Viễn Đông đang ở mức kỷ lục, nếu xét đến khối lượng giao dịch từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc. Đây vừa là câu chuyện về nguồn cung, vừa là về nhu cầu”, một nhà giao dịch cấp cao nhận định.

Chuyên gia Amaar Khan của hãng định giá Argus cũng cho biết: “Các nhà máy lọc dầu Trung Quốc coi nhiên liệu máy bay là sản phẩm chiến lược. Nguồn cung năm nay thực sự rất dồi dào, giúp châu Âu đáp ứng nhu cầu hồi phục mạnh mẽ.”

Điều đáng chú ý là, nhiên liệu máy bay khác với xăng hay diesel vốn chịu tác động từ các giải pháp thay thế như xe điện hay LNG. Nhu cầu đối với nhiên liệu máy bay hầu như không giảm, giúp dòng chảy từ Viễn Đông duy trì ổn định ngay cả khi giá nhiên liệu biến động.

Tác động đến ngành hàng không châu Âu

Làn sóng nhập khẩu mạnh đã kéo giá nhiên liệu máy bay tại châu Âu giảm sâu, trở lại mức thấp nhất kể từ sau đại dịch COVID-19. Mức giá hiện tại, khoảng 700 USD/tấn, tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho các hãng hàng không vận hành và tăng số chuyến bay.

“

Nguồn cung toàn cầu hiện dư thừa. Đặc biệt, khi OPEC+ liên tục tăng sản lượng trong khi nhu cầu chưa phục hồi hoàn toàn ở Ấn Độ và Trung Quốc, giá nhiên liệu sẽ duy trì ổn định quanh mức hiện nay trong trung hạn.

Ông Michael O’Leary - Giám đốc điều hành Ryanair

Việc giá nhiên liệu giảm cũng có tác động tích cực đến chi phí vé máy bay, góp phần tăng khả năng tiếp cận đi lại bằng đường hàng không cho người dân châu Âu.

Tuy nhiên, điều này đồng thời làm dấy lên lo ngại về khó đạt các mục tiêu hạn chế phát thải trong ngành hàng không, đặc biệt trong bối cảnh Liên minh châu Âu thúc đẩy chính sách khí hậu xanh.

Một trong những hệ quả quan trọng của dòng nhiên liệu châu Á vào châu Âu là sự gia tăng phụ thuộc vào nguồn nhập khẩu. Nhiều nhà máy lọc dầu cũ tại châu Âu đang phải đóng cửa vì không thể cạnh tranh với các cơ sở hiện đại, chi phí thấp ở Viễn Đông.

Một nhà giao dịch bình luận: “Khi ngày càng nhiều nhà máy lọc dầu châu Âu đóng cửa hoặc bị loại khỏi thị trường bởi các cơ sở hiện đại hơn ở Viễn Đông, dòng dầu từ khu vực này vào châu Âu là điều tất yếu.”

Hiệp hội Vận tải Hàng không Quốc tế (IATA) cũng cảnh báo rằng, phụ thuộc quá mức vào nguồn nhập khẩu nhiên liệu sẽ làm EU đối mặt với rủi ro chiến lược nếu chuỗi cung ứng bị gián đoạn.

Ngoài ra, dòng chảy nhiên liệu kỷ lục còn phản ánh một nghịch lý rằng mặc dù EU nỗ lực giảm phát thải từ hàng không, giá nhiên liệu giảm lại khiến chi phí đi lại bằng máy bay dễ tiếp cận hơn, khó khăn trong việc hạn chế lượng bay thực tế. Đây là bài toán cân bằng giữa mục tiêu môi trường và phát triển kinh tế, du lịch.

So sánh với thị trường Mỹ và châu Á

So với châu Âu, thị trường Mỹ hiện có khả năng tự chủ về nhiên liệu cao hơn nhờ công suất lọc dầu lớn và cơ sở hạ tầng hiện đại. Tuy nhiên, giá nhiên liệu máy bay tại Mỹ vẫn chịu ảnh hưởng từ xu hướng giá toàn cầu.

Trong khi đó, các nước châu Á như Trung Quốc, Hàn Quốc và Singapore đang trở thành trung tâm sản xuất nhiên liệu hàng không xuất khẩu, nhờ các nhà máy lọc dầu thế hệ mới, chi phí thấp, và chiến lược tập trung vào sản phẩm chiến lược như Jet Fuel.

Trung Quốc đặc biệt nổi bật với tăng trưởng sản xuất nhiên liệu bền vững, tận dụng nhu cầu hồi phục của châu Âu và các chuyến bay nội địa. Hàn Quốc cũng duy trì dòng chảy ổn định sang châu Âu, củng cố vị thế trong chuỗi cung ứng toàn cầu.

Đây là minh chứng cho xu hướng dịch chuyển quyền lực năng lượng từ Tây sang Đông, khi châu Á trở thành điểm xuất khẩu chiến lược nhiên liệu hàng không.

Theo các chuyên gia, dòng chảy nhiên liệu kỷ lục từ châu Á sang châu Âu không chỉ là câu chuyện về cung cầu, mà còn phản ánh những thay đổi dài hạn trong cân bằng năng lượng toàn cầu.

Viễn Đông củng cố vai trò là nhà cung cấp nhiên liệu chiến lược toàn cầu, với nhà máy hiện đại, chi phí thấp và năng lực xuất khẩu lớn.

Châu Âu đối mặt với thách thức tự chủ năng lượng, phụ thuộc nhập khẩu ngày càng cao, đặc biệt khi các nhà máy lọc dầu cũ đóng cửa. Giá nhiên liệu giảm tạo thuận lợi cho ngành hàng không nhưng đồng thời làm khó khăn cho các mục tiêu giảm phát thải.

Các dự báo trung hạn cho thấy, nếu EU không nâng cấp cơ sở lọc dầu hoặc đa dạng hóa nguồn cung, nhập khẩu nhiên liệu từ Viễn Đông sẽ tiếp tục tăng, đặc biệt trong mùa cao điểm du lịch.

Ngược lại, các nhà sản xuất tại châu Á có thể tiếp tục củng cố vị thế chiến lược và mở rộng thị phần, nhờ dòng chảy nhập khẩu mạnh và nhu cầu toàn cầu ổn định.

Một nhà phân tích thị trường năng lượng nhận định: “Dòng chảy nhiên liệu này là minh chứng cho sự dịch chuyển quyền lực năng lượng toàn cầu. Châu Âu đang phụ thuộc vào Viễn Đông, trong khi Mỹ và châu Á duy trì lợi thế về sản xuất và xuất khẩu.”

Mùa Hè 2025 ghi nhận lượng nhiên liệu máy bay từ châu Á sang châu Âu lập kỷ lục, với gần 11,5 triệu thùng chỉ riêng trong tháng 8. Sự kiện này phản ánh nguồn cung dồi dào từ Viễn Đông, nhu cầu hồi phục tại châu Âu, đồng thời tạo ra những tác động đa chiều như giá nhiên liệu giảm, chi phí đi lại thấp hơn, nhưng thách thức về phụ thuộc nhập khẩu và khó đạt mục tiêu giảm phát thải vẫn hiện hữu.

Nhìn xa hơn, dòng chảy nhiên liệu kỷ lục là minh chứng cho xu hướng dịch chuyển quyền lực năng lượng toàn cầu.

Đó là việc Viễn Đông trở thành trung tâm cung cấp chiến lược, trong khi châu Âu phải cân nhắc các giải pháp nâng cấp lọc dầu và đa dạng hóa nguồn cung nếu muốn duy trì vị thế năng lượng bền vững.

Thị trường nhiên liệu máy bay toàn cầu mùa Hè 2025 không chỉ là câu chuyện về cung cầu, mà còn là bức tranh phản chiếu những biến động kinh tế, chính trị và chiến lược đang định hình ngành năng lượng toàn cầu trong thập kỷ tới.",https://osky.1cdn.vn/thumbs/1200x630/2025/08/31/67d012e753d4a54034ea61e3_sustainable-aviation-fuel.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 04:56:48.810927

With airlines eagerly waiting to welcome this next-generation widebody, the aircraft is now moving deeper into its certification journey.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has officially approved Boeing to begin Phase 2D of the Type Inspection Authorization (TIA), a milestone that focuses on community noise testing in Glasgow, Montana.

According to reports, this approval marks a significant moment for Boeing’s flagship program. So far, the 777X test fleet has already completed over 1,500 flights and nearly 4,200 flight hours, demonstrating steady progress in what has been one of the most closely monitored certification campaigns in modern aviation.

Phase 2D – Noise Testing in Focus

Phase 2D is dedicated to evaluating the aircraft’s noise levels, ensuring that the 777X meets strict global environmental standards while maintaining performance. This is a critical requirement before the aircraft can be cleared for widespread passenger service, as airlines and regulators alike are paying greater attention to community noise impact.

Phase 3 on the Horizon

Once Phase 2D concludes, the program will advance to TIA Phase 3, although no official start date has been announced yet. Phase 3 will be broader in scope, covering:

Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) performance and cooling under varied conditions

Aircraft stability and control, ensuring safe handling in all scenarios

Precipitation static (P-static) testing, verifying that systems remain protected from static build-up during adverse weather

Fifth Test Aircraft Joins the Fleet

To strengthen the program, Boeing has added a fifth test aircraft to its 777X fleet. Registered N2007L, the jet joined in early August and will primarily conduct High-Intensity Radiated Field (HIRF) trials, designed to measure system resilience against strong electromagnetic emissions.

Lufthansa to Be the First Operator

The first delivery of the Boeing 777X is planned for Lufthansa, which will become the launch customer once the aircraft is certified by both the FAA and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). With certification moving closer and testing phases gradually wrapping up, major airlines are looking forward to adding the 777X to their long-haul, high-capacity fleets.

A New Era for Long-Haul Aviation

For Boeing, the successful certification and entry into service of the 777X will not only mark a technological achievement but also reaffirm its dominance in the widebody market. The jet promises reduced emissions, quieter operations, and improved efficiency, setting new benchmarks for long-haul travel.",https://i0.wp.com/jetlinemarvel.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/B777x-outside.jpg?resize=960%2C600&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-01 02:56:43.906935
