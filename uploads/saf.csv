“This small but growing volume of SAF will still add US$4.4 billion to airlines’ fuel bills globally,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.
In Europe, where SAF blending mandates took effect in January 2025, compliance costs have doubled the price of SAF.
This $2.9 billion total could have instead abated 3.5 million tonnes of CO₂, raising questions about the effectiveness of current policy approaches.
However, while the skies are busy, the fuel powering India’s aircraft is not yet sustainable, as there is currently no commercial production of SAF in the country.","‍DELHI – In a step toward decarbonizing the skies, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced on the first day of its Annual General Meeting (AGM) that the global production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is expected to reach two million tonnes in 2025.

While this marks a doubling of 2024’s output, it still represents just 0.7% of total airline fuel consumption—a sobering reminder of the long road ahead.

“This small but growing volume of SAF will still add US$4.4 billion to airlines’ fuel bills globally,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “We must urgently accelerate production and drive down costs.”

A key challenge lies in the unintended consequences of well-meaning environmental mandates. In Europe, where SAF blending mandates took effect in January 2025, compliance costs have doubled the price of SAF. For the one million tonnes expected to be purchased to meet these mandates, airlines will pay US$1.2 billion—plus an additional US$1.7 billion in compliance fees. This $2.9 billion total could have instead abated 3.5 million tonnes of CO₂, raising questions about the effectiveness of current policy approaches.

“Europe’s strategy has made SAF five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel,” Walsh warned. “Decarbonization policies must not make the energy transition more costly.”

To help scale the SAF market, IATA is rolling out two major initiatives. The first is a SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), which will ensure transparency and compliance with emissions schemes, such as CORSIA. The second, the SAF Matchmaker platform, aims to connect airlines with SAF suppliers, streamlining procurement.

Governments also play a critical role. IATA is urging them to refocus energy policies, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies that disadvantage renewables, and ensure SAF gets fair access to renewable energy infrastructure. Supporting the CORSIA framework and expanding access to eligible emissions credits is also key. So far, only Guyana has made credits available to airlines.

Meanwhile, India has biofuel ambitions. As the` world’s third-largest oil consumer and a rising aviation power, the country has committed to a 2% SAF blend by 2028. However, while the skies are busy, the fuel powering India’s aircraft is not yet sustainable, as there is currently no commercial production of SAF in the country.

If global aviation is to meet its sustainability goals, bold policy shifts and international cooperation—especially from emerging economies like India—are essential.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/683c8ae78be43a11443c911a_Adrian%20Nowakowski.jpeg,N,,2025-06-01 13:56:58.049068

To meet that goal, global SAF production must scale up to 185 million mt annually.
India’s potential to become a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel has been gaining momentum, bolstered by both public and private sector initiatives.
However, industry leaders — including Boeing India President Salil Gupte — emphasize that aircraft readiness is not the barrier.","India has the potential to emerge as a net exporter of sustainable aviation fuel, backed by its abundant agricultural residue and growing aviation sector, a senior Boeing official said May 29 at the CII Annual Business Summit 2025 in New Delhi.

Salil Gupte, President of Boeing India and South Asia, said the country is uniquely positioned to meet a significant share of global SAF demand, with the capacity to eventually produce 8-10 million mt annually, enough to meet over 5% of global SAF requirements.

“India can help decarbonize the civil aviation industry,” Gupte said. “This creates an opportunity to convert agricultural waste into a valuable export product while addressing climate goals.”

With aviation contributing around 2%–3% of global carbon emissions, according to IATA,SAF is considered a critical solution for reducing the industry’s environmental footprint. However, supply remains a major challenge, with SAF currently costing 2.5 to 3.5 times more than conventional aviation turbine fuel.

India’s rapid aviation expansion further strengthens the case for local SAF production. Gupte noted that 2,500 new civil aircraft are expected to join the Indian fleet over the next two decades. Indian carriers have already placed orders for more than 1,000 aircraft in recent years, cementing India’s status as one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets.

The opportunity, according to Gupte, lies not just in meeting domestic demand but also in exporting SAF to global markets striving to reach net-zero aviation emissions by 2050. To meet that goal, global SAF production must scale up to 185 million mt annually.

India’s feedstock advantage includes used cooking oil, farm waste, and other agricultural residues that are not in direct competition with the food supply. Developing this sector could not only support climate commitments but also drive rural economic development and energy security, Gupte suggested.

Boeing, a long-time partner in India’s aerospace ecosystem, is ramping up its efforts to support sustainable aviation globally, including through research partnerships, SAF supply chain investments, and aircraft fleet modernization programs.

India’s potential to become a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel has been gaining momentum, bolstered by both public and private sector initiatives. Earlier in 2025, Boeing and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. announced a partnership aimed at accelerating SAF production and ecosystem development in India.

The collaboration will explore opportunities to scale domestic SAF manufacturing, certify fuel made from local feedstocks, and implement sustainability standards across the supply chain.

HPCL, through its Green R&D Centre, has already pioneered “Trijet” technology, a patented method to convert used cooking oil into jet fuel.

This innovation underscores the country’s readiness to commercialize SAF at scale using widely available agricultural and industrial residues.

Feedstocks such as farm waste, non-edible plants, forestry residue, and municipal waste make India uniquely positioned to meet both its domestic needs and contribute to global SAF supply chains.

Boeing has committed to making all its commercial aircraft capable of flying on 100% SAF by 2030 and has previously demonstrated the technology in test flights.

However, industry leaders — including Boeing India President Salil Gupte — emphasize that aircraft readiness is not the barrier. Rather, building a viable supply chain, a favorable policy environment, and reducing the high cost of SAF are key challenges that must be addressed.

At recent industry events, Gupte projected India could produce up to 24 million mt of SAF annually based on available feedstock, far exceeding the estimated domestic demand of 8-10 million mt by 2030.",,N,,2025-06-01 13:57:04.853194

According to the association, 81 airlines have inked agreements to buy and use greener jet fuel, up from 70 in 2023, and this number is growing steadily.
Dr Thomsen also called on governments to redirect some of the subsidies given to fossil-fuel companies to those producing renewable energy, including sustainable jet fuel.
Iata on June 1 highlighted the sustainable jet fuel mandates rolled out in Europe and Britain.
This money will go towards the bulk purchase of greener jet fuel that airlines will need to use at Changi and Seletar airports.","– More airlines around the world are committing to using greener jet fuel in a bid to reach their goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But there are headwinds, with the global trade body representing the industry flagging policy shortcomings that have hindered the production and adoption of such fuels. These are made mainly from waste materials like used cooking oil, and are said to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with regular jet fuel.

The International Air Transport Association (Iata) said on June 1 it expects the production of such greener aviation fuels to reach 2 million tonnes in 2025, a dip of 0.1 million tonnes from its earlier projections in December 2024.

While this is double the 1 million tonnes of greener jet fuel produced in 2024, the 2025 figure forms just 0.7 per cent of airlines’ projected total fuel consumption this year, Iata noted.

According to the association, 81 airlines have inked agreements to buy and use greener jet fuel, up from 70 in 2023, and this number is growing steadily.

Singapore Airlines and its low-cost arm, Scoot, are among those that have pledged to increase sustainable fuel use.

“The problem is not the (airline) industry. The problem is the energy source,” said Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, Iata’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist.

Speaking to reporters on the first day of Iata’s three-day annual general meeting in New Delhi, she called for government policies that maximise the production of renewable energy in all forms.

Dr Thomsen also called on governments to redirect some of the subsidies given to fossil-fuel companies to those producing renewable energy, including sustainable jet fuel. These subsidies amount to US$1 trillion (S$1.3 trillion) a year globally.

Unless policies and behaviours change, she said the aviation sector will not meet its 2050 net-zero emissions target.

“It’s not impossible. It’s just that at the pace, with the investments and with the policies currently, it is a resounding no,” she noted on the sidelines.

She flagged other urgent priorities for governments around the world, including the need for policies to adapt and fix unintended consequences.

Iata on June 1 highlighted the sustainable jet fuel mandates rolled out in Europe and Britain. They require suppliers to add a proportion of sustainable aviation fuel into the jet fuel they deliver to airports – starting with a 2 per cent blend in 2025.

But the cost of greener jet fuel – which is already two to three timesmore expensive than regular fuel – has doubled as suppliers have passed on added compliance costs to airlines, Iata said.

The expected cost of green fuel needed to meet the mandates is US$1.2 billion at today’s market prices, and the compliance fees have added another US$1.7 billion to airlines’ jet fuel bills, it added.

Said Dr Thomsen: “We want to shout about it, loud and clear to everybody, so that other countries that might be thinking of mandates will think again.”

In contrast, she added that she found Singapore’s approach to driving greener jet fuel adoption to be “innovative”.

The Singapore Government will require flights departing from the city-state to use sustainable jet fuel, with an initial national target of 1 per cent use in 2026, and passengers will be charged a levy to help finance the cost.

Early government estimates in 2024 suggest that economy-class passengers may have to pay $3 more for short-haul flights, $6 more for medium-haul flights, and $16 more for long-haul flights.

This money will go towards the bulk purchase of greener jet fuel that airlines will need to use at Changi and Seletar airports. More details are expected to be announced in 2025, closer to the roll-out in 2026.

Dr Thomsen said raising ticket prices and a central fuel procurement system are not policies that Iata would have suggested.

But she added that there is greater faith that Singapore will reassess its policies and take a different course of action if the Government’s plans do not work as intended.

“The interesting and somewhat exciting nature of the market at the moment is nobody knows how to do this. Nobody has the solution,” she said. “Let’s see if this works and what can be done.”

On green jet fuel production, Iata’s head of net-zero research and programmes Preeti Jain said there are about 300 projects identified globally, with about 160 of them set to come online by 2030.

In Asia-Pacific, there are 28 such projects with a projected capacity of 7 million tonnes.

But whether these projects can be realised is a question, with Ms Jain noting delays and slow progress despite the abundance of raw materials in the region.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ede922998ca118b9f67f5779b63e4fc2e241b083bd993fde4ea1e78eea92d641,N,,2025-06-01 12:56:43.756494

NEW DELHI: India’s aviation sector is witnessing strong growth, supported by enhanced connectivity, improved airport infrastructure, and emerging potential in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Sunday. Speaking at a media briefing during the World Air Transport Summit (WATS) in Delhi, Amitabh Khosla, IATA’s Country Director for India, Nepal & Bhutan, said, ""We are also seeing significant increase in the airport infrastructure, so it gives a good foundation, a base on which India will build further."" Khosla also pointed to India’s potential in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, citing the country’s standing as a major ethanol producer. ""We understand from our discussions with some of the oil companies in the country that we are looking at India SAF production coming about in 2026,"" he said. India, he noted, has the capabilities to become a key player in sustainable aviation, aligning with global decarbonisation goals. Despite this progress, IATA also highlighted persistent challenges related to high operational costs and tax-related uncertainties. This year’s WATS event has drawn approximately 1,700 attendees, and marks the first time IATA’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) is being held in India in over four decades. IATA represents around 350 airlines, accounting for over 80 per cent of global air traffic. According to IATA data, the aviation sector in India directly employs nearly 370,000 people and contributes$5.6 billion to the economy. Including indirect, induced, and tourism-related effects, the industry supports 7.7 million jobs and adds $53.6 billion to India’s GDP- equivalent to 1.5 per cent of total economic output.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.
- 'Entirely achievable' - The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.
To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.","The airline industry's flagship goal of decarbonising by 2050 is now ""in peril"" due to climate-sceptic policies, including those of US President Donald Trump, the leading airline association IATA warned on Sunday.

The emergence of leaders favouring fossil fuels and recent regulatory rollbacks are ""obviously a setback... it does imperil success on the 2050 horizon"", Marie Owens Thomsen, the International Air Transport Association's senior vice president for sustainability, told reporters.

""But I don't think it's going to halt or reverse progress. I think it will just slow progress,"" she said at the IATA annual industry conference in India.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

- 'Entirely achievable' -

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, SAF biofuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

""Another problem, which is related, is the fact that oil is so cheap,"" Owens Thomsen said. ""I think that also diminishes the sense of urgency that people have.""

A barrel of Brent North Sea crude, the international benchmark, stands below $65 as a result of Trump's tariffs, his call to ""drill baby drill"" and especially a decision by OPEC+ to hike crude output quotas.

This represents an immediate boon for airlines, whose fuel costs represent between a quarter and a third of operating expenses.

SAF is seen as a crucial ingredient in hitting emissions targets. The biofuel produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel and is made from plant and animal materials such as cooking oil and fat.

European Union rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

Owens Thomsen estimated on Sunday that $4.7 trillion in investment is needed to establish SAF sectors capable of meeting the needs of air transport by 2050.

""It is entirely achievable,"" she said, adding that the raw materials and technology already exist and simply need to be developed.

""The money involved is very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably obviously wind and solar,"" she said.

That money could be found just by stopping subsidies to oil producers, she said.

""The world is subsidising large oil companies to the height of $1 trillion per year,"" she said.

""With that money, if it were redirected in its totality, we could solve our energy transition in less than five years.""

IATA also indicated on Sunday that it expects global SAF production to double this year compared with 2024 to 2.5 billion litres -- slightly down from its previous projections of 2.7 billion litres.

“We are placing a firm order for 30 Airbus A350-900s,” said Pieter Elbers, the CEO of IndiGo, a company founded in 2006 and already behind the largest contract by volume in the history of civil aviation -- 500 Airbus single-aisle aircraft by 2023.

The Indian low-cost carrier, the country’s biggest by market share, is positioning itself as a significant player in the long-haul market.

“This strategic move will enable IndiGo to spread its wings further and expand its long-haul international network”, the company said in a statement.

“This is yet another step in defining the airline’s long-term plans of international expansion”.

The A350 planes, with ranges of up to 15,000 kilometres (9,300 miles), will allow it to further expand its network.

Overall, IndiGo has placed orders for around 1,000 aircraft from the A320 family, Airbus’s most successful model and rival of the Boeing 737 MAX, which has endured multiple setbacks after a series of safety scares.

Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which began its annual industry conference in New Delhi on Sunday, said “the development of India’s air connectivity in recent years has been nothing short of phenomenal”.

Indian domestic air growth is “running at over 10 percent” per year, Walsh said, ahead of the conference.

The growth of its economy has made India and its 1.4 billion people the world’s fourth-largest air market -- domestic and international -- with IATA projecting it will become the third biggest within the decade.

Last year, India’s domestic air passenger traffic reached a “historic milestone, surpassing 500,000 passengers in a single day”, according to India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation.

Railways remain hugely popular but travelling by trains crisscrossing a country about three-quarters the area of the European Union is often slow and chaotic.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is slated to address IATA delegates on Monday, has made the development of the air sector a priority since coming to power in 2014.

Separately, the International Air Transport Association said on Sunday it expects the amount of sustainable aviation fuel produced to double in 2025 to reach 2 million tonnes, representing 0.7% of airlines’ fuel consumption.

Influential industry body IATA has increasingly been warning that airlines will struggle to meet their sustainability goals, and has described the production of SAF - which is more expensive than conventional jet fuel - as disappointingly slow.

In a press statement issued during IATA’s Annual General Meeting, Director General Willie Walsh noted that the projected 2 million tonnes of SAF will account for just 0.7 percent of total fuel consumption this year.

The use of SAF has been increasingly prominent in recent years, as most countries have set stipulated targets to achieve net zero as part of their energy transition efforts.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7 percent of aviation’s total fuel needs,” said Walsh.

He added: “And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

The IATA official further stated that sufficient government measures, including the implementation of effective policies, are needed to meet decarbonization efforts.

He added that ensuring the success of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation is crucial to offsetting carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Under CORSIA, an initiative launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization, airplane operators must purchase and cancel “emissions units” to offset the increase in CO2 emissions.

“Advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production,” said IATA in the statement.

In a separate statement, IATA said that $1.3 billion in airline funds are blocked from repatriation by governments as of the end of April.

The industry body, however, noted that this figure also represents a 25 percent improvement compared to the $1.7 billion reported for October.

The aviation body also urged governments to remove all barriers preventing airlines from the timely repatriation of their revenues from ticket sales and other activities in accordance with international agreements and treaty obligations.

“Ensuring the timely repatriation of revenues is vital for airlines to cover dollar-denominated expenses and maintain their operations. Delays and denials violate bilateral agreements and increase exchange rate risks,” said Walsh.

He added: “Economies and jobs rely on international connectivity. Governments must realize that it is a challenge for airlines to maintain connectivity when revenue repatriation is denied or delayed.”",,N,,2025-06-01 12:57:00.310808

Air India CEO Campbell Wilson recently valuable insights into the airline's ambitious turnaround plan, operational challenges, and future growth strategy during a candid interview with Managing Editor of CNBC-TV18 Shereen Bhan. As soon as the conversation began, Wilson highlighted the transformative changes underway at Air India since Tata's acquisition. He noted that the airline's ongoing modernisation efforts, and vision is to become a world-class global carrier with a distinct Indian identity.

One of the most striking revelations was the scale and speed of the airline's transformation. Wilson described a five-year plan aimed at moving from stabilisation to sufficiency and now to efficiency. The airline has grown its fleet from under 100 aircraft to nearly 300 in just three years, with plans for further expansion supported by a marquee 470-aircraft order.

Significant investments have been made in upgrading physical infrastructure, IT systems, product quality, and human resources. Wilson emphasised that these efforts are not short-‘term fixes, but part of a sustained transformation designed to strengthen Air India's financial position and operational performance over the long term.

During the interview, he shed light on the extensive refit programme underway. ""The narrow-body fleet's refurbishment is nearly 75% complete, with expectations to finish the remainder by the end of the year. The wide-body refit programme, critical for long-haul routes, is ongoing and expected to conclude around 2027,"" Wilson said and added that these upgrades will enhance the passenger experience and make the new Air India's product visible across the network.

Wilson discussed operational resilience too, recalling how the airline managed flight disruptions during recent airspace closures due to geopolitical tensions. Through advanced contingency planning, quick rerouting, and close coordination, Air India minimised passenger disruption despite the challenging circumstances.

The meager supply—and more critically, the inefficient policy landscape—poses a significant risk to aviation’s long-term decarbonization goals and cost-effectiveness.

IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh delivered the message with urgency:

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double, the current levels are nowhere near enough. Worse, poor policy implementation—particularly in Europe—is inflating SAF costs unnecessarily.”

With global attention on climate change and energy security, IATA’s critique comes at a crucial time. The agency calls for structural reforms in SAF policy and urges governments worldwide to collaborate in scaling sustainable fuel production while protecting airlines from volatile and inflated costs. Notably, India’s rising role as a SAF innovator and biofuel hub stands out as a potential game-changer.

Europe’s SAF Mandates Backfire, Raising Costs

IATA’s concerns stem from the European Union and United Kingdom’s implementation of SAF blending mandates effective from January 1, 2025. These mandates, while meant to incentivize sustainable fuel adoption, are now causing unintended consequences due to premature rollout in the absence of robust supply chains and price controls.

For the one million tonnes of SAF expected to be purchased in Europe this year to meet these mandates:

Market prices are expected to hit $1.2 billion

Compliance fees—charged by suppliers—could add an estimated $1.7 billion

“Instead of promoting SAF, Europe’s mandates have made it five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel,” said Walsh. “That $1.7 billion could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions.”

The critique underlines a vital policy lesson: premature mandates without price control and production scale-up mechanisms undermine the goal of energy transition and strain aviation economies, particularly in the post-pandemic recovery period.

IATA’s Two Key SAF Initiatives

To mitigate these challenges, IATA is proactively building industry tools to support SAF growth:

CADO SAF Registry: Managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), this registry provides a transparent, standardized system for tracking SAF transactions, usage, and emissions reductions. It ensures compliance with global carbon accounting systems like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

SAF Matchmaker Platform: This new tool matches SAF demand from airlines with verified supply offers, improving procurement and planning, especially for carriers outside Europe and North America.

Both initiatives aim to streamline SAF adoption, reduce compliance confusion, and promote international alignment.

What Governments Must Do: IATA’s Three-Point Reform Agenda

IATA is calling on governments to act swiftly and strategically by focusing on three priority areas:

1. Equalize Policy for Renewables vs. Fossil Fuels

Renewable energy producers currently operate at a cost disadvantage due to long-standing fossil fuel subsidies, which according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), amount to over $1 trillion globally per year.

IATA urges governments to:

Redirect a portion of fossil fuel subsidies toward SAF innovation

Provide capital access, price guarantees, and tax credits to SAF producers

2. Integrate SAF in Broader Energy Policy

Governments must develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that ensures SAF is:

Allocated sufficient renewable feedstock

Supported with shared infrastructure and co-production systems

Recognized as a priority in national energy and transport strategies

3. Ensure CORSIA Success and Carbon Credit Access

IATA reiterates support for CORSIA as the sole global, market-based mechanism to offset international aviation CO₂. Airlines currently lack access to adequate Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs)—with Guyana being the only country offering carbon credits to airlines under CORSIA.

IATA calls on other states to:

Make carbon credits available

Create certification and trading channels

Harmonize international reporting standards

India’s Emerging Leadership in SAF and Biofuels

India is uniquely positioned to emerge as a global SAF leader—a fact that IATA acknowledges in its SAF market outlook. As the third-largest oil-consuming nation and one of the fastest-growing aviation markets, India’s proactive steps toward sustainable aviation could reshape not just domestic travel but global emissions outcomes.

India’s recent launch of the Global Biofuels Alliance aligns with its G20 Presidency 2023 priorities and signals a national commitment to renewable energy integration. The alliance aims to:

Establish biofuels as a pillar of global energy transition

Promote cross-border investments and technology transfers

Support regulatory frameworks for SAF and other green fuels

The Indian government, through the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG) and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), has set a 2% SAF blending target for international flights by 2028. Supporting policies include:

Guaranteed pricing for SAF producers

Capital support for infrastructure

Technical standards for feedstock and lifecycle assessments

In March 2025, IATA partnered with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries, two major biofuel stakeholders, to implement best practices in SAF production and feedstock validation.

Implications for India’s Travel and Tourism Industry

India’s leadership in SAF policy isn’t just an environmental win—it presents a strategic advantage for tourism and air travel.

According to the Ministry of Tourism, India welcomed 17.4 million foreign tourists in 2023, with forecasts predicting 25 million by 2028. Long-haul travelers increasingly prefer airlines with strong sustainability credentials, particularly in Europe, North America, and East Asia.

Adopting SAF at scale will allow Indian carriers like Air India, IndiGo, and Vistara to:

Enhance brand reputation in eco-conscious markets

Comply with EU SAF mandates for incoming international flights

Attract code-share partnerships and global tourism alliances

Additionally, eco-tourism and green travel packages, supported by SAF-powered routes, can create new revenue streams and sustainable employment in India’s Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

The integration of SAF into India’s aviation economy may also enable green corridors linking key tourism destinations like Kerala, Rajasthan, Ladakh, and the Andaman Islands—creating a competitive edge for India as a sustainable destination.

Conclusion: Time for Coordinated Action

IATA’s stark warning makes it clear that policy missteps risk stalling the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts, and that SAF must be scaled responsibly, affordably, and globally.

India’s progress—through its clear targets, policy backing, and industry partnerships—offers a model for other nations. If supported with the right economic tools and international collaboration, India can be a biofuel powerhouse that transforms not only its own aviation industry but contributes meaningfully to global climate goals.

In the words of IATA’s Willie Walsh:

“The aviation industry is ready. The technology is advancing. But governments must now provide the foundation through smart, effective policies that support—not stifle—the transition to sustainable flight.”

Peter Elbers, CEO, IndiGo, emphasized the carrier’s evolution from a domestic low-cost carrier to a global powerhouse, backed by strategic partnerships, infrastructure investment, and a commitment to sustainability.

Taking the stage, Elbers delivered a compelling vision of IndiGo’s future. “This is more than just about IndiGo — it's about India's aviation story,” Elbers said. “With the IATA AGM back in India after 42 years, it's a fitting time to show the world how India is redefining flight.”

Doubling Down on Growth

A major announcement during the event was the conversion of options into firm orders for 30 Airbus A350-900s, doubling IndiGo’s wide-body commitment to 60. With deliveries starting in 2027, the deliveries will now continue well beyond 2035.

“This is a great moment for IndiGo — and a great moment for India,” said Elbers. “The A350s are not just planes; they are bridges — between India and the world, between dreams and destinations.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Chief Commercial Officer, Airbus, joined Elbers on stage. “IndiGo has ordered over 1,400 aircraft with us. That scale is unprecedented,” said Saint-Exupéry. “It’s not just a business relationship — it’s a shared journey.”

India’s Aviation Moment

According to IATA, India is currently the third-largest domestic aviation market in the world and is projected to become the third-largest overall aviation market (domestic and international combined) by 2030, surpassing the United Kingdom. In 2023, IATA reported that India’s domestic passenger traffic grew by more than 22% year-on-year — a strong indicator of both economic momentum and evolving consumer behavior.

India also boasts one of the youngest flying populations globally, with a median age of just under 29. “An ambitious, mobile, and tech-savvy middle class is reshaping how India travels,” Elbers noted. “We see this reflected in every flight we operate. And we're here to meet that demand — not just with more seats, but with more choices, more comfort, and more destinations.”

Expanding Horizons: Domestically and Internationally

Elbers outlined IndiGo’s plans to expand its domestic network from 91 to 95 destinations this year, alongside a bold push to grow its international network from 41 to over 50 cities. Besides Amsterdam (AMS) and Manchester (MAN), Elbers announced that Athens (ATH), Copenhagen (CPH) and London will be the next European destinations, plus four Central Asian cities, including Siem Reap (SAI).

“This is just the beginning,” Elbers stated. “Today, 90% of India’s population lives within 100 kilometers of an IndiGo-served airport. Soon, we want to ensure that 90% of the world is within reach of our wings.”

Beyond Numbers: The IndiGo Way

While growth metrics were abundant — including 118 million passengers flown last year and over 2,300 daily flights — Elbers emphasized culture and values. “Every three days, one million customers board an IndiGo flight. But behind every seat is a story. A business dream. A long-overdue reunion. A student’s first step abroad. That's the real weight of what we carry.”

The airline has also led inclusivity efforts in aviation, employing the highest number of female pilots globally at 16% and offering work opportunities to people with disabilities across its operations.

New Products, New Partnerships

In a nod to changing customer expectations, IndiGo is enhancing its premium offerings. The airline’s “IndiGo Stretch” product — a business-class experience — is being expanded to international routes such as Singapore (SIN), Bangkok (BKK), Phuket (HKT), and Dubai (DXB). Additionally, IndiGo's frequent flyer program, Blue Chip, has already amassed over three million members.

IndiGo is also forming deeper global alliances. Hours before the press briefing, the airline announced plans to develop a partnership, enhancing the connectivity of India with Europe and North America with Delta Air Lines (DL), Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic (VS).

Recent partnerships with Delta, Virgin Atlantic, Air France-KLM, and Japan Airlines are enhancing IndiGo’s network connectivity and brand visibility abroad. “These aren’t just codeshares,” said Elbers. “They’re strategic bridges to the future.”

Investing in Infrastructure and Sustainability

Elbers announced that IndiGo is developing its own MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) facility in Bengaluru — a step toward operational independence and cost efficiency. ""India is brimming with engineering talent,"" he said. ""Why should we send our aircraft overseas when we can build world-class facilities here?""

On sustainability, Elbers acknowledged the global push toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and decarbonization. While SAF is not yet widely available in India, he admitted, “We’re committed to flying cleaner. With one of the youngest fleets in the world, IndiGo already has a strong emissions profile. And we are ready to do more as the technology and infrastructure evolve.”

Looking to 2030 and Beyond

Summing up the airline’s direction, Elbers shared a clear ambition: “By 2030, IndiGo will not just be India’s airline — it will be a global airline. Powered by Indian ambition, Indian talent, and Indian innovation.”

Elbers emphasized that the airline’s expansion is not just about size, but about strengthening connectivity, improving service, and building long-term alliances. “We are growing with purpose,” Elbers said. “As India continues to develop, IndiGo’s role is to connect people, places, and opportunities — both within the country and across the world.”

With firm plans in place, a growing fleet, and a focus on both access and efficiency, IndiGo is preparing for its next chapter — one that aims to align closely with India’s broader economic and global ambitions.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/683c5affc2040fc029ba96af_Image%20from%20Roberto%20Leiro%20Airways%20Magazine%20(1).webp,N,,2025-06-01 11:57:09.509750

In a press statement issued during IATA’s Annual General Meeting, Director General Willie Walsh noted that the projected 2 million tonnes of SAF will account for just 0.7 percent of total fuel consumption this year.

The use of SAF has been increasingly prominent in recent years, as most countries have set stipulated targets to achieve net zero as part of their energy transition efforts.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7 percent of aviation’s total fuel needs,” said Walsh.

He added: “And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

The IATA official further stated that sufficient government measures, including the implementation of effective policies, are needed to meet decarbonization efforts.

He added that ensuring the success of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation is crucial to offsetting carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Under CORSIA, an initiative launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization, airplane operators must purchase and cancel “emissions units” to offset the increase in CO2 emissions.

“Advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production,” said IATA in the statement.

In a separate statement, IATA said that $1.3 billion in airline funds are blocked from repatriation by governments as of the end of April.

The industry body, however, noted that this figure also represents a 25 percent improvement compared to the $1.7 billion reported for October.

The aviation body also urged governments to remove all barriers preventing airlines from the timely repatriation of their revenues from ticket sales and other activities in accordance with international agreements and treaty obligations.

“Ensuring the timely repatriation of revenues is vital for airlines to cover dollar-denominated expenses and maintain their operations. Delays and denials violate bilateral agreements and increase exchange rate risks,” said Walsh.

He added: “Economies and jobs rely on international connectivity. Governments must realize that it is a challenge for airlines to maintain connectivity when revenue repatriation is denied or delayed.”

RIYADH: The global industrial sector is witnessing a radical transformation toward adopting Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, prompting countries to reconsider traditional manufacturing methods and adopt smart solutions that include automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, and data-driven systems to improve production efficiency and reduce operational costs.

According to the Saudi Press Agency, the Kingdom is not only keeping pace with the global industrial transformation but also aims to lead it through strategic initiatives and specialized programs that promote smart industry practices and accelerate the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies.

This will enhance the competitiveness of Saudi Arabia’s industrial sector both regionally and globally, aligning with the goals of Vision 2030 and the National Industrial Strategy to position the Kingdom as a leading industrial power, one that supports global supply chains and exports high-tech products globally.

The Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources is undertaking this ambitious transformation by establishing an integrated and comprehensive national system to enhance advanced manufacturing, according to SPA.

It has launched the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center, which brings together all programs and initiatives that enable the adoption of modern manufacturing technologies and stimulate smart and innovative industrial solutions.

This initiative is in cooperation with various government entities related to the technology, research, and innovation sectors and in partnership with several global leaders in industrial technology.

The efforts under the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center include the Future Factories Program Initiative, the Industrial Beacons Program, the Accelerated Manufacturing Program, the Capability Centers Network, and the Operational Excellence Program, reported SPA.

These initiatives collectively support the center’s vision of becoming a unified national platform that accelerates the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies. They also serve as a bridge to help local manufacturers access cutting-edge solutions that improve efficiency, enhance quality, and reduce costs across the industrial sector.

The center aims to boost productivity and competitiveness in the manufacturing sector by localizing advanced and sustainable technologies, creating an attractive environment for industrial investment, and supporting skill development through its Capability Centers Network. It also offers experiential learning opportunities and provides advisory services to help industrial establishments adopt advanced manufacturing practices.

The efforts of the ministry are aligned with several government entities that support the center’s vision and objectives.

In 2022, the ministry launched the Future Factories initiative to support the smart transformation journey of industrial establishments, aiming to automate 4,000 Saudi factories and increase their production efficiency, reduce reliance on unskilled labor, and promote the adoption of advanced industrial solutions and practices.

The initiative offers numerous incentives and enablers to support the digital transformation of national factories, including financing solutions, consulting services, and the development and qualification of human resources to leverage the latest manufacturing technologies.

It also helps industrial establishments assess their technological maturity and develop transformation plans to adopt operational excellence practices and advanced manufacturing solutions, including AI, robotics, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics.

To support industrial transformation in the Kingdom and achieve global leadership in adopting advanced manufacturing technologies, the ministry launched the Industrial Beacons program.

This undertaking aims to enable leading Saudi factories to adopt Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, thereby enhancing their production efficiency and qualifying them to receive international recognition within the Global Lighthouse Network, an affiliate of the World Economic Forum, by 2030.

During the launch ceremony of the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center, the Ministry announced 10 national industrial companies that committed to achieving the standards of the Industrial Beacons initiative.

With the launch of the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center and its targeted initiatives to promote advanced technologies and foster research and innovation in the industrial sector, the Kingdom signals that its ambitions extend beyond simply keeping pace with global industrial trends.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Madinah region recorded strong first quarter growth in 2025, led by 24 percent workforce participation in construction and 20 percent in trade, signaling diversification momentum.

A recent report by the Madinah Chamber of Commerce outlines the region’s sectoral distribution, with construction continuing to dominate amid a surge in infrastructure projects, the Saudi Press Agency reported.

The wholesale, retail trade, and vehicle maintenance sector, which accounted for 20 percent of the workforce, continued to thrive, demonstrating strong commercial activity and consumer demand. This segment’s high employment rate underscores Madinah’s role as a regional trading hub.

The manufacturing sector, representing 12 percent of the workforce, showed growth that indicates the emergence of a stronger industrial base, contributing to economic diversification and reducing reliance on oil-related industries.

Tourism, with an 11.2 percent workforce share, remained a key sector for Madinah as a destination for religious tourism, benefiting from a steady influx of pilgrims. The sector’s workforce expansion aligns with increased investment in hospitality, transportation, and tourism-related services, the SPA report added.

The chairman of the chamber, Mazen bin Ibrahim Rajab, emphasized the focus on improving the business environment by leveraging Madinah’s economic strengths and investment opportunities.

The report situated Madinah’s growth within broader economic trends. In 2024, the worldwide economic growth reached 3.2 percent, supported by a rebound in foreign direct investment, while inflation declined to 4.5 percent, signaling improving economic stability.

The Kingdom’s gross domestic product grew by 4.4 percent in 2024, with non-oil sectors expanding by 5.9 percent. Madinah contributed significantly to this trend, recording a 2.8 percent increase in its GDP, reaching SR57.6 billion ($15.3 billion) in the third quarter of 2024.

The report showed that Madinah recorded the second-highest domestic demand growth in Saudi Arabia at 11 percent, trailing only Riyadh.

Additionally, foreign direct investment in the Kingdom surged by 36.6 percent in the third quarter 2024, reaching SR16 billion, with Madinah attracting a notable share due to its expanding industrial and commercial opportunities.

The report also highlighted Madinah’s booming real estate and infrastructure sectors with property transactions in 2024 totaling SR10 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence.

The job market improved significantly, with unemployment dropping from 10.3 percent in the third quarter of 2024 to 8.4 percent in the following three-month period, thanks to new employment opportunities across key sectors.

A total of 213 development projects, valued at over SR210 billion, are currently in progress, according to the report. These include 153 commercial projects, 27 mixed-use residential and commercial developments and other projects in healthcare, education, tourism, and religious infrastructure.

These initiatives are expected to generate more than 119,000 jobs, further boosting Madinah’s economic prospects.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has opened the June subscription window for its savings sukuk product “Sah,” offering a return rate of 4.76 percent, as part of its 2025 issuance calendar.

Organized by the National Debt Management Center under the Ministry of Finance, Sah is the Kingdom’s first savings-focused sukuk designed for individual investors.

The Shariah-compliant, riyal-denominated product is part of the local bonds program aimed at fostering financial inclusion and increasing personal savings.

The June issuance opened for subscription from 10 a.m. on Sunday, June 1, until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, June 3.

The bonds are structured for a one-year term with fixed returns, and profits will be paid at maturity.

The minimum subscription is set at one bond with a value of SR1,000 ($266.56), while the maximum subscription per investor is capped at SR200,000.

The product aligns with the Financial Sector Development Program under Saudi Vision 2030, which targets raising the national savings rate from 6 percent to 10 percent by 2030.

The June issuance of Sah offers a slightly higher return compared to May, rising to 4.76 percent from the previous month’s 4.66 percent, reflecting marginal shifts in market conditions.

While both issuances maintain the same structure — Shariah-compliant, riyal-denominated sukuk with a one-year maturity and fixed returns — the June window opened slightly earlier in the month, running from June 1 to June 3, compared to May’s window from May 4 to May 6.

Subscription terms remain unchanged, with a minimum investment of SR1,000 and a cap of SR200,000 per individual.

Both offerings are accessible through the same network of approved financial institutions.

Sah is promoted as a secure, fee-free savings instrument offering stable, government-backed returns.

Eligible investors must be Saudi nationals aged 18 and above and must subscribe through approved platforms provided by SNB Capital, Aljazira Capital, and Alinma Investment, as well as SAB Invest, or Al-Rajhi Capital.

The sukuk is issued monthly, and the return rate for each tranche is determined based on prevailing market conditions.

NDMC CEO Hani Al-Medaini said in March that the sukuk serves as a catalyst for private sector cooperation and participation in developing and launching various savings products tailored to diverse demographics.

These initiatives could involve partnerships with banks, fund managers, financial technology companies, and more.

RIYADH: Total outstanding credit extended by Oman’s banking sector, comprising both conventional and Islamic institutions, rose by 9 percent year-on-year to 33.6 billion Omani rials ($87.3 billion) at the end of April, according to new data.

According to the Central Bank of Oman, private sector credit rose by 7 percent to 27.8 billion rials. Non-financial corporations held the largest share at 46.6 percent, followed closely by the household sector at 44 percent.

Financial corporations held 5.6 percent, while other sectors represented the remaining 3.7 percent.

Deposits across the banking system also showed robust growth. “Total deposits held with ODCs (other depository corporations) registered a YoY significant growth of 9.3 percent to reach 32.8 billion Omani rials at the end of April 2025,” the report stated.

Of this, private sector deposits reached 21.5 billion rials, a 7.1 percent increase from the previous year.

Household deposits contributed the largest share at 50.3 percent, followed by non-financial corporations at 30.4 percent, financial corporations at 17 percent, and other sectors at 2.3 percent.

Credit extended by conventional banks grew by 7.9 percent to 21.3 billion rials, while their aggregate deposits increased by 6.1 percent to 25.7 billion rials.

The banking sectors across the Gulf Cooperation Council countries have demonstrated credit growth, reflecting the region’s economic resilience and strategic investments.

In Saudi Arabia, outstanding credit facilities reached SR2.96 trillion by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, marking a 14.4 percent year-on-year increase.

However, Qatar’s banking sector saw a slight contraction, with total credit facilities declining by 0.2 percent to 1.4 trillion Qatari riyals, primarily due to reduced lending to the public sector and consumption.

Oman’s private sector deposits with conventional banks rose 4.5 percent to 16.8 billion rials in April.

Investments in government development bonds increased by 6.2 percent to 2 billion rials, whereas holdings in foreign securities declined by 3.7 percent to 2.1 billion rials.

Islamic banks and windows also demonstrated strong performance. Their total assets increased by 18.1 percent to 8.9 billion rials, accounting for 19.6 percent of the total banking assets.

Financing provided by these entities reached 7.2 billion rials, marking a 13.5 percent annual increase. Total deposits held by Islamic banks and windows increased by 22.6 percent to 7.1 billion rials.

Broad money supply grew 7.5 percent to 25.4 billion rials, driven by a 12 percent rise in narrow money and a 6 percent increase in quasi-money components.

Currency held by the public rose by 7.5 percent, while demand deposits expanded by 16.8 percent.

Interest rate trends showed mixed movements. The weighted average interest rate on deposits with conventional banks rose to 2.594 percent in April, up from 2.580 percent a year earlier.

Meanwhile, the weighted average lending rate fell to 5.555 percent from 5.604 percent.

The overnight domestic interbank lending rate dropped to 4.392 percent, down from 5.212 percent the previous year, reflecting a decrease in the central bank’s repo rate to 5 percent in line with US monetary policy trends.

Oman’s nominal gross domestic product increased by 1 percent year on year in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by a 4.1 percent expansion in the non-hydrocarbon sector.

Real GDP rose by 1.7 percent, supported by 3.9 percent growth in non-hydrocarbon activities.

The average oil price stood at $75.9 per barrel at the end of April, 5.2 percent lower than a year earlier.

Average daily oil production was 986,700 barrels, reflecting a 1 percent decline.

The broader aviation sector agreed in 2021 to target net-zero emissions in 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to SAF, which is made from waste oil and biomass.

Airlines are at odds with energy companies over scarce supplies of SAF, while also pointing the finger at plane makers Airbus and Boeing over delays in delivering more fuel-efficient jets.

The Problem with the Use of Mandates

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025. Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion. Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonisation policies. Europe needs to realise that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.

Focus on India

India, one of the emerging economies on the world stage today, is the third-largest oil user after the US and China. India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to position biofuels as a key to energy transition and economic growth. This includes a target for 2% SAF blending for international flights by 2028 with enabling policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards. IATA will be working with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries Limited, to provide guidance on global best practices for life cycle assessment of the use of feedstocks in the country.",https://www.timesaerospace.aero/sites/aerospace/times/files/ta-favico.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 11:57:19.550843

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

IATA members preceded ICAO by a year, at their 2021 General Assembly, in setting this ambitious goal, which requires colossal investments.

But SAF fuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

New Delhi – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that it expects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to reach 2 million tonnes (Mt) (2.5 billion liters) or 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Problem with the Use of Mandates

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025. Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion. Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.

IATA’s Role in Supporting the Development of a Global SAF Market

To support the development of a global SAF market, IATA has worked on two initiatives:

A SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) that brings a transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations such as Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

The SAF Matchmaker that will facilitate SAF procurement by matching airline requests for SAF with supply offers.

Urgent Action by Governments Is Needed

IATA urges governments to focus on three areas:

Creating more effective policies. Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular. This includes redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel.

Develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF. Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production. A wholistic approach should support joint use of infrastructure, co-production and other measures that will benefit the energy transition for aviation and for all other economic sectors.

Ensure the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions. IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date Guyana is the only state to have made their carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against their CORSIA obligations.

Focus on India

India, one of the emerging economies on the world stage today, is the third-largest oil user after the US and China. India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to position biofuels as a key to energy transition and economic growth. This includes a target for 2% SAF blending for international flights by 2028 with enabling policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards. IATA will be working with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries Limited, to provide guidance on global best practices for life cycle assessment of the use of feedstocks in the country.

As the third-largest global civil aviation market, India can strengthen its leadership in biofuels with the accelerated adoption of SAF through progressive policies.

The London-based owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia revealed the group is currently paying less than 60% of the market rate for sustainable aviation fuel.

This follows the firm's recent GBP2.6 billion push into green fuel, and its decision to enter long-term contracts with green fuel suppliers.

The Sunday Times said net-zero fuel quotas are expected to drive up fares over the next few years, as the price of SAF is currently between two and seven times higher than traditional kerosene.

SAF is claimed to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

German airline group Deutsche Lufthansa AG has already introduced a supplement of up to EUR72 per ticket to offset this anticipated increase in fuel costs.

Virgin Atlantic, meanwhile, has announced a USD24 surcharge to fund minimum green fuel quotas, and warned that a return trip to New York could cost USD40 more per person as SAF usage increases.

IAG Head of Sustainability Jonathon Counsell said that investing in SAF early would give the group a ""competitive advantage"" over its rivals, The Sunday Times reported.

IAG has committed USD3.5 billion to its SAF programme over more than a decade.

""Few industry watchers believe IAG's strategy will reduce fares in the medium to long term; but the hope is that some of the savings of discounted contracts can be passed on to customers,"" added the Sunday Times.

IAG spent EUR7.6 billion on fuel in its last financial year, making it the group's single largest expense.

IAG executives said that increases in the SAF mandate each year would also benefit the FTSE 100 group by making it hard for new airlines to start up, The Sunday Times reported.

The UK mandates 2% of jet fuel must be SAF this year, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

EU rules also require carriers to include 2% of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, which then rises to 6% in 2030 and soars to 70% from 2050.

Shares in IAG closed down 2.1% at 325.90 pence each in London on Friday. The stock is up 86% over the past year.

From June 1 to June 3, 2025, India proudly hosts the 81st Annual General Meeting (AGM) and the World Air Transport Summit (WATS) of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in New Delhi—a globally significant event that marks India’s elevated status in the world of aviation.

The summit, organised in partnership with IndiGo Airlines, brings together over 1,700 delegates including top airline executives, government officials, aviation industry experts, and media from across the globe.

This is the first time since 1983 that India has hosted the IATA AGM, reaffirming its growing influence in the global aviation landscape.

With record-breaking aircraft orders, cutting-edge infrastructure, and consistent passenger growth, India is being hailed as one of the most dynamic aviation markets in the 21st century.

A Landmark Gathering at a Pivotal Time

The event is expected to be inaugurated with a keynote address from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, emphasizing the government’s deep commitment to aviation-driven growth. This aligns with India’s National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) and UDAN Scheme (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik), which have democratized air travel and enhanced regional connectivity.

According to India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), the number of operational airports in the country has more than doubled over the past decade—from 74 in 2014 to over 150 by 2024.

Speaking about the importance of this event, Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, said: “We are excited to bring the IATA AGM to India after a 42-year gap. India’s place in global aviation has changed dramatically, particularly over the last decade. The country has seen record aircraft orders, impressive growth, and world-class infrastructure developments.”

India’s Aviation Landscape: Fast Growth and Economic Impact

The numbers reflect this transformation. According to IATA data supported by the Government of India, India’s aviation sector directly employs around 369,700 people and contributes $5.6 billion to the nation’s GDP. When including indirect, induced, and tourism-related impacts, the aviation industry supports 7.7 million jobs and $53.6 billion, equivalent to 1.5% of India’s GDP.

The MoCA further estimates that the sector will grow at a CAGR of 10% over the next five years, making India the third-largest aviation market globally by 2030. Strategic government initiatives like GAGAN (GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation) and airspace modernization projects are also facilitating faster, safer, and more environmentally friendly air travel.

Host Airline IndiGo Takes Center Stage

India’s largest airline, IndiGo, serves as the host airline for the IATA AGM. Pieter Elbers, IndiGo’s CEO and Chair of the IATA Board of Governors, expressed pride in India’s role as a rising aviation hub:

“As the host airline of the 81st IATA Annual General Meeting, IndiGo warmly welcomes the global airline community to India. India’s aviation market is rapidly thriving while significantly contributing to the country’s socio-economic growth. This is India’s time!”

IndiGo currently controls over 60% of India’s domestic market and has placed historic orders for new aircraft, underscoring its role in making Indian aviation competitive on the world stage.

World Air Transport Summit 2025: Key Issues on the Table

Following the AGM, the World Air Transport Summit (WATS) will explore urgent topics shaping the future of global aviation. The summit’s centerpiece, the CEO Panel, moderated by CNN’s Richard Quest, features major industry leaders:

Pieter Elbers, CEO, IndiGo

Joanna Geraghty, CEO, JetBlue

Adrian Neuhauser, CEO, Abra Group

Richard Smith, COO International and CEO Airline, FedEx

The CEO Panel will address:

Global financial outlook for airlines

India’s strategic aviation expansion

Energy security and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Innovative financing for net-zero aviation

Cost of payments and transaction innovations

The operational perspectives of airline COOs

The event aligns closely with sustainability goals under India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and global aviation’s commitment to Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050, as outlined in IATA’s Net Zero Roadmap.

Sustainability in Focus: SAF and Financing

One of the most anticipated sessions at WATS will cover Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With SAF production expected to reach 17 billion liters by 2030, as per IATA, countries like India have a key role in scaling domestic production using agricultural and municipal waste. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) supports biofuel initiatives through its National Bio-Energy Mission, promoting SAF as a cleaner, scalable alternative to traditional aviation fuels.

Further, global financial institutions and governments are exploring innovative financing models—green bonds, ESG investments, and carbon offsets—to fund the shift toward net-zero aviation.

Gender Diversity Takes the Spotlight

Another major highlight of the event is the sixth edition of the IATA Diversity & Inclusion Awards. These awards support the 25by2025 initiative, which aims to increase female representation in aviation leadership roles by at least 25% or to 25% minimum by 2025.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and IATA, women currently account for only 5% of airline CEOs and 3% of pilot roles globally. The awards aim to accelerate progress by recognizing individuals and organizations committed to gender equity in aviation.

India’s Strategic Aviation Vision

India’s hosting of the 2025 IATA AGM comes at a crucial moment. As the world seeks to rebound from global disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical challenges, India is positioning aviation as a key economic pillar.

The Indian government’s “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-Reliant India) initiative includes massive investment in airports, air cargo, and indigenous manufacturing—particularly through partnerships with global OEMs such as Airbus and Boeing. Meanwhile, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Drone and Aviation Components, led by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, is strengthening domestic capabilities.

A Milestone Moment for Global Aviation

As airlines worldwide face a complex future—balancing recovery, digital transformation, and decarbonization—the IATA AGM in New Delhi provides a powerful platform for shared strategy and innovation.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh encapsulated this vision:

“The AGM is always a moment for the industry to reflect and regroup in the face of enormous economic, geopolitical and technological forces. I’m confident this gathering will deliver value to our stakeholders and strengthen our commitment to progress and collaboration.”",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/maxresdefault-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 07:56:17.157414

The SAF British Airways uses is produced from a wide range of renewable sources, including used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and even forestry residue.
British Airways is responding to that demand by turning sustainability into a core part of its brand identity.","British Airways is rolling out a sweeping plan to offer cheaper and more sustainable flights across the UK, Switzerland, and Norway, driven by a £2.6 billion investment aimed at cutting emissions, modernising its fleet, and improving fuel efficiency—moves that will allow the airline to reduce operating costs and pass savings on to passengers while meeting tough environmental targets.

British Airways is preparing to transform the global airline industry by combining lower ticket prices with bold environmental leadership. The UK-based carrier is investing £2.6 billion—approximately \$3.5 billion—into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a move that positions it to underprice competitors in the UK, Switzerland, Norway, and beyond while pushing ahead with its goal to decarbonize air travel.

British Airways has positioned itself for long-term success through this bold investment, gaining a crucial edge over competitors. While many carriers are grappling with the financial burden of soaring sustainable fuel prices, British Airways has proactively secured future-focused supply deals that lock in favorable SAF rates. These agreements insulate the airline from looming cost surges, enabling it to keep fares competitive even as others begin adding extra charges to offset their fuel expenses.

Long known for its premium image and higher ticket prices, British Airways is now reshaping its pricing approach while holding firm on the quality of its service. As sustainable aviation fuel becomes increasingly expensive—costing as much as seven times more than traditional jet fuel—airlines across the industry are being forced to choose between absorbing the financial hit or passing it on to passengers. British Airways, having invested early and strategically in SAF, is uniquely positioned to avoid both options.

British Airways’ move to prioritize sustainable aviation fuel comes at a time when the aviation sector is under mounting pressure to cut carbon emissions. Across the globe, governments are introducing mandates that compel airlines to include a set proportion of SAF in their fuel mix. While this push supports the broader goal of reaching net-zero emissions, it also brings a new challenge—rising operational costs that could make air travel noticeably more expensive.

While other airlines brace for regulatory penalties or announce added fees, British Airways is using its early lead to gain pricing power. By locking in SAF supply well ahead of industry-wide mandates, the airline can offer greener flights without burdening travelers with extra costs. This approach also shields the airline from unpredictable SAF market swings that could destabilize ticket pricing elsewhere.

Several European carriers have already implemented environmental fees in response to SAF pricing challenges. One major airline has imposed a cost surcharge on all flights departing from the EU, UK, Switzerland, and Norway, with fees climbing as high as £60 per ticket depending on route distance. Another operator recently tacked on a £24 fuel surcharge, citing its efforts to meet sustainability targets through SAF integration.

Rather than shifting the financial burden onto its passengers, British Airways has opted to shoulder the initial costs of sustainable aviation fuel itself. By doing so, the airline sets itself apart in a market where many competitors are adding surcharges. This approach allows British Airways to appeal to travelers who are not only budget-conscious but also value eco-friendly choices in how they fly.

The SAF British Airways uses is produced from a wide range of renewable sources, including used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and even forestry residue. This eco-friendly fuel can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to standard jet fuel, making it a critical part of the aviation industry’s climate strategy.

British Airways isn’t just purchasing fuel—it’s shaping the supply chain. The airline was the first to use SAF made at commercial scale in the UK, thanks to a landmark partnership with a domestic fuel refinery. It also actively supports research and development to make SAF more scalable and cost-effective for the entire sector.

With global SAF demand on the rise, British Airways understands that early positioning is key. Airlines that delay adoption will likely face tighter supply, higher procurement costs, and an increasingly competitive marketplace. Those airlines may resort to charging more or cutting services, while early adopters like British Airways will retain flexibility and customer loyalty.

Despite these advantages, British Airways is not immune to broader industry pressures. The global SAF market remains small, with supply bottlenecks and logistical challenges still in play. However, the airline is working to expand access by supporting suppliers, investing in infrastructure, and contributing to cross-sector collaborations that aim to scale SAF production in line with rising demand.

The airline’s larger goal is clear: achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 without sacrificing its customer experience or market competitiveness. That requires more than just cleaner fuel. British Airways is also exploring fuel efficiency technologies, hybrid-electric propulsion, and operational changes that reduce environmental impact.

Still, SAF remains the cornerstone of its decarbonization plan. Unlike carbon offset schemes—which have come under scrutiny—SAF directly reduces the emissions from each flight. That direct impact resonates with climate-conscious travelers and regulators alike.

British Airways also recognizes the importance of making green travel accessible. By offering lower fares while maintaining environmental integrity, the airline removes the financial barrier that often comes with sustainable options. It proves that environmentally friendly choices don’t always need to cost more.

This approach also reflects shifting consumer expectations. More travelers now demand accountability from airlines—not just in comfort and service but in how their flights impact the planet. British Airways is responding to that demand by turning sustainability into a core part of its brand identity.

As the airline pushes forward with its SAF rollout, its strategy stands in sharp contrast to competitors who remain reactive or hesitant. The decision to invest early in SAF wasn’t just about climate—it was about long-term viability in a changing aviation landscape.

British Airways is investing £2.6 billion to offer more affordable and eco-friendly flights across the UK, Switzerland, and Norway by upgrading its fleet, cutting emissions, and boosting fuel efficiency. This move aims to lower operational costs and meet sustainability targets while expanding greener travel options.

British Airways is betting that sustainability and affordability can go hand in hand. If it succeeds, it won’t just redefine its own future—it will challenge the entire airline industry to follow suit. In a world where flying cleaner usually means paying more, British Airways is trying to rewrite the rules—and passengers may be the biggest winners.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-06-01T144833230.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 07:56:20.922543

India, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, is at the heart of this collaboration. By linking IndiGo’s extensive domestic network with Delta’s strength in North America and the transatlantic, the extensive reach of Air France-KLM in Europe and North America, and the U.K. and transatlantic presence of Virgin Atlantic, the partnership is poised to offer travelers broader access, smoother journeys, and a more consistent experience across continents. Linking dozens of cities in the United States, Canada, Europe and India, the airlines aim to meet rising demand for international travel while setting new standards for connectivity and cooperation in global aviation.

Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo, said: “IndiGo has embarked on an ambitious journey to become a global airline by 2030. This partnership represents another important milestone to pursue commercial synergies, operational excellence and innovation. This announcement not only expands our relationship with Air France–KLM and Virgin Atlantic but also marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter as we welcome Delta Air Lines as a valued partner. We are particularly excited to start our long-haul expansion from this Summer and connect with our partners’ networks to provide greater access to Europe and North America. This strategic partnership enables a compelling combined customer proposition in the form of comprehensive intercontinental connectivity, seamless experience and great loyalty value. It also lays the groundwork for us to exchange best practices in areas of technology, operational excellence and service delivery.”

Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, said: “This agreement is another example of our commitment to making travel more connected, more inclusive and more accessible. Combining our strengths with those of IndiGo, Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic, will enable us to offer unparalleled connectivity and convenience, ensuring that our customers enjoy the highest standards of service and reliability across the globe. We look forward to restarting Delta’s direct service from the U.S. to India in the near future.”

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, said: “We are very glad to extend our existing partnership with IndiGo and to do so alongside our partners Delta and Virgin Atlantic. India is a strategic market for Air France-KLM, where we have a strong and historic presence soon to increase. We look forward to welcoming IndiGo customers on our flights and to play an active role in the country’s connectivity.”

Shai Weiss, CEO of Virgin Atlantic, said: “In our 25th year of flying to India, we’re delighted to build on our Joint Venture with Delta and Air France-KLM, and our successful codeshare with IndiGo, by going further with this partnership. As IndiGo starts long haul operations, we’ll connect four of the world’s largest economies, enhancing the travel experience for our guests, from greater connectivity and optimized flight times to loyalty benefits.”

Connecting Route Networks, 2022 and Beyond

IndiGo has had partnerships with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic and with Air France-KLM since 2022. Since then, Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic customers have had access to more than 30 IndiGo points in India.

More recently, IndiGo announced the start of service to Europe, which, in addition to expanding the existing partnership with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic transatlantic flights, facilitates a new partnership opportunity between IndiGo and Delta, enabling Indigo’s customers to connect to Delta’s broad transatlantic network. After commercial contracts and regulatory procedures are completed to allow IndiGo to sell partner flights as its own under its own 6E* marketing codes, IndiGo customers will be able to book onward travel on select flights operated by its international partners, making it easier to reach destinations across Europe and North America. These include:

KLM flights from Amsterdam to 30 points within Europe

Delta and KLM flights from Amsterdam to the United States and Canada

Virgin Atlantic flights from Manchester to the United States

For its part, KLM’s recently announced new route connecting Amsterdam with Hyderabad offers further opportunity for cooperation with IndiGo. With the route’s launch in September 2025, Air France-KLM will begin selling IndiGo flights to 24 destinations beyond Hyderabad.

IndiGo has previously announced that it will enhance its fleet of damp leased B787 to six aircraft later this year and has in place a long-term firm order of 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft, with options for 70 more. As these aircraft join IndiGo’s fleet, the airline’s long-haul expansion will enable further and deeper cooperation between IndiGo and Delta, Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic in the future.

Delta, meanwhile, plans to resume services to India with nonstop flights between Atlanta and Delhi, subject to government approval. The service start date will be announced later.

Empreendedoras enfrentam desafios para acesso ao crédito

Apesar de representarem quase metade dos novos empreendedores, as mulheres ainda recebem apenas 29,4% dos recursos de crédito, segundo dados do Serviço Brasileiro de Apoio às Micro e Pequenas Empresas (Sebrae). A presidente do Conselho da Mulher Empreendedora e da Cultura (CMEC), Ana Claudia Badra Cotait, alerta para a desigualdade no sistema financeiro, que impõe juros mais altos e exige garantias que muitas não possuem. Programas como o Acredita Delas e iniciativas de cooperativas, como Sicredi e Cresol, buscam mudar esse cenário com linhas exclusivas e apoio técnico.

Southwest Airlines (WN) is undergoing a strategic transformation while holding firm to its core strengths.

A highly efficient domestic network, cost control, and exceptional employee-driven service. CEO Bob Jordan highlighted the airline’s financial pressure, especially in comparison to past industry-leading profitability.

To adapt, the airline is exploring additional revenue sources long embraced by competitors, such as baggage fees and seating options.

A major strategic shift is the introduction of assigned seating, marking a significant change for the carrier traditionally known for open seating.

This move, according to Jordan, aligns with modern passenger expectations. The airline aims to offer more personalized services and travel experiences, acknowledging that passengers fly for diverse reasons and increasingly expect flexibility and options.

Southwest’s new phase includes expanded international connectivity.

Through a partnership with Icelandair, customers can book transatlantic journeys with seamless links between Southwest’s US cities, Baltimore (BWI), Denver (DEN), and Nashville (BNA), and Icelandair’s European destinations.

More expansion is anticipated as the airline seeks to build a more globally connected route structure.

Confidence in Boeing

Despite Southwest’s fleet being entirely made up of Boeing 737 aircraft, Jordan dismissed concerns about supplier risk.

Instead, he expressed confidence in Boeing’s recent progress, noting visible factory improvements and stronger leadership floor relations.

While acknowledging past supply chain issues, Jordan believes Boeing is now on a more stable path and will fulfill Southwest’s upcoming aircraft orders.

Commitment to Modernization

Jordan welcomed federal plans to modernize US airspace infrastructure, describing current systems as outdated and restrictive.

He emphasized that no industry can scale efficiently using decades-old technology.

Encouragingly, the current administration’s prioritization of airspace reform, with committed funding and leadership, is seen as a pivotal step forward.

Regulatory collaboration is another area of focus. While consumer protection remains paramount, Jordan advocates for balanced regulations that benefit both travelers and businesses.

Constructive engagement between the Department of Transportation and airlines can, he says, lead to improved outcomes for all stakeholders.

Operational Efficiency

Southwest is doubling down on sustainability, with a clear strategy to integrate more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The airline backs government subsidies to scale SAF production, noting its current cost, three times that of conventional fuel, as the main barrier.

Airlines are eager to adopt SAF, but producers need long-term assurance to commit capital for development.

Beyond SAF, Southwest’s move to a full Boeing 737 MAX fleet is central to its emissions reduction strategy.

These newer aircraft offer major gains in fuel efficiency. Complementing the fleet upgrade are AI-driven innovations to optimize ground routing, gate assignments, and aircraft turnaround time, drastically improving operational efficiency and reducing carbon output.

Industry Opportunities

Southwest is adapting to new retailing models such as Offers and Orders, which focus on what customers actually want to buy rather than outdated sales processes.

This shift allows the airline to meet passenger expectations with greater clarity and flexibility.

On the broader industry front, Jordan sees both challenges and opportunities, from supply chain issues to economic headwinds.

Yet, he remains optimistic, citing the aviation sector’s proven resilience. Southwest, in particular, is targeting $1 billion in cost savings as part of a long-term efficiency drive, positioning itself to thrive regardless of external pressures.

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by the Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport in April. ZRCC is one of the leading SAF manufacturers in Asia to independently develop bio-jet fuel technology. This batch of SAF was converted from used cooking oil using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. As part of the first batch of SAF exported by ZRCC to Hong Kong, it has been certified by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) that it can reduce the lifecycle carbon emissions by about 80%, compared with conventional jet fuel.

What is SAF?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel produced from waste materials or other non-fossil carbon sources. As demonstrated by this batch, SAF has the potential to significantly lower its lifecycle carbon emissions as compared with fossil fuels, helping address the environmental impact of passenger and cargo air transport. This agreement with Sinopec demonstrates the potential for further cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the SAF supply chain.

Adoption of SAF from the Chinese Mainland

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: “Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.”

Last year, Cathay Pacific also adopted two batches of SAF from the Chinese Mainland, which were uplifted at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and London Heathrow Airport respectively.

Looking to the future

In recent years, the production and adoption of SAF has gained momentum across Asia. Cathay Pacific is working closely with different partners with the aim to expand the use of SAF in Asia. In March 2025, Cathay Pacific reached an agreement with fuel supplier SK Energy, which will supply SAF to Cathay Pacific from 2025 to 2027 in South Korea. At the same time, Cathay Pacific will continue to draw on its own experience to support Hong Kong to scale up SAF usage with supportive policy, in order to further strengthen Hong Kong International Airport’s status as a leading international aviation hub.",https://pimwp.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/2025/05/bOb7kVNu-Madhuri-PIM-Template.png,N,,2025-06-01 06:56:38.024627

By being an early adopter of SAF and securing long-term fuel agreements, the airline aims to reduce costs while maintaining its commitment to sustainability. As other airlines struggle with rising SAF prices and environmental surcharges, British Airways’ strategy gives it a unique edge, positioning the carrier to deliver affordable and eco-friendly flights to passengers across its network.

British Airways, the UK’s flag carrier, has long been recognized for its premium services and extensive route network, often making it a more expensive option compared to low-cost airlines. However, this price gap may soon shrink, driven by a significant £2.6 billion (\$3.5 billion) investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). With this strategic shift, British Airways is poised to undercut its rivals and deliver more competitive pricing to its passengers while continuing to prioritize sustainability.

As an early adopter and major advocate for SAF, British Airways is working toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The airline has made significant strides in using SAF produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, woody biomass, waste tyres, and agricultural byproducts like orchard and forestry waste. These eco-friendly fuels are expected to play a crucial role in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint, a sector traditionally reliant on fossil fuels.

British Airways is leading the way in adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), establishing a pioneering benchmark for the entire airline industry. It became the first airline in the world to utilize SAF produced at a commercial scale in the UK, thanks to a groundbreaking multi-year partnership with Phillips 66. This commitment to SAF is in line with the broader industry trend of decarbonization, where airlines are seeking more sustainable options for jet fuel in the face of growing environmental concerns.

The move to SAF is part of a broader effort within the airline industry to reduce carbon emissions. Governments across the globe have started to impose mandates requiring airlines to use a certain percentage of SAF in their fuel mix. The transition to SAF is expected to have far-reaching implications, particularly in terms of cost. Currently, SAF can be up to seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel, and as these mandates become stricter, the price of SAF is expected to increase. This price increase could lead to higher ticket prices across the board as airlines pass on the costs to passengers.

In anticipation of the rising cost of sustainable fuel, several airlines, including Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, have already implemented surcharges to offset the added expenses of SAF. Lufthansa, Germany’s flagship carrier, has introduced an environmental cost surcharge on all tickets for flights originating from the 27 EU countries, as well as from the UK, Norway, and Switzerland. This surcharge varies based on the route, with prices ranging from 84p (€1) to £60.70 (€72). Similarly, Virgin Atlantic has added a £24 surcharge, aiming to cover the rising costs associated with using SAF in its fleet. The airline’s CEO has also warned that a return flight between London and New York could cost £40 more per passenger as SAF usage becomes more widespread.

However, British Airways is working hard to mitigate the impact of these rising costs on its passengers. By being an early adopter of SAF, the airline has secured long-term contracts that allow it to lock in SAF prices at a lower rate than what is projected for the open market. This strategic move not only positions British Airways as a leader in sustainability but also gives the airline an edge when it comes to pricing. While other carriers are forced to introduce surcharges and hike ticket prices, British Airways may be able to shield its customers from the worst of the price increases associated with the transition to green fuel.

British Airways is betting on SAF to be a key driver in making air travel more sustainable while keeping its pricing competitive. The airline’s early adoption and strategic partnerships with fuel suppliers put it in a favorable position, ensuring that it can offer customers a relatively affordable way to fly while remaining committed to decarbonization goals. The airline’s efforts to push the boundaries of sustainability are a part of a broader shift within the aviation industry, where more companies are taking responsibility for reducing their environmental impact.

The rising cost of SAF, however, does come with challenges. While British Airways may have an advantage in securing discounted fuel prices, the overall industry is likely to see rising fares as SAF becomes more integrated into the aviation sector. The introduction of additional environmental surcharges, like those seen with Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, could become more widespread as airlines pass on the increased costs to passengers.

Despite these challenges, British Airways is working to balance the cost implications with its sustainability goals. The airline’s commitment to SAF and its investment in green fuel technology demonstrate its dedication to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 while remaining competitive in a rapidly changing market. British Airways’ move to outpace its competitors in providing sustainable air travel demonstrates that environmental responsibility can go hand in hand with affordable pricing.

British Airways is set to disrupt the airline industry with its £2.6 billion investment in sustainable aviation fuel, enabling it to offer significantly lower fares than its competitors in the UK, Switzerland, and Norway. This strategic move positions the airline to lead in both affordability and sustainability.

As the demand for greener aviation practices continues to grow, British Airways is setting an example for how airlines can reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing quality or affordability. By making bold moves in sustainable fuel adoption, the airline is not only contributing to the fight against climate change but also positioning itself as a leader in the future of air travel.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/British-Airways-3-1-850x567-1-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 04:56:11.641061

First Batch at Hong Kong International Airport

The first batch of SAF to leave Hong Kong International Airport was produced by Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) and was uplifted in April of this year. Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company is a key producer of SAF in Asia and is at the forefront of independently manufacturing bio-jet fuel technology.

The initial batch from Hong Kong International Airport was produced from used cooking oil through a process known as HEFA (meaning using hydrotreated esters and fatty acids), and was also recognised by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) as being able to decrease the lifecycle carbon emissions by around 80%, compared to the standard conventional jet fuel.

Last year, two batches were uplifted by Cathay Pacific at Amsterdam Airport Schipol and London Heathrow Airport.

What is SAF?

SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) is a sustainable substitute fuel made from waste materials and other renewable carbon sources. Cathay Pacific has shown that SAF can hugely decrease carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels, therefore helping to address the environmental impact that the aviation industry currently has. The cooperation between Cathay Pacific and Sinopec shows the capacity for further collaboration between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability, Grace Cheung, said:

“Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.”

Future Prospects

SAF production and adoption has increased across Asia in recent years, Cathay Pacific is working with different partners to expand the use of SAF across the continent. In March of this year, the airline reached an agreement with a fuel supplier SK Energy, who will supply SAF to Cathay Pacific for 2 years, from 2025 to 2027, in South Korea. Simultaneously, the airline will continue to make use of their experience and knowledge to support Hong Kong scale up its usage with a supportive police to help strengthen Hong Kong International Airport’s status as a leading aviation hub.

This is not Cathay Pacific’s first step towards sustainability as they revealed their 2024 sustainability achievements earlier this year, with a 15% increase in fuel efficiently, and a 20% reduction of onboard waste.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duc-Van-Photo-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 22:56:14.722291

Introduction: The Challenge of Air Freight Emissions

As global trade continues to expand, the logistics industry faces a significant challenge: reducing the environmental impact of air freight. Air transportation, while crucial for rapid global delivery, is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. On average, fossil-fueled air freight produces 50 to 150 times more CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per ton-kilometer than ocean freight and 5 to 6 times more than land freight. With aircraft fuel demand expected to double by 2050, it’s clear that we need innovative solutions to address this growing environmental concern.

At FreightAmigo, we recognize the urgent need for sustainable logistics practices. As a digital supply chain finance platform, we’re committed to helping organizations, enterprises, and individuals transform their logistics experiences while prioritizing environmental responsibility. In this article, we’ll explore how Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is revolutionizing the air freight industry and how FreightAmigo is supporting this crucial transition.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a game-changing alternative to conventional jet fuel. It’s derived from sustainable sources such as waste fats, oils, greases, agricultural and forestry residues, and even innovative processes that capture carbon directly from the air. The key advantage of SAF is its ability to significantly reduce lifecycle carbon emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels.

Here are some crucial facts about SAF:

SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by 70-95% compared to conventional jet fuel.

It can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in current aircraft engines without modifications.

SAF creates a closed carbon cycle, as the CO2 absorbed by the plants used to produce it is roughly equivalent to the CO2e emitted when the fuel is burned.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that SAF will be the most widely-used method for decarbonization in the aviation industry by 2050.

The Environmental Impact of SAF

The adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents a significant step towards reducing the carbon footprint of the logistics industry. By choosing to ship goods with SAF, companies can effectively lower their Scope 3 emissions, which refer to indirect greenhouse gas emissions occurring throughout a company’s value chain.

To understand the impact, it’s essential to consider the different scopes of emissions:

Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions from an organization’s own operations (e.g., fuel combustion in company-owned vehicles)

Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions related to purchased electricity, heating, or cooling

Scope 3 emissions: All other indirect emissions in a company’s value chain, both upstream and downstream

For logistics companies, air transportation emissions typically fall under Scope 3. By utilizing SAF, we can help our clients significantly reduce these indirect emissions, contributing to their overall sustainability goals.

Wizz Air made headlines recently by signing a major deal to purchase sustainable aviation fuel derived from treated human poop. The optics are amusing, but the implications are profound. This isn’t a fringe experiment or a corporate PR stunt. It’s a signal that the aviation industry is moving toward a serious decarbonization strategy grounded in real chemistry, real feedstocks, and real-world constraints. The decision to bet on SAF from municipal waste not only speaks volumes about what airlines think is possible, it also helps dismantle five of the most persistent misconceptions still infecting energy and climate discourse.

The first incorrect assumption is the idea that we are going to need vastly more liquid fuels than we do today. This belief underpins a surprising number of energy transition scenarios, especially those that downplay electrification or assume a strongly increasing demand curve for jet fuel, diesel, and bunker fuel decades into the future. But the numbers don’t support it. Global oil demand for transport is peaking or has already peaked, and all signs point to a rapid contraction over the next 25 years.

In my own modeling, published over the past several years, I’ve projected a scenario where 100% of ground transportation is electrified—cars, buses, trucks, rail, two- and three-wheelers. In that world, the demand for liquid fuels drops by over 80%, and what’s left is concentrated in the hard-to-electrify sectors: long-haul aviation and deep-sea shipping. Aviation fuel demand does grow modestly through 2050 under my model, which is more pessimistic and I think realistic about growth, but hybrid electric regional turboprops take over shorter hops of up to 1,000 km as battery energy densities climb. My projection is for only 110 million tons of liquid fuels required for aviation.

Maritime shipping fuel demand, meanwhile, shrinks dramatically as bulk fossil fuel and iron ore shipments decline. Oil, coal, and LNG shipping collectively represent about 40% of tonnage today, raw iron ore is another 15%, and all four are in structural decline. By the end of the century, I project annual liquid fuel demand for marine shipping is likely to be in the 70 million tons of diesel equivalent range globally. That’s less than a third of today’s shipping fuel volume, and with reductions in aviation fuel demand due to electrification, high-speed rail and other factors, we’re looking at a future where the total global need for liquid fuels might be one-tenth of what it is today.

The second misconception that refuses to die is the notion that biofuels can only come from prime agricultural land. This fear traces back to first-generation biofuels—corn ethanol, soy biodiesel, palm oil—where concerns, some legitimate if overstated, about land use, food prices, and deforestation emerged. But that legacy doesn’t reflect the reality of advanced biofuel production today. The Wizz Air deal is a perfect example. Biosolids—essentially the residual organic matter left over from wastewater treatment—are abundant, underutilized, and pose a methane emissions risk if unmanaged. Converting them to SAF doesn’t displace food crops or use new land. Instead, it turns a municipal waste liability into a high-value, low-carbon product.

And biosolids are just one category. In my comprehensive assessment of viable biofuel pathways, I catalogued at least ten scalable options that rely entirely on waste and non-food biomass: municipal solid waste, forestry residues, agricultural byproducts like corn stover and wheat straw, animal manure, and even landfill gas. The global supply of these materials is vast. The world wastes approximately 2.5 billion tons of food annually. Europe alone generates over 1.5 billion tons of livestock manure per year. At a conservative yield of 0.4 tons of fuel per ton of dried biomass, the waste streams we’re currently mismanaging could supply well over 500 million tons of low-carbon fuel annually. That’s more than enough to meet the residual liquid fuel demand in a maximally electrified transport system. No new farmland required. No tradeoff between food and fuel. Just a redirection of waste into the energy system.

The third false belief is that renewable electricity will become effectively free, enabling a cascade of ultra-cheap electrochemical pathways to dominate. This misconception stems from the marginal cost argument: since wind and solar have no fuel cost, they must eventually drive electricity prices to zero part of the time. It’s true that the marginal cost of generation is low. But the system cost of delivering firm, reliable, high-quality electricity is not. In high-renewables grids like California or South Australia, we do see negative pricing events during solar peaks. But these are short-duration, location-specific artifacts of a misaligned supply-demand curve.

To actually power a process like hydrogen electrolysis or synthetic fuel synthesis economically, you need high-capacity-factor electricity, 60% or more. If you’re relying only on intermittent surplus, your electrolyzers or synthesis reactors are sitting idle most of the time, and your capital costs explode. I’ve run the numbers in multiple regions, and the story is consistent: surplus renewable electricity is not free when you need it at scale, and its temporal distribution makes it unsuitable as the backbone of any major fuel production system. California’s duck curve is not a business model.

This brings us to the fourth fantasy: that green hydrogen will be cheap. It won’t. Hydrogen is a valuable industrial input for very specific contexts—ammonia production, petrochemical refining and perhaps steelmaking. But as a general-purpose energy substitute, it fails the physics and the economics. Electrolyzers are expensive, and their cost per kilogram of hydrogen is highly sensitive to utilization. Hydrogen is expensive to compress, store and distribute.

In transportation, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have a total cost of ownership roughly 2 to 3 times that of battery electric equivalents. I’ve documented multiple real-world cases where hydrogen trucks, buses and other vehicles failed on economics alone, let alone the infrastructure challenges. In energy terms, green hydrogen multiplies the upstream electricity demand by a factor of 3 compared to direct electrification. Every kilowatt-hour routed through an electrolyzer, then compressed, stored, and run through a fuel cell ends up delivering a fraction of the useful energy that a battery does.

That’s playing out now, as every organization that created fantastical projections of cheap green hydrogen adjusts their cost projections to fit the realities that were obvious when they first made them five to ten years ago. BNEF, CSIRO, LUT and more are all finally realizing that their numbers are bogus, but only BNEF has so far had the guts to triple its electrolyzer cost projections for 2050, with the rest only nudging costs up every year since 2020’s projections. Contacts tell me that the IEA gave the task of doing the first projections to an intern, and I find that credible. This wasn’t intentional disinformation, by the way, this was technoeconomic incompetence combined with cognitive biases. It remains indefensible in my eyes, however. Billions of dollars and years of time have been wasted, and more money and time that could be spent on actual climate solutions continue to be thrown at the space.

The reality is that hydrogen is an industrial feedstock that will see significant declines in demand from current levels as 40% of current use is for petroleum refining. Another 30% is used for ammonia, which is also going to see declines as its price increases and agrigenetic nitrogen fixing, precision agriculture, drone spraying and other levers displace its current overuse.

The final myth that needs to be retired is the idea that synthetic fuels—those created from green hydrogen and captured CO₂—will be cheaper than biofuels, perhaps even as cheap as fossil fuels. This one gets a lot of airtime in e-fuel hype circles, particularly in Europe where policy compromises have allowed synthetic fuels to keep internal combustion engines on life support past 2035. But the thermodynamics are unforgiving. Making a synthetic hydrocarbon fuel requires enormous amounts of electricity: to make hydrogen, to capture and purify CO₂, and to run the synthesis process itself. The round-trip efficiency is dreadful—somewhere between 10% and 15% from grid electricity to motion when burned in an engine. That means you’re spending five to seven times more electricity per kilometer than you would with a battery electric vehicle. And that electricity isn’t free, as we’ve established.

Today, synthetic jet fuel costs between $5 and $10 per gallon in pilot quantities. Bio-based SAF, by contrast, is already being produced at commercial scale for $2 to $4 per gallon from used cooking oil, tallow, and now, biosolids. Even as e-fuel technology improves, the gap will persist. Airlines aren’t ideologues, they’ll buy the cheapest low-carbon fuel that meets ASTM specs and avoids reputational risk. Right now, and likely forever, that’s biofuel. Wizz Air knows this. That’s why they’re locking in biosolid-derived SAF, not hydrogen-derived e-kerosene.

Biofuels are always going to be two to three times more expensive than fossil fuels if we let the atmosphere be used as a free sewer, but synthetic fuels will be four to six times as expensive. As a result, no synthetic fuels.

The reality is simpler and more elegant than the myths. We will electrify everything we can—cars, trucks, buses, rail, ferries, short-hop planes—and we will use sustainable biofuels made mostly from waste biomass streams for what we can’t electrify yet. That residual demand is modest, and we have the feedstocks to meet it without touching a single hectare of food-producing land. We will grow a bunch of soy beans and similar things for biofuels simply because we have lots of agricultural land. There’s no shortage or competition for food, as evidenced by us throwing away a full third of the calories we manufacture annually.

These movements have unlocked a 40% discount to market prices.

Governments are now setting mandates for airlines to use a certain percentage of SAF to reduce their carbon emissions. Net-zero targets are highly likely to increase fares over the next couple of years as the price of SAF can be two to seven times more expensive than traditional kerosene.

This higher cost is primarily due to the current technology and feedstock costs. The EU SAF blending quota starts at 2% from 2025, 6% from 2030, 20% from 2035 and 70% from 2050.

While SAF's price is expected to decrease as production scales and supply increases, it remains a significant challenge for airlines, many of whom are already rolling out additional costs.

As global trade continues to expand, the air freight industry faces a significant challenge: reducing its environmental impact. Recent data shows that fossil-fueled air freight produces 50 to 150 times more CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per ton-kilometer than ocean freight and 5 to 6 times more than land freight. With aircraft fuel demand expected to double by 2050, it’s clear that we need innovative solutions to address this growing concern.

At FreightAmigo, we recognize the urgency of this issue and are committed to leading the charge towards sustainable logistics. In this article, we’ll explore how Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is emerging as a game-changing solution for reducing air freight emissions and how our Digital Logistics Platform is supporting businesses in their journey towards greener supply chains.

Understanding Scope 3 Emissions in Air Freight

Before diving into the solutions, it’s crucial to understand the concept of Scope 3 emissions in the context of air freight:

Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (e.g., fuel combustion in company-owned aircraft)

Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy

Scope 3 emissions: All other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain

For most businesses using air freight services, the emissions associated with their shipments fall under Scope 3. These indirect emissions are often the largest source of a company’s carbon footprint and can be challenging to measure and reduce. However, addressing Scope 3 emissions is becoming increasingly important as stakeholders demand greater environmental responsibility from businesses across all industries.

The Promise of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a leading solution for reducing air freight emissions. Here’s why SAF is generating so much excitement in the logistics industry:

What is SAF?

SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional jet fuel but with a significantly lower carbon footprint. SAF can be produced from a variety of sustainable sources, including:

Waste fats, oils, and greases

Agricultural and forestry residues

Municipal solid waste

Carbon captured directly from the air

The Environmental Impact of SAF

The potential environmental benefits of SAF are substantial:

Lifecycle carbon emissions reduction of 70-95% compared to traditional fossil fuels

Creates a closed carbon cycle, as the CO2 absorbed by plants during growth is roughly equivalent to the CO2e emitted when the fuel is burned

Can be used as a drop-in solution, requiring no modifications to existing aircraft engines

The Role of SAF in Decarbonization

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF is expected to be the most widely-used method for decarbonization in the aviation industry by 2050. This underscores the importance of investing in and developing SAF technologies to achieve long-term sustainability goals in air freight.

FreightAmigo’s Commitment to Sustainable Logistics

As a Digital Logistics Platform committed to transforming the logistics industry, FreightAmigo is at the forefront of integrating sustainable solutions like SAF into our service offerings. Here’s how we’re supporting our clients in their sustainability journey:

1. Comprehensive Carbon Footprint Analysis

Our Digital Logistics Platform provides detailed insights into the carbon footprint of each shipment, allowing businesses to make informed decisions about their freight options. By clearly displaying the CO2e emissions associated with different transport modes, we empower our clients to choose the most environmentally friendly option for their needs.

2. SAF Integration

We’re working with airlines and fuel suppliers to integrate SAF options into our platform, making it easy for clients to opt for more sustainable air freight solutions. This includes:

Providing transparent information on SAF availability and pricing

Offering flexible options for incorporating SAF into shipments, such as carbon offset programs or direct SAF purchases

Facilitating the necessary documentation and certifications for SAF usage

3. Environmental Attribute System

Similar to the concept introduced by other logistics providers, FreightAmigo is developing an Environmental Attribute System to simplify the use of SAF for our clients. This system will allow businesses to purchase SAF credits or attributes, ensuring that an equivalent amount of SAF is used in the aviation fuel supply chain, even if it’s not directly used for their specific shipment.

4. Customizable Sustainability Programs

We understand that every business has unique sustainability goals and requirements. That’s why we’re developing customizable programs that allow clients to choose their preferred level of SAF usage or CO2e reduction for their shipments. These programs will be flexible enough to accommodate various budgets and sustainability targets.

5. Comprehensive Reporting and Analytics

Our Digital Logistics Platform provides detailed reports on SAF usage and emissions reductions, helping businesses track their progress towards sustainability goals and comply with reporting requirements. These analytics can be invaluable for companies looking to improve their environmental performance and communicate their efforts to stakeholders.

The Future of Sustainable Air Freight

While SAF represents a significant step forward in reducing air freight emissions, it’s just one part of a broader sustainability strategy. As we look to the future, several trends and developments are shaping the landscape of sustainable air freight:

1. Increased SAF Production and Availability

As demand for SAF grows, we can expect to see increased investment in production facilities and technologies. This will likely lead to greater availability and potentially lower costs for SAF in the coming years.

2. Advancements in Aircraft Technology

Alongside SAF development, aircraft manufacturers are working on more fuel-efficient designs and exploring alternative propulsion systems, such as electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft for short-haul flights.

3. Optimization of Air Freight Operations

Digital Logistics Platforms like FreightAmigo are enabling more efficient routing, load consolidation, and capacity utilization, further reducing the overall environmental impact of air freight.

4. Regulatory Support and Incentives

Governments and international organizations are likely to introduce more regulations and incentives to promote the use of SAF and other sustainable aviation practices.

5. Collaboration Across the Supply Chain

Achieving significant emissions reductions in air freight will require collaboration between shippers, freight forwarders, airlines, and fuel producers. Platforms that facilitate this collaboration will play a crucial role in driving industry-wide sustainability efforts.",https://www.freightamigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/new-icon-1.png,N,,2025-05-31 19:56:26.458231

‘Dat is aan hen, wij kunnen ons daar niet mee bemoeien.’ Elf procent Voor de Embraer ERJ-familie met de EMB-135 en de EMB-140 koos de vliegtuigbouwer in de vroege jaren ’90 voor Rolls-Royce-motoren.
Daarbij komt nog dat de poten van de stoelen aan de raamkant zich deels op de binnenzijkant van het vliegtuig bevinden in plaats van op de vloer.
‘De ene piloot heeft meer voorkeur voor de sidestick, de andere voor de yoke’, zegt Arjan.
Tussen onze verschillende engineering teams, die over de platformen van de vier business units heen werken, wordt voortdurend kennis met elkaar ontwikkeld, uitgewisseld en geïmplementeerd.’ Ter illustratie noemt hij het fly-by-wire-systeem: ‘De eerste generatie zat op de E-jets, de tweede op de Executive, de derde op de KC-390 en de vierde op de E2.’ Opnieuw vestigt Arjan de aandacht op de E-jet E2-familie.","Na een carrière bij KLM en twee van haar dochters kwam Arjan Meijer in dienst bij Embraer. Bij de blauwe maatschappij was hij betrokken bij zowel de inkoop als de uitfasering van een aantal karakteristieke vliegtuigtypes. Uiteraard weet hij ook het nodige te vertellen in relatie met de Braziliaanse vliegtuigbouwer die zowel verkeersvliegtuigen, militaire toestellen als zakenjets op de markt brengt.

Het was op een Tweede Paasdag dat hij samen met zijn ouders in een Cessna 172 voor de eerste keer het luchtruim koos voor een rondvlucht vanaf Eelde boven Groningen. ‘Vanaf dat moment, twaalf jaar was ik, ben ik de luchtvaart in de gaten gaan houden’, vertelt Arjan. Zijn ouders hoopten dat hij de bakkerij zou overnemen, maar het liep anders. Arjan ging naar Delft voor de studie lucht- en ruimtevaarttechniek aan de Technische Universiteit. ‘In eerste instantie wilde ik piloot worden. Uiteindelijk raakte ik toch meer geïnteresseerd in de operaties van airlines en het beheer van vliegtuigen dan in het daadwerkelijke besturen van een vliegtuig.’

747’s en 737’s

‘Tijdens een van mijn laatste studiejaren kwam ik in aanraking met iemand die werkzaam was bij KLM’, zegt hij. ‘Via dat contact kwam ik daar aan een stageplek op de vlootinkoopafdeling. Dat was in eind jaren negentig toen de Boeing 747-400 en de 737-800 en -900 werden ingekocht. Op het moment van mijn afstuderen in juli 1999 was er bij KLM een aannamestop. Toen heb ik bij KPN een managementtraining gedaan. Ik zat alweer enige tijd bij KPN Satcom in de satellietcommunicatie toen ik door KLM werd benaderd: er kwam een functie vrij op de afdeling waar ik stage had gelopen. Op 1 september 2001 ging ik van start, tien dagen voordat de wereld op Nine Eleven volledig veranderde. Ik sloot niet uit dat dit een vroegtijdig einde van mijn KLM-loopbaan zou inhouden, ik zat immers nog in mijn proeftijd. Maar nee, er volgde een heel interessante tijd waarin KLM overging tot de vervanging van zowel de 767 als de laatste 747-300’s door de A330 en de 777. De beslissing dat het doek voor de MD-11 ging vallen werd eveneens genomen. De laatste 747-400 en vier 747-400F’s werden in diezelfde periode aan de vloot toegevoegd. Volop werk aan de winkel dus.’

Fokker

Ruim acht jaar later ging Arjan bij KLM Cityhopper aan de slag. ‘Dat was de tijd van de uitfasering van de Fokker 100’, vervolgt hij. ‘Bij de ontmanteling van de meeste was ik betrokken. Een aantal zijn bij Fokker uit elkaar gehaald, een aantal ook bij KLM Cityhopper zelf. Een drietal ontkwam aan dit lot. Op Schiphol is de PH-OFE op het Panoramaterras van Schiphol alweer veertien jaar een blikvanger. Een andere is neergezet bij het Aviodome in Lelystad en ook daar nog altijd te zien. Ik was erbij toen de PH-OFA daar de wielen op de grond zette en zijn laatste vlucht tot een goed einde bracht. Een derde exemplaar, de PH-OFF, is naar de Aircraft Maintenance & Training School gegaan om aan te sleutelen.’

Embraers in de plaats

In 2014 maakte Arjan een overstap naar Engeland als directeur van KLM UK Engineering, een onderhoudsbedrijf in Norwich Norfolk. ‘Toen ik er begon vond er behalve aan 737’s en A320’s ook nog groot onderhoud plaats aan Fokker 70’s en BAe 146’s. Later kwamen voor die laatste twee vliegtuigtypes de Embraers in beeld.’ In 2016 keerde hij terug naar Nederland, niet alleen om er te wonen, maar ook omdat hij op uitnodiging een nieuw dienstverband aanging, nu met Embraer. Op het kantoor in Amsterdam begon hij als hoofd Europa, Midden-Oosten, Afrika, Centraal Azië en Rusland. Vervolgens werd hij hoofd verkoop van commerciële vliegtuigen voor Embraer wereldwijd. In juni 2020 kon hij aan de slag President & CEO van Commercial Aviation en dat is hij nu nog steeds.

Dat is aan hen

‘Embraer werkt met vier business units met allemaal hun eigen winst- en verliesrekening: Commercial Aviation, Defensie & Security, Executive (zakenjets; LK) en Service & Support’, legt Arjan uit. ‘Die laatste ondersteunt de klanten van de andere drie takken van sport op dagelijkse basis. Binnen mijn verantwoordelijkheid voor commerciële luchtvaart werk ik met alle klanten wereldwijd die met onze Embraer-verkeersvliegtuigen vliegen of dat gaan doen. Dat betekent dat we die machines bouwen en afleveren, de marketing en verkoop doen, en de strategie voor de business unit uitzetten.’ Arjan schudt zijn hoofd als de vraag komt over zaken doen met Rusland en Wit-Rusland. ‘Embrear houdt zich aan alle internationale sancties, dus wij hebben op dit moment geen enkele interactie met die landen. We leveren geen vliegtuigen, geen onderdelen en geen enkele service. In Rusland vliegt wel een aantal Embraers rond, maar wij kunnen daar niets aan supporten. Hoe ze dat onderling regelen?’ Arjan trekt zijn schouders op. ‘Dat is aan hen, wij kunnen ons daar niet mee bemoeien.’

Elf procent

Voor de Embraer ERJ-familie met de EMB-135 en de EMB-140 koos de vliegtuigbouwer in de vroege jaren ’90 voor Rolls-Royce-motoren. De daaropvolgende E-jets, de E170, E175, E190 en E195 werden twintig jaar geleden voorzien van General Electric-motoren. Onder de E-jet E2—jet-familie kwamen uiteindelijk motoren van Pratt & Whitney te hangen. Arjan: ‘Na met alle motorproducenten te hebben onderhandeld koos Embraer destijds voor de P&W GTF, Geared Turbo Fan. Voor de oplages die wij maken is het heel duur om daarop twee motortypes te certificeren, vandaar de keuze voor één leverancier. In het nieuwe concept van Pratt & Whitney kan de fan van de motor langzamer draaien en de turbine sneller door middel van een gear. Samen met een grotere afmeting van de fan levert dit motor type zeer veel efficiencyvoordelen. In vergelijking met het voorgaande type levert de motor an sich zestien procent brandstofbesparing op. Maar hij is ook zwaarder. Dus zodra we hem onder de vleugel hangen blijft er elf procent over.’

Een plas water op de grond

Arjan stelt nog altijd ‘heel blij te zijn met die keuze’, ondanks de ‘entry into service-problemen’ als gevolg van zogenaamde powder metal-bevindingen die ertoe hebben geleid dat talloze vliegtuigen langdurig aan de grond zijn komen te staan, een lot dat niet alleen de E-jet E2-familie trof maar ook machines van het type Airbus A220 en A320. ‘Powder metal, voluit powder metallurgy en afgekort PM, is een productieproces om componenten, zoals turbineschijven, van metaalpoeder te maken’, legt Arjan uit. ‘Al die motoren moesten terug naar de motorenshop van Pratt & Whitney. Embraer heeft het geluk dat we met onze E2 later op de markt kwamen dan Airbus met de A220 en A320 en daarnaast dat onze machines aanzienlijk lichter zijn. Dit zorgt ervoor dat we relatief minder last hebben van dit probleem. Bij de E2’s die we de laatste jaren hebben afgeleverd is het probleem al niet meer aan de orde. Je kunt het hele issue wel een beetje vergelijken met een kraan die kapot is: er ligt nog een plas water op de grond, die plas water zijn wij aan het opruimen, maar de kraan is inmiddels al lang gerepareerd.’

Opgeschoond

Niet alleen de motoren bewerkstelligen dat de nieuwe E2-serie veel efficiënter presteert dan de vorige. ‘We hebben het hele vliegtuig van voor tot achter vernieuwd en opgeschoond’, zegt Arjan. ‘Niet alleen de staart is compleet nieuw ontwikkeld, ook de vleugels zijn nieuw en volledig geoptimaliseerd. Op diverse locaties zijn in het vliegtuig lichtgewicht materialen geïntroduceerd. Doordat het onderstel nu van deuren is voorzien, is heel veel wrijving weggenomen. Het weerstandprofiel is daardoor veel efficiënter. Dus als een machine van onze nieuwste generatie overvliegt, kan je de wielen niet meer zien zitten zoals van oudsher het geval is bij bijvoorbeeld de oudere E-Jets en de Boeing 737. Het fly-by-wire-systeem heeft eveneens een upgrade ondergaan. Dankzij al die verbeteringen zien we op vliegtuigniveau een brandstofbesparing van bijna twintig procent. Omdat de195-E2 ook langer is dan haar voorganger hebben we bovendien nog wat schaaleffecten in het vliegtuig gekregen. Zo passen er in geval van een maximale configuratie in één klasse 146 in plaats van 124 stoelen in. Ook dat maakt dit toestel efficiënter. Nog een bijkomend voordeel is dat het bereik vergroot is van ongeveer 4.250 naar 5.500 kilometer.’

Wel heel veel uitdagingen

Nu de luchtvaart mega onder vuur ligt als het gaat om uitstoot en lawaai, is ook Embraer drukdoende haar machines steeds meer te verduurzamen in de zin van stiller, zuiniger en schoner. Arjan: ‘Enkele jaren geleden kondigden we Energia aan met een aantal vliegtuigconcepten, dus nog geen prototypes maar concepten op papier, waarbij we kijken hoe bepaalde technologieën toepasbaar kunnen zijn in de toekomst. Bij Embraer zeggen we dat de missie de technologie dicteert. Met andere woorden: afhankelijk van wat je met een vliegtuig wilt doen, zou je toegang kunnen krijgen tot bepaalde technologie. Dat betekent dat we wide-body’s voorlopig echt niet gaan zien op waterstof of elektriciteit. Er gaat zoveel energie in om, dat is veel te complex.

Ook met onze 195-E2 met maximaal 146 stoelen, weliswaar een small narrow-body, maar toch ook nog altijd een groot vliegtuig waarin erg veel energie omgaat, gaat dat niet lukken. Aan het laden van batterijen, de capaciteit van batterijen en het gewicht ervan zitten wel héél veel uitdagingen. Om een beeld te geven: voor een 195-E2 met zijn 5.500 kilometer range heb je zo’n dertig à veertig keer het gewicht van het vliegtuig aan batterijen nodig. Zelfs als je die batterijen twee of drie keer zo klein maakt gaat dat het probleem niet oplossen. Je moet dus naar veel kleinere toestellen kijken om dat werkbaar te maken. Een machine met tien stoelen moet wel kunnen. Embraer’s deelneming EVE Air Mobility bouwt overigens op dit moment een eVTOL, een helikopter die met zo’n vier à vijf personen op batterijen gaat vliegen.’

CO2-neutrale groei

In vliegen op waterstof met een machine met om en nabij de vijftig tot honderd stoelen ziet Arjan op langere termijn nog wel een mogelijkheid. ‘Maar dat brengt technisch een enorme complexiteit met zich mee’, haast hij zich te zeggen. ‘Het omzetten van waterstof met behulp van een fuel cell naar elektrisch geeft immers heel veel hitte. Ook de beschikbaarheid van waterstof en de kosten ervan vormen vooralsnog een enorme barrière. Voor het grotere segment van Embraer, en dat is tot 150 stoelen, zeggen wij dat de eerste stap gewoon bestaat uit het efficiënter maken van vliegtuigen. Wat bijvoorbeeld KLM doet met de aanschaf van de veel brandstofzuinigere E195-E2’s, laat zien dat een vliegtuig met 35 stoelen meer dan de E190 die zij voorheen vlogen, dat je die stoelen erbij krijgt zonder meer brandstof te verbranden. Dat is dus CO2-neutrale groei. Die stap vormt voor ons de eerste prioriteit.’

Een beperkte hoeveelheid

Een andere prioriteit van Embraer is vliegen op Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). De Braziliaanse vliegtuigbouwer streeft ernaar nog voor het einde van het huidige decennium hetzelfde resultaat te bereiken met haar verkeersvliegtuigen, zodat de airlines met volledig recyclebare brandstof kunnen gaan vliegen. ‘Vooralsnog zijn onze vliegtuigen gecertificeerd voor het tanken van maximaal vijftig procent SAF’, licht Arjan toe. De verkrijgbaarheid van SAF is echter nog zeer gering. Hoewel de productie de afgelopen jaren steeg, blijft de wereldwijde beschikbaarheid van SAF nog altijd relatief klein vergeleken met de totale vraag naar vliegtuigbrandstof.

Voor SAF zijn er verschillende productieroutes met verschillende grondstoffen, waaronder frituurvet, reststoffen uit de land- en bosbouw, stedelijk afval en bepaalde gewassen zoals huttentut, algen en moerasgassen. ‘Daar kan je maar een beperkte hoeveelheid mee produceren, zegt Arjan. ‘Aan de andere kant van het spectrum kan je echter ook brandstof maken door groene energie om te zetten in waterstof, en de waterstof vervolgens weer om te zetten in groene brandstof, ook wel eSAF genoemd. Alleen is dat wel een zeer kostbare manier om SAF te maken.’

Bepaald eenvoudig is het dus allemaal niet. In relatie met alle genoemde alternatieven voor de huidige traditionele straalmotoren die uiteindelijk uitstekend zullen kunnen presteren op SAF, kijkt Embraer ook naar hybride vormen. Arjan: ‘Het brandstofgebruik zou bijvoorbeeld verder omlaag gebracht kunnen worden door wat meer gebruik te maken van batterijen. Maar voordat je bij ons segment met waterstof en batterijen aan de slag kunt gaan…’ Hij fronst zijn wenkbrauwen en zegt dan: ‘Met onze projecties kijken we richting laat 2040, wellicht zelfs richting 2050.’

Je kunt heel veel doen

Het gesprek komt terug op E2-serie. Veelvliegers zal het niet ontgaan dat de verkeersvliegtuigen die Embraer levert, in vergelijking met de andere small narrow-body’s van binnen ruimtelijker overkomen. Arjan: ‘Wij zeggen wel: de E2 heeft de ruimte op de juiste plek. De rompen van al onze E-jets bestaan uit een double bubble, dus het is geen cirkelronde of ovale buis, zoals dat bijvoorbeeld het geval is bij de Boeing 737, Airbus A320 of Bombardier CRJ. Ons ontwerp voorkomt dat je bij een raamplaats met je schouder tegen een vliegtuigwand zit. Het betekent ook dat er op de plek waar je benen zitten, relatief veel ruimte is. Daarbij komt nog dat de poten van de stoelen aan de raamkant zich deels op de binnenzijkant van het vliegtuig bevinden in plaats van op de vloer. Dat geeft ook meer ruimte voor extra bagage. Omdat er bij onze twee aan twee-configuratie geen middenstoelen zijn, blijft bovendien het benauwde gevoel uit dat je krijgt als je aan beide kanten iemand naast je hebt zitten.’

‘Ook de introductie van de SlimSeat, een lichtere en dunnere stoel, brengt extra comfort. Deze stoel geeft de passagier ongeveer 1.5 inch extra beenruimte. Verder hebben onze E-jets grote ramen, veertig procent groter dan van de Airbus A320. Dat geeft veel meer licht. En dankzij het ontwerp van de side panels lijken de ramen nog groter dan dat ze feitelijk zijn. Uiteraard zijn nu ook de bagagebakken vergroot, zodat een rolkoffer er gedraaid, wheels first, in kan en je er daardoor veel meer kunt bergen. Je kunt echt heel veel doen in zo’n vliegtuig, niet alleen door te spelen met ruimtes maar ook met optische illusies.’

Yoke en sidestick

De yoke, die overigens met de bull-vormgeving aan de yoke van de Concorde herinnert, is wel behouden. ‘De ene piloot heeft meer voorkeur voor de sidestick, de andere voor de yoke’, zegt Arjan. ‘Het feit dat we nog steeds een yoke hebben op de E2 heeft alles te maken met de pilot commonality die we wilden houden tussen de oude en nieuwe generatie E-Jets. Daardoor kunnen luchtvaartmaatschappijen als KLM, Helvetic en Azul, die als E1-operator de E2 in hun vloot hebben verwelkomd, beide machines door elkaar vliegen op dagelijkse basis. Dat scheelt niet alleen geld qua planningsefficiency en uitvoerbaarheid, maar ook qua impact op vertragingen en daarmee dus op de klant. Maar wij leveren inmiddels ook vliegtuigen met sidesticks, waaronder de Legacy en de KC-390.’

KC-390 omarmd

Niet alleen op het gebied van verkeersvliegtuigen en zakenjets doet Embraer goede zaken. Hetzelfde geldt voor hun militaire paradepaardje, de KC-390, ontwikkeld voor het transport van militairen en het bijtanken van vliegtuigen in de lucht. ‘Op dit gebied doet Joāo Bosco, mijn collega van de business unit Defensie & Security, de zaken met klanten’, zegt Arjan. ‘In eerste instantie is dit vliegtuig, dat in samenspraak met de Braziliaanse luchtmacht is ontwikkeld, alleen verkocht in Brazilië. Maar we zien nu dat het toestel echt omarmd wordt in de rest van de wereld. In Europa maakt het een opmars maar ook inmiddels in Azië, in Zuid-Korea. In oktober 2023 nam de Portugese luchtmacht, de FAP, als eerste afnemer buiten Brazilië, hun eerste KC-390 Millenium in ontvangst, een NATO-variant. De Nederlandse Luchtmacht, de KLu, heeft er ook vijf in bestelling. Verder hebben we in Europa verkocht aan Oostenrijk, Tsjechië en Hongarije. Door Zweden is het vliegtuig al wel geselecteerd maar er is nog geen contract afgesloten.’

Vrachtversies

In 2022 kondigde Embraer de vrachtversies aan van de E190 en E195. De toestellen moeten een alternatief bieden voor oudere vrachtvliegtuigen in het tien tot vijftien ton cargosegment om daarmee in te spelen op de groeiende vraag naar E-commerce en gedecentraliseerde logistiek. Arjan: ‘We zien dat de E-jets ouder worden en dat het voor vrachtmaatschappijen, met name als ze minder uren draaien met vliegtuigen, zinniger is met een gebruikt vliegtuig te opereren dan met een nieuw. Omdat van de E190 meer exemplaren gebouwd zijn dan van de E195, is allereerst gestart met het ontwikkelen van een conversie op de E190.’

‘Het eerste toestel waarin zowel een gat is gemaakt als een cargosysteem is aangebracht, is nu gecertificeerd. Terwijl het tweede op dit moment wordt omgebouwd, zijn we met klanten actief bezig om deze variant ook in de markt te zetten. Dit nieuwe concept heeft voor onszelf als voordeel dat onze vliegtuigen langer gaan doorvliegen en dus ook langer omzet genereren voor onze service en support. Ook voor de airlines met een cargotak kan dit attractief zijn omdat deze configuratie de mogelijkheid biedt met een machine in de eigen operatie langer door te vliegen. De E195F hebben we echter voorlopig gepauzeerd. Gezien de veel grotere feed-stock van de E190, er zijn er immers veel meer van gebouwd, en de grote recente vraag naar gebruikte E195’s, hebben we besloten vooralsnog te focussen op de vrachtversie van de E190.’

Behoorlijk timmeren

In 2018 ging het nieuws de wereld over dat Boeing Embraer gedeeltelijk zou overnemen. ‘Die overname is in 2019 door de Braziliaanse overheid geblokkeerd omdat ze niet wilden dat hun defensie in handen kwam van een ander land’, vertelt Arjan. ‘Boeing stond toen op het standpunt enkel nog onze business unit Commercial Aviation te kopen. Maar in 2020 besloot Boeing de deal af te blazen. Inmiddels zijn we weer vijf jaar verder, is de Commercial Aviation helemaal geïntegreerd en zijn we heel blij met waar we nu staan. We hebben een heel sterke portfolio, Defensie en Executive draaien nu ook uitzonderlijk goed en vorig jaar had Embraer de hoogste revenu’s in haar hele loopbaan van 55 jaar. Voor de markt is dit niet onopgemerkt gebleven want als je naar de aandelenkoers kijkt zie je dat die van ongeveer vier dollar in 2020 gegroeid is naar meer dan vijftig dollar. We timmeren behoorlijk aan de weg.’

Vloot verbreed

Met gepaste trots stelt Arjan: ‘Sinds 2000 heeft Embraer meer dan twintig volledig nieuwe modellen in de markt gezet, dat is ongeveer elk jaar één. Tussen onze verschillende engineering teams, die over de platformen van de vier business units heen werken, wordt voortdurend kennis met elkaar ontwikkeld, uitgewisseld en geïmplementeerd.’ Ter illustratie noemt hij het fly-by-wire-systeem: ‘De eerste generatie zat op de E-jets, de tweede op de Executive, de derde op de KC-390 en de vierde op de E2.’ Opnieuw vestigt Arjan de aandacht op de E-jet E2-familie. ‘De kleinste 737 MAX 7 vertoont evenals de A220-familie wel enige overlap met onze E-jet E2-familie. Logisch dus dat wij die machines tegenkomen in onze discussies met klanten. Maar inmiddels blijkt wel dat niet alleen wij, maar ook steeds meer airlines, de E2 als small narrow-body duidelijk zien als een vliegtuig dat echt iets toevoegt aan de grotere narrow body’s en dat de vloot er dus uitstekend mee kan worden verbreed.’ Dat Arjan het reuze naar zijn zin heeft bij Embraer behoeft verder geen betoog.",https://i0.wp.com/www.upinthesky.nl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Arjan-Meijer-Executive-Photo-scaled.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 15:56:47.505995

As demonstrated by this batch, SAF has the potential to significantly lower its lifecycle carbon emissions as compared with fossil fuels, helping address the environmental impact of passenger and cargo air transport. This agreement with Sinopec demonstrates the potential for further cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the SAF supply chain.

In recent years, the production and adoption of SAF has gained momentum across Asia. Cathay Pacific is working closely with different partners with the aim to expand the use of SAF in Asia. In March 2025, Cathay Pacific reached an agreement with fuel supplier SK Energy, which will supply SAF to Cathay Pacific from 2025 to 2027 in South Korea. At the same time, Cathay Pacific will continue to draw on its own experience to support Hong Kong to scale up SAF usage with supportive policy, in order to further strengthen Hong Kong International Airport’s status as a leading international aviation hub.",https://aeronewsglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/favicon.png,N,,2025-05-31 09:57:03.737570

SAF can cost anywhere between two and seven times the price of standard jet fuel.
It is claimed to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional jet fuel.","Executives from parent company IAG last week held a low-key summit with investors where it was revealed that the group is currently paying less than 60 per cent of the market rate for SAF. This followed IAG’s high-stakes decision to enter into a glut of “take or pay” long-term contracts with suppliers that are up to 14 years in length.

For new green fuel suppliers, this provides a degree of certainty over their profits. This is because if IAG decides not to “take” the fuel, it would be obliged to “pay” a certain amount instead. For the suppliers, this certainty allows them to unlock financing to scale up projects.

• BA cancels private jet flights perk after greenwashing criticism

The benefit for early adopters such as IAG, meanwhile, is that they can lock in SAF prices at a hefty discount to market rate.

IAG sustainability head Jonathon Counsell said that investing in SAF early would give the group a “competitive advantage” over its rivals. It has committed $3.5 billion to its SAF programme over more than a decade.

SAF can cost anywhere between two and seven times the price of standard jet fuel. It is made in a range of ways: from extracting bioethanol from waste materials, to combining carbon dioxide with green hydrogen. It is claimed to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional jet fuel.

In the UK, rules state that 2 per cent of jet fuel must be SAF this year, rising to 10 per cent by 2030, and 22 per cent by 2040. The EU mandate works differently, but similarly stipulates a 2 per cent quota this year, rising to 6 per cent in 2030 and 34 per cent by 2040.

• Eco-friendly flights? That’s fuel for thought

Few industry watchers believe IAG’s strategy will reduce fares in the medium to long term; but the hope is that some of the savings of discounted contracts can be passed on to customers.

Like most other airlines, fuel is IAG’s biggest single expense, costing the group €7.6 billion last year. Employee costs, the second largest expense, were €6.4 billion.

IAG executives said that increases in the SAF mandate each year would also benefit the FTSE 100 group by making it hard for new airlines to start up, analysts said. This will lead to merger and acquisition opportunities, they added.

“[IAG] thinks that near-term consolidation opportunities are limited, however,” RBC said in a note to investors.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fc50d8852-bef4-45ac-8ca7-687eee96fc3c.jpg?crop=3000%2C1687%2C0%2C111&resize=1200,N,,2025-05-31 08:56:09.493929

Dakota Spirit AgEnergy produces clean-burning ethanol from corn in addition to distillers grains and corn oil, according to Harvestone Low Carbon Partners, which owns Dakota Spirit.
The corn oil produced at Dakota Spirit is used as a feedstock for renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel.
Corry Shevlin, CEO of Jamestown/Stutsman Development Corp., said Dakota Spirit AgEnergy is a “terrific” tenant partner of the SEPA industrial Park and JSDC.
Dakota Spirit AgEnergy was the first tenant in the SEPA industrial park.","SPIRITWOOD, N.D. — Dakota Spirit AgEnergy has increased its yields for corn oil and ethanol in the past 10 years, according to Jeff Zueger, CEO of Harvestone Low Carbon Partners.

“With a culture of continuous improvement, the team comes in every single day and looks for opportunities to increase efficiency,” Zueger said.

Dakota Spirit AgEnergy produces clean-burning ethanol from corn in addition to distillers grains and corn oil, according to Harvestone Low Carbon Partners, which owns Dakota Spirit.

Zueger said the rate that Dakota Spirit AgEnergy converts corn into ethanol has increased to an average of over 3 gallons per bushel in 2024. Ethanol production has increased by over 20%, rising from 68 million gallons in 2016 to more than 83 million gallons in 2024.

“That's been one of our objectives is to consistently hit above 3 gallons per bushel of ethanol and then incrementally continue to grow corn oil yield at the site because those are a couple of the higher value products,” he said.

Zueger said the corn oil yield has increased to above 1 pound per bushel.

“The corn oil, for example, started off at less than a half a pound per bushel, and today we're getting over a pound per bushel, so pretty significant change in corn oil production at the site, and that's been a continued focus of the team,” he said.

The corn oil produced at Dakota Spirit is used as a feedstock for renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel.

Dakota Spirit has been online for 10 years at the Spiritwood Energy Park Association’s industrial park at Spiritwood. Dakota Spirit received its first delivery of corn from area farmers on May 28, 2015.

“I think it's a tremendous accomplishment for the team out there and also for the community,” Zueger said.

Corry Shevlin, CEO of Jamestown/Stutsman Development Corp., said Dakota Spirit AgEnergy is a “terrific” tenant partner of the SEPA industrial Park and JSDC. Dakota Spirit AgEnergy was the first tenant in the SEPA industrial park.

“They do a pretty incredible job,” he said.

He said Dakota Spirit is a community-based project.

“Spiritwood Energy Park is a development effort in cooperation with Jamestown/Stutsman Development Corporation and originally Great River Energy, and now we're partners in SEPA alongside JSDC so without that community component, this project may not have happened,” Zueger said. “The whole energy park concept was important to getting the project developed and built.”

Since Dakota Spirit AgEnergy came online in 2015, it has produced over 694 million gallons of denatured ethanol and nearly 24 million gallons of corn oil, the company said. The denatured ethanol contributes to U.S. energy independence, and corn oil is a valuable co-product used for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, the company said.

Dakota Spirit AgEnergy has processed more than 235 million bushels of locally-grown corn and purchases an average of 23 million bushels of corn annually, the company said. Corn usage has expanded by 21%, growing from 24 million bushels in 2016 to 28 million bushels in 2024.

“I think that's really important to the region and to farmers by improving corn basis, having a consistent day-in, day-out market as opposed to trying to export the product to other markets outside of North Dakota or significantly transporting it elsewhere,” Zueger said. “I think anytime you can locate a processing facility like Dakota Spirit that will consume 28 million bushels of corn a year, that is obviously very positive for farming in the area, positive for corn growers and positively supports just kind of the overall ag commodity platform because of those acres being committed to growing the crop. That's a feedstock for our production process.”

Dakota Spirit also produces feed products. Zueger said local cattle and dairy farmers purchase feed from Dakota Spirit AgEnergy.

Dakota Spirit supports feeding approximately 180,000 cattle per year through byproduct utilization.

“We believe that feed is high quality and that they get a very good value in that purchase and that transaction,” Zueger said.

He said about 80% of Dakota Spirit AgEnergy’s feed product is exported primarily by rail to mostly the western U.S.

“Those dollars keep turning in the community,” Zueger said, referring to value-added ag processing products. “Then at that point, you continue to build the economy, the regional and local economy.”

Shevlin said it is good when a company can add value to agricultural products in the state, Jamestown and Stutsman County.

“Their impact on our economy is pretty tremendous,” he said.

Zueger said Dakota Spirit is focusing on advancing carbon capture and storage at its site. Using energy coming from Spiritwood Station allows Dakota Spirit to use a lower carbon intensity for the fuel it produces.

“As we advance carbon capture and storage at the site, it will further lower the carbon intensity of the fuel that we produce, thereby enabling it to hit low carbon fuel markets throughout North America and throughout the world and also be attractive for sustainable aviation fuel production,” he said. “When we lower the carbon intensity to near-zero carbon intensity, it becomes a very attractive product to either incent a sustainable aviation fuel project in the region that would further refine that into staff or allow us to serve markets that are higher value to ensure long-term sustainability for our facility.”

Zueger said Dakota Spirit’s plan is to capture biogenic carbon dioxide released from its production process and permanently sequester and store it. He said that plan further removes carbon dioxide from the climate and environment.

Dakota Spirit has about 45 full-time employees, Zueger said.

He said those employees are offered a voluntary time-off program to volunteer at an organization of their choice.

“We think that that's really important in supporting our communities,” Zueger said. “It is saying we're going to pay these folks as if they're at the site, and we're going to encourage them to go and participate in the community.”

He said Dakota Spirit sends information to its employees about opportunities where they can volunteer.

“I think our team has done a tremendous job participating in those kinds of events that help support community needs,” he said.

Zueger also said Dakota Spirit AgEnergy supports requests for donations when they align with the company’s objectives as well as community growth and promotion of good family and business partnerships.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/44101d4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1112+0+0/resize/1917x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2Ff6%2Fcff605c746bfbeb097f4b5888f7a%2Fdakota-spirit-one-052825.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 08:56:14.228754

In a strongly worded letter seen exclusively by the Yorkshire Post, they argue that government funding for CCS infrastructure, specifically the Viking CCS project, is crucial for the region’s economic future and the UK's energy security.

The letter, co-signed by key figures including council leaders, the Humber Energy Board, the Humber Freeport, the Confederation of British Industry, and the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, paints a picture of a region on the cusp of significant transformation.

In it, they argue £15 billion of private sector investment is ready to be deployed, creating 20,000 jobs for the area and safeguarding one in 10 existing jobs in the area.

According to the signatories, the Humber has the potential to become a world leader in industrial decarbonisation, with huge potential for growth in sectors like AI, advanced manufacturing, and sustainable aviation fuel, if the region receives the necessary government backing for CCS.

Further, it argues the Humber's geographic advantage, with access to over 60 per cent of the UK's licensed carbon storage sites, makes it a key player in the UK's ambition to become a ""clean energy superpower.""

They claim that with CCS, hydrogen, and the expansion of offshore wind, the region could cut emissions by as much as 80 per cent.

Sanctioning the project is the ""first step"" in delivering a sustainable economic future for the region, they say, before stressing the urgency of the situation, warning delays in government decision-making are stalling investment and hindering workforce development.

Richard Gwilliam is the chairman of the Humber Energy Board, and said: “As the country’s biggest industrial cluster, the Humber can lead the UK in generating economic growth while delivering high value regional infrastructure to support the large-scale decarbonisation.

“Transforming the Humber into a world-leading net zero industrial economy will attract new industries to the region, drawn by the prospect of a skilled workforce, abundant development land, robust infrastructure and high-quality education and training.

“Now is the time for the government to support our plans.

“In doing so, we can strengthen and accelerate their clean energy mission, prevent deindustrialisation, protect jobs and create new opportunities in the Humber.”

EOG Resources’ $5.6 billion acquisition of Encino Acquisition Partners shocked the market after it was announced on May 30, but analysts expect investors to come around once they evaluate the assets and the opportunity.

“We believe investors will warm up to the deal as they assess the scale and benefits EOG can extract over a 1.1 million net-acre position in Ohio,” said Tim Rezvan at KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Investors showed little immediate reaction to the purchase from Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Encino Energy. By early afternoon, EOG’s stock was down about $1 at $108.98 per share.

The deal, expected to close in the second half of this year, is 10% accretive on an annualized basis to EOG’s 2025 earnings and 9% accretive on an annualized basis for both cash flow from operations and free cash flow, Chairman and CEO Ezra Yacob told investors during a conference call following the announcement.

“After closing, we will continue to have the strongest balance sheet in our peer group underscoring our relentless focus on capital discipline,” he said.

CPP and Encino established EAP in 2017 to acquire high quality oil and gas assets with an established base of production in mature basins across the Lower 48.

“We are pleased with EAP’s success and the strong returns this investment has delivered,” said Bill Rogers, head of sustainable energies at CPP.

The investment group is active globally and holds net assets worth some $26.4 billion (CA$36.3 billion).

EOG’s acquisition has industrial logic, Rezvan said, given the price and the contiguous acreage. Likely year-end leverage of 0.3x is manageable.

“There has been marketplace chatter about Encino’s owners seeking an exit strategy for several years, and EOG is one of a few operators to be able to digest a $5.6 billion acquisition,” he said.

Leo Mariani, managing director at Roth Capital Energy Group, estimated EOG paid about $5,000 per undeveloped acre for Encino, assuming a price close to $15,000 per flowing boe for production with more than half of Encino’s acreage undeveloped.

“This is a good value, in our opinion, compared to what others have recently paid for more competitive basins in North America,” he said.

“However, the basin is still in the early days of proving out the competitiveness of the volatile oil window with other premier shale plays.”

Rezvan, an admitted bull on Utica Shale productivity, noted some market reticence about the play. He said more data points should improve the sentiment.

“The combination of attractive pricing, overlapping acreage and a thoughtful marketing portfolio from Encino all validate the acquisition to us. Lastly, EOG’s low cost of capital and ability to use scale to drive down well costs should not be overlooked as tangible synergies,” Rezvan said.

This time last year, KeyBanc produced a deep dive on the Utica, highlighting EOG’s increasing activity there. In June 2024, about 577 wells had been drilled in the play, and KeyBanc said it would be “premature to judge a play, especially with an O.G. shale operator like EOG Resources entering” and stepping up activity.

The analysts leaned in on well data and found promising results.

“Clients have been skeptical that high initial oil cuts in the volatile oil window of the Utica hold up, with some dismissive comments that oil cuts ‘fall off a cliff,’” Rezvan wrote.

“Our work refutes that bear-case thesis. We see decline rates that compare favorably with those from four other oily shale plays, which we believe debunks the bear case on EOG’s ongoing Utica development.”

Loaded for bear

EOG doesn’t crave the spotlight, its leadership doesn’t jump on bandwagons or trends and the company rarely releases flashy headlines. EOG was noticeably absent from the consolidation frenzy of late 2023 and throughout 2024. Rather, the company has steadily built its diverse footprint, making bolt-on deals for congruent acreage that, in recent years, have positioned them to make a strong case for organic growth.

“Our ability to execute on the Encino acquisition without diluting our shareholders is a textbook example of how EOG utilizes its industry-leading balance sheet to take advantage of countercyclical opportunities to enhance the returns of our business and create long-term value for our shareholders,” Yacob said.

EOG’s last big foray into M&A was in 2016 when the firm bought Yates Petroleum, which more than doubled its presence in the Permian Basin and expanded its Powder River Basin acreage. The $2.5 billion cash-and-stock transaction increased EOG’s Delaware position by 78% to 424,000 net acres, including 86,000 net acres of stacked pay in New Mexico with prospects in the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Leonard shale formations.

EOG stood out for its silence in 2024 when many public independents—including Diamondback Energy, Coterra Energy and Devon Energy—acquired private producers. By year-end, upstream M&A reached $105 billion, the third highest total tracked by Enverus.

“The transaction answers a long-running question in the industry of if and when EOG would finally commit to a significant acquisition,” said Andrew Dittmar, principal analyst at Enverus Intelligence Research.

Including Occidental Petroleum’s 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, since 2020 EOG’s large-cap peers ConocoPhillips, Diamondback Energy and Oxy have actively consolidated ownership in key U.S. unconventional plays, spending more than $140 billion in the process, he said.

“EOG has stayed firm … in its commitment to organic resource expansion and a focus on its core assets acquired in the early innings of shale,” Dittmar said. “While there is virtue in not pursuing increasingly expensive M&A transactions, it also risked EOG falling behind as undrilled high-quality inventory became increasingly scarce. Successfully executing on large-scale organic resource potential likewise became increasingly challenging as the major plays were discovered and delineated.”

Charles Mead, a Johnson Rice analyst, noted the similarities between the Yates and Encino deals during a conference call following the announcement on May 30. Specifically, both acquisitions targeted a private company in an emerging play.

Yacob confirmed that both transactions are consistent with EOG’s strategy.

“We’ve always talked about the way that we value [deals], whether it’s organic leasing, small bolt-on acquisitions or in this case, a transformative deal,” he said. “We view it through a returns lens, and so oftentimes that makes transactions in established basins a little bit less competitive with our existing portfolio because we’ve built so many things on a low cost-of-entry. Right off the bat, that steers you into potential transactions in emerging assets.”

Moreover, Yacob said, EOG has taken the time to develop relationships and a reputation that supports private negotiating.

“Similar to Yates, the relationship between Encino and EOG has been growing over the last couple of years since we’ve been involved in the basin, [and we] see a lot of similarities and alignments between the two companies.”",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/05/eog-resources.jpg?itok=CQwP6bbr,N,,2025-05-31 09:57:27.633784

The facility announced May 29 will be just south of PIT's terminal and is expected to dramatically enhance access to low-carbon jet fuel for commercial and cargo carriers operating in the region.

While other SAF plants operate elsewhere, PIT's facility situated just south of the terminal will be the first integrated within a major airport's infrastructure.

The facility will use KBR's PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels and globally licensed by KBR, converting renewable alcohol into jet fuel that meets ASTM certification and global sustainability standards.

KBR's PureSAF technology is an alcohol-to-jet process that converts various feedstocks, including bioethanol, syngas and carbon dioxide, into sustainable aviation fuel.

In addition to processing ethanol, this technology can also convert mixed alcohols, carbon dioxide and synthesis gas to SAF, creating pathways for utilizing captured carbon usage.

""This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall,"" Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis said. ""With abundant natural resources, robust energy infrastructure and available fuel storage, PIT is uniquely positioned to meet these goals and serve the growing demands for SAF.""

The process is a low-cost industrial-scale process that produces jet fuel with properties similar to conventional jet fuel, making it fully fungible. This technology is particularly attractive for its ability to utilize a wide range of feedstocks, including waste biomass and biogenic CO2.

Through multiple development phases, the facility is expected to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually, helping to significantly reduce the aviation sector's carbon footprint.

Much lower carbon intensity

The SAF produced at PIT will have a carbon intensity at least 65% lower than conventional jet fuel, according to project estimates, contributing meaningfully to the industry's decarbonization goals.

""KBR is proud to support the Pittsburgh International Airport team and enable it to be one of the first airports globally to provide SAF to its customers by producing it on-site at the airport,"" Hari Ravindran, KBR's Global SVP for Technology, said. ""PureSAF (alcohol-to-jet) technology is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100% drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel. This project is a real example of how innovation and strong business relationships are delivering tangible benefits to the aviation industry.""

The PIT-Avina initiative aligns with broader efforts across the aviation sector to cut emissions and build resilient fuel infrastructure. As airlines face increasing regulatory and market pressure to decarbonize, projects like this may define the next generation of airport operations and fuel logistics in the US.

Construction is set to begin soon, with phased rollout expected to support regional airline partners and national SAF supply chain expansion.

This landmark gathering arrives after a forty-two year hiatus, signaling a dramatic return of global aviation leadership to one of the world’s fastest-growing air travel markets.

But why now? And why India?

As aviation leaders from across the world prepare to land in New Delhi, anticipation is building. The eighty-first AGM isn’t just another annual meeting—it’s a symbol of India’s rising influence in global air transport.

With major developments underway in infrastructure, sustainability, and connectivity, this event is poised to reshape discussions far beyond the boardroom.

Will this World Air Transport Summit redefine the industry’s next chapter?

Or will this forty-two year wait mark a turning point not just for India, but for the future of aviation itself?

The sky, it seems, is just the beginning.

A Skyward Shift: India Welcomes the World as Global Aviation Leaders Gather for IATA AGM and WATS in New Delhi

After a long 42-year gap, the global aviation industry is once again turning its focus toward India. From June 1–3, 2025, New Delhi will host the 81st IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) and the World Air Transport Summit (WATS)—a seismic moment for both India’s aviation sector and the global travel community.

This isn’t just another conference. It’s a declaration. A statement that India’s aviation industry has arrived—not as a developing player, but as a global force reshaping the skies.

More than 1,700 participants, including airline CEOs, government officials, financial leaders, and media professionals, are expected to descend on the Indian capital. The host airline? IndiGo, India’s aviation juggernaut and the region’s most influential low-cost carrier.

A Historic Return with Global Significance

The last time India hosted an IATA AGM was in 1983. Since then, the landscape has changed dramatically. Today, India is one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world, with record-breaking aircraft orders, cutting-edge airport infrastructure, and booming passenger demand.

This return is far more than symbolic. It’s recognition of India’s meteoric rise as a vital aviation hub—not just for domestic travel, but for international connectivity and innovation.

Hosting the 81st IATA AGM in 2025 affirms India’s position at the center of global aviation dialogue.

All Eyes on India’s Aviation Engine

The timing couldn’t be more perfect. India’s aviation sector is booming on all fronts. The industry directly employs over 369,000 people and contributes $5.6 billion to the nation’s GDP. When including indirect, induced, and tourism effects, that number soars to $53.6 billion, supporting over 7.7 million jobs.

As aviation drives economic development, job creation, and cross-border connectivity, India is clearly becoming one of the most crucial players in shaping the industry’s future.

Meanwhile, IndiGo, serving as the host airline, stands at the forefront of this transformation. With the largest fleet and widest reach in the country, IndiGo symbolizes India’s evolving aviation story—agile, ambitious, and undeniably global.

WATS 2025: Spotlight on Challenges and Solutions

Immediately following the AGM, the World Air Transport Summit (WATS) will open dialogue on the pressing issues facing the aviation world.

This year’s agenda is laser-focused on economic pressures, geopolitical shifts, energy transitions, and net-zero goals. It also tackles rising concerns around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the cost of payments, and the evolving role of Chief Operating Officers in steering operational strategy amid constant turbulence.

One of the most anticipated sessions is the CEO Panel, moderated by CNN’s Richard Quest, featuring high-caliber names like:

Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo

Joanna Geraghty, CEO of JetBlue

Adrian Neuhauser, CEO of Abra Group

Richard Smith, COO International and CEO Airline of FedEx

This powerhouse panel will examine how airline leaders are responding to volatile demand cycles, shifting global regulations, and the never-ending challenge of modernization.

The Big Themes: Growth, Sustainability, Innovation

India’s own aviation expansion will be a central theme. Topics will explore how the country is strategically using aviation to accelerate national development, connect underserved regions, and create inclusive access to global opportunities.

Also under the microscope is the energy transformation sweeping aviation, especially the production and scalability of sustainable aviation fuel. India’s role as both a producer and adopter of SAF will likely influence global supply chains and cost structures moving forward.

Another major highlight is the urgent conversation around financing net-zero aviation. With climate commitments tightening and consumer awareness growing, airlines must now find sustainable business models that align with environmental targets.

Inclusion Takes the Stage

This year’s event also puts a powerful spotlight on diversity and inclusion, with the sixth edition of the IATA Diversity & Inclusion Awards. These honors recognize individuals and organizations making measurable strides in gender balance and equity across aviation.

Through initiatives like 25by2025, IATA and its member airlines are working toward creating a more inclusive, representative industry—from cockpit to boardroom.

This focus on social progress within an industry often seen as traditionally rigid signals a new era for aviation leadership—one rooted in people, purpose, and potential.

Why This Matters Globally

The aviation industry stands at a pivotal crossroads. Mounting costs, evolving traveler expectations, and accelerating environmental demands have forced a reckoning. The IATA AGM and WATS offer a space to regroup, realign, and recommit to innovation and cooperation.

India, as the host, represents what’s possible when an aviation market is given room to thrive. Its success story is one of balancing scale with agility, policy with progress, and ambition with accountability.

By holding this landmark event in New Delhi, the global aviation community will see firsthand how India is becoming a model—not just for growth, but for resilience and reinvention.

A Defining Moment in Aviation History

For three days in June, New Delhi becomes the world’s aviation capital. Every keynote, every panel, every meeting will shape the trajectory of how we fly, where we fly, and why we fly.

Egypt’s Minister of Civil Aviation, Sameh El-Hefny, has described civil aviation as a strategic pillar for strengthening economic and cultural integration across Africa. Speaking during the 10th edition of the AFI Aviation Week 2025 held in Zimbabwe, El-Hefny reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to boosting continental co-operation in air safety, aviation security, infrastructure development, and capacity-building – all within the framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

El-Hefny said the gathering reflected Africa’s shared commitment to advancing its aviation industry and positioning it as a driver of sustainable economic growth.

Alongside pilot Amr El-Sharkawy, head of Egypt’s Civil Aviation Authority, the minister took part in a high-level coordination meeting of African civil aviation directors, held with the participation of the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC). Discussions focused on sector-wide challenges, including enhancing operational efficiency, aligning with ICAO’s strategic goals, and launching new initiatives to boost air safety, improve airport services and modernise air navigation infrastructure.

Delegates also explored feasibility studies and commercial implementation mechanisms for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), seen as a key tool in reducing aviation’s environmental impact.

On the sidelines of the event, El-Hefny participated in the 28th Steering Committee meeting of the AFI Plan (Regional Implementation Plan for Aviation Safety in Africa), as well as the 14th meeting of the AFI SECFAL Plan (Security and Facilitation). Both sessions reviewed regional strategies to enhance safety and security while addressing emerging threats and improving compliance with international standards.

The Egyptian minister welcomed the proposal to merge the regional APIRG (Planning and Implementation Group) and RASG-AFI (Regional Aviation Safety Group for Africa), saying it would foster stronger coordination and improve safety outcomes continent-wide.

Egypt, El-Hefny added, has already taken tangible steps to localise the production of SAF, launching a project aligned with international environmental standards. The country aims to become a regional leader in the production and application of sustainable aviation fuels.

El-Hefny said Egypt’s SAF initiative reflects the country’s broader goal of building a climate-friendly aviation sector and reducing the industry’s carbon footprint.

During the forum, the minister also held a bilateral meeting with Zimbabwe’s Minister of Transport and Infrastructure, Felix Tapiwa Mhona. The pair discussed potential co-operation on technical training, airport development, aviation safety, and knowledge exchange.

El-Hefny stressed that Egypt prioritises regional air connectivity as a vital pillar of development and integration, and is keen to support African nations through strategic training and partnerships.

His Zimbabwean counterpart praised Egypt’s technical expertise and longstanding role in the African aviation sector, saying Zimbabwe is eager to enhance co-operation with Cairo in various aviation-related fields.

AFI Aviation Week – held annually under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and in coordination with the African Civil Aviation Commission — is the largest annual gathering of the civil aviation community in Africa. This year’s edition drew more than 400 participants, including top aviation officials, international organisations and industry experts.

This collaboration underscores the growing influence of SAF from the Chinese Mainland in the global aviation fuel supply chain and promotes green aviation in Asia.

Use of Certified Sustainable Aviation Fuel from Sinopec

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by Sinopec’s Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport. ZRCC, a leader in SAF manufacturing in Asia, converts used cooking oil into bio-jet fuel using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. The batch is certified by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), indicating an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel made from renewable or waste materials that significantly reduces carbon emissions. This initiative with Sinopec strengthens the cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in developing a sustainable SAF supply chain.

Expanding SAF Use in the Region

Cathay Pacific’s General Manager of Sustainability, Grace Cheung, highlighted that the partnership goes beyond fuel supply, aiming to expand SAF production and use regionally. The airline supports increased adoption of SAF to reduce fossil fuel dependency.

Previously, Cathay Pacific uplifted SAF sourced from the Chinese Mainland at airports outside Hong Kong, including Amsterdam and London. This latest project marks the first SAF use on flights departing directly from Hong Kong International Airport.

Regional Collaborations to Boost SAF Supply

The adoption of SAF is gaining traction across Asia. In March 2025, Cathay Pacific signed an agreement with South Korean fuel supplier SK Energy to supply SAF from 2025 to 2027. This collaboration illustrates the airline’s commitment to diversifying its sustainable fuel sources throughout Asia.

Aligning with Climate Goals and Regulations

This SAF initiative supports Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 2050 and the aviation industry’s global carbon reduction targets. The International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) also highlights SAF as key to achieving emission goals.

Environmental Benefits of SAF Adoption

The aviation sector contributes about 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). SAF offers a low-carbon alternative by converting waste products like used cooking oil into fuel, thus supporting circular economy practices and substantially reducing emissions.

Government Support and Policy Framework

Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection Department promotes cleaner fuels under its Cleaner Air Plan. Meanwhile, China’s national policies under the 14th Five-Year Plan encourage biofuel production, positioning Sinopec as a vital player in the green energy transition.

Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation

The Cathay Pacific-Sinopec partnership exemplifies cooperation between industry and government to develop a sustainable SAF supply chain, addressing challenges related to production scaling and certification.

Future Outlook: Scaling Up SAF Usage

Cathay Pacific aims to increase SAF’s share in its fuel mix to meet its 2050 net-zero target. The airline is investing in technology and partnerships to support broader SAF adoption, reinforcing Hong Kong International Airport’s role as an eco-friendly aviation hub.

Commitment to a Sustainable Aviation Future

Cathay Pacific continues to engage stakeholders across the supply chain to accelerate the shift toward sustainable air travel, investing in innovations that enhance SAF availability and operational efficiency.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-app-logo.png,N,,2025-05-31 00:56:10.398771

The tool is designed to help match buyers and sellers more efficiently and improve access to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SAFc Connect is designed to make the SAF buying process quicker and more flexible for procurement professionals and their organisations.

It allows companies to invest in available SAF while offering suppliers access to active corporate demand.

SABA says its members currently have a combined demand of about US$30m for SAF certificates through the platform. That need is predicted to rise as more companies join SABA and increase investments in order to meet their respective 2030 climate targets.

“To meet the decarbonisation goals for the aviation sector, we need to encourage both near and long-term investment into SAF,” says Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and Head of SABA Secretariat.

“With SAFc Connect, participants have a continuous SAF procurement opportunity that progresses climate goals now, while strengthening the foundations of the SAF market for future growth.”

Six SAFc providers have already joined the platform: Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group (which owns Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, LEVEL, and Vueling), JetBlue, Targray and Valero.

SABA predicts that more providers will sign up in the coming months.

Connecting procurement teams and sellers seamlessly

SABA began in 2021 with the aim of aggregating buyer demand to help fund SAF.

It started with a small proof-of-concept pilot procurement, moving to a longer-term agreement in 2023–2024 that supported tens of millions of gallons of SAF.

In early May 2025, the group issued a third request for proposals for next-generation fuels – this plan is meant to support 5- to 10-year supply deals large enough to help fund new production sites.

SAFc Connect is the next step in SABA’s effort to connect procurement teams and suppliers.

Through the platform, buyers can view current SAF certificate offers, all checked by SABA.

Each offer includes data such as emissions performance, certification standard, price, feedstock, fuel type and contract terms.

Only authorised buyers can view this data, and all information is kept confidential. Buyers can then contact providers directly to discuss purchase agreements.

Suppliers benefit by gaining access to a group of buyers and their respective organisations already committed to reducing their aviation emissions. The platform will update regularly with new offers and more participants. Its design is intended to support more SAF production and make longer-term pricing more stable.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/aacca13b80f7cb3e094f7099a0340c1a:da26db374d61b2778cdb2392da51b2c7/the-establishment-of-cado-could-jumpstart-the-production-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 22:56:07.080299

A new storm is brewing. The Trump trade war is back, and it’s hitting the global airline industry harder than expected. What once seemed like distant political noise is now grounded in the flight plans of major carriers.

The ripple effect is real. Aircraft deals are being reconsidered. Cross-border maintenance contracts face fresh hurdles. Supply chains are tightening. And the once tariff-free aviation world is now entangled in a maze of uncertainty.

IndiGo is seeing pressure on aircraft costs. Air India is reassessing timelines. United, American, and Delta are juggling unpredictable tariffs while watching demand patterns shift. Air Canada, caught between U.S. policy shifts and international routes, is recalibrating too. This isn’t business as usual—this is a calculated race against rising costs and unstable partnerships.

Meanwhile, the global airline industry is trying to adapt. But with the trade war rewriting rules overnight, strategies must pivot fast. Routes, revenues, and relationships are now in the line of fire. The skies may be clear, but beneath the surface, the pressure is building.

So, how is Trump’s trade war really affecting global aviation? What does it mean for the future of flying with IndiGo, Air India, United, American, Delta, and Air Canada? And why should travelers, investors, and governments be paying attention now more than ever?

Strap in. This is the storm behind the headlines—and it’s gaining altitude fast.

The global airline industry has returned to full capacity, but turbulence lies ahead. As airline CEOs and aviation powerhouses converge in New Delhi for the IATA annual summit, the mood is far from celebratory.

Despite post-pandemic recovery gains, the skies ahead are looking stormy. Mounting cost pressures, new geopolitical flashpoints, and looming sustainability failures are threatening to stall the industry’s momentum in 2025.

Passenger Numbers Are Up, But So Are the Challenges

More people are flying than ever. Global air traffic has roared back, with many markets outperforming pre-2020 levels. Airlines in Europe and Asia report strong demand, while India’s aviation sector is on a record-breaking rise.

However, that positive energy is being undercut by urgent realities. Airfare prices are slipping, plane deliveries are delayed, and supply chains remain tangled. Margins are being squeezed from all sides, leaving even top carriers scrambling to balance growth and survival.

Trade War Turbulence Adds New Uncertainty

Just as the skies began to clear, a fresh storm emerged—an unpredictable global trade war, reignited by President Donald Trump’s evolving foreign policy stance.

The once stable, tariff-free aerospace industry is now rattled by sudden changes. Aircraft manufacturers, maintenance hubs, and airline operations across borders are facing new regulatory hurdles and price hikes.

This shift hits especially hard in an era where airlines need every cent saved to afford new aircraft, upgrade fleets, and adopt sustainable fuel.

SAF Supply Crisis Threatens Net-Zero Dream

Another urgent cloud looms: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In 2021, the industry pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, with SAF seen as the cornerstone of that effort.

But three years later, progress is slow. In 2024, global SAF production hit only 1 million metric tons—far short of the 1.5 million target. Airlines are willing to pay, but there simply isn’t enough fuel to meet demand. Prices remain steep, and governments are dragging their feet on regulatory support.

Without a massive production breakthrough, airlines may miss climate goals—and lose public trust.

Asia’s Growth Outpaces the West—but Conflict Zones Raise Costs

Asia is soaring, with India leading the way as the world’s third-largest passenger market. The country’s aviation expansion is reshaping the global map. More routes. Bigger fleets. New airports.

Yet growth here comes at a cost. Rising tensions with Pakistan have forced Indian airlines to reroute flights, leading to long detours and increased operational expenses.

Conflict zones like this don’t just affect schedules—they endanger lives and bleed profits. Airlines must now weigh geopolitical risk alongside weather forecasts and fuel efficiency. War zones are no longer distant news—they’re baked into flight planning.

Safety Under Scrutiny After String of Global Incidents

Safety is also under the microscope. Recent air accidents in Kazakhstan, South Korea, and North America have sent shockwaves through the industry.

In the U.S., strained air traffic control systems are under fire. Delays and errors are becoming more frequent, threatening passenger confidence in the world’s largest aviation market.

IATA has flagged conflict-zone risks and outdated infrastructure as urgent concerns needing global coordination. But with governments distracted by political turmoil and economic instability, airlines are left to navigate these threats on their own.

U.S. Airlines Struggle as Travel Demand Slows

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, U.S. carriers are feeling the pressure. Unlike Asia and parts of Europe, America is seeing a slump in travel demand. Consumers are pulling back. Business travel is stalling. Airlines are finding it harder to predict booking patterns or manage costs.

As demand softens and labor costs rise, many U.S. airlines are slashing forecasts and rethinking route networks. Some are holding off on hiring. Others are delaying fleet upgrades. The once rock-solid American aviation sector is now playing defense.

India Takes Center Stage at Critical Moment

India’s hosting of this year’s IATA summit couldn’t be more symbolic. The country is emerging as a global aviation leader, both in passenger volume and airport development.

IndiGo, the summit’s host and India’s largest airline, represents the scale and ambition of the region. Yet even here, caution is creeping in. Fuel costs are rising. Access to aircraft is delayed. And tensions with neighboring states continue to pose real operational risks.

What happens in India this week could shape aviation strategy across continents. Industry players are watching closely for clarity—and collaboration.

Can the Industry Unite to Weather the Storm?

As the summit unfolds, one question hangs in the air: Can the global airline industry unite to overcome these headwinds?

From SAF production bottlenecks to trade war volatility, from geopolitical flashpoints to climate pressure, airlines face more simultaneous threats than ever before. No single carrier or country can navigate this turbulence alone.

Global coordination, regulatory reform, and investment in innovation are urgently needed. But will they arrive in time?

Conclusion: Aviation Enters Its Most Crucial Phase Yet

The airline industry is at a breaking point—and a turning point.

Demand may be strong, but the foundation is shaking. Supply chains, climate targets, international policy, and safety standards are all in flux. The path ahead is filled with unknowns, but one thing is clear: doing nothing is no longer an option.

What unfolds in New Delhi will not stay in New Delhi. The decisions made at this summit could determine whether the next decade of aviation is defined by progress—or by crisis.

For now, airlines must fly through a perfect storm—one decision, one flight, one reform at a time.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pexels-pixabay-358220-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 09:57:30.032357

Procurement & Supply Chain LIVE Chicago is set to bring together procurement and supply chain's finest from across the US and beyond.

The event, set to be co-located with Sustainability LIVE Chicago, will take place at the iconic Convene Willis Tower on 28-29 May.

It marks a watershed moment for BizClik, the UK-based digital media and events company, which began staging in-person events back in September 2021.

Here, Glen White, CEO of BizClik, discusses the remarkable rise of Procurement & Supply Chain LIVE and Sustainability LIVE, while detailing what industry-leading executives can expect from the Chicago event.

The decision to take Procurement & Supply Chain LIVE and Sustainability LIVE to the US for the first time, with Chicago as the chosen destination, wasn't made lightly.

Glen highlights the city's strategic advantages: ""It's central, a great hub for people to come from the east coast as well as the west coast, but it's an industrial heartland of the US.""

The choice has proven a masterstroke, with the Willis Tower event set to attract around 2,000 attendees.

""We have an entire floor with three very distinct stages, Glen continues. ""It's incredible and our team have worked tirelessly to pull this off.""

Parts Town: Why the Future of Supply Chain is Female

The supply chain and distribution industry faces a major talent crunch, but there remains a major untapped talent pool.

Women, despite making up nearly half the workforce overall, remain underrepresented in these roles.

However, companies looking to stay ahead are rethinking how they recruit and retain female talent – and it’s working. More women are stepping into key supply chain roles, breaking stereotypes and helping businesses build a stronger, more resilient future.

Here, Lisa Backlin, Group Vice President of Supply Chain at Parts Town Unlimited, tells Supply Chain Digital how organisations can better attract and retain female talent in their supply chain teams.

Why are women still underrepresented in supply chain and distribution?

There’s still a lingering perception that supply chain is all hard hats and heavy lifting, work traditionally associated with men. Due to that perception, it hasn't been framed as a strategic dynamic field where women can thrive. That's changed dramatically in the last few years, but we've got miles to go.

US Trade Court Blocks Trump Tariffs: What Happens Next?

A US trade court has blocked most of the tariff orders President Donald Trump has issued since taking office in January 2025.

The move could have significant implications on the US president’s controversial trade policy, which has seen import taxes placed on most of the US’s trading partners and steeper reciprocal tariffs placed on nations and blocs including the EU, the UK, Canada, China and Mexico.

On Wednesday 28 May, the Court of International Trade said that the US Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to regulate commerce with other countries.

It added that this was not superseded by the president’s emergency powers to safeguard the US economy — the White House had previously imposed tariffs after invoking an emergency law under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

The Trump administration has lodged an appeal against the ruling.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/697340a8bb2a15c5afc2c6274d423a9a:be3bd4c66e8db84e336888675b7c6c50/gw-headshot-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 08:56:50.008984

AFCAC Chief: Egypt plays a central role in shaping Africa’s aviation future

By Mohamed Attia

In a move reinforcing Egypt’s leadership role in the African aviation sector, Minister of Civil Aviation Dr. Sameh Al-Hafni held high-level bilateral meetings with top African and international aviation officials during his participation in AFI Aviation Week 2025, held in Zimbabwe.

During his engagements, Dr. Al-Hafni met with Florent Serge Dzotza, President of the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), and Adefunke Adeyemi, the organization’s Secretary General. The meetings were attended by Pilot Amr El-Sharqawy, President of the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority, and Ambassador Salwa El-Mowafi, Egypt’s ambassador to Zimbabwe.

Central to the discussions was Egypt’s candidacy for membership in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council, ahead of elections scheduled for September during the ICAO’s 42nd General Assembly. The AFCAC leadership expressed strong support for Egypt’s bid, citing its long-standing contributions to regional aviation development and international standards.

Al-Hafni emphasized that Egypt serves as the voice of Africa within ICAO and is committed to fostering an effective African partnership that supports sustainable development and regional integration.

The clean fuels developer has partnered with Pittsburgh International Airport to build and operate what it calls ""the nation's first on-site SAF production facility.""
The Pittsburgh facility will be the first to produce ATJ SAF, followed by a second facility in East Saint Louis, Illinois.
In addition to this pioneering SAF production project, Avina has other great ideas for clean fuel production in the US.
This includes a world-scale clean ammonia facility in Texas and a clean hydrogen production facility in California.","Statistics show that the production levels of this alternative fuel are not nearly enough to meet current and future demands. This has a lot to do with the fact that only a few companies can be considered big SAF producers right now. Neste, a Finland-based supplier, is the current leader, with refineries operating on three continents. It's also gearing up to produce more than 2 million tons of SAF per year by early 2026.

The lack of domestic production makes SAF an expensive alternative to conventional jet fuel, which discourages wider use across the industry. This is why launching and ramping up on-site production is a strategic priority. In this context, Avina's announcement is excellent news. The clean fuels developer has partnered with Pittsburgh International Airport to build and operate what it calls ""the nation's first on-site SAF production facility.""

Here's what we know so far about the future facility: it will be located south of PIT's terminal, it will use an alcohol-to-jet technology to obtain SAF, and production is expected to eventually reach more than 100 million gallons of fuel annually. This quantity is enough to satisfy the needs of commercial and cargo operations at PIT.

It's important to note that the particular technology used at this new facility is almost a premiere for the US. That's because there are multiple ways to obtain SAF, each with specific benefits and disadvantages. As the name suggests, ATJ turns ethanol or methanol into jet fuel, and its biggest advantage is that the resulting fuel is drop-in ready. More specifically, it's certified by ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) as a 100% drop-in replacement fuel.

The ATJ pathway SAF was also tested and validated by DARPA, the US Air Force, and the Swedish Air Force as military jet fuel. Why the Swedish Air Force? Well, because the PureSAF ATJ technology is developed and owned by Swedish Biofuels AB. KBR exclusively licenses this technology worldwide, and Avina will deploy KBR's technology at PIT.

The Pittsburgh facility will be the first to produce ATJ SAF, followed by a second facility in East Saint Louis, Illinois. The first one is due to become operational by 2027, and the second one should be ready by 2028.

We conduct extensive due diligence when choosing projects for our portfolio, and are pleased to support this project as part of Microsoft’s broader portfolio of high-quality carbon removal solutions.
The collaboration aims to protect the economic security of our agri-food system with a measurable and scalable approach to nature-based carbon removal.”","Sustainable agriculture and biological solutions provider Indigo Ag and Microsoft announced their second carbon removal agreement, with a new commitment from Microsoft to purchase 60,000 soil carbon credits generated through the promotion of regenerative agriculture practices by U.S. farmers.

The new transaction follows an initial 40,000 carbon credit purchase agreement by the companies last year.

Founded in 2013, Indigo Ag provides nature-based and digital technologies aimed at helping farmers improve profitability and environmental sustainability. The company launched its carbon program in 2019, helping farmers adopt regenerative agriculture practices including cover crops, diversified crop rotation, reduced tillage and improved nitrogen timing, that enrich soil while sequestering carbon dioxide. Under the program, farmers add the new practices with agronomic support from Indigo, while the company also calculates the carbon credits through the use of soil samples and on-farm data, validates the findings with a verifier, with results submitted to a carbon registry, for issuance of the credits, which can be sold to corporate buyers.

The new transaction is sourced from Indigo’s fourth carbon crop, consisting of over half a million independently verified carbon credits issued through the Climate Action Reserve. To date, Indigo’s carbon program has generated over 900,000 tons of carbon removal across 28 states, and has prevented over 64 billion gallons of surface water runoff.

Indigo Ag CEO Dean Banks said:

“When Microsoft, recognized as the major driver behind the carbon removals market, invests in Indigo’s carbon credits, it affirms their confidence in our science, team, and technology. Our microbial and sustainability portfolio spans 20 million acres across 15 countries, and this deal underscores the trust in farmers’ hard work to create a healthy and resilient agri-food system.”

Microsoft is by far the largest corporate buyer of carbon removal credits globally, with the company recently reporting that it contracted nearly 22 million tons of carbon removal last year alone as part of its efforts to become carbon negative by 2030. In just the past few weeks, the company has announced a series of large-scale carbon removal purchases across a broad range of technologies including biochar, forest management, bio-energy carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and reforestation, among others.

Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy and Carbon Removal at Microsoft, said:

“Indigo’s work to create resilient farms and secure watersheds across the U.S. delivers measurable climate benefits as well as improved soil and water health and new economic development opportunities in rural communities. We conduct extensive due diligence when choosing projects for our portfolio, and are pleased to support this project as part of Microsoft’s broader portfolio of high-quality carbon removal solutions.

The 140-MW electrolyzer - a facility that splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen through electricity - is planned to produce up to 23,000 metric tons a year of green hydrogen.

Expected to start production 2027, the project will use wind, solar and hydro power. It would be the biggest European electrolytic facility to produce renewable hydrogen, OMV said. Hydrogen produced through electrolysis that runs on renewable power is called green or renewable.

On June 30 OMV announced the start of production at its first commercial-scale green hydrogen facility, built with a capacity of 1,500 metric tons per annum at its Schwechat refinery near Vienna. The plant uses a 10-MW PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyzer powered by hydro, solar and wind energy. The process avoids up to 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions a year, equivalent to the CO2 consumption of 2,000 persons per year based on a European Union average, according to OMV.

Output from the newly inaugurated facility will be used to decarbonize the refinery and produce more sustainable fuels and chemicals including sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

Martijn van Koten, OMV executive vice president for fuels and chemicals, said of the incoming project, “With this project, we are re-inventing the production of everyday essential fuels and chemical products - a groundbreaking step that demonstrates how industrial innovation and sustainability can go hand in hand”.

“By using green hydrogen in the future, we are making the processes and production of fuels and chemical products more sustainable and are future-proofing our industry.

“Our planned 140 MW electrolysis plant in Bruck an der Leitha will meet a significant share of the hydrogen demand at the OMV Schwechat refinery, reinforcing our role as a pioneer in industrial transformation”.

Also on June 30 OMV and Abu Dhabi Future Energy Co. PJSC (Masdar) said they had signed a letter of intent to collaborate on producing green hydrogen and derivatives.

The partnership would involve producing synthetic aviation fuel and other synthetic fuels, as well as synthetic chemicals, in Austria, the United Arab Emirates and northern and central Europe.

“By leveraging our combined capabilities, Masdar and OMV are looking to produce green hydrogen and derivatives at industrial scale, supporting decarbonization efforts and building the green hydrogen value chain”, Masdar chief green hydrogen officer Mohammad Abdelqader El Ramahi said.

Along with the 10-MW electrolyzer, OMV also put into operation a plant that uses its proprietary ReOil technology to convert hard-to-recycle plastics into virgin-quality products.

“By strengthening the link between refining and chemical production, we unlock greater efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability”, chair and chief executive Alfred Stern said. “This is how we turn molecules into value - and strategy into meaningful impact”.

The data reveals that some of the biggest risks to airline success are now macro in nature—far outpacing traditional industry concerns like fuel price volatility or pilot shortages.

“In this year’s survey, there is a theme: CEOs are doubling down on the fundamentals they can control,” says Bryan Terry, Aviation leader, Deloitte Consulting LLP. “That means tightening cost structures, boosting operational reliability, and laying the groundwork for sustainable profitability and growth.”

Resilience through cost control and reliability

Airline CEOs are deliberately focusing on the fundamentals they can influence – whether it’s focusing on cost structures or striving for operational excellence. The focus demonstrates a deliberate pivot from growth-at-any-cost toward efficiency

When asked for their top priorities over the next 12 months, 63% of CEOs are prioritizing cost control and financial health

Over half of CEOs cited operational reliability as one of the top initiatives they will prioritize when it comes to customer experience

A majority of CEOs deemed on-time performance (67%) and technical operations (60%) as a priority

A balanced approach to growth and leadership

While cost containment and operational efficiency remain important to the CEO agenda, more than half (53%) are also prioritizing customer experience, signaling that delivering value to passengers should coexist with financial discipline.

To enhance customer experience, CEOs are prioritizing initiatives such as digital and mobile platform enhancements (65%) and operational reliability (58%)

CEOs also cited transformative technology (47%) as the top initiative they are prioritizing over the next 12 months to drive growth.

They identified strategic and visionary thinking (63%), operation execution and resiliency (60%) and employee engagement and culture (60%) as the top three traits to help guide their airlines to long-term success.

Technology investment as a catalyst

With a focus on transformative technology as the top driver of growth, the majority (63%) are prioritizing advanced data analytics over the next year, and many also have an upbeat perspective on AI’s transformational impact over the next three years.

Beyond data analytics, CEOs also cited AI and machine learning (47%), next generation retail solutions (43%), and cyber and IT resilience (40%) as top investments over the next year

A majority of CEOs (80%) expect AI to deliver the greatest gains in revenue management and dynamic pricing over the next three years

Over half (60%) also expect AI to have a significant impact on predictive maintenance and aircraft reliability over that period

Half (50%) see AI’s biggest impact in customer service and irregular operations recovery

Workforce and culture as strategic imperatives

Amid the current economic backdrop, airline CEOs see workforce and culture as one of the key levers to help build resilience. CEOs are selectively prioritizing strategies that create organizational stability and a stronger corporate culture.

Over half of CEOs (53%) said they are prioritizing leadership development and succession planning

And 47% of CEOs are focused on employee experience and well-being

Notably, traditional concerns such as pilot recruitment (30%), reskilling (20%), and flexible work models (13%) have taken a backseat

Targeted sustainability in a cost-conscious era

As the structural shift of the CEO agenda evolves, many are taking a more targeted and practical approach to sustainability.

More than three quarters of CEOs (80%) cited sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a top initiative to achieve their sustainability goals, while carbon offsets now rank near the bottom, with only 13% of CEOs now citing this as a priority

Aligning with the broader focus on operational efficiency, 63% of CEOs said they are prioritizing fuel optimization and block time

More than half of CEOs (53%) are pursuing fleet modernization

“The future of aviation may not be about chasing the next big breakthrough—it may be about becoming resilient in the face of whatever comes next,” says Yvonne Rene de Cotret, Deloitte Global Transportation, Hospitality & Services Sector leader. “Airline CEOs are laying the groundwork for long-term strength, anchored by a commitment to cost control, reliability, and adaptive leadership.”

The tense atmosphere in the United States, from Trump's plans to revoke foreign students' visas to reports of travellers detained at US borders, has also put a dampener on tourism.

""The airline sector is always sensitive to the economic and political climate,"" Paul Chiambaretto, professor of strategy and marketing at France's Montpellier Business School, told AFP.

""Any form of uncertainty will reduce traffic,"" he added, noting it ""especially"" impacted business travellers, the most profitable segment.

The influential International Air Transport Association (IATA) is due to update its traffic and profitability projections as the delegates from the group gathering 350 airlines hold their talks.

In December it forecast a record 5.2 billion air journeys in 2025 -- up 6.7 percent from an already unprecedented 2024. It predicted carriers would generate $36.6 billion in cumulative net profit, on revenue exceeding $1 trillion.

However, the US president's ""Liberation Day"" tariff blitz and his administration's stance on issues from immigration to education could throw a spanner in the works.

Putting up the 'closed' sign

As early as March, the North American air transport market, which represents 23 percent of global traffic, began to decline and several US-based airlines warned they would not meet their financial targets.

A study released this month by the World Travel and Tourism Council and Oxford Economics found that the United States was on track to lose some $12.5 billion in revenue from foreign tourists this year owing to worries about travelling to the country.

The group, made up of leading travel firms, said this ""represents a direct blow to the US economy overall, impacting communities, jobs, and businesses from coast to coast"".

""While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the US government is putting up the 'closed' sign,"" WTTC president Julia Simpson said.

Didier Brechemier, an airline industry expert at Roland Berger, said: ""Today, bookings for the North Atlantic are lower than they were at the same time last year.""

IATA Director General Willie Walsh noted on Thursday ""some signs of fragility of consumer and business confidence with continued weakness in the US domestic market and a sharp fall in North American premium class travel"".

Air transport has for decades benefited from the removal of import taxes, rising living standards -- particularly in Asia -- and open borders, with the number of air trips tripling since 2000.

But the return of protectionism is endangering the industrial model of aircraft manufacturers, whose assembly lines mobilise suppliers worldwide, with costs likely to increase, putting more of a burden on carriers.

Lower energy costs

There's good news for carriers, though, with oil prices falling owing to an anticipated slowdown in economic growth.

That could help firms reduce their fuel bills -- representing between a quarter and a third of their operational costs -- by hundreds of millions of dollars.

Washington's new Republican administration is also fully supporting the development of fossil fuels, in contrast to that of Democratic former president Joe Biden, who subsidised Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Sustainable development ""has largely disappeared from the airline industry's immediate priorities"", says Jerome Bouchard, a partner at consultants Oliver Wyman.

Also likely on the agenda for IATA will be the impact of geopolitical tensions on the industry.

India is experiencing explosive growth, with the number of airports and passengers in the world's most populous nation doubling over the past decade, while major airlines IndiGo and Air India have hundreds of aircraft on order.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address delegates on Monday, organisers said.

The country's recent deadly spat with neighbour Pakistan, which saw the two sides impose airspace bans on each other, highlighted the fragility of civil aviation in the face of such upheavals.

The row poses an additional complication for connections to Asia, as Russia has banned US and EU aircraft overflights in retaliation for sanctions linked to its invasion of Ukraine.

Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel and PIT (the Pittsburgh airport’s official abbreviation) agreed to develop an on-airport SAF facility featuring tested alcohol-to-jet biofuel technology. The Avina plant will be just south of PIT’s terminal and could eventually produce up to 100 million gallons of SAF annually utilizing KBR’s PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology which is owned by Swedish-based AB.

“Pittsburgh International Airport has long been committed to resiliency and driving innovation in the aviation and energy industries,” Christina Cassotis, CEO of Pittsburgh International Airport, said in a statement. “This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall. With abundant natural resources, robust energy infrastructure, and available fuel storage, PIT is uniquely positioned to meet these goals and serve the growing demands for SAF.”

SAF is a biofuel which is refined to meet energy density standards and serve as a drop-in fuel blended with traditional jet fuel. The move at PIT has gained the approval of various aviation industry firms which are participating in the growth of SAF options.

“In pursuit of responsible and resilient growth in aerospace, Boeing supports the development of advanced, synthetic fuels here in the U.S. to power air travel into the future,” said Mike Caston, Director, Americas Partnerships and Policy, Boeing, in a statement.

Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from non-petroleum feedstocks such as agricultural resources and is measured to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation currently accounts for 2% of all man-made carbon emissions globally and close to 12% of all transportation sector emissions, according to the Alternative Fuel Data Center within the U.S. Department of Energy.

“KBR is proud to support the Pittsburgh International Airport team and enable it to be one of the first airports globally to provide SAF to its customers by producing it onsite at the airport,” Hari Ravindran, KBR’s Global SVP for Technology said in a statement. “PureSAF (alcohol-to-jet) Technology, is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100% drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel. This project is a real example of how innovation and strong business relationships are delivering tangible benefits to the aviation industry.”

KBR is licensed to produce the PureSAF technology. Swedish BioFuels invented the process and spent years verifying it through a pilot plant. The feedstocks include ethanol and other alcohols derived from organic resources, then utilizes a synthesis of aromatics. This creates advanced SAF called synthetic kerosene, thus bringing this type of biofuel closer to traditional petroleum jet fuel chemistry, according to reports.

Pittsburgh International Airport has been fortifying its on-site power backups and other distributed energy since the last decade. PIT airport commissioned its microgrid featuring gas-fired gen-sets and solar power in 2021.

The microgrid at PIT was built partially in response to the costly and lengthy power outage at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport a few years earlier, which cost Delta and other airline companies an estimated $100 million. Since then, JFK International, Dallas-Fort Worth and other airport sites have commissioned construction projects around on-site power and microgrids.

Pittsburgh’s PIT has pushed even further into commercial and industrial energy transition technologies. Last month, IMG announced it was installing another 4.7-MW solar farm on-site at PIT, while a new hydrogen production and SAF agreement between PIT, KeyState Energy and CNX Resources was detailed late last year.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/05/6839d3e41a6ca8dea0781318-saf_dreamstime.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-30 12:56:53.203605

By adopting SAF, India can boost its leadership in sustainable energy, mitigate dependence on fossil fuels, and encourage environmental responsibility in the aviation value chain.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a next-generation biofuel designed to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector. SAF is derived from sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, algae and non-food crops. It is chemically parallel to traditional jet fuel, permitting it to be used in existing aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure without any alterations.

The primary appeal of SAF is implicit in its ability to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuel. This eco-friendly fuel is certified under international standards like ASTM D7566, which ensures safety and efficiency. With growing global demand and supportive policies, SAF is increasingly becoming an important component of sustainable aviation.

Why SAF is Crucial?

SAF plays a key role in combating climate change by minimizing the carbon footprint of the aviation industry, which accounts for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. With passenger air travel projected to develop gradually, a shift to SAF is necessary to fulfill global net-zero targets. It permits the aviation sector to align with national and international environmental commitments, including the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

F1’s relationship with SAF F1's alternative fuel strategy extends into the skies, too.","The roar of engines, the smell of burning rubber and the thrill of wheel-to-wheel racing at more than 200mph.

It’s fair to say that Formula 1 has never been a sport associated with environmentalism.

The European leg of the 2025 season is set to be a little different, though.

F1 is implementing a comprehensive alternative fuel strategy in service of its 2030 net zero goals as it attempts to transform how the sport operates both on and off the track.

The season’s nine European races, which stretch from May to September, will see the introduction of biofuel-powered lorries delivering freight, renewable energy systems powering entire paddocks and much more.

As the most viewed motorsport series in the world, F1 has a huge responsibility to decarbonise, but it is showing that it is willing to embrace radical, meaningful change.

Powering the paddock with renewable energy

The most visible change arrived in May 2025, at the season’s inaugural European race, the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.

Here in Imola, the course’s paddock was entirely powered by a low-carbon energy system.

This centralised approach, supplied by F1 partner Aggreko, promises to slash associated carbon emissions by approximately 90% – a figure that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.

Rather than each team operating their own generators scattered throughout the paddock, a single compound provided renewable energy from multiple sources.

Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar panels and battery energy storage systems (BESS) worked in tandem to power everything from the pit lane to the event technical centre.

This isn't F1 taking a punt on untested technology. The system has been trialled at four previous European races, including the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix and three events in 2024.

Each trial saw impressive carbon reductions, giving the sport the confidence to roll out the technology across all nine of its European races this season.

The benefits extend beyond mere carbon reduction. By eliminating the need for dozens of individual generators, the system also reduces transportation emissions – a crucial consideration for a sport that moves an entire circus across continents throughout the year.

Biofuel lorries and sustainable logistics

Perhaps the most practical demonstration of F1's commitment to sustainability is in its changes to logistics.

This season sees the return of DHL's biofuel fleet, with 37 specially adapted lorries transporting freight across Europe using alternative fuels rather than traditional diesel.

During the 2023 European leg, these biofuel-powered vehicles achieved an average reduction of 83% in logistics-related emissions compared to conventional fuel.

For a sport that requires the precise, time-critical movement of millions of dollars worth of equipment across the world, this represents a quite remarkable achievement without compromising on efficiency.

The fuel of the future

Perhaps most significantly for the sport's future, the 2025 season has seen F2 and F3 cars successfully transition to 100% advanced sustainable fuel, developed by Aramco.

This move builds on the 2024 season's use of 55% sustainable fuel and serves as a crucial testing ground for Formula 1's own transition, which is due in 2026.

The timing is deliberate. Next year's introduction of new hybrid engines in F1 will coincide with the sport's adoption of these advanced sustainable fuels, representing the most significant technical regulation change in years.

But the implications stretch way beyond the circuit.

The sustainable fuel being developed for Formula 1 is designed to be a 'drop-in' replacement, meaning it can also be used in conventional road cars without any modifications necessary.

It could prove transformative for the broader automotive industry, offering a sustainable alternative that requires no infrastructure overhaul or consumer behaviour change.

It’s also further proof that elite level sport is a prolific testing ground for innovations that change life on Earth.

F1’s relationship with SAF

F1's alternative fuel strategy extends into the skies, too.

In 2024, the sport’s governing body made significant investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which delivered an estimated 80% reduction in flight-related carbon emissions compared to conventional aviation fuel.

Working with partners DHL and Qatar Airways, this initiative reduced total emissions by more than 8,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent – roughly equivalent to taking 1,700 cars off British roads for an entire year.

For a sport that operates globally, with races across five continents, aviation emissions are one of the biggest challenges for F1’s net zero prospects.

The 19% reduction in related emissions across the 2024 flyaway events goes to show that meaningful progress is possible even in aviation, traditionally one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7baaf5fc848f025285cc645e0cf680c1:4f5223424a34c67e1c5a77c8c604ca26/the-paddocks-in-the-f1-s-european-circuits-are-getting-a-sustainable-makeover.png.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:56:19.934835

At the ACI Europe Annual Congress in Istanbul, International Airport Review sat down with Kata Cserep, Global Aviation Lead, and Sabire Ipek Demir, Energy Transition Expert at PA Consulting, to explore how airports can transform into data-driven, sustainable hubs of innovation. From electrification and grid constraints to community engagement and AI-powered operations, this interview reveals why PA Consulting sees collaboration, transparency, and innovation as essential to the aviation sector’s next evolution.

As the aviation industry navigates the complex challenges of decarbonisation, digital transformation, and shifting stakeholder expectations, the need for bold, integrated solutions has never been greater. At the forefront of this movement is PA Consulting, a firm leveraging cross-sector expertise to guide airports toward a smarter, greener future. In this exclusive interview, we speak with two of PA’s leading voices Kata Cserep and Sabire Ipek Demir on how airports can move beyond ambition and into actionable, measurable impact. From strategy to implementation, the conversation explores case studies, innovative technologies, and the evolving role of airports as both transport and energy hubs.

Can you tell me about PA Consulting generally and your role within the firm?

Kata: I lead the Global Airports and Aviation team at PA Consulting. I’ve spent the last 20 years working with airlines, airports, investors, and policy makers, and I joined PA in 2023.

Having spent this time in the industry, and generally taking a long-term view, I can see three long-term macro trends that will influence the challenges of airports over the next two decades. The first one is energy transition and decarbonisation. Another one is digital transformation, use of AI, and data science technologies. Last but not least is capacity expansion through capital investments and making the best use of existing capacities through greater operational efficiencies. These also happen to be areas where PA is an exceptionally strong advisor across a number of different sectors.

PA Consulting supports airports as well as other sector clients with their long-term sustainability strategies. We also work with airports to bring AI technologies into their operations, applying data science to manage flows and bring actionable efficiency insights. We also advise them on engagements with investors and regulators on new investments, whether it’s electric fleets, micro-grids, or new technology in the terminal. It’s about being able to assess the business cases and bring about the change – that’s the role we play.

In terms of size and coverage, PA has about 4,000 people. Our aviation team is based in the UK, Netherlands, and the U.S., but we operate globally, so we work with airports of all sizes, in different parts of the world.

Sabire, could you let me know about your role at PA and an example on how you supported UK airports on the road to sustainability?

Sabire: I’m an economist, specialising in energy transition policy design and investment strategies. I advise energy and aviation sectors clients, as we see similar trends across the economic frameworks that govern the energy transition initiatives in both sectors.

The PA team recently completed a project where we helped a major London airport develop a refreshed sustainability strategy. They approached PA with an ambition to be a champion in sustainable aviation: not just by meeting their Net Zero by 2050 targets, but also by meeting the expectations of local government, community, internal teams, and employees. They needed a roadmap and a communications agenda.

The PA team started the project with an extensive stakeholder engagement, interviewing more than a hundred stakeholders that range from airport senior executives, employees, teams, and shareholders, all the way to passengers, partners of the airport, as well as community members and local government. These engagements identified four areas of actions:

Infrastructure: Providing the necessary infrastructure to enable the net zero transition, which is the big and exciting challenge in front of us.

Partners: Having the airport business partners supporting the innovation and implementation of the future of flight.

Teams: Making the airport a great place to work with learning and growth opportunities and the chance to build a fulfilling career.

Community: Being a good neighbour while also providing opportunities for the community around the airport.

The planned work across these areas rests on collaboration, transparency and innovation:

It has to be a collaborative effort for all stakeholders to be onboard and for the plan to be designed in a way that’s implementable and effective for everybody.

Transparency is key. You must back up all initiatives or new measures with data evidence supporting the higher expected benefits.

Finally, innovation that supports sustainable solutions across all aspects of an airport service, from customer satisfaction to working with partners, to working internally within your own teams.

The PA team and our client airport identified commitments and delivery actions across these areas. For instance, the airport now has a strategy to enable the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by increased collaboration with airlines and fuel providers. With regards to the Net Zero targets, they aim to supply 25% of the electricity use at the airport from onsite renewable generation. By 2040, the aim is for 100% of all electricity needs of the airport to be provided by off-grid solutions or self-generation at the airport. There is also a 2030 target for achieving 100% low carbon airport vehicles fleet. These are all exciting goals.

Earlier today at the Congress, a subject that was touched upon was electrification of airports. What do you think is the biggest challenge if we were to see that evolution?

Kata: Grid connection challenge is what we hear most often from our clients, for two reasons.

One, the historical electricity capacity and requirements of airports have been modest in comparison to what the future projected needs are to electrify ground support equipment and fleet, not to mention future electric aircrafts. Further along, the level of ‘charging’ that’s required will be orders of magnitude larger. So, the step-up in electricity demand is larger than what the connections to the grid are currently set up for.

Secondly, outside of the airport, the whole grid is strained because everyone else is trying to electrify as well. That’s the challenge I see as the most consistently heard and voiced, whether in the U.S., in Europe, or anywhere else.

Sabire: Grid constraints are not just a challenge for our airport clients, but also for our renewable energy developer clients, onshore and offshore. We also advise the transmission and distribution networks on their investment strategies to reinforce the grid. There’s currently a high regulatory and policy awareness around this challenge and direct intervention by the government authorities to help alleviate grid constraints and potential overload from increased self-generation. The National Electricity System Operator (NESO)’s ‘Connections Reform’ and the ‘Strategic Spatial Energy Plan’ are steps in this direction.

Many solutions for reducing Scope 2 emissions at airports also consider off-grid generation and electricity storage solutions to bypass the grid connections challenge, converting airports to ‘enerports’.

Do you think that sustainability or the need for more sustainable practice could be framed as an exciting challenge for the industry, one that is driving forward innovation?

Kata: The aviation industry is generally characterised by continuous innovation. There is also increasingly more opportunity and appetite to learn from outside the aviation sector. This merging of expertise from the energy, transport and digital sectors, where different stakeholders are coming together either through commercial incentive, regulation, or that desire to innovate together, is where I see the most exciting opportunities.

You’re allowed one wish for the aviation and airport industry. What is that one wish? If you could wave a magic wand and solve one challenge right away?

Kata: In the area of sustainability, the obvious missing link to me, is the cost of decarbonising aviation. If I could wave a magic wand, I would say, “right, we are going to pay for decarbonisation overnight, and yes, it’s going to add 10% to every ticket globally tomorrow, but we’ll be done”. The reason it’s so expensive is because only a tiny proportion of people are doing it, so my wish would be to decarbonise at once, as a global collective.

Sabire: I would use my magic wand to achieve the required technological innovations overnight. We can achieve a lot with 3rd gen sustainable aviation fuels and the power-to-x technology, or zero emissions flight such as hydrogen or electric used for all private jets and smaller aircrafts. Yet these technologies are at the very early stages of development, and until they reach full maturity their costs will be too high. To be able to make that technological leap of 10 to 20 years overnight, would be my wish.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2510038871-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:56:32.218800

“It’s an exciting time right now for sustainable aviation and there’s a lot of moon-shot technologies being developed with electric aviation being one of those.”","With just two seats, the Velis Electro is the smallest aircraft I’ve ever been in — and one of the most remarkable, shining a light on the future of flight. The 600kg aircraft is being powered solely by two 12kWh batteries, one that is in the nose of the aircraft, the second tucked away behind us (by comparison a Tesla would have a battery pack with a capacity of about 100kWh).

It is also remarkably quiet. At 60db while cruising, the aircraft is no louder than the level of a normal conversation and is also surprisingly simple to fly. “There really are only a few buttons you need to press to get into the air,” Twidell says. “You just don’t have the same complexities as you do with a combustion engine. It has instant power and is extremely nimble.”

While the batteries make it the cleanest way to fly — it is zero-emission while in the sky — they are also its limiting factor. The aircraft, once fully charged, can only fly for about an hour, although Twidell says a flying time of 45 minutes is what a conservative pilot would be happy with.

When I had arrived at the airport, the aircraft had been hooked up to its charging unit, which was only a little bigger than the size of a generator you might see powering a motorhome. At present the plug is unique to the aircraft but work is under way to standardise it — similar to the combined charging system that electric cars can almost universally hook up to — so that a growing number of airports will be able to accommodate the inevitably growing number of electric aircraft. Currently just over a dozen aerodromes in the UK support electric aircraft.

As we circle around the outskirts of the city, Twidell lets me take the controls. “You can’t go wrong,” he says. Tentatively I tilt the aircraft using the yoke — the stick that controls the pitch and roll — and we bank back towards the centre. The River Cam is glistening in the spring sunshine and the limestone on the city’s grand colleges is illuminated.

As well as cleaner flying, the Pipistrel aircraft is considerably cheaper to run — albeit with a purchase price of about £170,000 — compared with traditional aircraft. An hour of flying costs about £5 in electricity, compared with about £100 in fuel in a traditional prop-plane such as a Cessna.

Back on the ground, Kennedy Ricci, the founder of 4AIR, the sustainable aviation consultancy, heralds the aircraft as a “huge step in the right direction”. It is working in partnership with Cambridge University’s Whittle Laboratory, which is running the “Aviation Impact Accelerator” (AIA), researching sustainable aviation.

“There is no single answer in aviation,” Ricci says. “Cars are easy, you can electrify them. In a lot of industries, electrification just works. It’s much more complex in aviation. There’s going to need to be a mix of solutions; electric for short flights, sustainable aviation fuel for long-haul. It’s a mixed picture.”

The race is on to develop electric technology. Last week the Bristol-based company, Vertical Aerospace, which is developing flying taxis, made its first flight over the UK countryside in its VX4 prototype.

It marked a milestone on the company’s road to commercial deployment of so-called eVTOLs, electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The company says its aircraft will be able to take passengers from Battersea, in southwest London, to Heathrow in just 12 minutes.

This week scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology unveiled a new fuel cell they believe has “revolutionary” potential for electric flying. They say that a prototype achieved energy densities of more than 1,500 watt-hours per kilogram — far beyond the 250 to 300 Wh/kg typical of lithium-ion batteries. In a real-life system, they believe that would translate to more than 1,000 Wh/kg — a threshold seen as necessary to make electric-powered regional aviation viable.

Dr Deepanshu Singh, a researcher in sustainable aviation at the AIA, is also excited about the prospects for green flying in the coming decades. He said: “Right now, it’s limited to short ranges and one of the reasons which kills range is the safety reserve requirement. However, there’s a way to extend that through hybrid configuration, just like a Prius, where you can save the reserve as fossil jet fuel, but not use it.

Formula 1 has never been regarded as a particularly sustainable sport.

However, the 2025 European racing segment is looking to be different.

F1 is deploying an extensive alternative fuel initiative to support its net zero objectives by 2030, working to revolutionise the sport's operations both during races and behind the scenes.

The nine European races, scheduled from May through September, will feature biofuel-operated trucks for freight transport, renewable energy infrastructure powering complete paddock facilities and additional sustainable innovations.

As the world's most-watched motorsport competition, F1 bears significant responsibility for decarbonisation.

Renewable energy integration in paddock operations

The most noticeable transformation debuted in May 2025 during the European season opener, the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.

At Imola, the circuit's paddock operated entirely on a low-carbon energy infrastructure.

This unified system, provided by F1 partner Aggreko, is projected to reduce corresponding carbon emissions by roughly 90% – a reduction that was unimaginable a few years ago.

Instead of individual teams running separate generators distributed across the paddock, one centralised facility delivered renewable energy from various sources.

Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), photovoltaic panels and battery energy storage systems (BESS) collaborated to supply power for everything from pit areas to the event's technical facilities.

This represents F1's adoption of proven technology rather than experimental systems. The infrastructure underwent testing at four prior European races, including the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix and three 2024 events.

Every trial demonstrated substantial carbon reductions, providing the sport with confidence to implement this technology throughout all nine European races this season.

The advantages go beyond carbon reduction alone. By removing the requirement for numerous individual generators, the system also decreases transportation emissions – an essential factor for a sport that relocates an entire operation across continents year-round.

Next-generation fuel development

The 2025 season has witnessed F2 and F3 cars successfully adopting 100% advanced sustainable fuel, created by Aramco.

This transition builds upon the 2024 season's implementation of 55% sustainable fuel and functions as an essential testing platform for Formula 1's own conversion, scheduled for 2026.

Next year's introduction of new hybrid powertrains in F1 will align with the sport's sustainable fuel adoption, marking the most substantial technical regulation modification in recent years.

Yet the ramifications extend far beyond racing circuits.

The sustainable fuel under development for Formula 1 is engineered as a 'drop-in' substitute, allowing use in standard road vehicles without requiring modifications.

This could prove revolutionary for the wider automotive sector, providing a sustainable option that demands no infrastructure restructuring or consumer habit changes.

It additionally demonstrates that elite sports serve as productive testing environments for innovations that transform everyday life.

F1's sustainable aviation fuel initiatives

F1's alternative fuel approach reaches into aviation as well.

During 2024, the sport's governing organisation made substantial investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), achieving an estimated 80% reduction in flight-related carbon emissions compared to standard aviation fuel.

Collaborating with partners DHL and Qatar Airways, this program reduced total emissions by more than 8,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent – approximately equal to removing 1,700 cars from British roads for one year.

For a globally operating sport with races spanning five continents, aviation emissions represent one of the greatest obstacles to F1's net zero ambitions.

The 19% reduction in associated emissions across 2024 flyaway events demonstrates that significant advancement is achievable even in aviation, historically among the most challenging sectors to decarbonise.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7baaf5fc848f025285cc645e0cf680c1:4f5223424a34c67e1c5a77c8c604ca26/the-paddocks-in-the-f1-s-european-circuits-are-getting-a-sustainable-makeover.png.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:56:52.811476

As the world’s leading SAF producer, Neste is at the forefront of efforts to bridge this gap and drive sustainable aviation forward.
Beyond airlines, Neste is deepening its collaboration with logistics companies.
While SAF is currently blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, Neste is actively working toward 100% SAF certification.
“We aim to support our customers in reducing their GHG emissions by 20 million tons per annum by 2030.","With the aviation industry pushing toward net-zero emissions by 2050, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a key solution. Despite its potential, SAF still accounts for less than 1% of total global jet fuel consumption, underscoring the urgent need to scale production. As the world’s leading SAF producer, Neste is at the forefront of efforts to bridge this gap and drive sustainable aviation forward.

“SAF is a key lever to decarbonise aviation, but its current production capacity is limited,” says Alexander Kueper, Vice President Renewable Aviation Business at Neste. “We simply don’t have the luxury to wait anymore. This requires action and cooperation across the whole aviation ecosystem, including airlines, airports, fuel producers, governments, businesses using aviation for travel and cargo, and even individual travellers.”

Scaling SAF production: Meeting global demand Neste is rapidly expanding its SAF production capacity to meet growing global demand. “Neste is the world’s leading producer of SAF with a current SAF production capability of 1 million tons per annum, which is roughly 1.25 billion litres,” says Kueper. “This will increase to 1.5 million tons per annum once the modification to our existing Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands is completed this year, and further to 2.2 million tons after the ongoing expansion of our refinery in Rotterdam.”

With production facilities in Finland and Singapore, Neste operates the world’s largest SAF production facility in Singapore, enabling the company to serve customers in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. However, scaling production remains a challenge. “Governments play a crucial role in creating a market and demand for SAF, as demand certainty is needed to attract investment into new production capacity,” Kueper explains.

Driving adoption: Partnering with airlines & expanding infrastructure Neste has partnered with numerous airlines and logistics companies worldwide to integrate SAF into operations. “A good example is our cooperation with Singapore Airlines, to which we supplied SAF at Changi Airport last year, produced at our Singapore refinery and supplied into the airport via our integrated supply chain in the country,” shares Kueper.

Beyond airlines, Neste is deepening its collaboration with logistics companies. “A more recent example is the further strengthening of our existing cooperation with DHL Group, to which we already supply SAF, but with whom we will develop a holistic, joint approach to tackling GHG emissions in transportation, both by air and by road,” he adds.

To enhance SAF accessibility, Neste is expanding fuel availability at major airports. “Neste has its own SAF supply capabilities at a selected number of international airports such as Amsterdam, San Francisco, and Singapore but is working together with partners to enable access to SAF at other airports across the globe—for example, with ITOCHU in Japan or Signature Aviation and Avfuel in the US,” says Kueper.

While SAF is currently blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, Neste is actively working toward 100% SAF certification. “For example, our cooperation with Airbus and Rolls Royce is researching the impact of using 100% SAF on aviation emissions,” he notes.

Policy & market dynamics: Unlocking SAF’s full potential Government support is crucial in accelerating SAF adoption, particularly through policies like the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the UK SAF mandate, which require airlines to incorporate a minimum percentage of SAF into their fuel mix. “Both have started with 2% in 2025, with the EU increasing to 6% in 2030 and the UK to even 10% by 2030,” Kueper explains.

Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are also moving towards similar mandates. “We see governments in Japan and Singapore implementing or developing similar policies,” he adds. “The availability of SAF to support the European mandates is there, with Neste alone increasing its SAF production capability to 1.5 million tons per annum this year, and we are not the only producer around.”

Global policy alignment is another critical factor. “Aviation is a global industry, introducing the need for global alignment. It is positive that ICAO has set an intermediary target for international aviation to be 5% less carbon-intensive by 2030, through the use of SAF,” Kueper highlights.

The next generation of sustainable aviation fuels While SAF is currently the most viable alternative to conventional jet fuel, Neste is also exploring future technologies such as Power-to-X. “SAF is basically a category of more sustainable fuels that can be produced from non-fossil sources in several ways,” explains Kueper. “Neste uses HEFA technology, which is currently the only commercially viable technology. Most of the SAF produced globally today is HEFA-SAF.”

Other production pathways, such as alcohol-to-jet, are scaling, while Power-to-Liquids technology, which combines green hydrogen and captured carbon to produce synthetic fuel, is in early development. “Neste is not only looking into these future technologies but also into new future raw materials such as novel vegetable oils and lignocellulosic residues,” Kueper adds.

The circular economy also plays a major role in Neste’s strategy. “SAF is already a good example of circularity, as we’re reusing carbon already in the atmosphere for its production via the raw materials used,” he says. Expanding feedstock availability will be crucial for ramping up production. “Independent reports like the World Economic Forum/Clean Skies of Tomorrow report estimate the global availability of waste and residue oils and fats to exceed 40 million tons by 2030. This will provide enough raw material to significantly ramp up SAF production,” he notes.

The road ahead for Neste and the aviation industry Neste’s sustainability roadmap is ambitious. “As far as SAF is concerned, the future milestones will be increasing our SAF production capability, first to 1.5 million tons per annum and then further to 2.2 million tons per annum,” says Kueper. “This will support mandates but also voluntary demand from businesses aiming to reduce emissions from their business travel and transport.”

Beyond SAF, Neste has set broader climate and sustainability targets. “We aim to support our customers in reducing their GHG emissions by 20 million tons per annum by 2030. We are well underway, having passed the 12 million tons mark,” he adds. “Additionally, we are working towards carbon-neutral production by 2035 and have set aspirational targets for climate, biodiversity, human rights, as well as our supply chain and raw materials.”

Neste’s push for sustainable aviation extends beyond just increasing SAF production—it’s about reshaping the entire industry’s approach to decarbonisation. With growing policy support, expanding airline partnerships, and ongoing advancements in alternative fuels, the company is driving the aviation sector closer to a low-carbon future. While challenges remain, Neste’s commitment to scaling SAF, broadening feedstock availability, and pioneering new technologies positions it as a key player in transforming aviation for generations to come.

Air India has lobbied the Indian government, saying the industry was already facing ""immense financial pressure"" in an April 15 letter.

The Adani Group’s Mumbai International Airport has changed its payment policy, requiring airlines to provide cash deposits instead of traditional bank guarantees to cover fees. The move has triggered opposition from major carriers IndiGo and Air India, documents reviewed by Reuters reveal.

The airport in India's financial capital of Mumbai, run by the Adani Group, has triggered a lobbying effort by top carriers IndiGo and Air India after it changed payment rules, citing financial needs and a risk of airline defaults, documents show.

The airport is one of India's busiest at a time when dozens are being added in one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets. It is the biggest of seven managed by a group led by billionaire Gautam Adani.

Confidential letters seen by Reuters show the intense pushback to the change, which seeks a compulsory cash deposit in a bank as security against charges such as landing and parking fees, instead of a long-standing practice of bank guarantees.

""None of these airlines normally pay on time ... we want to align our cash flow with the airlines' cash flow,"" said Arun Bansal, the chief executive of Adani Airport Holdings, which has a stake of 74% in the airport.

""They have taken advantage of our niceness,"" he added, referring to resistance to the new payment system from IndiGo and Air India since the change eight months ago in October.

Live Events

Airlines often delay payments beyond a due date at month-end but the airport has to pay authorities earlier, creating working capital challenges that can be resolved by using the security deposit when needed, Bansal said.

IndiGo and Air India, which together have a share of 91% of the market in India, did not respond to queries from Reuters.

A source with direct knowledge of the matter said the new policy would require the two airlines to make deposits of about 2 billion rupees ($23 million), taken together.

For Air India, owned by the Tata Group conglomerate, such payments could strain its finances after racking up losses of $521 million last year, in addition to monthly costs of $50 million after Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian airlines.

The Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), which serviced 53 million passengers last year, also faces financial challenges, after posting losses of $71.11 million on revenues of $461 million last year, disclosures show.

In a December 31 letter to an airlines body, the airport justified the change by pointing out its ""deteriorating financial position"" and ""significant debt obligations"".

""The deposits will help MIAL's financial stability and credit rating,"" it added.

DEFAULT RISK, AIR INDIA PUSH

The change also aimed to protect the airport from risks such as an airline going bankrupt, as carriers Jet Airways, Go First and Kingfisher Airlines have done in the last few years, Bansal said.

The Mumbai airport has the right to cancel the slots of airlines that do not follow the new policy, but does not intend to do so in the interest of passengers, he added.

The International Air Transport Association, representing both Air India and IndiGo, wrote to India's civil aviation ministry in December, calling the change a bid to use airline deposits to fund the airport's need for working capital.

India's civil aviation ministry did not respond to Reuters' queries. The government has a stake of 26% in the Mumbai airport.

In a letter on April 2, the Federation of Indian Airlines told the airport it disagreed with the contention that airline payments were not timely.

Air India has lobbied the Indian government, saying the industry was already facing ""immense financial pressure"" in an April 15 letter.

""It is highly likely that other airports across the country could adopt similar measures, leading to widespread financial strain,"" Air India said in the letter, seen by Reuters.

US tariff ruling could revive biofuel feedstock trade

US tariff ruling could revive biofuel feedstock trade

New York, 29 May (Argus) — A sweeping court ruling Wednesday against President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs could make foreign biofuel feedstock imports, which have wavered this year, more attractive. A three-judge panel on the US Court of International Trade struck down tariffs Trump set under a little-used economic emergency law, including bilateral tariffs on China, ""reciprocal"" tariffs on nearly every country, and levies on some Canadian and Mexican products to combat drug trafficking. The tariffs upended global trade flows, including by making recently fast-rising inputs for renewable diesel production like Chinese used cooking oil and Brazilian beef tallow more expensive. The trade court gave the government ten days to comply, though the Trump administration has asked for a pause on the ruling and pledged to appeal. Tariffs enacted under other laws, including sectoral tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, would remain intact. Trump could also still eye different authorities to revive his broader tariffs, which he sees as a crucial negotiating tool to counter what he has called unfair trade practices abroad. But the court's decision, if it holds, would still be a significant barrier to Trump's efforts to rewire global trade. The US could even be required to offer refunds of emergency tariffs that have already been paid. US levies on Chinese products imposed under the emergency law at one point reached 145pc, raising fears of a protracted trade war and global economic slowdown. Fewer options for foreign biofuel feedstocks because of tariffs also helped increase the price of domestic alternatives like US soybean oil, where futures were down 2pc in early trading Thursday, and compounded the pain for refiners struggling with major changes to biofuel tax credits. Biomass-based diesel production in the US has been down sharply this year because of all the policy shifts. Formerly fast-rising flow Before this year, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers along the US Gulf and west coasts were expanding capacity and increasingly looking abroad for inputs. Waste feedstocks like used cooking oil and beef tallow are considered lower-carbon feedstocks than crops and thus generally fetch larger government subsidies — even if sourced from abroad. The US imported nearly 5.4bn lbs of used cooking oil in 2024, a record-high and with more than half that total coming from China. But Trump's tariffs sharply reduced the incentive to import foreign feedstocks. Duties on Chinese products have varied significantly but were last at 30pc before the court ruling, adding to existing 15.5pc charges on Chinese used cooking oil. Reciprocal tariffs of 10pc on nearly every country added new costs to Australian and Brazilian tallow too. US import data is only available through March, before Trump imposed his most far-reaching tariffs as part of an April ""Liberation Day"" announcement . But global feedstock traders more recently have said that the tariffs — and the unpredictability of future policy — have made global inputs riskier. While some tariffs are eligible for duty drawbacks, creating options for biofuel producers targeting foreign markets, US imports of Chinese used cooking oil were down 27pc in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Other barriers remain Even if the court ruling holds, other policies could deter US biorefineries from relying too heavily on foreign feedstocks. For one, current government guidance around a new US clean fuel tax credit prevents refiners from claiming any subsidy for road fuels derived from foreign used cooking oil . Those rules also pin the carbon intensity of canola-based fuels as too high to claim any subsidy, choking off interest in Canadian canola oil imports that had been rising significantly before this year. And farm groups, worried that foreign feedstocks are hurting demand for US crops, are lobbying regulators and lawmakers for more severe limits. A party-line budget bill that passed the House this month would restrict clean fuel tax credit eligibility to fuels derived from North American feedstocks, a win for US oilseed crushers but a major blow to refiners reliant on foreign tallow. While that bill still needs Senate approval and changes would only kick in next year, the proposal is a clear signal from Republicans that refiners should start looking closer to home for renewable diesel inputs.

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by the Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport in April. ZRCC is one of the leading SAF manufacturers in Asia to independently develop bio-jet fuel technology. This batch of SAF was converted from used cooking oil using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. As part of the first batch of SAF exported by ZRCC to Hong Kong, it has been certified by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) that it can reduce the lifecycle carbon emissions by about 80%, compared with conventional jet fuel.

What is SAF?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel produced from waste materials or other non-fossil carbon sources. As demonstrated by this batch, SAF has the potential to significantly lower its lifecycle carbon emissions as compared with fossil fuels, helping address the environmental impact of passenger and cargo air transport. This agreement with Sinopec demonstrates the potential for further cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the SAF supply chain.

Adoption of SAF from the Chinese Mainland

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: ""Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.""

Last year, Cathay Pacific also adopted two batches of SAF from the Chinese Mainland, which were uplifted at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and London Heathrow Airport respectively.

By doing so, they can not only meet ambitious sustainability targets but also gain a competitive edge in the evolving aviation landscape.

The high stakes of SAF adoption

SAF offers unparalleled environmental benefits, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. However, its high production costs present a major barrier to widespread adoption. Today, many airlines pass these costs on to customers, and while the initial impact on customer willingness to pay (WTP) may be minimal, this dynamic is likely to shift.

As regulatory mandates for SAF increase and airlines voluntarily adopt higher levels of SAF to meet decarbonization targets, the financial strain could grow. This may ultimately affect airline profitability and competitiveness, making it imperative for airlines to develop robust strategies to mitigate costs and maximize returns.

Together, these mechanisms empower airlines to obtain SAF at economically viable prices, while instilling the confidence and risk-sharing needed to drive production growth and facilitate the opening of new facilities.

Monetization strategies: Turning sustainability into a revenue opportunity

Procurement alone is not enough to unlock the full potential of SAF. Airlines must also focus on monetizing sustainability by aligning their offerings with the unique motivations and WTP of different customer segments. This involves creating tailored solutions for:

Cargo customers: These customers are typically businesses with their own public sustainability targets, often taking on the roadmap outlined by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Given that the net cost of SAF is relatively low compared to the value of the transported products – especially since air cargo is often used for high value density goods - even using 100% SAF can be quite affordable. For example, considering typical values for goods transported by air, we estimate that 100% SAF uptake can be achieved with a

~0.5% price increase for a laptop,

~1% price increase for an item of clothing, or

~2% price increase for a bouquet of flowers

etc.

However, passing on the cost is insufficient: operators must effectively communicate this advantage to unlock demand. Airlines can implement strategies ranging from three-way agreements where they are compensated for SAF purchases through handling fees to full WTP approaches that include green offerings tailored to meet the specific needs of cargo customers (see “De-risking to generate value throughout the SAF supply chain” below for more details).

Corporate clients: Similar to cargo customers, corporate clients often have publicly announced sustainability targets, frequently with ambitious commitments for 2030-2040. In many industries – such as banking, professional services, legal, etc – flying can often represent a significant share of companies’ total emissions, meaning that any near-term meaningful action requires aviation decarbonization, generally through SAF. Roland Berger is itself a case-in-point as flying represents ~60% of our total annual CO2 emissions: to meet our ambitious SBTi targets, we follow a two-pronged approach: avoid air travel where possible, and abate remaining flight emissions through SAF procurement. By rethinking offer management, airlines can align with these customers’ decarbonization goals, creating compelling narratives that appeal to their sustainability objectives.

Leisure customers: Recent findings indicate that customers exhibit a notable willingness to pay when prompted; however, the conversion rates remain relatively low. This trend can be partially attributed to the absence of compelling offers that resonate with customers' perceptions of value. Through our comprehensive research, we have developed significant expertise in understanding what customers truly regard as valuable within the framework of sustainability. We are well-positioned to assist airlines in harnessing this knowledge to create customer-value-driven offerings, which can enhance customer satisfaction while mitigating the impact of regulatory challenges in the market.

Importantly, this approach does not solely apply to SAF, it also encompasses other sustainable goods and services as long as real action is being taken and can be proven accordingly.

De-risking to generate value throughout the SAF supply chain

Combining together procurement and monetization strategies is key: by aligning characteristics of SAF procured with SAF certificates sold (e.g., in carbon intensity, pathways/feedstocks, volumes, costing/pricing, contract duration and terms, logistical considerations, etc), airlines can align incentives and expectations through the SAF supply chain. There is indeed a continuum of structures for agreements that is possible here in the B2B space (with cargo and corporate customers):

From unlinked (not de-risked) deals,

to “back-to-back” deals where airlines contract separately but in close alignment with SAF suppliers and B2B customers,

to 3-way agreements involving the SAF supplier, airline and B2B customer,

to full special purpose vehicles dedicated to risk management, with equity investments from all parties involved.",https://www.rolandberger.com/img/og/Roland_Berger_25_2167_WEB_Unlocking_the_potential_of_aviation_sustainability_OG.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 10:56:08.813180

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by the Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport in April. ZRCC is one of the leading SAF manufacturers in Asia to independently develop bio-jet fuel technology. This batch of SAF was converted from used cooking oil using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. As part of the first batch of SAF exported by ZRCC to Hong Kong, it has been certified by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) that it can reduce the lifecycle carbon emissions by about 80%, compared with conventional jet fuel.

What is SAF?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel produced from waste materials or other non-fossil carbon sources. As demonstrated by this batch, SAF has the potential to significantly lower its lifecycle carbon emissions as compared with fossil fuels, helping address the environmental impact of passenger and cargo air transport. This agreement with Sinopec demonstrates the potential for further cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the SAF supply chain.

Adoption of SAF from the Chinese Mainland

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: ""Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.""

Last year, Cathay Pacific also adopted two batches of SAF from the Chinese Mainland, which were uplifted at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and London Heathrow Airport respectively.

Looking to the future

In recent years, the production and adoption of SAF has gained momentum across Asia. ​ Cathay Pacific is working closely with different partners with the aim to expand the use of SAF in Asia. In March 2025, Cathay Pacific reached an agreement with fuel supplier SK Energy, which will supply SAF to Cathay Pacific from 2025 to 2027 in South Korea.

To achieve the worldwide net-zero aviation goal by 2050, yearly output needs to hit 185 million tonnes of SAF.
Gupte stated that India, utilizing its diverse feedstock such as used cooking oil and agricultural waste, can generate 8–10 million tonnes each year.
“This means that India can actually provide over 5 per cent of the world’s SAF requirements… India can be an exporter of SAF.
This means India can help decarbonise the civil aviation industry,” Gupte said, adding that turning agricultural waste into SAF will be a tremendous opportunity.","A senior Boeing executive stated that India could become a net exporter of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as worldwide initiatives aim to cut carbon emissions in the aviation industry.

During the CII Annual Business Summit 2025 in New Delhi, Salil Gupte, President of Boeing India and South Asia, highlighted the plentiful supply of feedstock, like agricultural waste, that can be utilized for SAF production.

Aviation accounts for about 2–3 percent of worldwide carbon emissions, making SAF an essential approach to reducing them. Gupte remarked that India is set to incorporate 2,500 new civil aircraft in the coming 20 years, solidifying its status as one of the quickest expanding aviation markets. Indian airlines have placed orders for over 1,000 planes in the past few years.

Gupte noted that India’s modern aircraft fleet would support decarbonisation initiatives and proposed that the nation could spearhead the expansion of biofuel production for aviation. He stated the primary challenge would not be in aircraft or engineering technology but in securing an adequate and economical supply of SAF, which presently costs 2.5 to 3.5 times more than conventional Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).

The company, known for providing pipe services in the O&G sector, currently focuses on engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning (EPCC) for renewable energy projects. Now, it is considering becoming an asset owner in the biomass space, reports The Edge Malaysia.

Speaking after the company’s 25th annual general meeting, managing director and group CEO Giancarlo Maccagno said that the goal is to move past just building plants for clients. He explained that by securing long-term feedstock supply and energy offtake agreements — such as selling power to utility giant Tenaga Nasional — the company could build a more stable and recurring revenue stream.

Maccagno described the move as a natural progression for Wasco, and one that fits well with its current renewable energy operations. At present, the company is involved in full EPCC projects for biomass facilities, including steam turbine supply, mainly serving the palm oil industry. In both Malaysia and Indonesia, empty fruit bunches (EFB) from palm oil mills present a largely untapped source of biomass energy.

Despite the opportunity, Maccagno stressed that Wasco will only commit to projects once it has secured both supply and demand. “The risk is if either the feedstock provider pulls out or the energy buyer fails to follow through. We won’t proceed unless all key aspects are in place,” he said. He added that each plant could cost between RM30 million and RM40 million.

Wasco is not setting a deadline for its first biomass investment, preferring to wait for the right conditions. “There’s no urgency. Our existing business is performing well. But this strategy offers a promising future, as it can reduce the ups and downs of project-based income,” Maccagno noted.

This move aligns with Malaysia’s broader energy policy, which is increasingly supporting renewable sources like biomass and small hydro, in addition to solar power.

LanzaTech's leadership overhaul in 2025 signals a sharp pivot toward operational discipline. The promotion of Sushmita Koyanagi to CFO—replacing interim CFO Justin Pugh—brings critical expertise. Koyanagi's deep financial reporting experience and track record in team leadership could be pivotal as LanzaTech navigates its ambitious growth plans. Meanwhile, Amanda Fuisz stepping into the interim General Counsel role stabilizes governance amid a period of rapid expansion.

But the most significant move? The retirement of Gary Rieschel, a longtime board member and champion of LanzaTech's circular carbon economy vision. While his departure marks the end of an era, it also clears space for a board more focused on execution rather than vision-building—a necessity as the company shifts from R&D to commercialization.

Cost-Cutting: A $30 Million Gamble on Focus and Scale

LanzaTech's cost optimization initiatives are no minor tweak. The planned $30 million in annual operating expense reductions—achieved through workforce consolidation (10–15% globally) and strategic reallocation—aims to free capital for high-impact projects. But this isn't just about trimming fat. By spinning off its LanzaX synthetic biology platform and exploring partnerships for its LanzaTech Nutritional Protein (LNP) division, LanzaTech is doubling down on its core competency: Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology for SAF production.

This focus is strategic. The company's LanzaJet subsidiary is already advancing 30-million-gallon-per-year SAF facilities in the U.K. and EU, leveraging waste carbon and biomass. Partnerships with BioD in Colombia, Eramet in Norway, and Air New Zealand in New Zealand further cement its global footprint. By sidelining less profitable ventures, LanzaTech is channeling resources into projects with clear scalability and regulatory tailwinds.

The SAF Market: A Gold Rush with Clear Winners

The SAF market is projected to grow at a 22% CAGR through 2030, driven by mandates like the U.S. Clean Air Act and the EU's ReFuelEU initiative. LanzaTech's ATJ technology is a standout, converting ethanol from industrial emissions and agricultural waste into SAF—a process that slashes lifecycle emissions by up to 70% compared to fossil fuels.

Regulatory support is stacking up, too. The Expanding Clean Fuel Production Act in the U.S. could extend tax credits critical to SAF's competitiveness, while LanzaTech's DOE-backed CO2-to-ethylene projects add diversification. Yet the path isn't without hurdles: project delays, capital constraints, and competition from traditional oil giants.

Why This Matters for Investors

LanzaTech's restructuring isn't just about cutting costs—it's about prioritizing profitability in a winner-takes-all market. By streamlining operations, securing partnerships, and focusing on its proprietary technology, the company is positioning itself to capitalize on SAF's explosive growth. The $30 million in savings alone could fund critical expansions, while spinning off LanzaX could unlock synergies for both entities.

The risks? Yes. The SAF market remains nascent, and execution is far from guaranteed. But with $1 billion in secured project funding, a growing pipeline of partnerships, and leadership now laser-focused on commercialization, LanzaTech is emerging as a leader in a sector that's primed to boom.

Final Take: A Buy Signal for the Bold

LanzaTech's moves are risky but purposeful. For investors willing to bet on a company that's aggressively pivoting from innovator to industry player, the rewards could be substantial. The SAF market is still in its infancy, and those that scale first stand to command premium valuations.

The verdict? LanzaTech's restructuring isn't just about survival—it's about dominance. With the right execution, this could be the moment the company transitions from a promising idea to a profit-driven titan. For investors ready to back a carbon-negative future, the time to act is now.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1ac25ea756d38002.png,N,,2025-05-30 09:56:09.174974

That’s why we’re proud to partner with General Index to introduce a new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies.","General Index (GX) and ATOBA Energy are excited to announce their strategic partnership, bringing a brand-new vision of how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) benchmarks are built. SAF indexes need to be tailored to the unique cost profiles of diverse production technologies, delivering the right information required to scale the SAF industry for aviation goal of net zero by 2050.

For more than half a century, the aviation industry has relied on traditional price reporting services to manage exposure to price risks in the fossil jet fuel market. But the SAF revolution demands a new approach. Unlike traditional fuels, SAF can be produced from a wide variety of certified technologies, each with distinct feedstocks, costs, CO2 reduction capabilities and production scalability – and, at the end, producing similar drop-in aviation fuels. A one-size-fits-all SAF index isn’t fungible in this complex emerging market.

ATOBA recognizes that the immediate hurdle to overcome is unlocking investment and building confidence in bankable long-term offtake agreements for new production facilities. A key enabler to overcoming this challenge is bringing transparency and a level playing field to the industry through the creation of new SAF price indexes, developed by General Index. Each index will be designed to reflect the unique cost profile of the diverse SAF technologies and aggregated to create a benchmark that aligns with regulatory frameworks, regional nuances and market needs.

Neil Bradford, CEO and founder, General Index, said, “Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets. We’re already a benchmark partner to the European Commission for the official 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. Now, by partnering with ATOBA Energy, we’re helping to build the foundational infrastructure needed to attract investment, support offtake agreements, and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to net zero.”

Arnaud Namer, CEO & co-founder ATOBA Energy, said, “Unlocking investment in sustainable aviation fuel starts with transparency, market confidence, and trusted pricing tools. That’s why we’re proud to partner with General Index to introduce a new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies. These benchmarks are critical to ensuring SAF is competitively priced for airlines—an advantage we deliver thanks to our diversified portfolio of best-in-class SAF producers and long-term offtake aggregation strategy.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Atoba_General_Index_945fca3b32.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 02:57:20.838606

Author: Anna Simet Director of Content & Senior Editor Biodiesel Magazine","It seems that every day this magazine is in production, something changes policywise. Just this week, we’ve seen lots of movement with the release of President Trump’s proposed “big, beautiful bill” and its potential 45Z implications, as well as the U.S. EPA’s delivery of two Renewable Fuel Standard rulemakings to the White House Office of Management and Budget. One of those rulings for the 2026 renewable volume obligations and purportedly “also contains several regulatory changes to the RFS program intended to improve the program’s implementation.”

I haven’t yet come across any speculation as to what these changes are, but rumors allege that the renewable volume obligation proposal for biomass-based diesel will not be set at the industry’s ask of 5.25 billion gallons, but short of that. It’s expected we’ll know in late May or early June, so the waiting game continues.

In any case, I’ve had to make some updates to feature article “Ready to Bounce Back” on page 14, and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if by the time this magazine hits desks, even more has changed. The policy pieces that the industry has been waiting for are long overdue, so these movements are very welcome. My main interview for this article was with Grant Kimberley of the Iowa Biodiesel Board and Iowa Soybean Association. Iowa has the most biodiesel plants of all the states at 10, with a collective production capacity at 416 MMgy. In the article, he discusses the impact that policy inaction has had on Iowa’s biodiesel industry, and what is needed overall to get back to a healthy state. In particular, he emphasizes the critical impact of strong RVOs. “All indications from experts and marketplace are that a strong RVO would reset the RFS in a very positive way, strengthen RIN prices and be a huge boom to the marketplace,” Kimberley says.

Changing gears a bit, our page-21 feature shifts the focus to Canada. In “Fueling Canadian Decarbonization,” associate editor Katie Schroeder takes a deep dive into the Canadian biofuel sector—what it looks like and where it’s headed, the policy and incentives available (and needed) to help with the buildout, and how the United States’ biofuel policy has impacted development there.

Finally, we’re about three weeks out from the International Fuel Ethanol Workshop being held in Omaha, Nebraska, June 10-12. Being held in conjunction with that is the Sustainable Fuels Summit, which is focused solely on biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. It’s great timing to connect with stakeholders and learn about the impacts impending policy could or will have on the industry, among many other things.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) – An unpredictable trade war and daunting environmental targets are on the agenda for global airline bosses at an annual summit in India, as the industry’s outlook is clouded by concerns that geopolitical uncertainty will dampen travel demand and raise costs.

More people are flying than ever before after a full post-pandemic passenger market recovery, but airlines globally are facing rising cost pressures, extended plane delivery delays, lingering supply chain bottlenecks and falling airfares.

On top of this, President Donald Trump’s evolving trade war has upended the global aerospace industry’s decades-old tariff-free status and added a new layer of volatility and risk.

While carriers in Europe and Asia report strong demand for flying, the U.S. airline sector has been hit by a recent slump in travel demand, with carriers struggling to forecast passenger behaviour and operational costs.

The influential International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents more than 300 airlines and over 80% of global air traffic, will hold its annual three-day meeting from Sunday in New Delhi.

The summit, hosted by India’s largest carrier IndiGo, comes as the world’s third-largest air passenger market rapidly expands its aviation industry, and as air travel growth in Asia is expected to outstrip Europe and North America for the next few decades.

India’s recent hostilities with neighbour Pakistan, which is causing Indian airlines to take large, expensive detours around Pakistani airspace, highlights how conflict zones are an increasing burden on airline operations and profitability.

IATA said in February that accidents and incidents related to conflict zones are a top concern for aviation safety requiring urgent global coordination.

Aviation safety will also be in focus after a spate of air accidents in Kazakhstan, South Korea and North America over the past six months, and rising concerns about air traffic control systems in the United States.

NET-ZERO DOUBTS

IATA has increasingly been warning that airlines will not meet their sustainability goals, and that it is not clear how the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and new technologies will be financed.

Airlines agreed in 2021 to target net-zero emissions in 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to SAF, which is made from waste oil and biomass and costs more than conventional jet fuel.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh has in recent weeks said the industry will need to re-evaluate the commitment.

Airlines are being expected to bear the cost of the more expensive fuel and are not getting the support they need from SAF manufacturers, Walsh has said. Delays by Airbus and Boeing in delivering new, more fuel-efficient aircraft are also causing headaches for airlines.

IATA said 1 million metric tons of SAF was produced globally in 2024, below forecasts of 1.5 million tons, and described production as disappointingly slow.

“Demand for SAF continues to outstrip supply, and costs remain prohibitively high. Regulatory frameworks to encourage SAF production are still underdeveloped, inconsistent, or insufficient,” said Subhas Menon, the director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.

The study highlights that the industry could generate 58 million jobs this year, to reach the number of more than 330 million jobs, that is, only 1% below pre-pandemic levels and 21.5 % more than in 2020.

With these data in hand, the focus can begin to be placed on other urgent issues to be resolved, such as caring for the environment. It is clear that without a healthy planet, there is no tourism. Climate change causes considerable and often irreparable damage.

Commercial aviation has taken a new big step after the Toulouse Aviation Summit, held under the auspices of the French Presidency of the European Union, the event concluded with a new Declaration calling on all countries to take action to achieve a decarbonized aviation sector by 2050.

The Declaration was signed by 42 States, including the 27 member countries of the European Union, as well as Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Morocco and Georgia. It was also adopted by 146 industry stakeholder groups that participated in the event, including the top five European aviation associations represented through Destination 2050.

The signatories to the Declaration called on all public and private stakeholders to work together in preparation for the 41st ICAO Assembly later this year, where countries are expected to adopt a new global long-term goal applicable to the reduction/elimination of emissions from international flights.

MarketsandMarkets' new report ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market by Fuel Type"" estimates that in 2021 it could reach $219 million and is expected to reach $15,716 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 60.8% over the period forecast. The growing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the increase in passenger air traffic and the high fuel efficiency of biofuels are some of the key factors driving the market for sustainable aviation fuel. Government initiatives, such as tax reductions on the use of green and clean aviation fuels, will drive the growth of sustainable aviation fuel in the future.

By type, the sustainable aviation fuel market has been segmented into biofuel, hydrogen fuel, and power-to-liquid. The biofuels segment is estimated to account for the largest share during the forecast period. Reaching the GHG emission reduction targets proposed by the aviation industry and by organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will require a significant increase in the production and consumption of biofuels, thus boosting the market. In addition, the ability to incorporate unchanged aircraft infrastructure drives demand for biofuels.

Based on biofuel manufacturing technology, the Hydroprocessed Fatty Acid Esters and Fatty Acids – Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) segment is projected to lead the sustainable aviation fuel market during the forecast period.

There have been several initiatives taken by airlines to test and implement blended fueling in their aircraft fleet. For example, in June 2019, United Airlines took a flight from Chicago O'Hare to Los Angeles, powered by a 30% blend of sustainable aviation fuel produced by World Energy. The blended fuel met the same fuel specifications as Jet A with added environmental benefits.

Boeing determined to make the leap

The manufacturer announced a supply agreement for two million gallons (7.5 million liters) of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with EPIC Fuels to power its commercial aircraft operations in the state of Washington and South Carolina through 2022. The deal is the largest SAF acquisition announced by an aircraft manufacturer and further demonstrates Boeing's commitment to decarbonizing aviation.

Reporting from San Francisco

US green fuel company HIF Global has a big vision for Texas's Matagorda County: a $7bn (£5.2bn) commercial scale e-methanol factory to supply the world market.

The plant, which it claims would be the largest to date anywhere, would make e-methanol from captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen produced on site using renewable energy.

Its construction would create thousands of jobs and the product would power ships and planes in a far cleaner way.

But the company has yet to make its final investment decision. It is waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production.

The fate of the subsidies is part of a sweeping budget bill currently under consideration by the Senate.

A version of the legislation passed by the lower house cuts the hydrogen tax credit, amongst others, and scales back more.

The clean hydrogen tax credit would help reduce the cost of the American technology going into the facility, and aide in competing with Chinese e-methanol producers, says Lee Beck, HIF Global's senior vice president for global policy and commercial strategy.

""The goal is not to be dependent on tax credits over the long run, but to get the project started.""

Ms Beck can't say yet what the outcome for the Matagorda facility will be if the tax credit is ultimately killed, except that it will make things hard – and the US isn't the only location the company operates in.

The Trump administration has been particularly hostile to green energy.

Amongst the President's actions since taking office in January include initiating the US's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and temporarily suspending renewable energy projects on federal lands (he has a particular disdain for wind power).

Trump has also directed agencies to pause Green New Deal funds, which he regularly calls ""Green New Scam"" funds: grants and loans being made under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden's presidency in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

Those grants and loans, together with the clean energy tax credits that are also part of the IRA, have been funnelling billions of new federal and private dollars into developing clean energy.

""It is tumultuous time,"" says Adie Tomer, of the Brookings Institution, a think tank. ""We are doing the exact opposite of our developed world peers.""

Court battles are ongoing over the President's order to pause green funding, which might ultimately end up in the Supreme Court. In the meantime, agencies are conducting their own reviews and making their own decisions.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which represents companies involved in carbon capture and storage, laments the lack of clarity from the administration.

Members, she explains, have won project funding under the IIJA – including, for example, to build direct air capture facilities. But while projects generally have been able to access funds already awarded to earlier phases, it is unclear if they will be able to progress to additional phases where additional funds are supposed to be made available.

""It is causing uncertainty, which is really bad for project deployment,"" says Ms Stolark. ""If you endanger the success of these first-of-a-kind projects it just takes the wind out of the sails of the whole [carbon management] industry long term.""

Meanwhile, the fate of the IRA, which the Congress has the power to amend or repeal along with the IIJA, is being decided, in part, by the budget bill, which aims to permanently extend President Trump's first term tax cuts by making savings elsewhere.

What exactly will remain of the Federal green energy agenda when both the House and Senate agree a compromise version remains to be seen.

It seems likely the IRA's tax credits, which are generally scheduled to expire at the end of 2032, though some extend beyond that date, will take a heavy hit, even if the IRA dodges the bullet of outright repeal.

Also marked for termination include the tax credits for consumers buying EVs and making their homes more efficient.

Many others, such as those for producing clean electricity and manufacturing clean energy components like wind turbine parts, solar panels and batteries, would be phased out earlier or made harder and less worthwhile to secure.

That many of the projects set to benefit from the tax credits are in Republican areas seems to have had little sway in the House, notes Ashur Nissan of policy advice firm Kaya Partners.

But critics say that the Biden green energy initiatives are too expensive.

The IRA's energy tax credits are ""multiple times"" larger than initial estimates, and expose American taxpayers to ""potentially unlimited liability"" noted a recent report from the libertarian Cato Institute advocating their full repeal.

Meanwhile, actual clean energy investment in the US including from both government and private sources (the far larger share) dropped 3.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to $67.3bn, a second quarterly decline, according to new figures released by the Clean Investment Monitor.

""Momentum is sagging a bit which is a little concerning,"" says Hannah Hess of the Rhodium Group research firm, which partners with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce it. She attributes the trend to a mix of high inflation, high interest rates, global supply chain issues and uncertainty in the policy environment created by the new administration.

There was also, she observes, a record number of clean energy manufacturing projects cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 – six projects mostly in batteries and representing $6.9bn in investment– though it is difficult to say to what extent the new administration was a driver.

More worrying to Ms Hess is the decline since the last quarter in announcements for some types of new projects, which she believes can be ""more strongly"" attributed to the policy situation, with companies lacking confidence there will be demand for the clean products their projects would produce.

Tariffs, which will increase factory construction costs if components need to be imported, are an extra factor that may negatively influence project decisions going forward, notes Anthony DeOrsey of the Cleantech Group research and consulting firm.

Investment aside, companies are also making shifts in how they market their products.

The homepage of LanzaJet – which produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ethanol – used to emphasise how scaling SAF could ""meet the urgent moment of climate change"". It now focusses on its potential to ""harness the energy of locally produced feedstocks"".

SAF has never been about just one thing, notes CEO Jimmy Samartzis. Tailoring messaging to be ""relevant to the stakeholders we are engaging with"" makes sense.

The company is current waiting on a $3m grant it was awarded by the Federal Aviation Authority last August as part of a nearly $300m program designed to help aviation transition to SAF and which was funded under the IRA.

""It is approved funding, but it is stuck at this point,"" says Mr Samartzis.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2b61/live/52a048b0-3bb9-11f0-a20d-1b53273f2a3b.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 19:56:47.190036

The pump in Urbandale is now the second station in the country with the high blend of biodiesel fuel, but the first station with an above-ground pump.
Karl Thomas with Optimus Technologies, the company that helped to outfit the PepsiCo trucks to use the fuel, said decarbonizing the industry requires collaboration.
Biodiesel supports the soybean industry Biodiesel in Iowa is made primarily from soybean oil, which means biodiesel demand is directly linked with soybean demand.
According to 2024 figures from the Iowa Biodiesel Board, the industry added $2.2 billion in total sales and $123 million in labor income to the state’s economy.","URBANDALE— The Des Moines region is now home to the first above-ground B99 fueling pump, an action that was celebrated Thursday morning by leaders in the biofuels, trucking and soybean industries.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the new pump, which allows certain semi trucks to fill up with a 99% biodiesel blended fuel, shows a completion of the ag supply chain, from the field to the biofuel refineries and now into a truck.

“Every time I see this, or think of an infrastructure investment, I just know that that’s more demand pulling through, and what that ultimately means is more demand for the things that we grow,” Naig said. “It adds value every single step throughout the chain.”

The pump is located at a Pilot fuel station in Urbandale, near the intersection of Douglas Avenue and Interstate 35, and for now will be used primarily by PepsiCo trucks which are equipped to utilize the fuel.

Eric Fobes, head of renewables for Pilot, said the new biodiesel pump is an adherence to the company’s commitment to “shaping the future of energy.”

“To me and our customers, it’s important that we are offering decarbonized solutions,” Fobes said. “This is one of those offers.”

The trucking company launched the first B99 pump at a travel center in Decatur, Illinois in March. The pump in Urbandale is now the second station in the country with the high blend of biodiesel fuel, but the first station with an above-ground pump. The company has plans to open another pump in Texas this summer.

PepsiCo has committed local trucks to using the biodiesel from the station, which is several minutes away from the beverage and snack company’s Urbandale plant.

Sarah Towles, senior director of government affairs for PepsiCo, said the partnership with Pilot represents “real scalable solutions” for long haul transportation. Towles said PepsiCo has about 20 trucks prepared to use the station currently, but plans to equip other trucks in the future.

Karl Thomas with Optimus Technologies, the company that helped to outfit the PepsiCo trucks to use the fuel, said decarbonizing the industry requires collaboration.

“Together, we’re building an ecosystem for sustainable trucking by introducing a new fuel to the commercial trucking market in the U.S.” Thomsas said.

Thomas said Optimus developed a vector system in the trucks which keeps the biodiesel from gelling during colder months. Thomas said this technology, and equipping long haul trucks to run on higher blends of biodiesel is “one of the lowest cost technologies to decarbonize heavy duty trucking.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates 23% of transportation related carbon dioxide emissions came from medium and heavy-duty trucking. The agency encourages the industry to transition to lower emission fuels, like biofuels, hydrogen or compressed natural gas to lower emissions.

Biodiesel supports the soybean industry

Biodiesel in Iowa is made primarily from soybean oil, which means biodiesel demand is directly linked with soybean demand.

Dave Walton, a director for both Iowa Soybean Association and Iowa Biodiesel Board, said the pump represents, “real on the ground, progress in Americans’ transition to cleaner fuels.”

“By fueling their Des Moines based fleet at this B99 pump, PepsiCo is showing that high blends of biodiesel aren’t just a future concept, they’re here and now, and working,” Walton said.

Walton said biodiesel is critical to the farm economy and that the industry adds a 13% value to each bushel of soybeans produced by Iowa farmers.

According to 2024 figures from the Iowa Biodiesel Board, the industry added $2.2 billion in total sales and $123 million in labor income to the state’s economy.

“Projects like today’s expands consumer access to affordable domestic homegrown fuels that increase good paying jobs for our hardworking Americans,” Walton said.

Walton also commended Iowa lawmakers, specifically Sen. Annette Sweeney, R-Iowa Falls, Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale and Rep. Larry McBurney, D-Urbandale who were in attendance, for supporting state incentives on biodiesel blends.

Calls for federal support

While the industry a high performing year, with a total of 350 million gallons of biodiesel produced in 2024, Walton said several plants in the state are idle due to the uncertainty of federal tax credits.

Walton said he also hopes EPA will approve 5.25 billion gallons of biodiesel for the upcoming Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS. This standard sets the minimum amount of renewable fuels required to be blended, annually, into diesel and gasoline. According to EPA, the 2025 requirement for biodiesel was 3.35 billion gallons.

Naig echoed the call for “strong” Renewable Volume Obligations under RFS and said producers also need clear guidance on tax policy.

Renewable fuel producers in Iowa have been advocating for, and waiting on, definitive guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury on the 45z tax credit, which would incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel and other plant-based fuels.

A bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines, could also impact the biofuels industry’s ability to use these credits, which is a major reason why the industry has opposed the legislation, which is currently sitting on Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk.

Naig said he has heard from folks on both sides of the issue, but the decision on the bill rests with Reynolds and her council.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8869-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:56:34.116026

The May 21 flight and landing at Edwards AFB, Calif., came about five months later than the Atlanta-based company had hoped. The main goal of the company’s test campaign is to validate high-speed takeoff and landing.

The company said the successful test campaign and flight of the Mk 1 “validated design and performance models, including aerodynamics, stability and control. Testing also validated performance of vehicle subsystems including propulsion, fuel systems, hydraulics, power, thermal management, avionics, flight software, telemetry, flight termination, and command and control.”

The Mk 1 is powered by the GE Aerospace J85 engine. The Mk 2 will be powered by the RTX Pratt & Whitney F100-229 turbofan engines used on the Air Force’s F-15 and F-16 fighters. The F100 will feature a precooler to give the engine more speed, a feature of the startup’s future Chimera engine this is a hybrid of a turbojet for takeoff to get an aircraft to supersonic speeds, and a ramjet that will allow an aircraft to reach hypersonic speeds.

A successful flight is also seen as important to demonstrate the business perspective for investors and customers.

Design of the Mk 1 began in the fourth quarter of 2023.

But the potential could be “very significant"" if stepped-up to commercial levels, said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger, speaking to Canada’s National Observer.
These sustainable aviation fuel projects are clearly addressing a need articulated by government and industry,"" said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger.
SAFs can produce 80 per cent lower emissions than conventional jet kerosene.
This could reduce emissions by 15-20 per cent for aircraft departures from Canada.","Aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing has invested almost $17.5 million with a trio of Canadian sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pioneers aiming to accelerate development of technologies that could help convert the country’s lumber waste and CO2 emissions into low-carbon jet fuels.

Boeing will invest $10 million in a joint venture between Quebec companies Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables to advance a project that will turn sawmill by-products into biocrude for SAF, and $7.5 million in a pilot plant being built in BC by Dimensional Energy that can capture CO2 directly from industrial facility emissions and transforms it into green synthetic fuel.

The volumes of SAF produced by the pilot projects will be relatively small: a total of 50 million gallons a year compared to the almost 100,000 million gallons currently burned annually by passenger airlines, according to Statista, a data portal. But the potential could be “very significant"" if stepped-up to commercial levels, said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger, speaking to Canada’s National Observer.

Chris Lohman, Boeing Canada’s head of sustainability, added: “These two projects were selected because of the enormous latent energy sources in Canada that they have the potential to unlock: sawmill waste residue that in years gone by went into the pulp and paper industry but is now looking for new uses and end-products, and CO2 that comes from heavy-emitting industry.”

“We are a global company and committed to supporting Canada’s objective of being net-zero by 2050. These sustainable aviation fuel projects are clearly addressing a need articulated by government and industry,"" said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger.

Canada Transport’s climate action plan targets 10 per cent of aviation fuel being replaced by SAF by 2030 to decarbonize a sector that globally accounts for over two per cent of all CO2 emissions, according to the Air Transport Action Group, a lobbyist. SAFs can produce 80 per cent lower emissions than conventional jet kerosene.

“SAF is a very complicated nut to crack and each concept has its own unique challenges so it is important Boeing support companies to move these technologies down the field,” said Lohman.

SAFs — which can be generated from a range of industrial and commercial feedstocks as well as captured carbon — have the potential to make up 65 per cent of the emissions reduction needed by the aviation sector to reach net-zero in 2050, according to figures from the International Air Transport Association, an industry trade body.

Technology ‘valley of death’

The SAF generated by the two projects backed by Boeing will first be trialled in 16 P-8A Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance military aircraft ordered from Boeing by the Canadian government in November 2023, but Meinzinger said it was targeting future use in commercial airliners.

“These projects are aimed at the broadest possible market. We want to help these technologies traverse the ‘valley of death’ [between innovative concepts to commercial production] and get over the key engineering challenges so that they can get to economic scale,” he said.

Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables’ project, called Projet Avance, points to Canada’s “unique opportunity” with SAF, said Lohman, given the “vast, ready-made biomass resource” that can be found in the forested regions across the country “not just to create a useful low-carbon fuel for use in Canada but also one that is exportable.”

The Dimension Energy project, which will capture CO2 straight off a flue stack at a Lafarge cement facility in Richmond, BC, he added, is “highly replicable anywhere you have greenhouse gases being generated by heavy industry.”

The Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels — made up of 60 airlines operating in the country — laid out a roadmap in 2023 aiming to have 265 million gallons of SAF being produced domestically by 2030 and by 2035 enough to meet 25 per cent of total demand. This could reduce emissions by 15-20 per cent for aircraft departures from Canada.

Meinzinger believes Canada is “not going to get anywhere” in its energy transition without moving away from its historical focus on energy-intensive fossil fuel-based products and services: “The world is energy-hungry but, in the long term, also sustainability-hungry.”

Lohman added that Canada “needs to make more of what we need here with what we’ve got,” adding that SAF is “at the intersection of this reality.”

SAF technologies, he said, can “disentangle” Canada from its dependence on petroleum for jet fuel by using biomass and CO2 to build more sustainable industries.

“This investment in new industries will bring enormous rewards if it bridges the gap between innovative technology and commercial products – jobs, economic development, expanded export markets,” he said.",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/05/29/dimension_energy_saf_2.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 17:56:50.646335

,,2025-05-29 19:32:15+00:00,Canary Media,"A new, low-carbon way to make chemicals, without the big, dirty factories - Canary Media",Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/a-new-low-carbon-way-to-make-chemicals-without-the-big-dirty-factories,"Chemical plants consume lots of fossil fuels, both to power the high-temperature, high-pressure processes involved and often as a feedstock for the chemicals produced.
“The way we make cars, the way we make TVs, the way we make semiconductor chips should be the same way we make chemicals plants,” Brix said.
Much of the world’s supply of the chemicals is from factories that are part of China’s expanding coal-fed chemicals industry.
But OCOchem doesn’t need a ​“green premium” for its low-carbon bona fides, Brix said.
That causes cost problems and safety problems,” Xu said, especially for chemicals being transported by truck or train.","The global chemicals industry is big, and it’s dirty. Chemical plants consume lots of fossil fuels, both to power the high-temperature, high-pressure processes involved and often as a feedstock for the chemicals produced. And to maximize production, those plants are typically built to be as large as possible.

Todd Brix, CEO of startup OCOchem, has a different vision for how to build a modern chemicals industry: Manufacture lots of small machines that are powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels to do the work.

“The way we make cars, the way we make TVs, the way we make semiconductor chips should be the same way we make chemicals plants,” Brix said.

Last week, the company’s pilot plant in Richland, Washington, started producing a class of chemicals known as formates, used in everything from deicing airplanes to preserving animal feed. But instead of the conventional hot, dirty method of combining methanol with carbon monoxide derived from fossil fuels, OCOchem makes formate with just water and carbon dioxide inside four 1.5-meter electrolytic modules.

OCOchem fills those modules with water and carbon dioxide and then zaps the solution with electricity, causing an electrochemical reaction that yields formic acid, a combination of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. Chemically speaking, it’s ​“one of the simplest molecules you can imagine,” Brix said — basically, ​“CO2 with two hydrogen atoms attached to it.”

The $5 million project can make up to 60 tons of formic acid per year. That’s not a lot, compared with the roughly 1 million tons per year of formates produced globally. But being able to deliver an industrial chemical cost-effectively in such small amounts is one of the selling points, Brix explained.

“Once you want to scale out and make more formate, you just make more modules. That’s the power of economies of scale of mass production,” he said. ​“We can rapidly scale that technology out, and make a lot of little chemical plants, and stack them together.”

Factory-built modular devices are being tried out across various industries, from fertilizer to steel — and they are even being considered for nuclear power. It’s already a winning pathway in the renewable energy sector, where mass-produced solar panels and lithium-ion battery cells have seen costs drop steeply as production volumes increase and manufacturers consistently improve each new generation of products.

“What the solar industry does is mass-produce solar panels — and what we are trying to do is mass-produce chemical plants,” Brix said. ​“That allows you to dramatically lower the costs over time.”

Tiny chemicals-production cells are a bit more complicated than solar panels, of course. But OCOchem’s electrolytic cells aren’t taking on anything as dangerous as nuclear fission. Brix described the process as akin to ​“artificial photosynthesis.” Plants use water, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the energy from sunlight. OCOchem cells, which operate at ambient temperatures and pressures, electrify water and carbon dioxide and emit only formic acid, which is corrosive but not flammable or explosive.

Using electrolysis to produce formate is far from a unique idea, said Brix, who worked at Chevron, Intel, and Microsoft before founding OCOchem in 2020. In fact, researchers have been trying to do it for decades. But the efforts he’s aware of have struggled to expand cells to a size that can support commercially viable volumes.

“We started with a reactor that was 10 square centimeters in size,” Brix said. ​“We’ve scaled that up by a factor of 1,500.” OCOchem has developed patented technologies that can handle the required current density, or electrical throughput, to achieve this increased size and manufactures these key components itself. It then works with a contract manufacturer to assemble them into cells, which otherwise use off-the-shelf equipment from other electrolysis-based industries.

OCOchem raised $5 million in 2023 and has secured federal and state grants for its early technology development, as well as an undisclosed amount of early-stage support from Halliburton Labs, the tech accelerator of oil services company Halliburton. The four cells in the pilot facility are the first it’s produced via this assembly-line process, Brix said, but the company is preparing to scale up its manufacturing to meet orders for more than $300 million in prepurchase contracts.

Those contracts are for the formate it will make, not for the equipment itself, he noted. ​“Our goal is to be the developer of the technology and operator of the plant and share ownership of the plant with various partners.”

A cleaner — and cheaper — path to bigger chemicals markets?

OCOchem’s process emits no carbon dioxide, unlike the fossil-fuel-based processes used to make formates today, Brix said. Much of the world’s supply of the chemicals is from factories that are part of China’s expanding coal-fed chemicals industry. Whether OCOchem’s formate is considered low-, zero-, or negative-carbon depends on two key factors: the carbon footprint of the electricity used to make it and the carbon dioxide going into its cells.

Right now, OCOchem plans to get its CO2 ​“from the highest purity and cheapest sources we can find,” Brix said. ​“That turns out to be biogenic CO2,” or gas captured from ethanol plants, breweries, wastewater-treatment facilities, and similar sources. Some of that CO2 is used today as coolant in refrigeration and for carbonating beverages. CO2 that can’t find industrial purchasers is either captured at the expense of its emitter or, far more often, vented into the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change.

Plenty of industries, ranging from sustainable aviation fuel to lower-carbon cement, are planning to rely on captured CO2 to decarbonize. Consulting firm EcoEngineers studied OCOchem’s process and found that every ton the company produces could avoid a combined 7.2 tons of CO2 emissions, compared with fossil-fuel-fed formate production, both by displacing fossil fuels and fixing captured CO2 in the formic acid it makes.

But OCOchem doesn’t need a ​“green premium” for its low-carbon bona fides, Brix said. Instead, it’s relying on offering customers a cost-competitive alternative to formate shipped from overseas. That’s not possible with its pilot-scale facility today, he stressed. But ​“even at 10,000 tons per year, which is a small chemical plant, we’ll have lower cost of production” than typical fossil-fuel-fed plants. ​“We can say, ​‘Whatever your market price is, we’ll meet it.’”

More chemical markets beckon. Formic acid can be processed into a number of organic compounds, including many now made from fossil fuels, he said — ​“not because they’re higher performance, or cleaner, or cheaper, but because they do the job good enough.”

Formates and formic acid could also serve as ​“hydrogen carriers,” Brix said. Hydrogen, when it’s produced in ways that don’t cause greenhouse gas emissions, can be used to cut the carbon impact of industries from steelmaking to shipping. It’s unlikely that OCOchem’s formates would be a cost-effective source of hydrogen at large volumes, but they could serve as a convenient medium for transporting hydrogen in trucks, he said.

The trick is to find cost-effective ways to separate the hydrogen molecules from the formates once they reach their destination, said Ye Xu, associate professor of chemical engineering at Louisiana State University. Xu specializes in research in ​“surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis” — the fundamental study of the interaction of solid catalysts with molecules. He’s been working on a project to crack hydrogen from formates in a way that’s economically viable—one of many being funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

“If you need to transport huge quantities of hydrogen atoms, you have to compress hydrogen gas under extremely high pressure. That causes cost problems and safety problems,” Xu said, especially for chemicals being transported by truck or train. Hydrogen-bearing formates, by contrast, are ​“not flammable. They don’t explode. They are not toxic. These are some very attractive characteristics.”

When it comes to separating the hydrogen atoms from formate molecules at the end of the journey, so far ​“the stumbling block is the speed of the reaction,” he said. ​“Formates are stable substances and slowly decompose on their own.” Speeding up the process requires a catalyst, and ​“according to the scientific literature, the only catalyst that works is palladium” — a costly metal, which, like the chemically similar platinum, is already in high demand for electronics, automotive, and many other industrial uses.

Xu’s search for substitute catalysts to make formate a viable hydrogen carrier involves massive computational research as well as collaboration with scientists doing real-world research. In a way, Brix noted, it’s a similar process to the years of research that have gone into OCOchem’s core technologies, such as the gas-diffusion electrodes that allow it to electrolyze water and CO2 at commercial-scale volumes.

Taking such experiments from laboratory to pilot project to commercial production may be labor-intensive and costly. But building, testing, and redesigning the next generation of technologies is a lot easier and faster on an assembly line than as part of a complicated, yearslong engineering, procurement, and construction project to build large-scale facilities, Brix said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/OCOchem-cell-assembly-indoor-framing.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=18f1b215d9eb4728fdc775a7965fa035,N,,2025-05-30 00:56:21.750256
