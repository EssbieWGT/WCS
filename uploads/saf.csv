Finnair and DB Schenker have initiated their sustainability collaboration by signing an agreement for DB Schenker to purchase nearly 400 tons of scope 3 CO2e reductions, equalling approximately 120 tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from Finnair.

Both companies are committed to increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to air cargo transport.

Finnair has set a science-based target to reduce its carbon emissions intensity (CO2e/RTK) by 34.5% by 2033 from a 2023 baseline.

The target has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Like others in the industry, Finnair is aiming towards net-zero emissions by 2050.

Gabriela Hiitola, senior vice president, Finnair Cargo says: “Our toolkit for reaching the target comprises investing in sustainable aviation fuels beyond regulatory requirements, further improving operational efficiency, optimizing our network, and investing in new aircraft technology.

“This agreement with DB Schenker marks an important milestone in our decarbonization efforts and we are thrilled to partner with such a pioneering company, placing key focus on this important matter.

“Air freight industry needs to address the climate challenge together, and partnering with like-minded stakeholders within the value chain is essential”, .

By co-funding SAF with Finnair, DB Schenker receives a verified scope 3 emissions reduction certificate, proving its contribution to decreasing air cargo-related emissions.

This rollout will enable the Mirabel teams to utilize SAF for production, customer acceptance, and test flight operations.

This now means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites around the world are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

All Airbus Facilities Now on SAF

This achievement means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites worldwide are now operating with SAF for internal operations.

This global integration of SAF underscores Airbus’ dedication to embedding sustainable practices throughout its manufacturing processes.

Furthermore, the manufacturer has announced that by 2025, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights. This will significantly expand the accessibility of greener fuel options.

Mirabel SAF Consumption

The impact of this shift is already tangible. In 2025 alone, the Airbus Mirabel site anticipates using over 600,000 liters of a 30 percent SAF blend. This substantial volume is projected to result in a reduction of approximately 400 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada, highlighted the significance of this milestone. “On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonization by 2050.”

“It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too.”

The numbers speak for themselves. In 2024, 18 percent of Airbus’s global fuel mix was SAF, translating to over 16 million liters of neat SAF. Additionally, 75 percent of Airbus aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, demonstrating the growing importance of decarbonization to customers.

Blended SAF

The management of SAF at the Mirabel site adheres to the mass balance principle. Once delivered, the SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel (CAF), also known as Jet-A1, within the site’s fuel farm.

This dilution process is conducted according to established standards and auditable bookkeeping, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Airbus Canada is aiming to provide SAF Proof of Sustainability (PoS) to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025, further solidifying their commitment to sustainable practices.

Notably, the A220 has been operating with SAF from the A220 Mobile Final Assembly Line since 2016.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is currently certified to operate with up to 50 percent SAF.

Looking Ahead

Looking ahead, Airbus has set an ambitious goal for all its aircraft to be capable of running on 100 percent SAF by 2030, marking a significant step towards a fully sustainable aviation future.

The Airbus site in Mirabel is a sprawling facility spanning over 1.5 million square feet. It encompasses a pre-final assembly line, two final assembly lines, a customer response center, a flight and integration test center, and a brand-new delivery center.

This state-of-the-art facility is home to over 3,500 Airbus employees, all contributing to the company’s mission of innovation and sustainability.

By embracing SAF and implementing sustainable practices across its operations, Airbus is setting a new standard for the aviation industry.

The recent SAF delivery at the Mirabel site furthers the manufacturer’s commitment to a greener future for air travel.

Produced through the electrolysis of water using electricity from renewable energy sources like solar and wind, renewable hydrogen offers a clean alternative to fossil fuels and is a crucial component in the clean energy transition.

Renewable hydrogen is also critical to decarbonise certain industries where electricity from renewables won’t be enough. These areas are typically defined as hard-to-abate sectors and include things like aviation, maritime, steel and alumina industries.

Take aeroplanes for example. If you want to power an aeroplane with electricity, the sheer amount and size of the batteries that would be required for a long-distance flight would add so much weight to the plane it would be commercially unviable and a safety hazard.

Renewable hydrogen can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a solution to the aviation decarbonisation challenge. Down the road, the hope is it will be a lynch pin to create electrofuels (e-fuels). E-fuels are synthetic fuels in gas or liquid form made from renewable energy sources.

The issue is renewable hydrogen is currently expensive to produce, and the cost is one factor that is stalling projects and wide-spread market adoption in Australia.

With current technology, it costs $6-$9 to make 1 kilogram (kg) of renewable hydrogen. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) knows the cost needs to be brought down for hydrogen to be sold at a competitive price. A drop in the cost to produce renewable hydrogen is one method of accelerating the clean energy source to be widely adopted across the market and drive down emissions.

There are also other opportunities to improve project economics and therefore lower the potential sales price of renewable hydrogen as technology moves forward. One of these potential revenue streams is pure oxygen.

In certain projects, the use of pure oxygen could help to make renewable hydrogen more commercially viable in the years to come.

Pure oxygen

Electrolysis is a process that makes renewable hydrogen. This is a process where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen through an electrolyser with the use of electricity from renewable energy sources. It’s completely emissions free.

Oxygen is a byproduct of this process. For every 1kg of renewable hydrogen there is 8kg of oxygen left behind.

Many industries can use the byproduct such as the medical field or to help in other emissions reductions through applications such as wastewater treatment.

ARENA is supporting projects to explore ways to use pure oxygen as a byproduct to help drive renewable hydrogen’s commercial viability. The oxygen can also help meet emissions reduction targets through its application in other industries. It’s a win-win for industryand the Australian public as we move forward to a net zero future.

Pure Oxygen and use for wastewater treatment

Last year, ARENA committed $3 million in funding to Barwon Water for the Green Oxygen for Wastewater Treatment project.

The project aims to use pure oxygen from Viva Energy’s renewable hydrogen production plant in Geelong in the treatment of wastewater at Barwon Water’s Northern Water Plant.

ARENA supplied $34 million to Viva Energy to build ‘Australia’s first commercially scaled and publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling station.’

A circular economy will result from the collaboration where pure, clean oxygen is fed to Barwon Water’s treatment plant and wastewater is treated through oxygenation. The clean water will then be available for Viva Energy to use in the production of renewable hydrogen for its fuelling station.

Australia has over 1200 wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which contribute more than 2.95 million tonnes of CO2 in Australia. The project seeks to not only make renewable hydrogen more commercially viable through use of its byproduct, but it also serves a further emissions reduction opportunity.

Wastewater treatment remains one of the largest and most challenging sources of emissions in the water utilities sector, according to the Australian Water Association (AWA).

Science behind oxygenation and wastewater treatment

Wastewater treatment is a critical process to remove contaminants from water to make it safe for discharge or reuse. Oxygenation is a key step in this treatment.

When added into water, oxygen supports the growth of beneficial microorganisms. These microorganisms break down organic matter and other pollutants, effectively cleaning the water.

Traditionally, wastewater treatment plants use air, which is only about 20% oxygen. To pump the air through the wastewater, it requires energy. According to Barwon Water, this process takes up 50-70% of the energy used in the process.

Oxygen has a 90% purity and would enhance the activity of the microorganisms, allowing them to break down pollutants faster and more efficiently. This process would drastically reduce energy use and lower emissions for wastewater treatment.

Oxygen use at Barwon Water will not only improve the efficiency of the treatment but also provide a valuable use for the oxygen that would otherwise go to waste.

Real world impact

The project will be in two stages.

In the first stage, Barwon Water will complete a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study to determine the technical and economic feasibility of the concept.

If successful, the project will move to the second stage, which involves a two-year demonstration of the use of oxygen sourced from Viva Energy’s electrolyser, at the Northern Water Plant.

The collaboration between ARENA and Barwon Water is a shining example of how innovative thinking and collaboration can drive positive change. By harnessing the power of renewable hydrogen and improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment, this project is paving the way for a more sustainable future.

As technology continues to advance, the potential for similar projects to be implemented across Australia and beyond is substantial.

The lessons learned from the project could inspire other regions to adopt similar approaches, furthering the global transition to a cleaner, greener future.

Expanding the vision

Integration of renewable hydrogen production with other industrial processes, can create a more interconnected and efficient energy system.

Industries that require large amounts of oxygen, such as steel manufacturing or chemical production, could benefit from the surplus oxygen generated during electrolysis. This would not only improve the efficiency of these industries but also reduce their environmental impact and commercial viability.

The success of the Barwon Water and Viva Energy project could serve as a model for other regions and countries looking to enhance their sustainability efforts.",https://arena.gov.au/assets/2025/03/AdobeStock_215987645-scaled-e1742522489398.jpeg,N,,2025-03-20 22:57:16.523836

Rehn said polluting the aquifer is not worth the risk, citing carbon capture leaks at ADM last year.
The measure unanimously passed out of an Illinois Senate committee on Thursday.","After months of community engagement, the Illinois House and Senate are endorsing a bill that would ban carbon sequestration near the Mahomet Aquifer.

This comes after the Senate put a proposed ban on hold last fall to better study the technology and its environmental risks. Carbon capture technology involves injecting climate warming CO2 deep underground.

Advocates say the ban would protect the aquifer from possible leaks that could lead to contamination of a major water source for much of Central Illinois.

A year ago, Illinois placed a two-year pause on carbon sequestration.

Much of Republican State Sen. Sally Turner's district is served by the Mahomet Aquifer. She's said she's open to carbon capture, but not near the aquifer.

“The biggest thing for me is it's a sole sourced aquifer. It's the water for over a million people. I think that it's really important that we make sure and safeguard that area,” said Turner, adding that protecting the aquifer, so far, has been bipartisan effort.

""Everybody has a source of drinking water wherever they are throughout the state,"" Turner said. ""How would this affect me if it happened to me in my area? So, I think that's how they all look at it. And don't get me wrong, we all want jobs. We all want economic development. We just need to put this process in the right place.”

Even with the bipartisan support, Turner said she and chief sponsor Sen. Paul Faraci, D-Champaign, are ready for further discussion with opponents.

“If there's something that needs to be tweaked to assist in another avenue that would help all the way around, I think Sen. Fauci is willing to look at that,” Turner said. “But we haven't heard what those things are they're looking for. So, we're waiting to see what those things are.”

Andrew Rehn is director of climate policy at the Prairie Rivers Network, a Champaign-based environmental group. Rehn said polluting the aquifer is not worth the risk, citing carbon capture leaks at ADM last year.

“While policy decisions often involve how much risk do we want to take for said economic benefit, for the Mahomet Aquifer, the tolerance has got to be zero,” Rehn said. “And that means that any number you come up with on how much risk you want to take is not appropriate in the Mahomet Aquifer.”

Rehn isn’t opposed to carbon sequestration as a practice, but thinks it should be done someplace else.

“We're taking our aquifer, our sole source of drinking water, and we're proposing to do an experiment under that aquifer doesn't make sense,” Rehn said. “Let's do this somewhere else. Let's not do it under the aquifer. Let's not induce those risks, whatever those risks might be. Let's make sure the risk is zero for a sole source of drinking water.”

Republican State Sen. Chris Balkema who represents parts of Bloomington-Normal is not a sponsor of the bill, but said the issue deeply affects those he represents.

Balkema said he, too, is worried about the possible leaks, but also acknowledges the technology's potential. In his district, companies are working to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

“We have to grow jobs in Illinois,” Balkema said. “We have to find ways for these companies to produce sustainable aviation fuel, and we gotta do all of the above, protecting the environment and the water source, while not losing out to companies outside of Illinois.”

Balkema said he is ready to discuss the issue further on the Senate floor when it heads there April 1.

Brazil central bank raises target rate to 14.25pc

Sao Paulo, 20 March (Argus) — Brazil's central bank raised its target interest rate by 1 percentage point to 14.25pc amid accelerating inflation in a decelerating — but still heated — economy. The hike in the target rate, announced Wednesday, was the fifth in a row from a cyclical low of 10.5pc at the end of September last year, partly prompted by accelerating depreciation of the currency, the real, to the US dollar. Brazil's annualized inflation hit 5.06pc in February and is poised to keep accelerating. The bank's Focus economic report increased its inflation forecast to 5.7pc for the end-of-year 2025 from 5.5pc in January, when the bank's policy-making committee last met. Brazil's current government has an inflation ceiling goal of 3pc with tolerance of 1.5 percentage point above or below. The bank has recently changed the way it tracks the inflation goal. Instead of tracking inflation on a calendar year basis, it now monitors the goal on a rolling 12-month basis. The bank cited heated economic activity and a strong labor market as factors that have contributed to rising inflation. But the bank forecasts ""modest GDP growth"" for Brazil of almost 2pc in 2025, down from 3.4pc growth last year. Further tightening will also be linked to global economic uncertainty prompted by US president Donald Trump's aggressive trade and other policies and the monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve , according to the bank. Brazil's target interest rate is expected to keep rising at the bank's next meeting in 6-7 May, albeit to ""a lesser extent"" as the contributing factors are set to moderate, according to the committee.

TotalEnergies delays, cuts size of Grandpuits HVO

Barcelona, 20 March (Argus) — TotalEnergies is delaying the start up of its Grandpuits hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) plant, and is planning to reduce the plant's proposed capacity. TotalEnergies confirmed the planned 400,000 t/yr HVO and HVO jet fuel (SAF) plant, near Paris, will not start in 2025 as previously outlined. Instead, a first phase of 210,000t of SAF output is slated to begin operations ""early in 2026."" TotalEnergies said there will then be a second phase of 75,000t, which will start at an unspecified point in 2027, giving 285,000 t/yr. If all production is SAF this would be equivalent to around 6,155 b/d. The CGT union said its members at Grandpuits downed tools for 24 hours yesterday, 19 March, as a result of the company's announcement. Workers say they have been promised a meeting with management in mid-April, and there does not appear to be industrial action at the site today. TotalEnergies halted crude distillation at the 93,000 b/d Grandpuits four years ago . The transformation includes a 10,000 t/yr plastics recycling unit. It said 1,200 workers are on site to undertake the conversion and this will result in 250 full time posts on completion. This is consistent with previous plans . The delay and reduction in size at Grandpuits does appear to confound targets for TotalEnergies' HVO and SAF output previously laid out by chief executive Patrick Pouyanne . The company operates a 500,000 t/yr HVO and SAF plant at La Mede, near the port of Fos-Lavera. A Grandpuits worker said management has indicated the company will look to purchase HVO and SAF, in order to honour contractual obligations.

UK study sets out Grangemouth's post-refining future

Edinburgh, 19 March (Argus) — A government-funded study has identified nine potential low-carbon and renewable options for the Grangemouth site in Scotland following the planned closure of its 150,000 b/d refinery in the second quarter this year. The nine possible projects outlined in the Project Willow study centre around waste, bio-feedstocks and industries supporting the development of offshore wind. They could benefit each other through synergies and create up to 800 direct jobs, but their success ""will require significant contributions from both the public and private sector"", with an initial £3.5bn ($4.5bn) in capital investments needed, the study said. The £1.5mn report, paid for by the UK and Scottish governments, was commissioned by Grangemouth refinery operator Petroineos, which announced in November 2023 that it was going to close the plant and convert it into a fuel import terminal. The UK and Scottish governments have since set aside £25mn and £200mn for Grangemouth, along with other initiatives such as Scotland's £100mn Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package. The study's 'waste' pathway comprises a hydrothermal plastic recycling project, a dissolution plastic recycling facility and a bio-refining project relying on bacterial fermentation (ABE). Under the 'bio-feedstock' pathway, the study envisages a second-generation bioethanol plant on Scottish timber feedstock and an anaerobic digestion facility using organic waste to produce biomethane. Second-generation bioethanol refers to ethanol made from non-edible resources such as biomass. This pathway also suggests a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, with production made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). UK trade union Unite has been supportive of this option , but Petroineos deemed it unviable ""under current regulatory conditions"". The third pathway — called conduit for offshore wind — is mostly focused on hydrogen. It includes fuel switching, producing jet from e-methanol and methanol as well as producing low-carbon ammonia for the shipping and chemicals industry. The second-generation ethanol plant and the HEFA facility, as well as the e-methanol and e-ammonia projects, would have a longer 2030-40 timeline, against a 2028-30 timeline for the other projects. The projects would benefit from existing infrastructure such as Grangemouth's port, which includes container, bulk and liquid fuel terminals. ""There are also opportunities to reuse existing tank storage, ethanol facilities, and other ancillary assets at the site,"" the study said. Unite has criticised the study's project timelines, pointing out most would start years after the refinery had closed, by which time jobs would have been lost. Many of the projects ""could be fast tracked and implemented now"", including converting the refinery to SAF production, the union said. ""Project Willow was created by Petroineos as a fig leaf to justify its act of industrial vandalism of shutting the refinery and axing jobs. It asked the wrong questions and then failed to provide the answers that Grangemouth refinery workers need,"" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. ""There are projects like SAF production which can be swiftly enacted to protect jobs and those opportunities must not be lost. This would pave the way for the UK to become a world leader in green aviation."" By Caroline Varin Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

LowLands signs biomethanol deals with shipping firms

London, 18 March (Argus) — Dutch renewable methanol producer LowLands has signed several bio- and low carbon-methanol supply agreements with shipping firms, its chief executive Gijs Bakker said. The value of these agreements surpasses €1bn and is ""rising fast"", Bakker said. The supply will come from LowLands' 120,000 t/yr biomethanol facility in Moerdijk, Netherlands, which will use waste wood and municipal waste as feedstock. Bakker highlighted that the location at Moerdijk will offer ""logistical advantages"" to clients in Rotterdam and Antwerp. He said that the product price is very competitive compared with e-methanol, with a discount rate of 40-50pc. Production at the plant was initially scheduled to begin in 2024, but has been delayed until end of 2027 or early 2028, because of ""war and its consequences on utility pricing"", LowLands told Argus . ""[Northwest Europe] has excellent infrastructure for collecting bio-wastes"", Bakker said. ""This makes [it] a preferred location for biomethanol production units."" He noted that the slower-than-expected development of green hydrogen capacity means biomethanol from biogenic carbon will remain competitive for longer. International offtake agreements for renewable methanol are on the rise with the January rollout of the FuelEU maritime regulation, which could increase demand for biomethanol in shipping. Ship operators traveling to, out of, and within EU territorial waters must reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity on a lifecycle basis by 2pc. The cuts will reach 6pc from 2030 and gradually reach 80pc by 2050. Shipping firm Maersk has signed several letters of intent for procurement of biomethanol and e-methanol from producers including Norway's Equinor , Switzerland's Proman and Dutch-based chemical company OCI Global , and has an agreement with Chinese wind turbine manufacturer Goldwind for 500,000 t/yr from 2024. Maersk sees biomethanol and e-methanol as likely the most competitive and scalable pathways to decarbonisation this decade. While relatively small, Maersk's ""green marine"" fuel consumption, which includes biomethanol, increased by 38pc in 2024 to 3,034 GWh.

Co-electrolysis makes power-to-liquid more efficient For the production of synthetic kerosene at KIT's Energy Lab, a multi-stage process distributed to modular facilities is used.
Up to 85% of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.
""This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.""","Fuels like kerosene can be produced in a climate-friendly way from CO2, water and green electricity using power-to-liquid processes. Researchers from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have already demonstrated this with systems in actual operation.

Now, researchers working on the Kopernikus P2X project have succeeded for the first time in coupling—at an industrial 220-kilowatt scale—the highly efficient co-electrolysis process with fuel synthesis.

In order to achieve its climate targets, Europe needs green alternatives for applications that do not easily lend themselves to electrification. ""The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,"" says Professor Roland Dittmeyer from KIT's Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT).

""Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable.""

Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project and heads the corresponding research activities at KIT. The project has now reached an important technological milestone on the way to sustainable aviation fuel: For the first time in the world, the innovative, highly efficient water vapor/CO2 co-electrolysis technology from industrial partner Sunfire was coupled directly with a synthesis process at an industry-relevant scale (220 kilowatts of electrolysis output).

Co-electrolysis makes power-to-liquid more efficient

For the production of synthetic kerosene at KIT's Energy Lab, a multi-stage process distributed to modular facilities is used. First, syngas—a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide—is produced from CO2 and water.

In principle, there are several ways to generate syngas. The new configuration uses a co-electrolysis module with an output of 220 kilowatts from industry partner Sunfire, which simplifies this process step and, above all, boosts its efficiency.

""Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step. Up to 85% of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.

""In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,"" says Hubertus Richter, Senior Engineer R&D Project Management & Process Engineering at Sunfire.

""This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.""

For the coupled operation of co-electrolysis and fuel synthesis, the syngas needs to be brought to reaction pressure. This job is done by a compressor with safety devices the researchers added to the process chain. In a microstructured reactor, the syngas is then converted to long-chain hydrocarbons—known as syncrude—using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These hydrocarbons can be used directly to produce fuels such as kerosene or other chemical products.

Scientists at KIT developed this reactor technology, which is already being commercialized by INERATEC, a KIT spin-off. In the future, it is planned to use the heat released as vapor during synthesis for the co-electrolysis. This would further reduce the energy demand of the entire process and demonstrate that the product preparation to finally obtain kerosene is feasible at this scale.

By combining these process steps, it is possible to fully utilize the carbon dioxide provided and achieve the highest possible energy conversion efficiency, as this process chain allows efficient recycling of material flows in addition to the energy flows.

The next step: A ton of kerosene per day

Researchers at KIT successfully tested the integration of co-electrolysis in campaign operation under real conditions, producing up to 100 liters of syncrude per day. Coupled operation marks an important milestone in the second funding phase of the Kopernikus P2X project. The facility is now being expanded for a capacity of up to 300 liters syncrude per day.

In the third and final funding phase, the research team has INERATEC additionally build a larger Fischer-Tropsch production facility in the Höchst Industrial Park near Frankfurt. ""For the first time, ton-scale production will be realized there,"" says Dittmeyer.

The product, which will eventually be processed into kerosene, will be used by aircraft engine manufacturers and research partners for testing. Accompanying analyses will ensure that the fuel meets the strict aviation standards.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/boosting-the-efficienc.jpg,N,,2025-03-20 18:00:27.934027

This move aligns with the release of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology, which provides specific rules for calculating carbon emissions reductions associated with SAF usage. The enhancement aims to give airlines, corporations, and individual travelers a clearer understanding of the impact of SAF on their carbon footprint.

Improving Transparency with SAF Emissions Data

The newly enhanced CO2 Connect calculator will initially apply uniform per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. This approach is part of IATA’s commitment to transparency and providing accurate emissions data to travelers and businesses alike. The future version of CO2 Connect will allow airlines to allocate SAF-related emissions reductions on a more granular level, assigning specific reductions to individual routes, further increasing the accuracy and relevance of the data.

Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Commercial Products and Services, emphasized that travelers and corporations alike are increasingly seeking to understand the sustainability of their flights. “By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Leger.

A Growing Number of Airlines Participating in CO2 Connect

IATA’s CO2 Connect is already benefiting from contributions by a growing number of airlines. The platform uses real operational data, including aircraft-specific fuel consumption, which is directly provided by participating airlines. This method sets CO2 Connect apart from other calculators, which tend to rely on modeled averages rather than real-world data.

With the recent inclusion of airlines such as Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas, and Royal Air Maroc, the total number of contributing airlines has now reached 60. This expansion further improves the accuracy and transparency of CO2 Connect’s calculations, making it a more powerful tool for individual travelers and businesses seeking to reduce their carbon footprints.

Strengthening Aviation’s Commitment to Decarbonization

IATA’s CO2 Connect is designed to support the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts. By incorporating the SAF accounting methodology, the platform provides a more accurate picture of the environmental impact of air travel, helping to foster more sustainable practices in the aviation sector. According to Leger, the enhanced CO2 Connect is “going from strength to strength” and is poised to play a pivotal role in the aviation industry’s journey toward carbon neutrality.

The tool is not only a step forward for the aviation industry but also provides valuable data for businesses aiming to align with sustainability goals and for travelers looking to make more eco-conscious decisions. The integration of SAF into emissions calculations demonstrates the growing importance of sustainable aviation practices as airlines work toward decarbonization.

As IATA continues to build on this foundation, the platform’s ability to track and report SAF-related emissions reductions will only grow in importance, helping to drive the global aviation industry toward a more sustainable future.

Conclusion

IATA’s latest upgrade to its CO2 Connect emissions calculator represents a significant leap forward in transparency and accuracy in emissions reporting for the aviation industry. With the incorporation of SAF accounting, airlines, corporations, and travelers now have a more precise tool to track and reduce their carbon emissions.

Finnair has set a science-based target to reduce its carbon emissions intensity (CO2e/RTK) by 34.5% by 2033 from a 2023 baseline.

The target has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Like others in the industry, Finnair is aiming towards net-zero emissions by 2050.

“Our toolkit for reaching the target comprises investing in sustainable aviation fuels beyond regulatory requirements, further improving operational efficiency, optimizing our network, and investing in new aircraft technology,"" said Gabriela Hiitola, senior vice president, Finnair Cargo.

""This agreement with DB Schenker marks an important milestone in our decarbonization efforts and we are thrilled to partner with such a pioneering company, placing key focus on this important matter.

""[The] airfreight industry needs to address the climate challenge together, and partnering with like-minded stakeholders within the value chain is essential.""

DB Schenker has been an early adopter of SAF since 2020 and aims to expand its low-carbon airfreight options for shippers.

“At DB Schenker, we recognize the urgency of decarbonizing airfreight and are committed to driving meaningful change within the industry,"" said Björn Eckbauer, senior vice president of global operations & procurement air, DB Schenker.

""Our collaboration with Finnair marks another step in scaling sustainable aviation fuel use to significantly reduce the industry’s carbon footprint. By investing in SAF, we are not only reducing our own carbon footprint but also empowering our customers with low-carbon air freight solutions.""",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/8/0/10780_biofuel-aircraft-shutterstock_2055311654.jpg-resized.jpg,N,,2025-03-20 19:57:05.078244

In 2022, Farnborough trialled selling SAF at the same price as Jet A1 fuel for two weeks. However, new UK and EU mandates are putting pressure on domestic SAF sales.

“Hydrogen Refinery’s patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20 per cent blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s own target of 10% by 2030,” said Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport. “What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the UK.”

Geere explains how the financial position of Farnborough Airport is a crucial factor when it comes to supporting the development of SAF fuelling technologies, and how its frequent traffic of small modern aircraft is ideal.

“We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling,” commented Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery. “Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF. This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill. We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.

Alongside this new agreement, Farnborough Airport has a history of sustainability initiatives, achieving Level 4+ Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) status in 2024, and installing enough light-weight solar panels to generate 25 per cent of its own power.

The project, located in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques region of France, aims to establish the nation's first commercial e-biofuel plant, capable of producing 110,000 tonnes of e-fuels annually from 2029.

The BioTJet facility will leverage wood waste and forestry residues as feedstock, converting them into cleaner jet fuel through a process enhanced by clean hydrogen. This innovative approach addresses the pressing need for sustainable alternatives to traditional jet fuel, which contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.

The core technology selected by Elyse Energy, BioTfueL, has undergone rigorous testing at a semi-industrial plant between 2010 and 2021, validated by the Bionext consortium, a collaboration of industry leaders including Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies Nouvelles, Total Energies, and thyssenkrupp Uhde. In 2024, Axens secured a license agreement for the BioTfueL technology, which incorporates thyssenkrupp Uhde's PRENFLO gasification and Axens' GASEL technologies.

A key feature of the BioTJet process is the integration of clean hydrogen, which significantly improves efficiency and reduces emissions. The wood waste is initially subjected to high temperatures to produce syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The addition of clean hydrogen enhances the syngas quality, making it more suitable for subsequent fuel synthesis.

Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy, emphasized the strategic importance of this technology in providing “cost-competitive” e-fuels. The BioTJet plant is projected to produce 75,000 tonnes of SAF and 35,000 tonnes of naphtha, which will serve both road transport and chemical sectors, diversifying its impact on reducing carbon footprints.

The project has already achieved a significant milestone with the completion of basic engineering in November 2024. Currently, the BioTJet project is progressing through the detailed engineering phase, demonstrating a commitment to timely execution and operational readiness.

This development aligns with the European Union's ambitious ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which mandates a progressive increase in SAF usage within the aviation sector. The regulation requires that SAF constitute 2% of European aviation fuel supplies by 2025, escalating to 70% by 2050.

Despite SAF's potential to significantly reduce aviation emissions, its current adoption remains limited. As of 2024, SAF production accounts for only 0.53% of global jet fuel consumption, primarily due to high production costs and feedstock constraints. The BioTJet project, with its focus on utilizing readily available wood waste and integrating clean hydrogen, aims to address these challenges and accelerate the commercial viability of SAF.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-20 14:58:03.940289

Because of that, customers of commercial airlines will still have residual Scope 3 emissions and will need a way to address them.
• SAF is more expensive to produce than traditional jet fuel, and airlines alone cannot bear the cost.
• The refining capacity of sustainable aviation fuel is currently limited, due in part to the up-front capital investment required to expand or build new facilities.
Even so, their investments have demonstrated demand and helped accelerate supply in the sustainable aviation fuel industry.","SBTi’s recently published Corporate Net-zero Standard v2.0 is a positive step forward for “insets,” which are emission reductions within a company’s value chain. World Energy applauds this development because it provides “hard-to-abate” sectors like aviation, steel, and chemicals with a way to mitigate emissions when they can’t be avoided. With the draft guidance, SBTi recognizes that companies in these industries, and companies whose supply chains include these industries, may have no other option to address their emissions because “direct traceability is not possible or because persistent barriers prevent mitigation at the source.”

They specifically cite sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) and the use of book & claim as an example of a valid option for companies to address their value-chain emissions. With SAFc, the fuel’s environmental attributes are separated from the fuel itself and are tracked using a book & claim chain of custody model. This allows aviation customers to claim the environmental attributes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without purchasing physical fuel.

For example, a SAFc inset purchase enables an airline (Scope 1) and an aviation customer (Scope 3) to claim the environmental benefits of the SAF against their direct (airlines) and indirect (customers) emissions, regardless of where the fuel is being combusted. Ideally, the physical fuel is delivered to an airport as close to the production facility as possible, which helps minimize both logistical costs and emissions.

One point in the draft is concerning, however. It suggests SBTi’s recognition of insets may be “time-limited,” without citing a rationale. We believe insets will have an important role to play for a long time to come for these reasons:

• Individual airlines will not achieve 100% decarbonization by 2050 according to EIA, ATAG and other credible sources, though some might. Because of that, customers of commercial airlines will still have residual Scope 3 emissions and will need a way to address them. With SAFc, corporates can still address these emissions through voluntary actions.

• SAF is more expensive to produce than traditional jet fuel, and airlines alone cannot bear the cost. However, Scope 3 customers have the motivation and the means to help. This cost collaboration allows airlines to purchase the fuel itself more affordably while also enabling corporates to achieve their net-zero goals through voluntary actions.

• The refining capacity of sustainable aviation fuel is currently limited, due in part to the up-front capital investment required to expand or build new facilities. Long-term SAFc contracts bring companies with high credit ratings into the financial mix and signal long-term demand. This gives investors confidence that a SAF refinery can count on customers for its product well into the future. And, in the long run, the price of SAF will drop as supply increases.

Corporations with ambitious emissions reduction goals have been using insets like SAFc as indirect mitigation tools, but they haven’t had a standardized way for those reductions to be recognized. Even so, their investments have demonstrated demand and helped accelerate supply in the sustainable aviation fuel industry. If finalized in this form, companies will have added confidence that their Scope 3 emissions reductions will be viable and recognized, which will encourage a new wave of corporations to become involved in the market.

Moving towards physical procurement as soon as practical is a good thing, but an arbitrary expiration date for indirect mitigation it will eliminate a tool for corporates to decarbonize “hard-to-abate” sectors and will also signal to investors that voluntary offtake agreements aren’t bankable.

The comment period on this draft guidance runs until June 1 and World Energy looks forward to constructive engagement with SBTi to build out pragmatic mitigation solutions.",https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/email/artdeco/logos/96/linkedin-bug-color.png,N,,2025-03-20 18:01:09.297120

Turkish lira at all-time low against dollar

London, 19 March (Argus) — Turkey's lira currency fell to record lows against the US dollar today, after the arrest of Istanbul's mayor provoked concern about instability. The depreciation could cause imports of dollar-denominated commodities to become more expensive, although reaction was mixed across markets. The lira went as low at 40/$1 in early trading, from below 37/$1 on Tuesday 18 March, before easing to around 38/$1 later in the day. The lira has been slowly depreciating against the dollar for many years, but the sharp fall today came after Ekrem Imamoglu, one of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rivals, was held on suspicion of corruption and aiding a terrorist organisation. Turkey is a significant importer of natural gas, crude and LPG, as well as coal and petcoke, although demand for many commodities will be muted currently because of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. Early indications from the coal and petcoke markets were that all import trades had halted as the lira hit the record low. In polymers markets the focus is on whether demand recovers after Ramadan ends on 30 March. But a trading source in Turkey said the fall is not enough for ""massive changes"" to imports of oil products. The OECD forecasts headline inflation in Turkey at 31.4pc this year, the highest among its members, easing to 17.3pc in 2026. The IMF has forecast Turkey's economy will grow by 2.6pc this year, after an expansion of 2.7pc in 2024.

English and Welsh roads hit by lack of spending: Survey

London, 19 March (Argus) — More than half of the local road network in England and Wales has less than 15 years of structural life left because of insufficient allocation of government funding to local authorities, according to the latest Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (ALARM) survey. The survey, compiled annually by UK industry body Asphalt Industry Association (AIA), found that 52pc, or around 106,000 miles, of the English and Welsh road network managed by local authorities had just 15 years life remaining, and that nearly a third of these roads — around 34,600 miles — may only have up to five years life left. The survey found that in the next 12 months, 24,400 miles, or 12pc, of the network is likely to need some form of maintenance and that just 1.5pc of the local road network was resurfaced over the last year. Although there has been over £20bn ($26bn) spent on carriageway maintenance in England and Wales over the last decade, ""due to the short-term nature of the allocation of funding, it has resulted in no quantifiable uplift to the condition and resilience of the network,"" AIA Chair David Giles said. He added there needs to be a complete change in mindset away from short-term to longer term funding commitments, and he asked the UK government to set a minimum five-year funding horizon and substantially increase investments for local roads maintenance work. UK bitumen consumption has been steadily falling in recent years, with another 10.5 decline registered in 2024, hitting its lowest levels since 2016, according to UK government's department for energy security and net zero (DESNZ) data. The consumption drop coincided with a 20.3pc jump to 449,000t in UK production of the heavy oil product used mainly in road paving as well as general construction, combining to sharply reduce the country's bitumen import requirements. The ALARM survey also found that there had been no improvements in as much as 94pc of the England and Wales local network over the last year. To maintain their network, the survey showed that in England and Wales, local authorities would have needed an extra £7.4m each in 2024 and £16.81bn in total, as a one-off cash injection, to bring their networks up to their ""ideal"" conditions.

Danish firm to set up Kalundborg bitumen terminal

London, 19 March (Argus) — Danish firm Bitumen Danmark will build a new bitumen terminal at Kalundborg, Denmark, with an initial capacity of 10,000-15,000t. The storage facility is scheduled for completion by late 2026 when it could start receiving winter-fill cargoes during the 2026/27 winter ahead of supply into local truck markets when the next paving and general construction season starts in spring 2027. The secured terminal, which could be expanded at a later point, will have deep water access that will enable the firm to take delivery of cargoes carried in bitumen tankers from a wide variety of locations across the Nordics, northwest Europe and the Mediterranean. In 2024, Denmark received around 123,000t of bitumen in cargo shipments, according to Vortexa, with the majority of the tankers delivering into Danish terminals at Aarhus, Nyborg and Koge. Sweden was the biggest single source last year, supplying just over half the total, with just over a third from the Netherlands.

UK study sets out Grangemouth's post-refining future

Edinburgh, 19 March (Argus) — A government-funded study has identified nine potential low-carbon and renewable options for the Grangemouth site in Scotland following the planned closure of its 150,000 b/d refinery in the second quarter this year. The nine possible projects outlined in the Project Willow study centre around waste, bio-feedstocks and industries supporting the development of offshore wind. They could benefit each other through synergies and create up to 800 direct jobs, but their success ""will require significant contributions from both the public and private sector"", with an initial £3.5bn ($4.5bn) in capital investments needed, the study said. The £1.5mn report, paid for by the UK and Scottish governments, was commissioned by Grangemouth refinery operator Petroineos, which announced in November 2023 that it was going to close the plant and convert it into a fuel import terminal. The UK and Scottish governments have since set aside £25mn and £200mn for Grangemouth, along with other initiatives such as Scotland's £100mn Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package. The study's 'waste' pathway comprises a hydrothermal plastic recycling project, a dissolution plastic recycling facility and a bio-refining project relying on bacterial fermentation (ABE). Under the 'bio-feedstock' pathway, the study envisages a second-generation bioethanol plant on Scottish timber feedstock and an anaerobic digestion facility using organic waste to produce biomethane. Second-generation bioethanol refers to ethanol made from non-edible resources such as biomass. This pathway also suggests a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, with production made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). UK trade union Unite has been supportive of this option , but Petroineos deemed it unviable ""under current regulatory conditions"". The third pathway — called conduit for offshore wind — is mostly focused on hydrogen. It includes fuel switching, producing jet from e-methanol and methanol as well as producing low-carbon ammonia for the shipping and chemicals industry. The second-generation ethanol plant and the HEFA facility, as well as the e-methanol and e-ammonia projects, would have a longer 2030-40 timeline, against a 2028-30 timeline for the other projects. The projects would benefit from existing infrastructure such as Grangemouth's port, which includes container, bulk and liquid fuel terminals. ""There are also opportunities to reuse existing tank storage, ethanol facilities, and other ancillary assets at the site,"" the study said. Unite has criticised the study's project timelines, pointing out most would start years after the refinery had closed, by which time jobs would have been lost. Many of the projects ""could be fast tracked and implemented now"", including converting the refinery to SAF production, the union said. ""Project Willow was created by Petroineos as a fig leaf to justify its act of industrial vandalism of shutting the refinery and axing jobs. It asked the wrong questions and then failed to provide the answers that Grangemouth refinery workers need,"" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. ""There are projects like SAF production which can be swiftly enacted to protect jobs and those opportunities must not be lost. This would pave the way for the UK to become a world leader in green aviation."" By Caroline Varin Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

The report comes after the UK government promised a £200m investment for Project Willow last month.
The capital investment required for each of the nine projects varies significantly, from as little as £15m for the anaerobic digestion project, to up to £2.1bn for the hydrogen-powered methanol production project.
Wait for jobs to go on EY estimates that Project Willow could create up to 1,100 long-term jobs at Grangemouth by 2040.
Unite’s Scottish secretary Derek Thomson said: “The options for the future of the Grangemouth refinery need to be fast-tracked to preserve jobs and skills on the site.","GRANGEMOUTH could host recycling and bio-feedstock production facilities after the site’s oil refinery closes this year, according to proposals published in a report yesterday.

Consultancy EY’s report, commissioned by the Scottish and UK governments for £1.5m (US$1.95m), is the first to provide a detailed picture of Project Willow, the transition plan for the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland, which will close later this year with the loss of at least 400 jobs.

EY’s report made nine project proposals, including: hydrothermal recycling to break down hard-to-recycle plastics; dissolution plastic recycling to return plastics to virgin-like status; converting used cooking oil and other waste into alcohols; timber-to-ethanol production; anaerobic digestion for fuel production from animal waste and sewage; SAF production from hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) cover crops; hydrogen production to power industrial plants, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and ammonia factories.

The report was produced for the Grangemouth refinery’s owner Petroineos, who announced last year that the refinery would close in the second quarter of 2025 due to ongoing losses from their refining operation.

The report comes after the UK government promised a £200m investment for Project Willow last month.

UK government energy minister Michael Shanks said: “We committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth.

“We will build on Grangemouth’s expertise and industrial heritage to attract investors [and] secure a long-term clean energy future.”

The UK and Scottish governments are now trying to attract private sector investment. Prime minister Keir Starmer previously said he aims to attract £600m from the private sector.

Time and money

EY’s proposals are dependent on the government accepting the report’s recommendations, including energy market reform to reduce renewable energy costs, and an exemption to the cap on SAF feedstocks derived from HEFA, which was included in the government’s SAF mandate last year.

The capital investment required for each of the nine projects varies significantly, from as little as £15m for the anaerobic digestion project, to up to £2.1bn for the hydrogen-powered methanol production project. The anaerobic digestion project would have the earliest start date of all nine, becoming operational by 2028. The methanol plant would not be operational until 2035.

EY estimates all projects would contribute to total UK emissions reductions of just 0.4% compared to 1990 levels. However, individual sectors could benefit from more significant carbon savings, such as shipping emissions which could be reduced by more than 5% with low-carbon ammonia produced at Grangemouth.

Wait for jobs to go on

EY estimates that Project Willow could create up to 1,100 long-term jobs at Grangemouth by 2040. However, it will be years before most of the expected operational jobs arrive, with most of the first construction jobs not expected until 2027.

According to the report, the number of jobs on the site would only exceed 400 – the number of jobs that will be lost when the refinery closes this year – by 2032, and this assumes all nine projects get the go-ahead. Unite the Union has argued that Petroineos’s existing refinery facilities could be converted to a SAF factory and bring operation much nearer. Unite’s Scottish secretary Derek Thomson said: “The options for the future of the Grangemouth refinery need to be fast-tracked to preserve jobs and skills on the site.

“The workers need to see that the political will exists for a decent future for Grangemouth.”

The Scottish government set aside £25m (US$32.4m) last month to expedite the projects identified in yesterday’s report from EY. The UK government has also promised a “training guarantee” for all refinery staff who want skills training at a local college to help them move into new jobs with local employers.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/18934/grangemouth-credit-treasuregalore-shutterstock_1250322649-16-9.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-03-20 12:57:29.198983

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates taking effect at the start of this year, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly being put at risk by the lack of production and investment within the UK.

The UK and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025 and also the way that SAF must be produced in the future. This is to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support the required growth in SAF production without incentivising farmers to switch from growing food to growing SAF feedstocks.

SAF today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids), however Hydrogen Refinery’s ground-breaking technology is able to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented: “We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery. Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s own target of 10% by 2030.

“What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the UK.”

He added: “The transition to new fuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen. Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller-modern aircraft which we handle and the significant economic value of the flights we support.

“As a local company, Hydrogen Refinery exemplify the deep-rooted technological capabilities of the companies which form part of Farnborough Airport’s aeronautical research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership which will generate significant local inward investment and will reinforce our ambitions to become a Global Sustainability Showcase for Airports around the world.”

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, commented: “We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling. Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The airport ranks among the largest single-site suppliers of SAF, selling over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021. However, the lack of investment and production in the UK threatens SAF sales. This decrease in production comes after the introduction of SAF mandates at the start of 2025.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented:

We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuel developer Hydrogen Refinery. Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s target of 10% by 2030.

The UK and EU have mandated legislation requiring compliance from January 2025, also outlining how SAF will be produced in the future. These mandates are in place to support the development of advanced fuels to support the required growth in SAF.

Waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids) produces almost all SAF. However, Hydrogen Refinery’s technology focuses on producing carbon-negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, said:

We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling. Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF.

Farnborough’s sustainable stance

The deal with Hydrogen Refinery follows a series of successful milestones achieved by Farnborough Airport. In 2024, the Airport Carbon Accreditation Scheme awarded the airport a Level 4+ carbon accreditation status. This makes it one of five UK airports, and the only business aviation airport, to achieve such recognition. The airport also completed one of the largest lightweight solar installations, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its power.

In 2022, before the Farnborough Airshow, the airport became the first to price SAF equal to Jet A1, promoting its adoption. In the same year, Farnborough Airport committed to achieving Net Zero by 2030 or sooner, setting a leading aviation target.

This new deal adds to the list of partnerships Farnborough has made in 2025.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1024px-Farnborough_Airport_-_Red_Arrows_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_1982981.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&ssl=1,N,,2025-03-20 12:57:42.303557

Announcing the green milestone on March 20, 2025, Airbus said its Mirabel A220 site recently welcomed the first tanker truck filled with SAF to power internal operations.

Joining their colleagues around the world, the Airbus A220 teams in Canada will now be able to use SAF for production, customer acceptance and test flights.

“On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too,” Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada said.

According to Airbus, 75% of the planemaker’s aircraft were delivered with SAF in 2024, representing the importance that its customers are also placing on decarbonisation.

While in 2025, Airbus plans that all commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights.

“Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with the conventional aviation fuel (CAF) also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping,” a spokesperson for Airbus explained.

The company, founded by Ashia Livaudais, recently secured a $2.1 million seed round at a $15 million valuation. With this funding, SymbyAI is accelerating its growth, expanding its team, and focusing on deploying its AI-powered platform to enterprise clients.

Raising early-stage funding is notoriously difficult for Alabama-based startups, making SymbyAI’s success even more noteworthy. Livaudais credits gBeta (part of gener8tor) with helping lay the groundwork for the company’s early traction. The accelerator provided key introductions to initial investors and ultimately connected SymbyAI with Antler in Austin, TX—a firm that played a pivotal role in the company’s growth.

Rather than a single lead investor, the $2.1 million seed round was secured through SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) agreements with multiple valued investors, reflecting broad confidence in SymbyAI’s mission and market potential.

SymbyAI reimagines the research process by shifting from static academic papers to dynamic, interactive projects. Researchers use Symby to create workspaces that integrate papers, code, data, and experiments into a single, organized hub. The AI-powered platform automates key aspects of the research lifecycle, offering:

AI-Assisted Peer Review – SymbyAI checks editorial requirements, replicates statistical methods, and detects potential image manipulation.

AI-Enabled Method Replication – Researchers can validate their methods with AI-powered simulations and replications.

Advanced Image Analysis – The system reviews scientific assets for integrity and accuracy.

On-Demand Research Insights – Users can generate AI-driven literature reviews, data simulations, and code replications to enhance their research.

Since raising the seed round in December, SymbyAI has more than doubled its team, growing from four to nine employees. The company has added specialists, including AI research scientists and front-end and back-end developers, to strengthen its platform and meet increasing demand.

SymbyAI’s impact is already being felt across industries. While specific client names remain confidential due to strict agreements, the company serves a diverse range of organizations, including academic publishers, commercial R&D teams, and clinical research centers.

Financially, the company is on an upward trajectory. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) has grown from $450,000 at the time of the previous report to approximately $550,000, with nine signed contracts. The company’s next major milestone? Reaching $1 million in ARR by mid-year, a goal that Livaudais and her team are actively working toward.

Looking ahead, SymbyAI is focused on ensuring smooth early deployments for its enterprise clients, fine-tuning its product, and expanding its reach in the research community. With a clear mission and a rapidly growing team, the company is well-positioned to become a major player in AI-driven research and development.",https://huntsvillebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Untitled-2025-03-17T131744.979.png,N,,2025-03-20 10:56:43.340522

Eddy Liegeois, Head of Aviation Policy at the Commission, presented a comprehensive overview of the EU’s strategic direction, emphasizing a commitment to sustainability, competitiveness, and connectivity.

Liegeois detailed upcoming regulatory changes, including a planned review of the Air Service Regulation in 2026, aimed at streamlining ownership rules and facilitating access to finance. He also outlined plans to revisit airport slot allocation and charges, with a focus on ensuring fairness and promoting green investments.

The Commission’s commitment to the “Destination 2050” initiative, a collaborative effort to achieve net-zero emissions, was highlighted as a cornerstone of its strategy.

However, the session was dominated by a vocal critique of the Commission’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates, particularly the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative.

Nadia Giordimaina of KLM Malta Airlines delivered a pointed assessment, saying that the current regulations “do not work” and are negatively impacting the industry’s sustainability, competitiveness, and connectivity.

Giordimaina raised concerns about the perceived failure of the fuel suppliers’ flexibility mechanism, the disproportionate cost burden placed on airlines without adequate SAF supply, and the detrimental effects on regional routes.

She also highlighted the administrative challenges of justifying conventional fuel uplift for safety reasons, and the cumulative impact of multiple regulatory deadlines.

“Waiting until 2027 to rectify these issues is not an option,” she asserted, calling for urgent action.

Her views were greeted by loud applause from the audience of ERA members.

Liegeois acknowledged the industry’s concerns, emphasizing the early stage of SAF implementation and the need to allow new regulations time to mature. He pointed to existing funding mechanisms designed to support SAF uptake and reiterated the Commission’s commitment to addressing the price gap between conventional and synthetic fuels.

Looking ahead, the Commission plans to unveil a sustainable transport investment plan later this year, outlining an industrial strategy to bolster SAF production and facilitate offtake agreements. While a market for SAF certificates is not currently planned, further consultation remains a possibility. The Commission also reiterated the importance of global solutions for aviation emissions and ongoing work on non-CO2 emissions monitoring.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250320_105310-1-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-03-20 10:57:08.099779

“Nevertheless, we need hydrogen,” Brunini said.
We should not stop because of a 5-10 years delay.” Brunini is also the CEO of airport operator SEA Milan Airports.

His comments come at a time when industry is reviewing its decarbonization goals. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is ramping up too slowly, battery performance is stagnating and Airbus has postponed its ZEROe project, citing a lack of readiness of the hydrogen ecosystem. While the feeling is growing that 2050 targets will be missed, Brunini’s remarks signal a need for renewed stability in the goals aviation is pursuing.

“Let’s not give up on hydrogen,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of the Clean Aviation Annual Forum held March 18-19 here in Brussels. The latest version of the Destination 2050 roadmap devised by industry—including ACI—takes into account Airbus’ delay, he noted. The roadmap’s reliance on hydrogen as a contributor to aviation’s sustainability in the next two decades has thus decreased.

SAF thus has a strengthened leading role in Destination 2050. “Nevertheless, we need hydrogen,” Brunini said. “SAF will not do it alone. We also need new-technology aircraft to reach net zero. We should not stop because of a 5-10 years delay.”

Brunini is also the CEO of airport operator SEA Milan Airports. At Milan Malpensa airport, hydrogen needs would total 100-300 metric tons per day, and the top 10 airports in Europe would need to invest a combined €16 billion ($17.4 billion), he said. For safety reasons, trucks cannot carry hydrogen to airports so pipelines, storage facilities and liquefiers will be required, he said.

“We must work on the first bricks now, let’s not relax, otherwise we will fall into a vicious circle and airframers will blame a lagging infrastructure again,” he said. “Hydrogen will be for short- to medium-range aircraft only, yet it is part of the solution.” As a first step, airports should encourage ground vehicles to use hydrogen so they contribute to creating a critical mass in hydrogen needs, he added.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-03-20 06:56:32.588000

Founded in 1995 by Bob and Kelly King on Maui, Pacific Biodiesel created the first retail biodiesel pump in the U.S. and remains the longest-operating biodiesel producer in the country. Today, it is Hawaiʻi’s only commercial producer of liquid biofuels, generating nearly 6 million gallons of biodiesel annually at its Hawaiʻi Island refinery—all of which is used within the state.

Lt. Governor Sylvia Luke presented the official proclamation to Pacific Biodiesel President Bob King and Director of Operations Jenna Long during a ceremony at the State Capitol last week.

March 18 is also observed nationwide as “National Biodiesel Day,” in tribute to diesel engine inventor Rudolph Diesel, who originally designed his engine to run on renewable plant oils such as peanut oil.

Pacific Biodiesel’s founder, Bob King, played a key role in advancing the biodiesel industry by developing the first commercial-scale technology to recycle used cooking oil into clean-burning biofuel. The company’s first plant, launched at the Central Maui landfill in 1995, laid the foundation for an industry that produced over 2 billion gallons of biodiesel in the U.S. last year.

Many energy transition projects in infancy; expected completion closer to 2030

India to be big exporter of green ammonia to South Korea, Japan, northwest Europe

Vopak to continue pursuing joint ventures to develop value chains

Initiatives include green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier, expanding value chains, and repurposing existing infrastructure to support sustainable feedstocks, according to Vopak president of Asia and Middle East Chris Robblee.

ACCELERATING ENERGY TRANSITION

Vopak is focusing on several key areas to support the global shift toward sustainable energy.

Recently, the company completed its first bio-bunker fuel supply operation in Fujairah in the UAE, the fruits of its infrastructure development for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“For us, new energy is about ensuring we have assets ready for sustainable feedstocks and future products like biofuels and SAF,” Robblee said.

Furthermore, Vopak views ammonia as the most efficient hydrogen transport solution and is actively investing in related projects.

Ammonia is liquid that is a carrier for hydrogen (which is gas), and is easier to store and transport than hydrogen.

“Hydrogen can move in different ways, but ammonia is the most efficient in our view,” said Robblee.

The company is also leveraging its experience in handling hazardous products to expand its carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives, seeing it as a crucial decarbonization pathway.

Recognizing the shift from molecules to electrons, Vopak is entering the battery storage sector to support the changing energy landscape.

INVESTMENT PROGRESS

While Vopak has committed $1 billion to energy transition projects by 2030, only a fraction has been spent so far, as many projects are still in early development stages.

The company has spent a little less than $100 million on projects since it made the pledge in 2022, Vopak CEO Dick Richelle was quoted by newswire agency Reuters in November 2024.

Robblee emphasized the development of energy transition projects will be completed closer to 2030, with the pace of implementation much slower compared with its industrial and gas terminal projects.

Vopak has a capex target of €2 billion for industrial and gas terminals by 2030.

“The thought always was, it’s going to come closer to the 2030 date than our growth spending on industrial and gas terminals. And it’s just because a lot of the projects were in their infancy.

“The big infrastructure projects that we work on take years to develop and then years to get going.”

Ongoing projects include working through Vopak’s Tokyo office to import ammonia for co-firing with coal for power generation.

Japan and South Korea are becoming leading importers of green ammonia as they work to decarbonize newer coal facilities or thermal power plants, Robblee said.

“They have the proven technology that you’re able to co-combust ammonia with … coal,” he added.

“There are a lot of exciting projects in India and the Middle East that we see that flow coming to the East [northeast Asia], as well as the US.”

India is a particular focus for storage and export of green hydrogen and ammonia.

In November 2023, India’s Odisha state approved several green hydrogen and ammonia projects, including an ammonia storage tank project at Gopalpur operated by Aegis Vopak (AVTL), Vopak’s joint venture with India’s Aegis. This facility is designed to store 80,000 tonnes of liquid ammonia.

AVTL, in November 2024, announced it has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) worth Indian rupees (Rs) 35 billion ($405 million) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

A final decision for the IPO is expected in the first half of 2025.

Vopak is also repurposing existing infrastructure in Asia to support sustainable feedstocks.

In 2024, the company repurposed part of its Sebarok terminal in Singapore, commissioning 40,000 tonnes of capacity for blending biofuels into marine fuels.

The Sebarok terminal is earmarked as a sustainable multi-fuels hub, reinforcing Singapore’s status as a leading bunkering center.

VALUE CHAINS STILL IN INFANCY

A major challenge for Vopak in new energy markets is that value chains are still new.

“I think what you’ll see, which is quite normal, is a lot of these value chains aren’t built yet,” he said.

However, Robblee said the company is confident it can safely handle the products of the future.

“We have the capabilities to contribute, to ensure that we give our people our best knowledge to build the assets in a safe and secure manner, in an efficient and [sustainable] manner.”

Vopak also aims to continue working with different partners to develop its energy transition projects.

“We are very accustomed to joint ventures. Across Asia and the Middle East, almost all our business is structured this way.”

For example, Vopak and France’s Air Liquide, in March 2024, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore the development and operation of infrastructure for ammonia import, cracking, and hydrogen distribution in Singapore.

“I think the only difference is, and we’re quite open to it. Maybe the partners that we had in the past aren’t the same partners that we [will have] in the future. And so, we’re looking at that today,” Robblee added.

As of 19 March, Swedavia’s Annual and Sustainability Report for 2024 is available on the company’s website. The past year saw increased international travel, new airline routes at Arlanda, and a stronger operating profit, alongside continued investments in the transition to fossil-free aviation. Passenger volume rose by over one per cent compared to 2023, driven by sustained demand for international travel.

Details on Swedavia’s sustainable efforts in 2024

The growth in travel and higher commercial revenues enabled Swedavia to report a positive operating income for the first time since the pandemic, marking a key milestone in the company’s recovery. The net revenue increased by SEK 462 million compared to the previous year, while operating income improved by SEK 344 million. Cash flow from operating activities also grew by SEK 305 million, strengthening Swedavia’s financial position.

At Stockholm Arlanda Airport, the final stage of the new Marketplace will be completed in the first quarter of 2025, with the last tenants moving in. This, along with the new security control, finalises the modernisation of Terminal 5, which began just before the pandemic. The modernisation significantly improves passenger flows and satisfaction. The new Marketplace also allows for increased profit margins in commercial operations, which will help maintain competitive airport charges.

In 2024, around 40 new routes were added, including 18 entirely new destinations. Notable new services included Air Canada’s direct routes to Toronto and Montreal, and ANA’s new service between Arlanda and Tokyo Haneda, launching in early 2025. Swedavia continues to strengthen its international connectivity.

Domestic air traffic faced challenges, notably with BRA’s closure of its domestic traffic at Bromma Stockholm Airport. Instead, BRA signed a cooperation agreement with SAS, consolidating domestic traffic at Arlanda. This move is crucial for maintaining connectivity across Sweden.

Swedavia also achieved a major milestone, with four of its airports now certified at the highest level by the Airport Carbon Accreditation system.

According to Viva Energy’s general manager for aviation, Nick Adams, the partnership will allow Viva to “expand its ability to supply SAF-blended jet fuel across Australia utilising its infrastructure assets, while exploring regional SAF delivery, storage and handling, and direct into-wing dispensing”.

“It is clear that SAF is going to play a bigger role for commercial airlines in this country as they move towards a more sustainable future,” he said.

“Through this collaboration – and drawing on the strengths of Viva Energy’s national distribution network and experience supplying high-quality fuels and aviation operations – we will be working with Virgin Australia to establish the supply chains that will be critical to the future of the aviation industry.

“Viva Energy is also delighted to be helping a key partner like Virgin Australia in its sustainability journey.”

Other airlines including Qantas and Air New Zealand are making moves towards greater use of SAF, while the Federal Government last month invested $10.4 million into two projects in Queensland through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

This included $2.4 million for Viva to demonstrate SAF use and storage at Brisbane Airport, in which the company will recondition a fuel tank at the Pinkenba Terminal for a commercial supply of blended SAF, with the resulting findings to be shared with other Australian airports to ready their infrastructure for domestic SAF.

The 2023 Boeing/CSIRO SAF Roadmap identified Australia as in a “prime position” to develop a domestic SAF industry.

Wright, speaking in an interview in Louisiana, stated that the aim is to bring the reserve holdings “just close to the top” for optimal operation.
During Biden’s term, approximately 290mbbl were sold from the reserve, including emergency drawdowns and sales mandated by Congress for unrelated expenditures such as infrastructure repairs.
So certainly some of the money we are going to spend is going to be maintenance,” Wright stated.
“Ultimately, that is what it was built for — to have the maximum security for the American people,” Wright stated.","US Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced plans to seek up to US$20 billion in funding to restore the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to its full capacity, echoing President Donald Trump’s commitment to bolstering domestic energy resources.

The SPR, established in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo, can hold up to 700 million barrels (mbbl) of crude oil, serving as a critical safeguard against supply disruptions.

Wright, speaking in an interview in Louisiana, stated that the aim is to bring the reserve holdings “just close to the top” for optimal operation.

Following the announcement, US crude futures experienced a momentary surge, peaking at US$67.68 a barrel in New York.

The SPR’s stockpile was significantly reduced under the previous administration of President Joe Biden in response to soaring gasoline prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Current levels stand at 395mbbl, according to Energy Department data.

During Biden’s term, approximately 290mbbl were sold from the reserve, including emergency drawdowns and sales mandated by Congress for unrelated expenditures such as infrastructure repairs.

Wright indicated that these rapid drawdowns might have caused infrastructure issues due to the reserve’s age.

“Was there some damage from the rapid drawdowns? It appears that there was. So certainly some of the money we are going to spend is going to be maintenance,” Wright stated.

The replenishment plan hinges on Congressional approval of the necessary funding, which remains uncertain.

The Energy Department’s budget for purchases was exhausted after the Biden administration acquired approximately 60mbbl.

Wright disclosed that a specific funding request to Congress has not yet been made.

President Trump has consistently emphasised reinforcing conventional energy sources since his inaugural address in January, which includes enhancing domestic oil production and easing regulations.

Wright emphasised the importance of the SPR in ensuring energy security for the American people.

“Ultimately, that is what it was built for — to have the maximum security for the American people,” Wright stated.

“Australia is a vital market for Embraer, and our presence at Avalon underscores our long-term commitment to the region, said Embraer Commercial Aviation VP Raul Villaron. “With a strong foundation of existing E-Jet operators and the addition of Virgin Australia’s E190-E2 fleet, we’re confident that Embraer aircraft will continue to play a crucial role in connecting communities and driving economic growth across Australia.”

Last year, Embraer and Virgin Australia announced a firm order for eight E190-E2s, as part of Virgin Australia’s fleet renewal plan. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in the second half of this year, and the fleet will be based in Perth, Western Australia.

Building upon the first-generation E-Jets’ 20 years of operational excellence, the E2’s enhanced aerodynamics, novel wing design, and new technologies deliver significant improvements in carbon emissions and fuel burn. It has been certified to fly with blends of up to 50% SAF and has demonstrated through test flights the engine’s compatibility with 100% SAF.

Embraer is committed to developing products, solutions, and technologies to contribute to the aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The E2 family of aircraft is certified to fly with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel and has demonstrated through test flights the engine’s operability with 100% SAF, with full certification expected by 2030, further reinforcing Embraer’s commitment to emissions reduction and sustainable aviation.

Beyond commercial aviation, Embraer’s Defense and Security team will showcase its portfolio of defense aircraft and solutions, including the KC-390 Millennium. Since entering service with the Brazilian Air Force in 2019, the Portuguese Air Force in 2023 and, most recently, the Hungarian Air Force in 2024, the KC-390 has proven its capability, reliability and performance. The current fleet of aircraft in operation has a mission capability rate of 93% and mission completion rates above 99%, demonstrating exceptional productivity in the category.

In addition to Brazil, Portugal, and Hungary, the Netherlands announced their choice for the Millennium in 2022. In 2023, Austria, the Czech Republic and the Republic of Korea also selected the KC-390, confirming the success of this game-changer platform. In 2024, Sweden, Slovakia and an undisclosed customer also opted for the KC-390.

Embraer has been present and supporting customers in Australia since 1978, marking 47 years in the market since Embraer’s first aircraft, the Bandeirante, took to Australia’s skies.",https://spaceanddefense.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Space-and-Defence-Favicon.png,N,,2025-03-20 00:28:45.835177

SAF, produced from renewable resources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-food crops, is considered a critical game-changer in the aviation industry’s efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050. This reflects SAF’s significantly lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions profile compared to that of conventional jet fuel.

Under the terms of the agreement, Viva Energy will provide Virgin Australia with SAF consisting of Jet A1 and a 30-40% synthetic blend component made from waste and residue feedstocks. The blend is fully compatible with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure, and all regulatory and safety requirements.

Through this collaboration, Viva Energy will continue to expand its ability to supply SAF-blended jet fuel across Australia utilising its infrastructure assets, while exploring regional SAF delivery, storage and handling, and direct into-wing dispensing.

Commentary from Virgin Australia

Virgin Australia Chief Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer, Christian Bennett, said the collaboration with Viva Energy is another step forward in Virgin Australia’s sustainability journey, which recognises the long-term importance of alternative fuels to reduce carbon emissions.

“SAF represents the critical long-term opportunity in commercial aviation’s pursuit of its 2050 net zero emissions ambition,” he said.

“Partnership, focused policy development, and collaborations such as this with Viva Energy will be essential if we are to adopt successfully SAF’s broader use in Australia over the years and decades ahead.

“Ensuring SAF is affordable and accessible will be key to achieving lowest cost carbon abatement at the same time as maintaining the essential role of aviation in connecting Australian communities.”

Commentary from Viva Energy

Viva Energy’s General Manager for Aviation, Nick Adams, said the initiative is an important step in the establishment of an ongoing supply of SAF for air travel in regional Australia.

“It is clear that SAF is going to play a bigger role for commercial airlines in this country as they move towards a more sustainable future,” he said.

“Through this collaboration – and drawing on the strengths of Viva Energy’s national distribution network and experience supplying high-quality fuels and aviation operations – we will be working with Virgin Australia to establish the supply chains that will be critical to the future of the aviation industry. Viva Energy is also delighted to be helping a key partner like Virgin Australia in its sustainability journey.”

Commentary from Whitsunday Regional Council

Whitsunday Regional Council Mayor, Ry Collins, has welcomed the introduction of SAF at Whitsunday Coast Airport, calling it a ‘perfect fit’ given the region’s deep connection to the Great Barrier Reef and its commitment to sustainable tourism.

“It makes absolute sense that Virgin Australia would choose Whitsunday Coast Airport as the launch site for its first ongoing SAF-powered services,” Mayor Collins said.

“We are committed to driving initiatives locally that produce world-class bio-products, so I applaud Virgin Australia and Viva Energy for their commitment to SAF and for recognising the Whitsundays as an ideal location to showcase the benefits of sustainable aviation.

“We are located in one of the most pristine and ecologically significant regions in the world, and as the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, we have a responsibility to embrace innovative solutions that reduce our environmental footprint.”

In response, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has released its Corporate Net-Zero Standard Version 2.0 Consultation Draft, introducing a comprehensive framework to elevate corporate accountability, ensure measurable progress, and align climate strategies with the latest scientific benchmarks.

Revised Standard Drives Full-Cycle Accountability

SBTi’s Version 2.0 represents a shift from a target-centric approach to an end-to-end model that emphasizes implementation and continuous improvement. The new framework introduces a validation model that spans the full emissions reduction lifecycle: initial ambition, performance assessment, progress reporting, and target renewal. This model aims to close the accountability gap by requiring companies to demonstrate real-world progress, not just commitments.

Companies must now assess and communicate progress at the end of each five-year cycle, setting new targets that address any performance gaps. This process reinforces accountability and provides a structured pathway to reach—and maintain—a net-zero-aligned state. Importantly, the standard retains 1.5°C as its central ambition, underscoring the need for accelerated action as the window to limit global warming narrows.

Tailored Criteria for Diverse Business Needs

Version 2.0 introduces a differentiated approach based on company size and geographic location. Category A companies—large and medium-sized entities in high-income countries—are subject to comprehensive criteria, while Category B companies—SMEs in lower-income nations—are granted flexibility, with optional criteria in recognition of resource constraints. This structure broadens accessibility while preserving rigor for entities with greater climate impact.

Enhanced Scope 3 Target Framework

Recognizing both the criticality and complexity of value chain emissions, the revised standard abandons the fixed-percentage approach of previous versions. Instead, it prioritizes action on the most relevant emission sources and introduces non-emissions metrics such as procurement from net-zero-aligned suppliers and revenue from low-carbon products and services. This allows companies to substantiate progress even when primary emissions data are limited, aligning with real-world data challenges.

Beyond Value Chain Mitigation Gains Traction

Beyond Value Chain Mitigation (BVCM) is given greater emphasis, rewarding companies that proactively address emissions beyond their operations. By recognizing investments in mitigation activities—such as sustainable aviation fuel or clean energy finance—SBTi encourages companies to take broader responsibility for emissions released during their net-zero transition. These measures are framed as critical to accelerating decarbonization across sectors and geographies.

Business Implications: Strategic Risk and Opportunity

For companies operating in an increasingly regulated and disclosure-driven environment, aligning with Version 2.0 is both a risk mitigation strategy and a competitive advantage. The new requirements for climate transition plans, third-party assurance of emissions inventories, and transparent reporting align closely with evolving mandates such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and recommendations from the UN High-Level Expert Group.

Adopting the revised standard enables businesses to attract sustainable capital, manage reputational and regulatory risks, and demonstrate leadership in climate governance.

,,2025-03-19 18:30:59+00:00,NewsForKids.net,US Solar and Wind: More Power Than Coal in 2024 - NewsForKids.net,Not Available,,,,,https://newsforkids.net/articles/2025/03/19/us-solar-and-wind-more-power-than-coal-in-2024/,"Last year, the US got more of its electricity from wind and solar power than from coal.
In 2024, wind and solar power provided 17% of the electricity in the US.
Ember says that in 2018, just six years ago, coal produced three times as much electricity as wind and solar power combined.
Though solar is growing much faster, wind energy is still bigger than solar, providing about 10% of the country’s electricity.
But Ember’s report suggests that as more large-scale battery stations are added to the grid, solar power will be available around the clock, too.","Last year, the US got more of its electricity from wind and solar power than from coal. It’s the first time that’s ever happened, and it shows how quickly the US is moving toward cleaner energy sources. Because renewable energy is so cheap, it will probably continue to grow, despite President Donald Trump’s push to increase fossil fuel use.

The US gets its electricity from many different sources. In 2024, around 58% of the country’s electricity came from fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, and coal.

But Ember, a company that studies energy use, says renewable energy is growing rapidly. In 2024, wind and solar power provided 17% of the electricity in the US. For the first time ever, these renewables beat coal, which provided just 15% of the US’s electricity.

That’s a huge change. Ember says that in 2018, just six years ago, coal produced three times as much electricity as wind and solar power combined.

Wind and solar energy are growing because they’ve gotten cheaper and cheaper. That’s especially true for solar power, which produced 81% of the extra electricity added to the grid last year. Though solar is growing much faster, wind energy is still bigger than solar, providing about 10% of the country’s electricity.

Under Ex-President Joe Biden, the US government worked hard to promote renewable energy. That changed when Mr. Trump took office in January. Mr. Trump is pushing hard to promote polluting fossil fuels.

Even so, experts say renewable energy will probably continue to grow. The main reason is that renewable energy sources are cheaper. The US added 50 gigawatts of solar power in a single year last year. That’s enough to supply the electricity required by more than 37 million average US homes. And solar energy is expected to grow even more in the future.

Natural gas is still a major source of energy in the US. It produced about 42.5% of the country’s electricity last year. Natural gas is cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel, and makes the climate crisis worse.

Fuels like natural gas have one big advantage – they can supply power even at night. Solar electricity is only produced when the sun is shining. But Ember’s report suggests that as more large-scale battery stations are added to the grid, solar power will be available around the clock, too.

For years, the demand for electricity in the US has remained about the same. But now, demand is rising, and it’s expected to keep going up. There are several reasons, including more large computer centers providing Artificial Intelligence (AI) services, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and an increase in the number of electric cars.

To reduce pollution and fight climate change, the US will need to continue to grow its renewable energy sources. Another report released last week says that by 2040, the country will need 900 more gigawatts of renewable energy and battery storage.

Dave Jones, who led the study for Ember, believes that with battery storage, solar will grow faster and remain cheaper than natural gas. “Solar is winning,” he says.",https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/us-2024-energy-production-1200.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 17:57:24.470869

Combustion tests performed by ONERA

Evry, 19 March 2025 – 05:45 p.m.: Global Bioenergies' Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been tested in collaboration with Safran on the injection phase, and with ONERA on the combustion phase.

The Company supplied a batch of SAF to Safran, the world's second-largest aircraft equipment manufacturer, to evaluate the specific properties of Global Bioenergies' SAF, used in its neat form, during the fuel injection phase prior to combustion in the engine. This phase is crucial to ensure, among other things, high efficiency and therefore lower fuel consumption. A test campaign was carried out near Rouen at CERTAM (regional innovation center of technological exchange in aerothermal and engines).

Frédéric Ollivier, CTO at Global Bioenergies, says:” The various simulations carried out by the CERTAM demonstrator have enabled us to test the behavior of our fuel under various conditions representative of an aircraft engine. Injecting Global Bioenergies’ SAF, without blending it with kerosene, produces a spray of fine, homogeneous droplets, very similar to the spray from Jet A-1, the standard fossil kerosene. These tests are feeding into the data that enable a better match between engine and fuel.”

ONERA, the French aerospace research center, has also carried out tests on a laboratory burner to quantify the particles emitted during combustion of Global Bioenergies' SAF.

Emission levels were measured using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies, Jet A-1 as a control, and a blend of 50% SAF and 50% Jet A-1 (the maximum proportion currently authorized by ASTM when certifying Global Bioenergies’ process). These three batches of fuel were injected into the laboratory burner in order to quantify and characterize the non-volatile particles emitted during combustion, i.e. soot. Several representative conditions were tested to simulate soot emission levels, both on the ground and in flight.

The results obtained using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies show a 40-99% reduction in soot emissions compared with Jet A-1 fuel, depending on the conditions tested in the laboratory. The results obtained from the 50-50 blend show a reduction in particulate matter that is globally proportional to the SAF incorporation rate.

Louise Ganeau, research engineer at ONERA, explains:” Soot emitted during fuel combustion has an impact on air quality in airport areas. Incorporating SAFs such as Global Bioenergies’ into the fossil fuel landscape would help reduce soot emissions locally, and cut particulate pollution. Furthermore, from an environmental standpoint, SAF have a role to play in reducing net CO₂ emissions thanks to the way they are manufactured.”

Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies, concludes:” The properties of our fuel had already been validated when it obtained ASTM certification. The tests carried out today in the best French laboratories go even further in characterizing our product. These validations strengthen the attractiveness of our offer.”

More information More about the KIT Energy Center","Fuels like kerosene can be produced in a climate-friendly way from CO2, water and green electricity using Power-to-Liquid processes. Researchers from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have already demonstrated this with systems in actual operation. Now, researchers working on the Kopernikus P2X project have succeeded for the first time in coupling – at an industrial 220-kilowatt scale – the highly efficient co-electrolysis process with fuel synthesis. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

In order to achieve its climate targets, Europe needs green alternatives for applications that do not easily lend themselves to electrification. “The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,” says Professor Roland Dittmeyer from KIT’s Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT). “Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable.” Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project and heads the corresponding research activities at KIT. The project has now reached an important technological milestone on the way to sustainable aviation fuel: For the first time in the world, the innovative, highly efficient water vapor/CO2 co-electrolysis technology from industrial partner Sunfire was coupled directly with a synthesis process at an industry-relevant scale (220 kilowatts of electrolysis output).

Co-electrolysis Makes Power-to-Liquid More Efficient

For the production of synthetic kerosene at KIT’s Energy Lab, a multi-stage process distributed to modular facilities is used. First, syngas – a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide – is produced from CO2 and water. In principle, there are several ways to generate syngas. The new configuration uses a co-electrolysis module with an output of 220 kilowatts from industry partner Sunfire, which simplifies this process step and, above all, boosts its efficiency. “Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step. Up to 85 percent of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas. In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,” says Hubertus Richter, Senior Engineer R&D Project Management & Process Engineering at Sunfire. “This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.”

For the coupled operation of co-electrolysis and fuel synthesis, the syngas needs to be brought to reaction pressure. This job is done by a compressor with safety devices the researchers added to the process chain. In a microstructured reactor, the syngas is then converted to long-chain hydrocarbons – known as syncrude – using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These hydrocarbons can be used directly to produce fuels such as kerosene or other chemical products. Scientists at KIT developed this reactor technology, which is already being commercialized by INERATEC, a KIT spin-off. For the future, it is planned to use the heat released as vapor during synthesis for the co-electrolysis. This would further reduce the energy demand of the entire process and demonstrate that the product preparation to finally obtain kerosene is feasible at this scale. By combining these process steps, it is possible to fully utilize the carbon dioxide provided and achieve the highest possible energy conversion efficiency, as this process chain allows efficient recycling of material flows in addition to the energy flows.

The Next Step: A Tonne of Kerosene per Day

Researchers at KIT successfully tested the integration of co-electrolysis in campaign operation under real conditions, producing up to one hundred liters of syncrude per day. Coupled operation marks an important milestone in the second funding phase of the Kopernikus P2X project. The facility is now being expanded for a capacity of up to 300 liters syncrude per day. In the third and final funding phase, the research team has INERATEC additionally build a larger Fischer-Tropsch production facility in the Höchst Industrial Park near Frankfurt. “For the first time, tonne-scale production will be realized there,” says Dittmeyer. The product, which will eventually be processed into kerosene, will be used by aircraft engine manufacturers and research partners for testing. Accompanying analyses ensure that the fuel meets the strict aviation standards.

About the Kopernikus P2X Project

In the Kopernikus P2X project, partners Climeworks, Sunfire, INERATEC, and the Institute for Micro Process Engineering are establishing and operating an integrated process chain at KIT’s Energy Lab. Based on the “Power-to-Fuel” concept, carbon-neutral fuels, known as e-fuels, can be produced in this way. The project, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), involves 18 partners from industry and science as well as civil-society organizations.

This fuel is crucial for reducing the aviation sector's carbon footprint and addressing global warming. Collaborating with industry leaders like Safran Aircraft Engines and ONERA, Global Bioenergies has conducted extensive injection and combustion tests that underline the capabilities of their innovative SAF.

Collaboration with Industry Leaders

Global Bioenergies has partnered with Safran, the second-largest aircraft equipment manufacturer in the world, to explore the unique properties of their SAF during the fuel injection phase. This phase is essential for ensuring high efficiency and reducing fuel consumption in engines. Testing took place at CERTAM, a center dedicated to technological innovation in aerothermal systems and engine technologies, where several simulations were conducted.

Understanding the Injection Phase

According to Frédéric Ollivier, the Chief Technology Officer at Global Bioenergies, “The simulations allowed us to evaluate our fuel's behavior under various engine conditions. The results indicated that when injected without blending, our SAF produces a spray of fine, homogeneous droplets, closely resembling that of Jet A-1, a conventional kerosene. This is a promising outcome for matching engine performance with fuel properties.”

Combustion Tests and Emission Analysis

In tandem with the injection tests, ONERA has been analyzing the combustion performance of Global Bioenergies' SAF. This aspect is vital since it impacts not only the efficiency of the fuel but also the air quality in regions surrounding airports. During these combustion tests, emissions from the SAF were measured against standard Jet A-1 and a 50-50 blend of SAF and Jet A-1. The aim was to quantify the non-volatile particles emitted, which are a crucial factor in determining the environmental impact of emissions.

Results that Matter

The findings have been encouraging. Tests showed that using neat SAF resulted in a remarkable 40-99% reduction in soot emissions compared to traditional Jet A-1, which varies depending on specific test conditions. Similarly, the 50-50 blend demonstrated a proportional reduction in particulate emissions, illustrating the effectiveness of integrating SAF into conventional fuel systems.

Environmental Impact and Future Directions

Louise Ganeau, a research engineer at ONERA, highlighted the implications of these results for air quality and pollution control. “Soot emissions from combustion fuel significantly impact air quality, especially around airports. By introducing SAFs like those developed by Global Bioenergies, we can considerably lower local soot levels and mitigate particulate pollution. This innovation also supports a broader reduction in net CO? emissions due to the sustainable manufacturing process behind SAF,” she explained.

Strengthening Market Position

Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies, reiterated the significance of their SAF achievements. He stated, “The validation of our fuel properties through ASTM certification confirmed our position in the market. Now, with further testing in reputed French laboratories, we can better characterize our product. These developments enhance our market attractiveness.”

Combustion tests performed by ONERA

Evry, 19 March 2025 – 05:45 p.m.: Global Bioenergies' Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been tested in collaboration with Safran on the injection phase, and with ONERA on the combustion phase.

The Company supplied a batch of SAF to Safran, the world's second-largest aircraft equipment manufacturer, to evaluate the specific properties of Global Bioenergies' SAF, used in its neat form, during the fuel injection phase prior to combustion in the engine. This phase is crucial to ensure, among other things, high efficiency and therefore lower fuel consumption. A test campaign was carried out near Rouen at CERTAM (regional innovation center of technological exchange in aerothermal and engines).

Frédéric Ollivier, CTO at Global Bioenergies, says:” The various simulations carried out by the CERTAM demonstrator have enabled us to test the behavior of our fuel under various conditions representative of an aircraft engine. Injecting Global Bioenergies’ SAF, without blending it with kerosene, produces a spray of fine, homogeneous droplets, very similar to the spray from Jet A-1, the standard fossil kerosene. These tests are feeding into the data that enable a better match between engine and fuel.”

ONERA, the French aerospace research center, has also carried out tests on a laboratory burner to quantify the particles emitted during combustion of Global Bioenergies' SAF.

Emission levels were measured using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies, Jet A-1 as a control, and a blend of 50% SAF and 50% Jet A-1 (the maximum proportion currently authorized by ASTM when certifying Global Bioenergies’ process). These three batches of fuel were injected into the laboratory burner in order to quantify and characterize the non-volatile particles emitted during combustion, i.e. soot. Several representative conditions were tested to simulate soot emission levels, both on the ground and in flight.

The results obtained using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies show a 40-99% reduction in soot emissions compared with Jet A-1 fuel, depending on the conditions tested in the laboratory. The results obtained from the 50-50 blend show a reduction in particulate matter that is globally proportional to the SAF incorporation rate.

Louise Ganeau, research engineer at ONERA, explains:” Soot emitted during fuel combustion has an impact on air quality in airport areas. Incorporating SAFs such as Global Bioenergies’ into the fossil fuel landscape would help reduce soot emissions locally, and cut particulate pollution. Furthermore, from an environmental standpoint, SAF have a role to play in reducing net CO₂ emissions thanks to the way they are manufactured.”

Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies, concludes:” The properties of our fuel had already been validated when it obtained ASTM certification. The tests carried out today in the best French laboratories go even further in characterizing our product. These validations strengthen the attractiveness of our offer.”

Morisora is due to be formally launched in March, with plans to start bioethanol production in 2027 at Nippon Paper’s Iwanuma Mill in Miyagi prefecture, northeastern Japan. Commercial-scale operations are anticipated to begin around 2030.

The bioethanol will be primarily used as feedstock for SAF, though it may also be utilised in other applications, including blending with petrol, fuel cells, cosmetics, and as a raw material in chemical production.

​Japan is actively advancing SAF initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector.​ But so far no commercial production has started. However, Cosmo Energy Holdings is due to start supplying 30,000 kg of the fuel annually from its Sakai refinery in Osaka this April, utilising used cooking oil as feedstock.

The government plans to produce 1.7mn kg of SAF annually by 2030. To support this goal, it has allocated approximately JPY340bn (around $2.2bn) over five years, starting from fiscal year 2025, to bolster SAF manufacturing and supply chain development.

Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is proposing stricter regulations for SAF producers. These regulations aim for a minimum 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

The refinery’s closure, after 100 years of production, is expected to hit up to 2,000 jobs in the east of Scotland. Trade union leaders and policymakers see Grangemouth as a casestudy in ensuring the transition from oil and gas is fair and just.

Swinney said workers and local businesses faced “enormous difficulties”.

“What we have to make sure is that we manage the transition from the dependence on fossil fuels to an approach that delivers net zero,” he said. “I think it can be done at scale [and] I’m confident we can deliver those new prospects for these communities.”

He was speaking after the UK and Scottish governments published a report from the consultancy EY that said up to 1,200 jobs could be created by attracting low-carbon businesses to Grangemouth. However, that would be too late for workers being laid off this year.

EY identified nine industries including plastics recycling; biorefining of chemicals from organic waste; bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel production; biomethane production from organic waste; and low-carbon hydrogen from renewable sources and ammonia.

Those industries would require substantial investment, the report said. About £3.5bn would be needed to create about 800 jobs over the next decade. As much as £7.5bn could be spent if those businesses expanded, to create 1,200 jobs by 2040.

Earlier in March Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced £200m in UK government funding to help support five green businesses at Grangemouth; the Scottish government has put up £25m for a just transition fund.

Michael Shanks, the UK government’s energy minister, chaired a local taskforce meeting with Gillian Martin, the Scottish government’s net zero secretary, on Wednesday morning. “We are committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth,” he said.

Energy analysts and environment campaigners are sceptical about some of these technologies, in particular mass production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, because they believe the costs and energy involved greatly outweigh the gains.

But Mark Simmers, chief executive of Celtic Renewables, a Grangemouth-based firm where Swinney launched the report, which is already making green chemicals, said he believed the plans were realistic.

His firm, which makes acetone, butanol and ethanol by fermenting whisky byproducts, waste potatoes and molasses, hopes to build a plant eight to 10 times larger than its current factory at the refinery site. Its products help make nail varnish, paints, medicines and household cleaning products, replacing crude oil-based chemicals.

“We’ve got this great facility with a range of utilities, land and a lot of resources from a feed stocks perspective, but also from a people perspective,” Simmers said. “So repurposing that for a low carbon manufacturing complex, I think is a great and a realisable plan.”

The investment agency Scottish Enterprise would oversee possible investments, Swinney said. “This is going to take time. It’s going to take investment, and it’s going to take commitment, but the Scottish government is here for the long haul,” he said.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4374b178d95babe673725eebe312258f148b4ca7/0_194_5808_3485/master/5808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3930b4e46621ef62cb8ec9ae75535b99,N,,2025-03-19 12:57:28.225603

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

AMERICAS

Renewable rollback – US President Donald Trump revoked several executive orders (EOs) issued by former President Biden on Mar. 14, including EOs that supported domestic production of solar panels and electric heat pumps, reversing policies that facilitated their manufacturing under the Defence Production Act. President Trump also ordered reductions to multiple federal entities, including the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars at the Smithsonian, a nonpartisan think tank which focuses on climate change and Arctic research.

Regulation rebellion – A coalition of 137 energy, agriculture, and transportation industry groups urged Congress on Monday to block California’s vehicle regulations, which include mandates for electric vehicle adoption and a ban on new gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicle sales by 2035. In a letter to congressional leaders, the organisations argued that these policies, adopted by multiple states, restrict consumer choice, increase reliance on foreign supply chains, and pose risks to national security. They supported US EPA’s decision to submit the regulations for congressional review, contending that such sweeping rules should be determined at the federal level rather than dictated by California.

Offsets optimised – Northern Trust, a US-based financial services company, has been selected by Bayer, a multinational company focused on pharmaceuticals and agriculture, to provide digital lifecycle management for its voluntary carbon credits programme. Bayer will use The Northern Trust Carbon Ecosystem, a digital platform, to record, track, and facilitate transactions of verified carbon credits, linking them to their US state of origin and vintage year. The initiative aims to support Bayer’s Crop Science division, which promotes regenerative agriculture through its ForGround platform, offering incentives for farmers adopting sustainable practices.

Forest plan partnership – The Brazilian Forestry Service (FSB) has signed a cooperation agreement with PlanaFlor – an initiative of non-profit Environmental Exchange of Rio de Janeiro (BVRio) and the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (FBDS) for strategic implementation of the Forest Code – to drive environmental regularisation and enhance economic incentives for the conservation of native vegetation in Brazil. This partnership seeks to develop strategic actions within PlanaFlor, and through the agreement, the institutions commit to jointly formulate strategies to promote the environmental regularisation of rural properties and encourage mechanisms for “Legal Reserve” compensation, such as Environmental Reserve Credits (CRAs). Furthermore, the cooperation includes activities aimed at improving regulations and instruments related to Environmental Regularisation Programmes (PRAs) and Degraded Area Recovery Projects (PRADAs), including enhancing procedures and public policies.

Carbon-free cargo – California and Shanghai transportation leaders convened Wednesday at the Port of Long Beach to advance efforts to decarbonise maritime trade through the development of a Green Shipping Corridor. The forum brought together representatives from California state agencies, the ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Shanghai, as well as industry and environmental stakeholders to discuss infrastructure investments and policies necessary to support low- and zero-carbon shipping. The collaboration builds on previous agreements between California and Shanghai to promote clean transportation.

Advancing exemptions – An amended House Bill 1912 (HB 1912) passed its chamber of origin in Washington on Mar. 12 with a 93–4 vote. In its latest iteration, HB 1912 directed the state’s Department of Ecology (ECY) to publish guidelines by Oct. 1 for potentially eligible users of exempt agricultural fuel to receive compensation under the cap-and-trade programme. The substitute bill also mandated the ECY to maintain this exemption until Dec. 31, 2029. A previous version of this bill established reporting requirements for the sale of exempt fuels used for agricultural purposes under the Climate Commitment Act (CCA), but the latest text scraps such provisions. HB 1912 is now being considered in the Senate Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee.

EMEA

Let’s party – The Dutch political parties GroenLinks and PvdA have announced plans to consult their members on strengthening their cooperation and potentially forming a new party. A joint congress on June 21 will allow members to vote on the proposal. GroenLinks President Katinka Eikelenboom highlighted widespread concern among progressive voters, while GroenLinks International Secretary Gebke van Gaal emphasised their commitment to green and left-wing politics in Europe. The European Green Party welcomed the move, with co-chair Ciaran Cuffe praising the alliance’s role in opposing the far-right Dutch government and defending democracy, human rights, and climate action. Co-chair Vula Tsetsi reiterated the importance of progressive alliances at all levels of governance. GroenLinks and PvdA formed an electoral alliance in 2023, finishing second to the far-right PVV. They also led in the 2024 European Parliament elections in the Netherlands, securing 21% of the vote. As the largest opposition force, they continue to challenge the Dutch governing coalition of PVV, VVD, NSC, and BBB.

Green claims clarity, please – Trade association IETA is asking EU policymakers for clarity on the future use of emission reduction and removal credits, ahead of technical negotiations on the bloc’s Green Claims Directive. The proposed law would establish rules for substantiating business-to-consumer corporate environmental claims in the EU, including in the use of carbon credits. Members of the European Parliament are pushing to limit the use of carbon credits in corporate claims, and to set conditions on how credits can be used, going beyond disclosure requirements. In a statement on Tuesday, IETA argued that companies should be able to use emission reduction and removal credits for compensation claims that drive climate efforts. The claims should not be limited to the residual emissions at the point a company has reached net zero – as was proposed in the negotiations – because it would deter companies from acting, said IETA Managing Director Andrea Abrahams.

Renewable liquid gas – Europe could produce up to 27.4 mln tonnes (350 TWh) of renewable liquid gas (rLG) annually by 2050 – or enough to meet most of Europe’s current LPG demand, found a new report from Liquid Gas Europe on Tuesday. rLGs can reduce GHG emissions by more than 80% compared to traditional LPG, positioning them as a vital solution to decarbonise off-grid heating, industrial processes, and transport – particularly in rural areas and in industries where electrification is challenging. This makes rLGs critical in achieving Europe’s 2040 and 2050 climate targets, the trade association said. Feedstocks for production are primarily waste-based, such as agricultural residues, animals fats, and used cooking oils. The rLG supply prognosis is premised on “strong policy support and technological advancements”. (Liquid Gas Europe)

Target delay – UBS has pushed back its target to cut GHG emissions to net zero from 2025 to 2035, blaming its acquisition of crosstown rival Credit Suisse for the delay. The move, announced in UBS’s latest sustainability report published this week, reflected its “enlarged corporate real estate portfolio” following the state-orchestrated takeover of Credit Suisse in 2023. It follows HSBC’s decision to push back its net zero timeline to 2050, while banks and other large companies have been reassessing their climate commitments following the election of US Donald Trump in November. UBS remains a member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance however, despite withdrawals by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup. Members of the group are set to vote in coming weeks on whether to ditch the pledge to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and instead settle for warming of 2C. (FT)

Carbon project template – The Russian registry of carbon units RSPP Committee on Climate Policy and Carbon Regulation has developed a unified template for the design and technical documentation of climate projects. The template is intended to simplify and cut the cost of project registration, making it more accessible to companies. To date, 50 climate projects have already been registered in the Russian registry, more than 32 mln carbon units have been issued, of which more than 20,000 have already been used to offset the carbon footprint, according to the statement on the registry website. The template minimises potential errors and complies with national carbon standards. It was developed with the support of the Russian operator of the carbon unit registry — JSC Kontur.

Scottish trees – Extensive work is underway in Scotland to plant more than half a million trees on university land to absorb 1 mln tonnes of carbon and create a natural haven. The planting project will take place across land in Stirlingshire and the Pentland Hills Regional Park owned by the University of Edinburgh. Some 570,000 saplings are being planted across about 5,600 ha of land, of which 4,800 ha is owned by partners, with aims to combat climate change by restoring peatland and expanding forest. However, recent studies from other Scottish institutions, have shown that tree planting, especially in certain ecosystems like heather moorland, might not always lead to net carbon sequestration, as soil carbon losses can outweigh the carbon stored in the trees, particularly in the first few decades. In one Scottish study over a period of 39 years, planting native trees on heather moorlands, with large soil carbon stores, found no evidence of net carbon sequestration. The University of Edinburgh project has been approved by Scottish Forestry. (the Scotsman)

Risk assessment – South Korean banks and other financial institutions may lose nearly 46 trillion won ($31.83 bln) by around 2100 if the country fails to properly address climate change, the central bank said Tuesday, according to Yonhap. If the government belatedly pushes for net-zero policies after 2030, their losses would amount to around 40 tln won, according to a climate stress test conducted by the Bank of Korea (BOK). However, the losses would be as low as 27 tln won if the government achieves its zero emission targets by 2050 or reduces carbon emissions by half by that time, the test showed.

House of cards – Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is planning to exit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), following a Wall Street-led exodus that has gone global, according to a Bloomberg report. A spokesperson for MUFJ told the news agency that the bank has yet to come to a decision. Meanwhile, NZBA is considering rolling back its mitigation target to just above 2C, from 1.5C at present, a former member said at an event in New York on Monday. Sumitomo and Nomura Holdings exited the alliance recently, leaving Mizuho as the only Japanese megabank in the group.

Rice project – Japanese agricultural firm Suzunari has teamed up with Tsuda Bussan to implement initiatives targeting the creation of J-Credits as part of their sustainable agricultural activities, the companies announced Tuesday. Suzunari will help farmers reduce GHG emissions by extending the length of paddy field drainage, according to the statement. The Norinchukin Bank supported the matching of the two companies in this collaboration.

Aussie rules – Australian project developer Wilderlands has sold over 100,000 voluntary biodiversity credits in less than four months through its partnership with Tasman Environmental Markets (TEM), it said in a post on LinkedIn. The figure follows Wilderlands saying it had sold 70,000 biodiversity credits in the three months up to Dec. 2024 under the same mechanism. In Sep. 2024 it launched an ‘Extended Impact’ solution, selling Wilderlands’ Biological Diversity Units alongside an equal number of carbon units on the TEM online marketplace.

Sweet credits – US-based soil carbon developer Boomitra has partnered with EID Parry, an Indian sugar producer, to advance sustainable sugarcane farming practices in the South Asian nation by equipping farmers with regenerative agricultural tools, improving soil health, and unlocking access to carbon finance. The partnership will leverage cutting-edge technology to quantify and certify soil carbon sequestration, enabling farmers to earn income through verified carbon credits while playing a critical role in reducing global GHG emissions, the developer said in a statement.

Mates rates – A forestry programme financed by Norway is attracting criticism for appointing to key positions personnel with little climate experience. Mongabay reports that Forestry Minister Raja Juli Antoni has appointed several members of his own party to key positions. The FOLU Net Sink 2030 initiative which is designed to reduce forestry emissions from the sector and forests to absorb more carbon than they release. The paper also reports the salaries, up to $3,000 a month, are considered much too high for the relative positions.

INVESTMENT

Leaving the table – Sarasin & Partners has divested from Equinor, citing the oil major’s failure to align its strategy with global climate goals. The British asset manager first invested in the company in 2021 and played a major role in the Climate Action 100+ initiative, as well as leading investor talks with Equinor over its emissions concerns. The decision by Sarasin highlights its frustration with the board’s resistance to align Equinor with the 1.5C Paris aligned pathway. In February, Equinor cut its clean energy targets, lowering its projected clean energy capacity to 10-12 GW by 2030, down from the previous target of 12-16 GW. The move came in the wake of peers BP and Shell watering down their climate goals last year. (BusinessGreen)

SCIENCE & TECH

UNDP upgrade – Countries using the National Carbon Registry of the United National Development Programme (UNDP) now have the option of using Hedera Guardian, which provides auditable, traceable, and reproducible records that document the process and lifecycle of environmental assets. The Guardian enables Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) and enforces on-chain methodologies, ensuring that credit issuance and transfers are immutable and tamper-proof. The UNDG has partnered with Xeptagon to leverage the Hedera public distributed ledger network.

AVIATION

Account for your SAF – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has improved its IATA CO2 Connect emissions calculator to account for carbon emissions reductions related to the usage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Initially, CO2 Connect will apply equal per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. But in future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added, the organisation wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday. The news follows the recent publication of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology, which includes specific accounting rules and practices on how to include SAF in per-passenger CO2 data. IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data contrasting with other calculators that primarily rely on modeled averages. Some 60 airlines now contribute data to CO2 Connect.

The Grangemouth industrial complex is one of Scotland's major manufacturing facilities - but the imminent closure of Scotland's only oil refinery threatens 400 jobs.

Project Willow, a £1.5m feasibility study funded by the UK and Scottish governments, looks at potential low-carbon alternative uses for the wider site.

Consultants EY evaluated 300 technologies - and came up with nine ideas that could be developed with private sector investment.

1. Hydrothermal plastics recycling

This involves breaking down hard-to-recycle plastics such as clingfilm-type products to produce naptha and pyrolysis oil vapour.

Currently these plastics are usually incinerated or go to landfill.

They could instead be reused in plastics production or refined as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

It would require about £150m-£250m of capital investment, create 35-60 jobs and operations could start before the end of 2028

2. Dissolution plastics recycling

This uses chemicals to dissolve waste plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene.

The material can then be reused to create new plastic products or packaging.

Between 35 and 45 jobs could be created, with operations commencing late in 2028.

A relatively low amount of capital investment of £25m-£30m would be required.

Such technology could make use of plastic derived from bottle deposit return schemes when they are introduced across the UK.

3. Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol biorefining

Waste and by-products from sectors like food, drink, packaging and agriculture could be fermented using bacteria.

This could produce low-carbon chemical products such as acetone, butanol or ethanol.

Raw materials are plentiful - the amount of paper and cardboard waste currently produced in the UK is about 50 times the capacity of the plant being proposed for Grangemouth.

EY believes 80-100 jobs could be created through £215m-£265m of capital investment, with operations starting in 2030.

4. Second generation bioethanol

Sustainably-sourced Scottish timber and timber waste could be broken down and fermented to produce bioethanol.

This is used in fuel blending, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

This option would compliment plans to scale up the amount of softwood production through forestry in Scotland.

Between 50 and 60 jobs would be created from £350m-£430m of investment with production starting in 2032.

5. Anaerobic digestion

Anaerobic digestion is already carried out at dozens of small-scale plants across Scotland.

The process takes animal waste and sewage sludge and ferments it into biomethane.

The gas can then be used by local industry or injected into the gas grid.

Although burning it releases carbon dioxide, it is considered carbon neutral because the carbon originates from the atmosphere rather than underground.

The report says an investment of £15m-£25m would create 5 -10 jobs by 2028.

6. Hydrogenated esters and fatty acids

Fats, oils and certain crops potentially grown in Scotland can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

The process would require hydrogen - but that could be produced sustainably.

China is currently investing heavily in this kind of fat and oil conversion technology, so an adequate supply of raw materials from Scotland would have to be secured.

This would come in part from used cooking oil, tallow and fish oil but would need to be supplemented by oil seed crop production.

It would require hefty investment, from £740m-£900m, but would also save a lot of carbon emissions and support 90-120 jobs. Production could start by 2032.

7. Hydrogen fuel switching

Hydrogen can be produced from water using a process called electrolysis. It requires electricity but this could come from renewable sources provided it is cheap enough.

Low-carbon hydrogen could then be used as a replacement for natural gas in industrial processes.

The reports says the UK government should reform the energy market to reduce the cost of renewable electricity to industrial consumers, making green hydrogen production more commercially attractive.

About 25-30 jobs would be created by late 2030 with £210m-£250m of investment required.

8. E-methanol for aviation fuel

If enough low-carbon hydrogen is produced at a reasonable cost, this could in turn be used to make methanol - which can be converted to aviation fuel.

Grangemouth is already a supplier of far less environmentally-friendly jet fuels to Scottish airports.

Such manufacturing facilities could create between 240 and 270 jobs but it would be 2036 before production gets under way.

This option would also require around £2bn of new investment in the site.

9. E-ammonia

Another potential use of low-carbon hydrogen is to turn it into ammonia.

This could be used to decarbonise shipping, as ammonia-powered engine technology develops, and it is also used by the chemicals industry.

As with e-methanol production, it requires electricity to be cheap enough to make the large-scale production of green hydrogen more commercially viable.

The amount of hydrogen required is so large that so-called ""blue hydrogen"" could also be necessary, produced from natural gas with the carbon dioxide by-product piped to north-east Scotland to be buried underground.

The proposed Project Acorn carbon capture scheme at Peterhead missed out on a first round of UK funding but an update on support is expected this summer.

EY estimates it would take a decade or more before e-ammonia production would start but between 180 and 210 jobs would eventually be created and there would be significant emissions benefits.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4eb6/live/d61b1130-04c2-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 12:57:35.784618

English and Welsh roads hit by lack of spending: Survey

London, 19 March (Argus) — More than half of the local road network in England and Wales has less than 15 years of structural life left because of insufficient allocation of government funding to local authorities, according to the latest Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (ALARM) survey. The survey, compiled annually by UK industry body Asphalt Industry Association (AIA), found that 52pc, or around 106,000 miles, of the English and Welsh road network managed by local authorities had just 15 years life remaining, and that nearly a third of these roads — around 34,600 miles — may only have up to five years life left. The survey found that in the next 12 months, 24,400 miles, or 12pc, of the network is likely to need some form of maintenance and that just 1.5pc of the local road network was resurfaced over the last year. Although there has been over £20bn ($26bn) spent on carriageway maintenance in England and Wales over the last decade, ""due to the short-term nature of the allocation of funding, it has resulted in no quantifiable uplift to the condition and resilience of the network,"" AIA Chair David Giles said. He added there needs to be a complete change in mindset away from short-term to longer term funding commitments, and he asked the UK government to set a minimum five-year funding horizon and substantially increase investments for local roads maintenance work. UK bitumen consumption has been steadily falling in recent years, with another 10.5 decline registered in 2024, hitting its lowest levels since 2016, according to UK government's department for energy security and net zero (DESNZ) data. The consumption drop coincided with a 20.3pc jump to 449,000t in UK production of the heavy oil product used mainly in road paving as well as general construction, combining to sharply reduce the country's bitumen import requirements. The ALARM survey also found that there had been no improvements in as much as 94pc of the England and Wales local network over the last year. To maintain their network, the survey showed that in England and Wales, local authorities would have needed an extra £7.4m each in 2024 and £16.81bn in total, as a one-off cash injection, to bring their networks up to their ""ideal"" conditions.

UK study sets out Grangemouth's post-refining future

Edinburgh, 19 March (Argus) — A government-funded study has identified nine potential low-carbon and renewable options for the Grangemouth site in Scotland following the planned closure of its 150,000 b/d refinery in the second quarter this year. The nine possible projects outlined in the Project Willow study centre around waste, bio-feedstocks and industries supporting the development of offshore wind. They could benefit each other through synergies and create up to 800 direct jobs, but their success ""will require significant contributions from both the public and private sector"", with an initial £3.5bn ($4.5bn) in capital investments needed, the study said. The £1.5mn report, paid for by the UK and Scottish governments, was commissioned by Grangemouth refinery operator Petroineos, which announced in November 2023 that it was going to close the plant and convert it into a fuel import terminal. The UK and Scottish governments have since set aside £25mn and £200mn for Grangemouth, along with other initiatives such as Scotland's £100mn Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package. The study's 'waste' pathway comprises a hydrothermal plastic recycling project, a dissolution plastic recycling facility and a bio-refining project relying on bacterial fermentation (ABE). Under the 'bio-feedstock' pathway, the study envisages a second-generation bioethanol plant on Scottish timber feedstock and an anaerobic digestion facility using organic waste to produce biomethane. Second-generation bioethanol refers to ethanol made from non-edible resources such as biomass. This pathway also suggests a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, with production made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). UK trade union Unite has been supportive of this option , but Petroineos deemed it unviable ""under current regulatory conditions"". The third pathway — called conduit for offshore wind — is mostly focused on hydrogen. It includes fuel switching, producing jet from e-methanol and methanol as well as producing low-carbon ammonia for the shipping and chemicals industry. The second-generation ethanol plant and the HEFA facility, as well as the e-methanol and e-ammonia projects, would have a longer 2030-40 timeline, against a 2028-30 timeline for the other projects. The projects would benefit from existing infrastructure such as Grangemouth's port, which includes container, bulk and liquid fuel terminals. ""There are also opportunities to reuse existing tank storage, ethanol facilities, and other ancillary assets at the site,"" the study said. Unite has criticised the study's project timelines, pointing out most would start years after the refinery had closed, by which time jobs would have been lost. Many of the projects ""could be fast tracked and implemented now"", including converting the refinery to SAF production, the union said. ""Project Willow was created by Petroineos as a fig leaf to justify its act of industrial vandalism of shutting the refinery and axing jobs. It asked the wrong questions and then failed to provide the answers that Grangemouth refinery workers need,"" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. ""There are projects like SAF production which can be swiftly enacted to protect jobs and those opportunities must not be lost. This would pave the way for the UK to become a world leader in green aviation."" By Caroline Varin Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

Vitol's Malaysian storage to take third bitumen cargo

Mumbai, 19 March (Argus) — Global energy trading firm Vitol will take a third bitumen shipment from Singapore for its recently built 50,000-70,000t storage facility in Malaysia's Tanjung Bin, vessel tracking data showed. The cargo aboard the 5,869 deadweight tonne (dwt) Erica 10 vessel was loaded from Singapore Refining's terminal in Jurong, Singapore over 16-17 March and is scheduled to discharge in Tanjung Bin over 20-21 March, Kpler and Vortexa data showed. The same vessel carried the firm's second cargo the previous week, while the first shipment was loaded aboard the 4,020dwt Sidra Qatar vessel at the end of January from ExxonMobil's terminal in Singapore and was discharged into Tanjung Bin in early February, the data showed. The trading firm is likely importing cargoes into its storage facility to stock up, but it cannot be determined if it would start exporting from Tanjung Bin in the near term.

Paul Huijts was visiting Saxon Air in Norwich when he learned about the county's aspirations around the development of Advanced Air Mobility small, sustainable and highly efficient air vehicles for short and medium-range travel which can offer on-demand services and take-off and land in smaller, decentralised zones.

The vision is for Norfolk and Suffolk to lead the way in its development and become the UK's first Aviation Development Zone.

The Ambassador also visited institutes at Norwich Research Park to meet with scientists at the leading edge of research into the role of the gut microbiome in pregnancy, decreasing the risk of urinary tract infections in Type 2 Diabetes patients, and heart disease and bioactive compounds.

Mr Huijts was also told about research being carried out by the University of East Anglia into how AI can be used to evaluate whether EU regulations actually support its citizens and the potential threats posed by technological developments in non-democratic states. AI4POL will bring together researchers from the fields of technology development, ethics, law, economics and political sciences, and partners include Tilburg University in the Netherlands.

Andrew Wood, Hon Dutch Consul for East Anglia, spearheaded the official visit from 13-14 March with support from Norfolk County Council's Inward Investment Team. It began at Felixstowe Port in Suffolk and concluded at the Sainsbury Centre in Norwich where Mr Huijts spoke with Dutch artists from an exhibition entitled A World of Water.

The Netherlands is the biggest trading partner to Norfolk and Suffolk, and it is hoped the Ambassador's extensive visit will strengthen direct links to Dutch investment teams and encourage partnership working following devolution with a focus on the areas covered in the visit.

Mr Huijts said: ""It was a great two-day visit to Suffolk and Norfolk. East Anglia and the Dutch have many historical connections and those ties resonate today. From the connection of Norwich Airport with Schiphol to shared expertise and collaboration in domains as agriculture and health.

""Next to the trade and historical ties cultural exchange also flourished over the years. Last week I attended the opening of the exhibition 'A World of Water' at the Sainsbury centre in Norwich, which shows the shared history and ongoing collaboration between the Dutch and East Anglia on water management, art and sustainability"".

Alex Durand, CEO of Saxon Air said: ""The East of England already supports aviation innovation, already taking a UK lead in development of electric aircraft, early availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and advanced development of commercial drone activity.

""This will require substantial capital investment from the private sector [GBP3.5 billion capital expenditure] and development of new supply chains.""
Commenting on the report, UK energy minister Michael Shanks said: ""We committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth.
Thomson added: ""It just makes no sense to me whatsoever that you wouldn't say as a government, let's go for the SAF project.","(Alliance News) - A low-carbon future for Grangemouth will require around GBP3.5 billion of private investment, a summary of the long-awaited Project Willow report says.

The GBP1.5 million study sets out nine options for the future of the industrial cluster in central Scotland.

Hundreds of jobs are set to be lost this year when the oil refinery there closes.

The study identifies nine ""feasible"" proposals which could attract private investment.

These include plastic recycling, fermenting Scottish timber into bioethanol, and hydrogen production.

Both governments say these projects could create up to 800 jobs by 2040.

Earlier this month, the Just Transition Commission warned it could take years to close the ""jobs gap"" left by the refinery's closure.

A summary of the report says the nine projects ""have the potential to significantly enhance low-carbon manufacturing across the UK and create a positive future for Grangemouth"".

It adds: ""However, the report also underscores the challenges of this transformation as low-carbon fuels and chemicals remain more expensive to produce than fossil alternatives.

""This will require substantial capital investment from the private sector [GBP3.5 billion capital expenditure] and development of new supply chains.""

Commenting on the report, UK energy minister Michael Shanks said: ""We committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth.

""This report and the GBP200 million investment by the UK government demonstrates that commitment.

""We will build on Grangemouth's expertise and industrial heritage to attract investors, secure a long-term clean energy future, and deliver on our Plan for Change.""

Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said: ""We will leave no stone unturned in order to secure the future of the Grangemouth refinery site, and the Scottish Government has already committed or invested a total of GBP87 million to help do so.

""Grangemouth is home to over a century of industrial expertise and employs thousands of highly skilled workers, placing the site at a massive competitive advantage and creating a unique opportunity for investors.

""Everyone working at Grangemouth's refinery – and in the wider industrial cluster – is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland's economic and net zero future.""

One of the nine options is to use low-carbon hydrogen to produce methanol, which would be converted into sustainable aviation fuel, SAF.

Union leaders have suggested this as a way forward which could save jobs, with Unite saying the plant could be converted ""relatively easily"" over a few years to produce SAF.

The Project Willow document says SAF operations would commence in 2035, with a capital expenditure of up to GBP2.1 billion required. Up to 270 staff would run the plant.

Derek Thomson, the Scotland regional secretary at Unite, urged the UK Government to back this option.

""What we're saying is, if you're going to accelerate anything in Project Willow, accelerate the sustainable air fuel plant,"" he said in an appearance before the Scottish Affairs Committee which coincided with the release of the report on Wednesday.

Thomson added: ""It just makes no sense to me whatsoever that you wouldn't say as a government, let's go for the SAF project.

""It saves Grangemouth, it saves the refinery, it gets us on track to meet our mandates for our own SAF production, and it doesn't rely on us to import oil.""

Such production, he added, could even result in making money for government.

A spokesman for the refinery's owners Petroineos said: ""The publication of the first Project Willow report is a milestone event for Grangemouth that could mark the beginning of a transformation for the whole cluster and, in time, create many more jobs and growth opportunities across a variety of related industries in Scotland.

""We look forward to continuing to support both UK and Scottish governments as they implement the recommended policy, regulatory and fiscal changes required to unlock the opportunities identified in our report.""

For international routes, JAL said it plans to add 10 Boeing 787-9 aircraft and 20 Airbus A350-900 aircraft. JAL will also reassign an unspecified number of B787-9 aircraft to its subsidiary low-cost carrier ZIPAIR.

The airline expects its international scale to expand approximately 1.6 times by fiscal year 2030, compared to the fiscal year of 2023. In particular, the airline sees significant growth on North American and Asian routes and plans to increase flights and seat numbers with larger aircraft on these destinations to improve passenger experience.

The JAL Group said it aims to ensure growth and expansion by placing aircraft orders early, in anticipation of its growth beyond 2030.

The airline outlined a summary of its fleet order plans until 2030:

38 Boeing 737-8 for domestic routes (delivery scheduled within financial year of 2026)

11 Airbus A321neo for domestic routes (delivery scheduled within financial year of 2028)

10 Boeing 787-9 for international routes (delivery scheduled within financial year of 2028)

3 Airbus A350-900 for domestic routes (sequential delivery/ introduction)

6 Airbus A350-1000 for international routes (sequential delivery / introduction)

“Additionally, by upgrading to more fuel-efficient aircraft, the company is committed to further reducing CO2 emissions,” JAL said.

But another major driver of warming is often overlooked: contrails. These wispy cloud formations – short for condensation trails – form when aircraft fly through ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs) at high altitudes, emitting soot particles that serve as nuclei for ice crystal formation. While short-lived, contrails can trap heat and contribute significantly to warming.

While some early studies estimated contrails contribute up to two-thirds of aviation’s total warming effect, more recent analyses suggest the figure may be closer to one-third. There is still some uncertainty, but new analysis from CATF makes one thing clear: contrails must be tackled alongside CO₂ emissions if we are serious about reducing aviation’s climate impact.

Addressing contrails is essential for sustainable aviation

Aviation climate policies have largely centered on reducing CO₂ emissions. While decarbonizing jet fuel remains a critical long-term goal, CO₂ reductions alone won’t be enough to mitigate the industry’s climate footprint. Contrails exert a short-term but intense warming effect, meaning reducing them could yield near-immediate climate benefits – potentially faster than cutting CO₂ alone.

Ignoring contrails while focusing solely on CO₂ leaves a major climate lever untouched. That’s why a comprehensive approach is needed – one that tackles both CO₂ and non-CO₂ effects.

Relying on a single solution for contrails is risky – we need multiple approaches

Contrail formation depends on several factors, including fuel composition, engine technology, and atmospheric conditions. This complexity makes it risky to rely on any one solution to mitigate contrail effects. Instead, a combination of approaches – including cleaner fuels, low-soot engine designs, and smarter flight routing – will likely yield the best results.

Some mitigation strategies can be deployed today, while others require further research and investment. Below are the three primary areas for reducing contrails:

1. Cleaner fuels: Reducing soot through fuel treatment and SAF

One of the most effective ways to reduce contrails is to lower the amount of soot produced by aircraft engines. Since soot particles act as the initial nuclei for contrail formation, reducing their presence in exhaust emissions can limit ice crystal growth and shorten contrail lifespan.

Two main fuel-based strategies are under consideration:

Fuel treatment: Further refining jet fuel to remove aromatics, particularly naphthalene, in order to reduce soot emissions. This is a viable short-term mitigation option, though it is energy-intensive and would increase CO₂ emissions at the refinery level.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): SAF blends, which contain fewer aromatics than conventional jet fuel, have been shown to reduce soot emissions by 50-70%, leading to fewer and weaker contrails. However, global SAF supply remains limited.

Given the current SAF supply constraints, a smarter strategy is needed. Instead of blending small amounts of SAF into all flights, research suggests that prioritizing high-contrail routes could be 9-15 times more effective at reducing warming. This approach would direct limited SAF resources where they have the most impact, maximizing climate benefits in the short term.

2. Engine modifications: Optimizing fleets for lower soot emissions

Advancements in engine technology present a significant opportunity to mitigate contrail formation by reducing soot emissions. Newer aircraft engines burn fuel more efficiently and produce fewer soot particles, which leads to weaker and shorter-lived contrails.

For example, the CFM Leap-1B engine, used in Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft, has demonstrated lower soot emissions, potentially reducing contrail formation. As airlines modernize their fleets, these newer, lower-soot engines could help cut aviation’s non-CO₂ climate impact.

However, since fleet turnover takes time, additional mitigation strategies – such as using SAF and smarter flight routing – must be implemented in parallel to maximize near-term contrail reductions.

3. Smarter flight routing: Avoiding contrail-forming conditions

Given that contrails only form in ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs), adjusting flight paths to avoid these areas could dramatically reduce contrail occurrence. Key methods for this sort of contrail avoidance include:

Weather forecasting models: Improved weather models could help airlines predict ISSRs and adjust flight plans accordingly. However, current humidity forecasts are not yet reliable enough for large-scale deployment.

AI and satellite monitoring: Emerging AI-driven contrail detection systems offer promising results. Google, in collaboration with American Airlines, conducted a trial using AI-assisted routing, which achieved a 54% reduction in contrails by optimizing flight paths.

Altitude adjustments: Research suggests that small altitude changes (~2%) on high-contrail flights could cut contrail-related warming by nearly 57% – with minimal fuel penalties (~0.03%).

These operational strategies may not be applicable in all situations (i.e., a plane cannot climb to avoid an ISSR after it has begun its landing decent), but to the extent this can be incorporated into ATC procedures, these strategies could provide near-term contrail reductions while longer-term solutions like SAF scale up.

Policy action is needed to integrate contrail mitigation into climate strategies

Despite growing recognition of contrail-related warming, current aviation regulations focus almost entirely on CO₂ emissions. This leaves a critical gap in aviation climate policy.

Governments, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) must work to incorporate non-CO₂ mitigation strategies into their frameworks.

Key areas for policy action include:

Incentivizing the targeted use of SAF on high-contrail flights.

Funding research into low-soot engine designs and cleaner combustion technologies.

Enhancing air traffic management systems to enable real-time contrail avoidance strategies.

Contrail mitigation is one of the fastest ways to reduce aviation’s climate impact

These measures could significantly reduce aviation’s near-term warming impact, making them a critical component of sustainable aviation policy.

Because contrails dissipate within hours, mitigation efforts can provide immediate climate benefits – unlike CO₂ reductions, which take decades to show results. By tackling contrails alongside CO₂ emissions, we can make meaningful progress toward reducing aviation’s full climate footprint.

Aviation needs a multi-pronged approach, and contrail mitigation must be a core part of that plan.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07121340/contrails-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 10:57:33.769180

The rapid replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles by electric vehicles has allowed marked improvements in reducing roadside air pollution, no doubt helped by government action to reduce road tax and provide subsidies for purchase, as the financial incentive can attract a lot of new users.

For marine applications, battery-driven vessels are still not common, but the use of low-sulphur diesel has helped to reduce air pollution with less sulphur dioxide and trioxide emission, though it does not help to reduce carbon emissions.

For air transport, the Airport Authority, working together with airline companies, is doing its best to pursue the carbon-reduction goal, which aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Apart from various initiatives such as experimenting with renewable diesel fuel for landside operations, replacing conventional vehicles with EVs and many other innovative moves, the AA is promoting the use of SAF - or sustainable aviation fuel - which has seen increasing usage by airlines and airports worldwide.

In the 2025-26 budget, SAF received special mention, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po advising that, following the completion of a study by the AA, the government will announce its consumption target this year.

We are all aware that aircraft use a large amount of fossil fuel. Worse than that, the amount used at takeoff is a large proportion of the total amount used in a journey, as a lot of energy is consumed to provide the necessary lift from the ground to reach the flying altitude.

Once in flight, with the rarified atmosphere at 3,000 meters, fuel consumption is vastly reduced as air resistance then becomes much smaller.

Because of this, there is a relatively large amount of carbon emission at or near the airport, which we should manage, as it would affect our ability to achieve the carbon-reduction goal.

It is obvious that, when we have already achieved sizable reduction in carbon emission on land, we should focus on other areas to reach the reduction targets with effective actions for marine and air transport.

International research estimates that, with application of SAF, carbon emission can be reduced as much as 80 percent.

So, how can we proceed to achieve that?

Aircraft engines, mainly using gas turbines instead of internal combustion engines, are less sensitive to fuel types, and most modern aircraft can burn a mixture of kerosine and SAF of up to about 50 percent without affecting longevity and reliability of their power train.

But the present issue is the limited supply of SAF.

SAF can be manufactured in a variety of ways, but the production volume is constrained mainly by supply of feedstock.

To comply with the sustainability goal, the source must either be from renewable source, non-fossil fuel, or from waste. In a busy city like Hong Kong, there is a large potential of waste oil available to be converted.

We have a large quantity of waste oil from restaurants, apart from industrial and land transport applications.

There are already many established methods for upcycling waste oil. Biodiesel is one of the known applications, but its production is confined to only certain types of waste oil, mainly lubrication oil.

Ecoceres, a subsidiary of Towngas in Hong Kong, is established to produce SAF.

Though waste fats, oils and greases, agricultural waste and non-food crops can all be used to manufacture SAF, Ecoceres mainly use waste cooking oil and wood biomass due to limited supply of other waste products.

The amount it can collect from local sources is small, limiting its production volume but, hopefully, with wider publicity, it would help if the public collect waste oil and waste wood products for this purpose, significantly reducing risks of waste oil polluting our sewage systems and waste wood being dumped in landfills.

At this time, the production quantity is still small and can only supply a small percentage of the current aviation fuel used by airlines, but the room for growth is huge as we have not yet fully explored its potential.

It will take time before this initiative receives good attention for a much wider application.

Carbon reduction is now a clear goal for us, but when we are able to devise an eco-system to achieve it, we can also help to reduce air and water pollution at the same time.

Researchers from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have already demonstrated this with systems in actual operation. Now, researchers working on the Kopernikus P2X project have succeeded for the first time in coupling - at an industrial 220-kilowatt scale - the highly efficient co-electrolysis process with fuel synthesis. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

In order to achieve its climate targets, Europe needs green alternatives for applications that do not easily lend themselves to electrification. ""The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,"" says Professor Roland Dittmeyer from KIT's Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT). ""Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable."" Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project and heads the corresponding research activities at KIT. The project has now reached an important technological milestone on the way to sustainable aviation fuel: For the first time in the world, the innovative, highly efficient water vapor/CO2 co-electrolysis technology from industrial partner Sunfire was coupled directly with a synthesis process at an industry-relevant scale (220 kilowatts of electrolysis output).

Co-electrolysis Makes Power-to-Liquid More Efficient

For the production of synthetic kerosene at KIT's Energy Lab, a multi-stage process distributed to modular facilities is used. First, syngas - a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide - is produced from CO2 and water. In principle, there are several ways to generate syngas. The new configuration uses a co-electrolysis module with an output of 220 kilowatts from industry partner Sunfire, which simplifies this process step and, above all, boosts its efficiency. ""Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step. Up to 85 percent of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas. In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,"" says Hubertus Richter, Senior Engineer R&D Project Management & Process Engineering at Sunfire. ""This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.""

For the coupled operation of co-electrolysis and fuel synthesis, the syngas needs to be brought to reaction pressure. This job is done by a compressor with safety devices the researchers added to the process chain. In a microstructured reactor, the syngas is then converted to long-chain hydrocarbons - known as syncrude - using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These hydrocarbons can be used directly to produce fuels such as kerosene or other chemical products. Scientists at KIT developed this reactor technology, which is already being commercialized by INERATEC, a KIT spin-off. For the future, it is planned to use the heat released as vapor during synthesis for the co-electrolysis. This would further reduce the energy demand of the entire process and demonstrate that the product preparation to finally obtain kerosene is feasible at this scale. By combining these process steps, it is possible to fully utilize the carbon dioxide provided and achieve the highest possible energy conversion efficiency, as this process chain allows efficient recycling of material flows in addition to the energy flows.

The Next Step: A Tonne of Kerosene per Day

Researchers at KIT successfully tested the integration of co-electrolysis in campaign operation under real conditions, producing up to one hundred liters of syncrude per day. Coupled operation marks an important milestone in the second funding phase of the Kopernikus P2X project. The facility is now being expanded for a capacity of up to 300 liters syncrude per day. In the third and final funding phase, the research team has INERATEC additionally build a larger Fischer-Tropsch production facility in the Höchst Industrial Park near Frankfurt. ""For the first time, tonne-scale production will be realized there,"" says Dittmeyer. The product, which will eventually be processed into kerosene, will be used by aircraft engine manufacturers and research partners for testing. Accompanying analyses ensure that the fuel meets the strict aviation standards.

About the Kopernikus P2X Project

In the Kopernikus P2X project, partners Climeworks, Sunfire, INERATEC, and the Institute for Micro Process Engineering are establishing and operating an integrated process chain at KIT's Energy Lab. Based on the ""Power-to-Fuel"" concept, carbon-neutral fuels, known as e-fuels, can be produced in this way. The project, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), involves 18 partners from industry and science as well as civil-society organizations.

A long-awaited report says up to 800 jobs could be created over the next 15 years at the Grangemouth site, where Scotland's only oil refinery is set to close.

The Project Willow study, which was funded by the Scottish and UK governments, sets out nine areas for potential private investment in green industries.

It says jobs could be created in areas like sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen production and plastics recycling.

Owner Petroineos is shutting the loss-making refinery at the sprawling industrial complex on the Firth of Forth with the loss of 400 jobs.

The report, by consultants EY, lists nine potential uses for the wider site, which employs around 2,000 people.

About 480 jobs could be created with the manufacture of e-methanol for jet fuel and e-ammonia for shipping - but that would require £6.6bn of private investment and would not be operational until around 2035, the report said.

Plastics recycling could be done much sooner, within five years, at a cost of about £600m. It is estimated around 250 jobs could be created.

The report calls on the UK government to bring forward market reforms of the electricity sector to bring down the cost of hydrogen production.

Ministers should also encourage farmers to focus on plant-based products which can be turned into fuels, it says.

The UK and Scottish governments have promised £200m and £25m respectively to support new investment at Grangemouth.

UK Energy Minister Michael Shanks promised to ""leave no stone unturned"" in securing a future for the site.

""We will build on Grangemouth's expertise and industrial heritage to attract investors, secure a long-term clean energy future, and deliver on our Plan for Change,"" he added.

Scottish First Minister John Swinney said: ""Grangemouth is home to over a century of industrial expertise and employs thousands of highly skilled workers, placing the site at a massive competitive advantage and creating a unique opportunity for investors.

""Everyone working at Grangemouth's refinery - and in the wider industrial cluster - is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland's economic and net zero future.""

Although we've waited months for this, Project Willow is just the starting gun being fired on what could happen to Grangemouth.

Matching the ambition and the reality is not an easy job. In fact it's never really been achieved before.

But among the big companies which operate on this huge industrial complex there is a renewed sense of optimism because governments are now engaging with them seriously on what could be achieved.

The report sets out the options but it still requires billions of pounds in private cash. Decisions on whether to spend that money have to be done with an assurance of a return on that investment.

Moving operations to other parts of the world, like the Middle East, the US and Australia, look like more favourable options at the minute.

What both governments do next will be crucial.

Cheaper renewable electricity and regulator reform are two key areas identified for change.

The report talks about 800 potential new jobs but this whole town relies on a green industry developing at Grangemouth, so this will be a key test in whether a just and fair transition can ever truly be achieved.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b6b4/live/51b75cb0-04ad-11f0-b105-736ce33fe23a.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 07:56:38.432614

Europe’s aviation industry has taken a significant leap forward by publishing a toolkit designed to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This initiative, backed by key players including airlines, airports, and manufacturers, aims to strengthen Europe’s energy independence and establish a competitive advantage in sustainable fuel production.

The report, compiled by global consulting firm ICF, underscores the urgent need for a dedicated European Union (EU) SAF strategy. With the European Commission (EC) actively working on the Clean Industrial Deal and the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), now is the perfect time to align policies and investment strategies to achieve the region’s sustainability goals.

Why Europe Must Take the Lead

Current projections indicate that SAF production in Europe is not keeping pace with demand. Industrial policies in other global regions, such as the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and China’s strategic investments, have intensified competition, creating an imbalance in the market. If this trend persists, Europe risks becoming overly reliant on imported SAF, undermining its energy autonomy and economic resilience.

The implications of inaction are clear:

Consumers will face higher costs as imported SAF remains expensive.

The European workforce will lose potential employment opportunities in the SAF sector.

The region’s ability to lead in clean energy innovation will be weakened.

However, the report emphasizes that this trajectory is not inevitable. With the right policies and mechanisms, Europe can overcome these challenges and transform itself into a global SAF leader.

Unlocking Investment Through Smart Policy

To accelerate SAF production, the report outlines several key recommendations:

1. Risk-Sharing Mechanisms for Investment

Encouraging private investment is crucial to scaling SAF production. Implementing risk-sharing mechanisms can provide financial stability, making SAF projects more attractive to investors while also mitigating costs for consumers.

2. Strengthening Financial Support for SAF Facilities

Advanced SAF facilities require significant capital investment. Increasing funding for research, infrastructure, and production capacity will help Europe meet its SAF targets and compete on a global scale.

3. Prioritizing Feedstock Access

Ensuring a steady supply of sustainable feedstocks and renewable electricity is essential for the competitiveness of SAF production. By prioritizing access to these resources, Europe can create a more stable and sustainable fuel supply chain.

4. Refining Existing Regulatory Mechanisms

Policies such as the ReFuelEU Aviation mandate and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) can be optimized by introducing greater flexibility. This will enhance market efficiency, reduce volatility, and provide a more predictable investment environment.

A Defining Moment for European Aviation

The leaders of the six industry associations that commissioned the report stress that SAF is more than just a tool for decarbonization—it is an opportunity to establish Europe as a global leader in clean energy. With strong policy action, Europe can:

Lead the transition to a net-zero aviation industry.

Strengthen its energy independence.

Boost its global competitiveness in sustainable fuel technologies.

Collaboration for a Sustainable Future

The six organizations behind the report include:

Airlines for Europe (A4E) – representing major European airlines.

Airports Council International (ACI Europe) – advocating for sustainable airport development.

Airport Regions Council (ARC) – supporting local and regional airport authorities.

AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) – promoting innovation in aerospace sustainability.

European Regions Airline Association (ERA) – focusing on regional airline sustainability efforts.

General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) – supporting clean aviation technology advancements.

Conclusion

This SAF toolkit arrives at a pivotal moment. Europe has the potential to shape the future of aviation by embracing sustainability as a competitive advantage. However, success will require coordinated efforts from policymakers, industry leaders, and investors. The choices made today will determine whether Europe leads the global SAF transition or remains dependent on external suppliers.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-45-6-1024x576-1.png,N,,2025-03-19 06:56:48.785955

In future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added.

“Corporations and individual travellers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s senior vice-president commercial products and services.

IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, directly contributed by airlines. This approach contrasts with other calculators that primarily rely on modeled averages.

With the recent inclusion of Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas and Royal Air Maroc, some 60 airlines are now contributing data to CO2 Connect. With each new airline participant, the accuracy and transparency of IATA CO2 Connect’s calculations improves—for individual travellers and corporates.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonisation powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IATA-CO-pic-Biofuel-19-3-768x577.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 07:56:52.718739

Just as it seemed that we were making real climate progress, the fossil fuel industry is sidetracking elected officials, regulators, and business leaders with a rash of climate solution diversions. In the face of Zenith Energy’s plans to make Portland the West Coast center for so-called “renewable” diesel and “sustainable” aviation fuel, the panel will examine: how renewable diesel is fraught with all kinds of problems and dangers, and may have a higher carbon footprint than petroleum-based fuels. 

Additionally, the panel will discuss how renewable natural gas actually comes from methane produced by tortured animals in factory farms.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) will play a vital role in decarbonising aviation but it continues to be in very short supply and we need to find ways to stimulate growth. At the same time, corporate organisations are becoming increasingly mindful of their travel footprint and, due to stricter ESG reporting requirements, they are also under increased pressure to demonstrate how they are lowering it. Given SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel, it could be a hugely effective means of doing this. The issue is that SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) rules insist companies must show beyond reasonable doubt that fuel has been consumed, which only an airline or fuel supplier can do. This scheme is a novel solution to this problem and our proof-of-concept trial (now proven) has allowed us to demonstrate how airlines and corporates can share the cost of SAF in a mutually beneficial way. And over time, such an initiative could drive up demand for SAF and bring down prices for all.

How does it work?

easyJet purchases the fuel and in return, we help our corporate partner lower their footprint, which is useful for helping them meet their ESG reporting obligations while making a ‘real world’ difference when it comes to emissions reduction. We began with a three-month partnership with Airbus, which essentially covered its employee travel on easyJet between the company’s bases in Toulouse and Bristol. The customer is given non-tradeable, verified SAF certificates to provide proof of sustainability and delivery, which then allows it to demonstrate reductions in its Scope 3 target. In turn, the SAF is delivered to the chosen airport and used by all carriers operating there.

Can corporates of any size take advantage?

Absolutely. The beauty of this scheme is that easyJet is able to ‘pool’ demand for SAF and make a bulk purchase. We can establish the precise SAF requirements of each of our partners to cover their particular travel needs. Making a bigger order is better for SAF producers as it shows there is long-term commitment. Having launched with Airbus, our intention now is to welcome as many corporate partners as possible. Given business travellers make up around 14% of our customer base, there is a lot of potential to expand. By scaling up the scheme into different regions, using the many easyJet-operated airports, we believe we can make it a practical solution for customers looking to meet their Scope 3 ambitions.

What makes it different from other SAF schemes?

Again, the difference of our scheme is that there is a direct link between the customer and the SAF. The ability to provide verification is key and this scheme enables us to guarantee where the fuel was produced, when it was purchased and how and where it was used. Offering that level of transparency and assurance is a real selling point. We also ensure that SAF used in our scheme meets EU and UK standards and is additionally certified by the ISCC voluntary scheme, which provides evidence of the sustainability characteristics.

Why did you pick Airbus as a launch partner?

We have a long working relationship with Airbus, having collaborated with them on many innovative projects. They also made a perfect launch partner as the easyJet Toulouse-Bristol service is one that is used regularly by Airbus employees, and it was simple for us to feed the SAF stocks into the fuel supply at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport. The 106 tonnes of SAF purchased was equivalent to the amount of fuel needed to operate easyJet’s flights between Toulouse and Bristol with 30% SAF blend over a three-month period of the trial.

What else is easyJet doing to make flying more sustainable?

SAF is just one part of a suite of measures we are taking to move towards net zero by 2050. By 2035 we aim to have reduced our carbon emissions intensity (per passenger/per KM travelled) by 35% compared to 2019 levels. Reducing energy use is key, and we are doing that through fleet renewal, operational efficiencies and airspace modernisation. Scaling up SAF use, renewing our fleets, maximising operational efficiency, driving airspace reform, adopting carbon capture and investing heavily in research with Rolls-Royce into future aircraft technologies, such as hydrogen-powered engines, are all key components of how we’ll achieve our long term goal to decarbonise.

What’s next for the model?

We hosted an event following the close of phase one and have received nothing but positive feedback on the scheme from leaders at Airbus, not to mention local politicians and media that attended. Now the concept has been proven – and having successfully retired SAF certificates on Airbus’ behalf – we invite other corporate partners that are interested to join the scheme and encourage any interested parties to contact their Business Development Manager.",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/easyJet-wing-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 20:56:30.326819

Biodiesel is one of the known applications, but its production is confined to only certain types of waste oil, mainly lubrication oil.
The amount it can collect from local sources is small, limiting its production volume but, hopefully, with wider publicity, it would help if the public collect waste oil and waste wood products for this purpose, significantly reducing risks of waste oil polluting our sewage systems and waste wood being dumped in landfills.","In our hot pursuit of carbon neutrality in 2030 and zero carbon in 2050, the transport sector is doing its best to achieve this goal.

The rapid replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles by electric vehicles has allowed marked improvements in reducing roadside air pollution, no doubt helped by government action to reduce road tax and provide subsidies for purchase, as the financial incentive can attract a lot of new users.

For marine applications, battery-driven vessels are still not common, but the use of low-sulphur diesel has helped to reduce air pollution with less sulphur dioxide and trioxide emission, though it does not help to reduce carbon emissions.

For air transport, the Airport Authority, working together with airline companies, is doing its best to pursue the carbon-reduction goal, which aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Apart from various initiatives such as experimenting with renewable diesel fuel for landside operations, replacing conventional vehicles with EVs and many other innovative moves, the AA is promoting the use of SAF - or sustainable aviation fuel - which has seen increasing usage by airlines and airports worldwide.

In the 2025-26 budget, SAF received special mention, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po advising that, following the completion of a study by the AA, the government will announce its consumption target this year.

We are all aware that aircraft use a large amount of fossil fuel. Worse than that, the amount used at takeoff is a large proportion of the total amount used in a journey, as a lot of energy is consumed to provide the necessary lift from the ground to reach the flying altitude.

Once in flight, with the rarified atmosphere at 3,000 meters, fuel consumption is vastly reduced as air resistance then becomes much smaller.

Because of this, there is a relatively large amount of carbon emission at or near the airport, which we should manage, as it would affect our ability to achieve the carbon-reduction goal.

It is obvious that, when we have already achieved sizable reduction in carbon emission on land, we should focus on other areas to reach the reduction targets with effective actions for marine and air transport.

International research estimates that, with application of SAF, carbon emission can be reduced as much as 80 percent.

So, how can we proceed to achieve that?

Aircraft engines, mainly using gas turbines instead of internal combustion engines, are less sensitive to fuel types, and most modern aircraft can burn a mixture of kerosine and SAF of up to about 50 percent without affecting longevity and reliability of their power train.

But the present issue is the limited supply of SAF.

SAF can be manufactured in a variety of ways, but the production volume is constrained mainly by supply of feedstock.

To comply with the sustainability goal, the source must either be from renewable source, non-fossil fuel, or from waste. In a busy city like Hong Kong, there is a large potential of waste oil available to be converted.

We have a large quantity of waste oil from restaurants, apart from industrial and land transport applications.

There are already many established methods for upcycling waste oil. Biodiesel is one of the known applications, but its production is confined to only certain types of waste oil, mainly lubrication oil.

Ecoceres, a subsidiary of Towngas in Hong Kong, is established to produce SAF.

Though waste fats, oils and greases, agricultural waste and non-food crops can all be used to manufacture SAF, Ecoceres mainly use waste cooking oil and wood biomass due to limited supply of other waste products.

The amount it can collect from local sources is small, limiting its production volume but, hopefully, with wider publicity, it would help if the public collect waste oil and waste wood products for this purpose, significantly reducing risks of waste oil polluting our sewage systems and waste wood being dumped in landfills.

At this time, the production quantity is still small and can only supply a small percentage of the current aviation fuel used by airlines, but the room for growth is huge as we have not yet fully explored its potential.

It will take time before this initiative receives good attention for a much wider application.

Carbon reduction is now a clear goal for us, but when we are able to devise an eco-system to achieve it, we can also help to reduce air and water pollution at the same time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The head of the U.S. government’s energy loans office that has provided financing to projects from nuclear power to a sustainable aviation fuel plant supported by one of President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans will depart the agency this week, the U.S. Department of Energy said on Tuesday.

John Sneed, who headed the Loan Programs Office, or LPO, in the Trump’s first administration, was re-appointed on January 20 to head it for 30 days to work on the transition to new administration. His appointment was extended by about another month through March 21.

Sneed said in a release he will return home to Texas, and his family, without giving more detail.

In the first Trump administration, Sneed was also a chief of staff to then Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a former Texas governor of Texas.

The LPO’s capacity to offer low-cost loans and loan guarantees to emerging energy technologies was vastly expanded to hundreds of billions of dollars under the administration of former President Joe Biden, a Democrat.

Technologies, such as advanced vehicles, batteries, and solar power arrays, that struggle to get financing from private banks, were among the beneficiaries, during Biden’s presidency.

Trump only used the LPO to finance nuclear power in his first term and it has been uncertain how he will use the agency in his second administration.

So far this term, Trump’s LPO has provided part of a loan guarantee for Holtec’s Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan, which is aiming to be the first commercial reactor resurrected after a complete shutdown.

Last month, his LPO also approved disbursement of a $1.67 billion loan guarantee finalized days before Trump took office for a Calumet sustainable aviation fuel refinery in Montana, after pressure from Senator Steve Daines, a Republican.

DOE said it will announce the incoming LPO director in weeks.

International traffic also showed positive results, totaling 15.6 million passengers, a 0.7% increase from the previous year.
The Dominican Republic achieved a record number of international passengers, reaching 1.8 million in January, a 3% increase from 2024.
Mexico’s Santa Lucia airport (AIFA) saw a 78% growth, while Argentina's Tucumán experienced a 116% increase in international traffic.
However, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remained 2.1 times more expensive, with an average price of US$208.05 per barrel.","The Latin American aviation market began 2025 with significant growth, registering 42.3 million passengers in January, marking a 2.4% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This growth was driven by the reactivation of routes, the adoption of open skies policies, and a stronger tourism demand. According to the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), the growth is also attributed to the expansion of both international and domestic markets.

A major contributor to the region's performance was the Brazilian domestic market, which saw a 44% growth, representing 438,000 additional passengers. Brazil played a key role in the region's overall growth. Notably, the Lima-Santiago route became the busiest in Latin America, with nearly 156,000 passengers in January, contributing to an increase in intra-regional traffic, which reached 5.3 million passengers.

“With these results, 2025 begins with an optimistic outlook for the aviation industry in the region. The consolidation of new routes, increased connectivity, and the industry’s commitment to sustainable development will continue to be essential to maintaining this positive trend,” said José Botelho, CEO, ALTA.

International traffic also showed positive results, totaling 15.6 million passengers, a 0.7% increase from the previous year. One notable development was the 33.5% increase in traffic between Brazil and France, driven by the introduction of the Paris-Salvador route. Additionally, routes between Panama and the United States performed well, with more than 2,500 frequencies, marking a 12% year-on-year increase.

In terms of international market performance, Brazil and the Dominican Republic stood out. The Dominican Republic achieved a record number of international passengers, reaching 1.8 million in January, a 3% increase from 2024. Mexico’s Santa Lucia airport (AIFA) saw a 78% growth, while Argentina's Tucumán experienced a 116% increase in international traffic.

The total number of flights in the region grew by 4.8%, reaching 345,331 operations. The average occupancy rate also improved, rising by 1.1 percentage points to 84.7%.

“Regional aviation continues to show resilience, reinforcing the sector’s role as a vital driver of connectivity,” Botelho added.

One ongoing challenge for the industry is fuel costs. In January 2025, the average price of jet fuel was US$98.05 per barrel. However, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remained 2.1 times more expensive, with an average price of US$208.05 per barrel. The cost discrepancy between conventional jet fuel and SAF continues to pose a significant barrier to the large-scale adoption of SAF in the region. To address this, there is a strong push for policies that support SAF production and make it more competitive with traditional jet fuel.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-03/Latin%20America%E2%80%99s%20Aviation%20Market%20Grows%202.4%25%20in%20January%202025.jpg?h=c8607a4f&itok=UektwSQO,N,,2025-03-18 18:56:39.519558

The rapid replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles by electric vehicles has allowed marked improvements in reducing roadside air pollution, no doubt helped by government action to reduce road tax and provide subsidies for purchase, as the financial incentive can attract a lot of new users.

For marine applications, battery-driven vessels are still not common, but the use of low-sulphur diesel has helped to reduce air pollution with less sulphur dioxide and trioxide emission, though it does not help to reduce carbon emissions.

For air transport, the Airport Authority, working together with airline companies, is doing its best to pursue the carbon-reduction goal, which aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Apart from various initiatives such as experimenting with renewable diesel fuel for landside operations, replacing conventional vehicles with EVs and many other innovative moves, the AA is promoting the use of SAF - or sustainable aviation fuel - which has seen increasing usage by airlines and airports worldwide.

In the 2025-26 budget, SAF received special mention, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po advising that, following the completion of a study by the AA, the government will announce its consumption target this year.

We are all aware that aircraft use a large amount of fossil fuel. Worse than that, the amount used at takeoff is a large proportion of the total amount used in a journey, as a lot of energy is consumed to provide the necessary lift from the ground to reach the flying altitude.

Once in flight, with the rarified atmosphere at 3,000 meters, fuel consumption is vastly reduced as air resistance then becomes much smaller.

Because of this, there is a relatively large amount of carbon emission at or near the airport, which we should manage, as it would affect our ability to achieve the carbon-reduction goal.

It is obvious that, when we have already achieved sizable reduction in carbon emission on land, we should focus on other areas to reach the reduction targets with effective actions for marine and air transport.

International research estimates that, with application of SAF, carbon emission can be reduced as much as 80 percent.

So, how can we proceed to achieve that?

Aircraft engines, mainly using gas turbines instead of internal combustion engines, are less sensitive to fuel types, and most modern aircraft can burn a mixture of kerosine and SAF of up to about 50 percent without affecting longevity and reliability of their power train.

But the present issue is the limited supply of SAF.

SAF can be manufactured in a variety of ways, but the production volume is constrained mainly by supply of feedstock.

To comply with the sustainability goal, the source must either be from renewable source, non-fossil fuel, or from waste. In a busy city like Hong Kong, there is a large potential of waste oil available to be converted.

We have a large quantity of waste oil from restaurants, apart from industrial and land transport applications.

There are already many established methods for upcycling waste oil. Biodiesel is one of the known applications, but its production is confined to only certain types of waste oil, mainly lubrication oil.

Ecoceres, a subsidiary of Towngas in Hong Kong, is established to produce SAF.

Though waste fats, oils and greases, agricultural waste and non-food crops can all be used to manufacture SAF, Ecoceres mainly use waste cooking oil and wood biomass due to limited supply of other waste products.

The amount it can collect from local sources is small, limiting its production volume but, hopefully, with wider publicity, it would help if the public collect waste oil and waste wood products for this purpose, significantly reducing risks of waste oil polluting our sewage systems and waste wood being dumped in landfills.

At this time, the production quantity is still small and can only supply a small percentage of the current aviation fuel used by airlines, but the room for growth is huge as we have not yet fully explored its potential.

It will take time before this initiative receives good attention for a much wider application.

Carbon reduction is now a clear goal for us, but when we are able to devise an eco-system to achieve it, we can also help to reduce air and water pollution at the same time.

IATA’s CO2 Connect is one of many tools designed to measure emissions from flights. It provides operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, rather than the modelled averages used by some other calculation methodologies.

The latest improvement to CO2 Connect takes into account the use of alternative fuels, which the airline industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Initially, the per-passenger emissions reduction figure from the use of alternative fuel will be based on an airline’s total schedule, so every flight will “benefit from an equal percentage reduction based on total SAF purchases”.

Although, IATA plans further enhancements to allow the tool to allocate per-passenger emissions reductions on specific routes.

Frederic Leger, IATA’s senior vice president commercial products and services, said:“Corporations and individual travellers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is - particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having.

The company’s latest updates focus on improving safety, efficiency, and operational feasibility of the jet.

The BYA-1, initially unveiled in 2023, is an eight-passenger business aircraft designed to run on gaseous hydrogen without batteries. Its propulsion system has been updated to include two independent power channels, reducing the risk of failure while increasing redundancy.

The fuel cell stack has been upgraded to 2.4MW, while the 700-bar hydrogen tanks have been repositioned above the wing box structure to improve crashworthiness and remove high-pressure fuel lines from the cabin. The aircraft’s propulsion system has also been fine-tuned with electric ducted fans and a digital engine control system to optimise performance across all flight phases.

Beyond Aero estimates these refinements will significantly cut costs. Maintenance expenses are expected to be up to 55% lower than those of conventional turbine-powered aircraft due to fewer moving parts, while hydrogen fuel is projected to be 65% cheaper than synthetic sustainable aviation fuel by 2025.

The road to certification

Bringing a hydrogen-powered aircraft to market is not without regulatory challenges. Current certification frameworks are designed for conventional fuels, meaning new safety and operational standards must be developed.

“During discussions with EASA about certifying our hydrogen-electric aircraft, a key challenge emerged: existing regulations are designed for conventional fuels and do not fully address the specifics of hydrogen,” Walter Filho, Head of Certification at Beyond Aero, told Zag Daily.

“One of the biggest hurdles is establishing regulations that ensure the same safety level as conventional aircraft in the same category. To tackle this, Beyond Aero is collaborating with EASA to draft the certification basis for BYA-I and develop a ‘special condition’ tailored to this innovation,” he added.

Beyond Aero is also engaging with industry stakeholders through the Alliance for Zero-Emission Aviation to help define technical standards for hydrogen fuel cell applications and crashworthiness.

While aircraft certification is a major hurdle, the success of hydrogen-electric aviation also depends on fuel availability. The company has been working to secure hydrogen supply chains and airport partnerships to ensure operators can refuel efficiently.

“From the early stages of the project, we established a dedicated department focused on hydrogen airport infrastructure, working closely with airports and hydrogen providers to assess requirements such as hydrogen consumption, storage capacity, and refuelling solutions,” Irwin Kerboriou, Lead H2 Airport Operations Manager at Beyond Aero, told Zag Daily.

Kerboriou pointed to key partnerships, including a collaboration with ADP Group, announced two years ago, to ensure hydrogen availability at business aviation hubs in Europe. Beyond Aero is also working with the Alliance for Zero-Emission Aviation to help build a scalable hydrogen supply chain.

Strong market interest

The BYA-1 is designed for corporate clients and business jet operators looking for a low-carbon alternative. In a six-passenger configuration, the aircraft has a range of 800 nautical miles, covering over 80% of European business aviation routes. It is also optimised for constrained airports such as London City.

Market interest in Beyond Aero’s aircraft has been strong, with demand coming from business jet operators, corporate clients, and investors.

“The market response has been overwhelmingly positive,” Eloa Guillotin, Co-founder and CEO of Beyond Aero, told Zag Daily. “Many potential clients have turned into investors eager to participate and keen to know when the aircraft will be available. This direct connection has enabled us to validate demand and refine our offering based on genuine user feedback from high-net-worth individuals and corporate and fleet operators.”

To date, Beyond Aero has secured $914 million in Letters of Intent for 108 aircraft and has already started a waiting list for booking deposits.",https://zagdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BYA_Hangar.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 13:57:52.315448

Larry Rhoden recently signed off on legislation banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines in the state.
“South Dakota landowners feel strongly that the threat of involuntary easements for the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline infringes on their freedoms and their property rights,” Rhoden wrote.
Another option is rerouting through Minnesota, but state law does not allow eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.
An Iowa bill banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines on agricultural land recently passed out of committee.","A new law in South Dakota raises questions about the future of a $9 billion carbon dioxide pipeline project spanning five Midwestern states.

The Iowa-based company Summit Carbon Solutions wants to build a 2,500-mile pipeline network to transport carbon dioxide from dozens of ethanol plants and bury it deep underground in North Dakota. Summit and its supporters say sequestering the greenhouse gas will open the door to low-carbon fuel markets and bump up demand for corn.

But the project has faced strong pushback, largely over property rights, local zoning ordinances and safety after a carbon dioxide rupture in Satartia, Mississippi five years ago made national headlines.

South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden recently signed off on legislation banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines in the state. Shortly after, Summit Carbon Solutions asked South Dakota regulators to hit pause and extend the deadline for its application to build and operate its pipeline in the state.

According to Summit’s filing, South Dakota requires a company to have a permit application and the legal authority to use eminent domain to access private property for land surveys.

Rhoden said in a letter explaining his decision that he’s had hundreds of conversations with people on all sides of the proposed project. Banning the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines does not kill Summit’s plan, he said, since the company could still move forward with voluntary easements.

“I encourage Summit and others to view [the new law] as an opportunity for a needed reset,” Rhoden stated.

Eminent domain is the legal right to use private property for projects that benefit the public. A court determines the landowners’ compensation. Many pipeline opponents argue Summit’s project is not a public benefit and that the possibility of eminent domain pressures landowners to sign easement agreements.

“South Dakota landowners feel strongly that the threat of involuntary easements for the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline infringes on their freedoms and their property rights,” Rhoden wrote. “I have said many times that Summit needs to earn back trust from South Dakota landowners.”

Emma Schmit is the director of Pipeline Fighters with Bold Alliance, a nonprofit that organizes against fossil fuel projects and eminent domain abuse. She said the new law is a “huge victory for landowners.”

“It’s going to be a long, hard road for [Summit] if they do continue,” Schmit said.

A large roadblock after several green lights last year

Iowa officials last year approved Summit’s phase one route permit and granted the right to use eminent domain. But they said construction in the state cannot begin until Summit files proof of agency approval from North Dakota and South Dakota.

North Dakota approved Summit’s route and sequestration permits last year. Commissioners for the route permit said the courts would decide whether the company has the right to eminent domain in the state.

Minnesota officials in December granted Summit a permit for a 28-mile pipeline that connects an ethanol plant to North Dakota.

Nebraska, the last state in the pipeline’s planned route, does not require state-wide approval, but Summit will need conditional use permits from each county with a zoning ordinance.

“It’s very unfortunate that, despite our approvals in Iowa, North Dakota and Minnesota, South Dakota changed the rules in the middle of the game,” a Summit spokesperson stated in an email.

“This kind of regulatory uncertainty creates real challenges—not just for our project, but for the ethanol plants in South Dakota that now face a competitive disadvantage compared to their counterparts in neighboring states,” the spokesperson wrote.

In a press release, Summit said all options, including legal action, are on the table to move the project forward.

What are Summit’s options?

But Summit has few choices, said Jess Mazour, conservation program associate for Sierra Club Iowa Chapter. The organization is one of the groups that has rallied landowners opposed to carbon dioxide pipelines.

Summit could sue the state of South Dakota to try to overturn the bill or find a route in the state without using eminent domain, said Mazour. Another option is rerouting through Minnesota, but state law does not allow eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.

“This is going to be a very tough path forward for Summit and likely require massive reroutes or massive lawsuits,” Mazour said.

Whether Summit pursues lawsuits or pipeline reroutes, Mazour said Iowa needs to move forward with its own legislation to protect landowner rights.

“We’re not changing the rules in the middle of the game, we’re protecting Iowans’ property rights,” Mazour said.

An Iowa bill banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines on agricultural land recently passed out of committee.

“It's similar to what South Dakota did, and it's fair,” Mazour said. “[Carbon dioxide pipelines] are not for the public good. These are privately owned projects, and we do not think eminent domain should be used for them.”

Similar legislation in the past has stalled in Iowa’s senate, but Mazour said the recent win in South Dakota adds wind to the sails of pipeline opponents.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said he views the new South Dakota law as a “de facto ban” on carbon dioxide pipelines in the state. Shaw said he, along with ethanol producers in the association, were disappointed by the decision, but he’s confident the project will move forward, even if it does not include South Dakota.

“There are lots of places you can sequester carbon in the United States, and there are lots of ways to get there that do not involve South Dakota,” Shaw said. “When you consider the massive opportunities that ultra low carbon ethanol has in markets, literally around the world, it's just so large that no one state's going to stop that from happening.”

One of these markets is aviation fuel, which Shaw said could drive demand for biofuels over the next two decades.

In 2021, the International Civil Aviation Organization set targets to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. That same year, the U.S. launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge with the goals of producing 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel in the U.S. by 2030 and meeting all domestic aviation fuel demand by 2050.

“Sustainable aviation fuel alone could be 100 billion gallons worldwide,” Shaw said. “To put that in reference, we use 14 billion gallons to supply E10 to the entire United States.”

While Summit’s project comes with a lot of question marks, Shaw pointed to another one that’s moving forward. Tallgrass Energy is converting a natural gas pipeline to carry carbon dioxide from industries in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming for underground storage in Wyoming.

An ethanol plant in southwest Iowa may connect, as well.

“We're a little bit jealous watching what's happening to the west of us where the Tallgrass pipeline is under construction,” Shaw said. “It'll be operational in the third quarter of this year, and the plants on that pipeline are going to reap huge financial benefits.”

Tallgrass and Bold Alliance signed a “first-of-its-kind” community benefits agreement last year, which established landowner protections throughout the pipeline’s life cycle.

Made from so-called renewable sources, the fuels are said to be a ‘gamechanger’ by the UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves, limiting the environmental damage of flying. Even though this has been challenged by some, alternative aviation fuels are here to stay, with a new mandate from Westminster.

From this year, 2% of all jet fuel used in the UK must be SAF, rising to 10% by 2030 and climbing again by 2040, and there’s a similar programme in Europe, ReFuelEU.

The British Government argues that SAF emits 70% less carbon emissions over its lifetime. Last year, production volumes globally reached one million tonnes, double that of the year before, according to IATA.

This sounds like a lot, but UK aviation consumes over 12 million tonnes of jet fuel each year. For travel buyers looking to drill down on their Scope 3 emissions, the big question is how to get hold of the stuff. There are a number of avenues (see next page), however there can be challenges.

“Making sense of this sector is like unravelling layers of an onion, working out who are the producers, suppliers and middlemen. With any scheme, I am always looking for the closest line of sight to the SAF producer,” explains John Harvey, founder of travel consultancy Globalyse and former Chief Marketing Officer of HRG.

Remember carbon offsets? Well, the market for SAF is reminiscent of this, with accusations of greenwashing and double counting. Integrity in reporting will therefore be essential going forwards, where claims are based on transparent and verifiable data, with a clear justification of their environmental impact.

This is where credible standards come in; the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) Book and Claim Standard is one and the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance’s (SABA) Sustainability Framework for SAF is another.

Then there’s the issue of whether it’s sustainable at all. A study commissioned by the European Consumer Organisation, BEUC thinks not. Currently a lot of SAF comes from used cooking oil, animal fats or agricultural waste. Although it contributes to reducing the harmful environmental aspects of flying, the term “sustainable here is too absolute and not concrete enough,” it says.

For instance, the amount of land needed to produce the required amount of fuel via agricultural means would be 68% of the total land under production in the UK, according to a Royal Society report.

These are still early days. The quality of current SAF used does matter. There’s only so much farm waste and residue oil available to fuel producers, while new raw materials such as algae and novel vegetable oils based on regenerative farming practices are underdeveloped. So are ‘power-to-liquids’, which use green hydrogen and carbon capture to generate a liquid jet fuel, often called an e-fuel.

But if travel buyers are getting in early with purchases, they’re helping to kickstart the industry of the future, in a similar way to investments in solar power decades ago. Solar is now cheap to install, ubiquitous and has lower generation costs than new fossil fuel projects. So, what are the options?

Buy it direct from producers

This is the best way to source SAF. You then have a clear line of sight on what you’re getting and from whom. Transparency and traceability matters. One of the world’s largest producers and the most prominent in Europe is the Finnish company Neste. Many buyers will not have the volumes to source directly. However, knowing who the producer is at the end of the supply chain is essential, and that they are reputable. World Energy, Alder Fuels and SkyNRG are also big players in this space.

Buy it from airlines

Air France-KLM is a standout, then there’s United Airlines and Norwegian. T&E’s SAF Observatory ranks airlines on their use of SAF and what it’s sourced from.

Airlines have subsequently partnered with energy companies to source the stuff, some of which are also fossil fuel firms. For instance, Air France-KLM has an agreement with TotalEnergies to produce SAF.

IATA plans to launch a SAF registry this quarter allowing any airline to source certified and compliant fuel.

In a recent development, easyJet has been trialling its own SAF scheme with customer Airbus and is now rolling it out to other corporates. Under the scheme, easyJet will work with corporate partners to determine a specific quantity of SAF to cover their travel requirements.

Once it has pooled demand, it will use its purchasing power to buy the SAF from a fuel supplier at a better price and deliver it to a chosen airport where the SAF will be used by all carriers operating there.

Corporates are provided with non-tradeable, verified SAF certificates which they can register as part of their Scope 3 reporting (see more on page 26).

Buy it from TMCs

Whether it’s ATPI, CWT, Reed & Mackay, American Express GBT or other travel management companies, SAF can be purchased through a ‘book and claim’ system, where SAF is ‘booked’ into a fuel system and the benefits are ‘claimed’ elsewhere.

A number of TMCs source their fuel direct from producers such as Neste. Again, travel managers must know where their SAF is coming from. Due diligence is essential.

Buy it from digital platforms

New digital and data-fed platforms are now available to travel buyers. A number are more widely active in the climate technology industry.

For instance, CWT and BCD Travel have adopted Berlin-based Squake. This allows corporate travel buyers to use an automated solution for procuring SAF on a trip-by-trip basis. Such platforms offer wider carbon budgeting, forecasting and reporting tools to clients. Squake again sources SAF from Neste directly.

Buy it using blockchain tools

Blockchain allows for a reputable digitised public ledger for SAF, so that purchases are efficient, traceable and transparent with environmental data on the fuel used.

It is why Amex GBT has adopted the technology through Avelia, a blockchain powered book-and-claim solution, which involves Shell Aviation and Accenture. Rolls-Royce, Google, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America are just some of the 20 or so firms signed up to Avelia.

Buy it from energy suppliers

Traditional fossil fuel companies are also getting in on the act, including BP, Chevron, Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Eni.

These six oil majors have 43 biofuel projects that are either already operational or are targeted to start up by 2030, according to Rystad Energy.

Many are creating their own biorefineries using ‘waste and residues from the circular economy.’ Some companies are doing direct location-based deals on SAF.

For instance, DHL buys from Shell at Brussels Airport. This is a carbon ‘insetting’ practice – as opposed to offsetting, since it addresses carbon emissions directly inside DHL’s own value chain.

The issues with investing in SAF

If air transport is to become more sustainable, rapid action is needed to boost production of sustainable aviation fuels.

The UK Government is betting airport expansion on the ability to ramp up SAF.

Fuel demand will also have to rise since air passenger numbers globally are projected to more than double by 2050, undermining the industry’s ability to cut carbon emissions.

According to green group, Transport and Environment, such growth means the airline sector could be burning as much fossil kerosene as it did in 2023, even when using SAF for 42% of its fuel, as mandated by EU legislation.

The issue at the moment is a lack of supply and high prices, which are up to five times that of traditional jet fuel. Investing in SAF is likely to bring prices down, but more capacity is needed.

It doesn’t help that there is a lack of biorefineries under construction. These require extensive capital expenditure.

Plants typically cost £600 million to £2 billion to reach economies of scale and tend to run at a loss during their first years of operation.

Shell has now paused SAF projects and in the U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to repeal Joe Biden’s green measures under the Inflation Reduction Act. This includes tax credits for SAF producers, so uncertainly plagues the sector, globally.

Who’s responsibility is it anyway?

IATA says oil majors, who supply jet fuel to the industry, should be responsibility for the ramp up of SAF, rather than airlines, who do not produce any fuel themselves directly.

It’s why the UK Government is now talking about a levy on traditional fuel suppliers. The levy would cover the cost of payments to SAF producers, so the country can meet its mandate for SAF production. This idea is out for consultation.

Ultimately, it will be the traveller that pays, but right now a stand-off could be looming between oil companies who may not want to produce SAF without long-term commitments, and airlines who won’t necessarily commit to SAF without lower prices.

In the UK, a levy would deal with this, providing a price guarantee and a so-called revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers. Watch this space!",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SAF-1.png,N,,2025-03-18 13:58:10.653685

In Hong Kong, where Towngas is based, a new third runway opened in 2022 after six years in construction.","By Alan Chan, Chief Investment Officer, The Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited (Towngas) / Managing Partner and Co-Founder of Full Vision Capital

The move to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport is, to put it mildly, controversial. The angst and opposition over the cost, the time to build and the subsequent noise and air pollution, seemingly in defiance of the UK net-zero carbon emissions commitment, is understandable.

Yet, take a step back and you will see an aviation industry that is developing rapidly amid growing demand for travel and green transition. The latter includes growing usage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). There’s plenty to consider and, while there are valid concerns over carbon emissions, there are powerful mitigating factors that suggest the proposed long-term strategy for Heathrow may be the right one.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), aviation accounted for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions in 2023, rising back to above pre-pandemic levels. To give that some context, automotives account for around 12% and fast fashion about 10%. However, aviation as a sector is growing fast. The EU estimates that commercial flights could increase as much as 42% by 2040.

The commercial case for an extra runway is a powerful one, but public concerns about increased pollution and meeting net-zero-emission commitments need to be addressed. The UK, the European Union and several other countries have legally binding net-zero commitments, mostly by 2050. All have interim targets – stepping stones to net-zero – that are critical. Aviation has a big part to play and that’s where SAF comes in.

SAF is produced from sustainable feedstock that includes waste and residue fats, such as vegetable oil, used cooking oil, and animal fats, as well as purpose-grown crops like jatropha and camelina. These feedstocks are processed with hydrogen to remove oxygen and create hydrocarbon fuel components. SAF has the same energy intensity as jet fuel and can be safely blended with it. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 75%-90%, depending on the feedstock composition.

Regulation, SAF driving change in aviation

So, what factors support the airport expansion? Besides the economic benefits, there are two major factors.

The first is regulatory impetus. The EU has mandated the use of SAF in aviation fuel, rising in incremental amounts through to 2050. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which took effect at the start of 2024, requires aviation fuel to have a minimum 2% of SAF from 2025. This percentage rises to 20% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. Use of synthetic SAF is mandatory too with 5% in 2030 rising to 35% in 2050.

Yes, the UK is no longer in the EU, but it is surrounded by EU countries and will need to follow suit. Singapore has similar legislation and Hong Kong will do likewise, as will other airports with flights that go to Europe. The UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate will see incremental increases in SAF usage, similar to the EU.

The second factor is the amount of SAF coming on stream, helping to meet current global demand of about two million tons – demand that is forecast to reach 10 million tons by 2030. Finland’s Neste Corporation is the world’s largest producer, but more manufacturers entering the market. One of the leading and most exciting producers is Hong Kong-based EcoCeres Inc., a company which received early funding from Full Vision Capital and is now 43% owned by Towngas.

Innovative startups supported by TERA Awards developing clean fuels

EcoCeres is a major producer of SAF and major feedstocks for SAF, hydro-treated vegetable oil (HVO) and cellulosic ethanol (CE). SAF and HVO are ISCC certified as offering emissions reductions of up to 95%. CE can offer reductions of up to 80%. With new plants in Suzhou, China, and Johor, Malaysia, that are scaling up output, EcoCeres is an example of the rapid growth in this sector.

It’s true that although SAF effectively eliminates CO2 emissions, there are still non-CO2 emissions, such as water vapor, sulphur dioxide (SO2), soot particles, and nitrogen oxides (NOx). However, SAF emits far fewer non-CO2 pollutants than jet fuel, and this can be reduced with high blends and quality feedstock.

In Hong Kong, where Towngas is based, a new third runway opened in 2022 after six years in construction. It was controversial. But air traffic has risen sharply since, albeit from low pandemic levels, and is set to continue upwards over next decade. Heathrow will see the same over the next decade and beyond – that’s inevitable. It makes sense to be ready.",https://149885598.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Alan-Chan-2023.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 13:00:05.838550

HVO Class II fob ARA trading activity on the Intercontinental Exchange (Ice) rose as European fuel suppliers increasingly seek renewable diesel made from used cooking oil (UCO) to meet higher mandates and overcome the 7pc restriction for blending conventional methyl ester biodiesel into diesel.

The total traded volume for the first two weeks of March (1-14) was 120,000t, close to the previous full-month high in January of 138,000t (see chart).

The Ice contract — a cash-settled future that settles based on Argus spot price assessments — launched in 2022 as both a differential to Ice low sulphur gasoil and outright, with the former most commonly traded.

Physical HVO interest has been more measured through the beginning of 2025, although spot trade rose year on year.

Changes to key biofuels policies in Germany and the Netherlands are expected to support overall demand and anticipation of this has supported HVO paper liquidity.

Germany has paused the carryover of surplus tickets that would otherwise go towards meeting its greenhouse gas (GHG) savings quota, meaning obligated parties will have to use more physical biofuels to meet mandates, while the Netherlands has limited the amount of tickets allowed to be carried from year to year, driving a similar dynamic.

The start of the year is often a slower physical trading period in northwest Europe as market participants look to finish off compliance submissions for the previous year. Anticipating changes to ticket carryover policies, some physical biofuels were stored in tank to be used at the start of the year, particularly in Germany, suppressing prompt demand. Class II HVO has also been affected by high feedstock prices, which have pressured production margins, and strong imports from east of Suez.

Ticket values in Germany and the Netherlands have been below the equivalent cost of blending physical Class II HVO, further limiting demand. In the Dutch market HBE-IXB prices have been pressured by supply of UCO-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends, which generate 2.4 HBEs per GJ as per the biofuel portion, while German ticket prices have been affected by lower diesel demand and a focus on finishing off 2024 balances.

The prompt/front-month price spread for Class II, which gives an indication of the prompt market's strength or weakness, has been volatile for the past month according to Argus assessments (see chart). The spread flipped into contango for the first week of March following a supply surge which weighed on European prices, then returned to backwardation as HVO prices tracked UCO and UCO-based biodiesel prices higher.

Prompt UCO prices have in turn been supported by tighter global supply following a protracted export ban from Indonesia, which is still expected to be temporary, contributing to the forward curve backwardation.

HVO paper trading on 14 March focused on the upcoming three months. An April/May spread traded at $10/t ($1,055/t, $1,045/t) for 5,000t/month, or 10,000t total, a May/June spread traded at $5/t ($1,045/t, $1,040/t) for 13,000t/month, or 26,000t total, and a second quarter contract traded at $1,065/t for 2,000t/month, or 6,000t total. All of the trades were as premiums to front-month Ice gasoil.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-03-18 11:31:48.329244

The agreement, effective from March 12, 2025, outlines a cooperative effort to convert used cooking oil into SAF feedstock, advancing environmental sustainability.

The ""Agreement on Collaboration and Cooperation in Promoting the Adoption of SAF"" aims to encourage the collection and recycling of used cooking oil into SAF. A signing ceremony was held on the same day at Cosmo Oil's Sakai Refinery, Japan's first major SAF production facility.

Suita City will supply around 27,000 liters of used cooking oil annually for this initiative—the largest contribution of its kind from a Japanese municipality. As part of Suita City's General Waste Management Plan, the city has actively supported accessible recycling systems. Since 2009, Suita has installed collection points for used cooking oil at public facilities, facilitating proper disposal and reuse. While this resource can become valuable SAF feedstock, many households still discard it as waste. Through this partnership, Suita City will expand collection efforts to convert waste oil into aviation fuel, empowering citizens to contribute to a carbon-free, resource-recycling society.

The five collaborating organizations will work together to build a sustainable and decarbonized society by:

Collecting household-generated used cooking oil.

Supporting production and continued SAF supply.

Raising public awareness about recycling used cooking oil into SAF.

Expanding oil collection points across Suita City.

Developing additional initiatives aligned with the Agreement's objectives.

Key Initiatives:

Used cooking oil collected from 15 public facilities, including city offices and libraries, will be transported by REVO International to the SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY plant located at Cosmo Oil's Sakai Refinery. This facility, completed in December 2024, will lead Japan's large-scale SAF production efforts by converting recycled cooking oil into sustainable fuel. Additionally, oil from 35 municipal elementary schools and 14 public daycare centers will be collected for SAF production, bringing the annual total to approximately 27,000 liters.

To further encourage participation, Cosmo Oil's service stations in Suita City may also become collection points. To promote awareness, citizens who donate used cooking oil will be entered into a lottery featuring prizes like ""Suitan Goods"" (the city's mascot-themed items) and SAF facility tour invitations. The initiative will also extend awareness campaigns to local businesses to boost engagement and promote sustainable practices.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-18 10:50:34.617704

The coalition is asking EPA to propose and finalize the 2026 biomass-based diesel volume at no less than 5.25 billion gal., with a corresponding increase in the advanced biofuel volume.

“We write today to ask that EPA without delay set 2026 RFS standards and adopt a robust step change in biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel volumes,” the letter states. “Setting these volumes for 2026 and establishing consistent growth for 2027 and beyond based on the industry’s investments and projections will ensure that American consumers can access affordable and clean transportation options. These volumes will support farm security, create jobs and economic opportunity and further President Trump’s goal for U.S. energy dominance.”

Over the past several years, significant investments in biofuel production capacity and feedstock supply have led to a doubling of domestic biodiesel and renewable diesel production. Currently, these fuels account for approximately 9% of U.S. on-road diesel demand, providing consumers with cost-effective, domestically produced clean fuel options, the coalition said.

Prices for B20 biodiesel blends have averaged 14 cents/gal. lower than conventional diesel since 2021, benefiting both consumers and the economy. The industry’s continued expansion supports U.S. energy security, farm prosperity and rural economic development by creating markets for agricultural byproducts and repurposing waste materials such as rendered fats and used cooking oil.

Despite these advances, the RFS volumes for 2023-2025 failed to reflect the industry's rapid growth, undermining market confidence and causing some producers to idle capacity.

Additionally, the consultants propose introducing a levy on airline tickets and levying a tax on revenues from SAF production through waste recycling.
These measures could help generate the necessary financial resources to significantly increase SAF production in the coming years.
The challenge of meeting the global demand for sustainable jet fuel is enormous and requires extensive investments in infrastructure and technology.","The global aviation industry faces a huge challenge in supplying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to meet global demand in the coming decades. According to a recent study by the management consultancy EY, investments in SAF production will need to increase dramatically in the coming years to meet rapidly changing requirements. The cost of building the necessary production capacity is expected to rise to between one and 1,5 trillion US dollars in the coming years—a sum nearly equivalent to the entire annual investment in oil and gas infrastructure worldwide.

The aviation industry has long faced the challenge of reducing its CO2 emissions and finding sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Sustainable jet fuel is considered a promising solution, as it offers a direct way to reduce aircraft CO2 emissions without requiring changes to the entire aviation industry infrastructure. However, significant hurdles remain, particularly with regard to production capacity, which is currently far from sufficient to meet future demand.

The growing demand for SAF

According to the EY study, demand for SAF will increase dramatically in the coming decades. Global markets for sustainable jet fuel are in a growth phase driven by strict regulatory requirements and growing demand for climate-friendly fuels. Demand is forecast to increase dramatically, particularly in Europe. Estimates indicate that by 2050, more than half of Europe's total jet fuel demand will be met by SAF. This would equate to a demand of approximately 73,1 million tons of SAF in Europe alone. In North America, the second-largest market, demand is expected to be around 60 million tons.

The European market is further driven by the EU regulation on reducing CO2 emissions and the airlines' commitment to use sustainable fuels. Starting in 2023, all airlines operating in Europe must cover at least two percent of their kerosene consumption with SAF. By 2030, this share is expected to increase to at least six percent. However, the current share of SAF is only 0,2 percent of total kerosene consumption in Europe, highlighting the magnitude of the challenge.

Costs and investments

According to the EY study, the necessary investments to expand SAF production capacity are enormous. To meet the estimated demand in 2050, between 5.000 and 7.000 new production facilities will be needed worldwide. These facilities would require significant investments in infrastructure, research, and development. The total cost of expanding SAF production is estimated at up to $1,5 trillion. This corresponds to approximately six to ten percent of the annual investments currently flowing into the oil and gas industry's infrastructure.

Despite the high investment requirements, EY experts believe that these expenditures are not so high when viewed in relation to global investments in fossil fuels. According to EY, the oil industry could provide a significant portion of the required funds, as it already benefits from high oil and gas prices. The funds could be collected through various mechanisms, such as a central fund at the EU level, which would include revenues from the EU emissions trading system or fines for violations of climate protection regulations. These funds could then be invested in expanding SAF production.

Production and challenges

Despite the promising growth of the SAF market, production capacity currently remains limited. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global SAF production is expected to reach only 2023 million tons in 2,1, accounting for only approximately 0,7 percent of total jet fuel consumption. In Germany, SAF production is expected to reach a mere 2026 million tons by 0,08. This highlights the enormous discrepancy between current production volumes and future demand.

Currently, 264 new SAF production projects are planned worldwide, 103 of which are located in North America and 98 in Europe. Many airlines have already signed supply agreements with SAF producers to meet their own climate targets and meet the demand for sustainable fuel. Despite these numerous projects, however, the supply of SAF remains tight, forcing airlines to resort to alternative solutions or invest in research and development of their own SAF production capacities.

Potential solutions and future prospects

A key aspect addressed by the EY experts is the need to create a central fund at the EU level to expand the SAF industry. This fund could be funded by revenues from the EU emissions trading system and fines from climate protection violations. Additionally, the consultants propose introducing a levy on airline tickets and levying a tax on revenues from SAF production through waste recycling. These measures could help generate the necessary financial resources to significantly increase SAF production in the coming years.

The challenge of meeting the global demand for sustainable jet fuel is enormous and requires extensive investments in infrastructure and technology. Given the increasing demand for SAF and the political mandate for CO2 reduction, both the aviation industry and policymakers are called upon to find joint solutions to expand production capacities and ensure the supply of sustainable jet fuel.",https://i0.wp.com/aviation.direct/wp-content/uploads/1_Skytanking.jpg?fit=1200%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-03-18 13:58:17.403296

Disruptions to the graphite supply chain threaten US competitiveness, energy independence, and economic vitality. Homeostasis’ technology allows for the domestic production of graphite using small, modular, and portable electrochemical reactors.

Both the US Departments of Defense and Energy have recognized graphite as a critical mineral, and Homeostasis is stepping up to meet this need. In addition to securing a domestic graphite supply, many industries are looking to capture CO2 emissions directly at the source.

However, existing carbon capture technologies are often complex to install and fail to address long-term storage. Homeostasis turns this challenge into a business opportunity by converting waste CO2 into graphite and other valuable carbon materials with an easily installable solution.

Dr. Julien Lombardi, Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer of Homeostasis, “CO2 doesn’t have to be waste. We can strengthen our energy infrastructure by transforming excess carbon into an abundant feedstock. Homeostasis technology unlocks the productive potential of CO2 gas.”

“When speaking with customers who want to capture emissions, we’ve found that the pain points really come down to geopolitical risk, project development time, product lead time and cost,” said Co-Founder and CEO Makoto Eyre.

“Our technology stack resolves all of these problems with the single gesture of synthesizing critical materials from CO2.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has significantly upgraded its IATA CO2 Connect emissions calculator by incorporating reductions in carbon emissions associated with the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This enhancement aims to provide a more precise and transparent measurement of aviation-related emissions, reinforcing the industry’s commitment to sustainability.

Advancing SAF Accounting and Reporting

This development follows the recent release of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology, which establishes standardized accounting rules and best practices for including SAF in per-passenger CO2 data. In its initial phase, CO2 Connect will distribute emission reductions uniformly across an airline’s network, ensuring that all flights receive an equal percentage reduction based on the total SAF procured. Future updates will refine this approach, allowing SAF-related emission reductions to be assigned to specific routes, further enhancing accuracy and accountability.

Expanding Participation in CO2 Connect

IATA CO2 Connect leverages actual operational data, including aircraft type-specific fuel consumption figures directly supplied by airlines. This distinguishes it from other calculators that rely on generalized modeling and assumptions.

The tool’s credibility continues to grow as more airlines join the initiative. The latest additions—Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas, and Royal Air Maroc—bring the total number of contributing airlines to approximately 60. Each new participant enhances the precision and reliability of CO2 Connect’s emissions calculations, benefiting both individual travelers and corporate users seeking accurate sustainability metrics.

As IATA continues to refine its emissions calculation methodologies, CO2 Connect remains a crucial tool in fostering transparency and progress in sustainable aviation.

“Corporations and individual travelers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President Commercial Products and Services.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonization powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.

On 1 January, the UK Department for Transport (DfT) introduced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, meaning at least 2% of all jet fuel aboard flights taking off from UK airports must be SAF by law. This is set to expand to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 – delivering up to 6.3 mega tonnes of carbon savings per year according to government figures – but what exactly is SAF, how is it made, how much can be produced and is it really the answer to our collective net zero aspirations? Figures quoted by the DfT confirm that SAF production in Britain increased 188% from 2022 to 2023, rising from 48m to 138.1m litres. That accounted for less than 1% of the 14bn litres of conventional jet fuel consumed in the UK that year. Meanwhile, figures published by the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service’s Global Agricultural Information Network in December 2024 reveal that 287.5m litres of SAF will be needed this year alone to meet the 2% SAF mandate – meaning that 2023 figures would cover just 48% of the fuel needed.

Looking further ahead, the DfT estimates that 1.5bn litres of SAF will be needed each year in order to meet the mandated 10% level required in 2030. Put simply, in 2023 the UK produced 9.2% of the SAF that the industry will need in 2030. Can it upscale production to produce the missing 90.8% by the end of this decade? Or will the UK need to import fuel from overseas?

It should be noted at this point that although trials have been conducted using 100% SAF – and the 2025 UK mandate is just 2% - there are currently physical limits in terms of how much can be blended with conventional Jet A1 for commercial operations. Fossil fuels contain natural aromatics, which are absorbed by some types of elastomer-based engine components, helping them seal. SAF has lower levels of aromatics and, therefore, has the potential to cause leaks due to seal shrinkage. Researchers are developing ways to produce synthetic aromatics but currently SAF needs to be blended with conventional fuel for safe operation.

Incentives and enforcement

The government has chosen to enforce the mandate via a traceable certificate scheme for fuel suppliers. These suppliers will receive a certificate confirming the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction their fuels – either manufactured or imported – have achieved over the previous year and these can then be used to prove they have met their obligations. Fuel manufacturers and suppliers also have the option to sell excess certificates via a buyout mechanism to other suppliers who may need them because they have not been able to produce or import sufficient to meet their obligations. A maximum price of £4.70 each has been set for these certificates, which aims to prevent excessive costs being passed on to consumers, and the DfT says the buyout price has been designed to encourage the supply and trading of certificates rather than their sale for profit.

From 2027, the UK’s mandate also requires innovation in the feedstocks that can be used, imposing a cap on feedstocks derived from hydroprocessed esters (organic compounds that react with water to produce alcohols or acids) and fatty acids (HEFA) and, from 2028, including a separate power-to-liquid obligation. By way of incentivising companies to set up SAF production facilities in the UK, the government has also announced that it will introduce a ‘revenue certainty mechanism.’ It is hoped this will attract investment in new production plants in Britain and a new consultation on the mechanism is set to be launched in early 2025. The term SAF covers several basic pathways of producing a lower carbon-emitting jet fuel from, mostly, waste products.

The fatty answer

A light-hearted study (see Frequent Fryer Insight blog, 12 March 2024) discovered that it would take 357,143 portions of chips to fuel a transatlantic Dreamliner with 60 tonnes of neat, unblended SAF.

One of the most established and widely used forms of SAF production comes from the use of HEFA. This uses a feedstock made up from waste fats, oils and greases – notably used chip fat – as well as waste from food production, such as tallow (or beef dripping as it is better known in Britain). The supply of these by-products is finite and no matter how many portions of chips we eat the potential to produce SAF is limited (See ‘Frequent Fryer’ AEROSPACE Insight blog, 12 March 2024). As such, the recent SAF mandate includes a cap on the amount of HEFA that can be used to meet the obligations. HEFA can contribute a maximum amount (100%) of SAF demand in 2025 and 2026, decreasing to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

Pros: Mature technology already widely deployed. Cheapest among current SAF types.

Cons: Feedstock availability and vulnerability to supply chain shocks. Linked to high feedstock food costs.

The corny answer

Some biofuels use agriculture crops to produce SAF. These cellulosic substances, which can come from specifically grown crops or waste products, like corn stalks or branches of chopped trees, can be processed into synthetic fuel through the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. FT is a set of chemical reactions that convert CO2 and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons.

Pros: Relatively higher blend rates possible (+/–50%).

Cons: Feedstock availability and vulnerability to supply chain shocks.

The alcohol answer

Plant-based feedstocks, including corn and sugarcane, can be converted into renewable ethanol and then into jet fuel through the ‘alcohol-to-jet’ (AtJ) pathway. AtJ removes the oxygen molecules from the ethanol and uses a variety of chemistry steps to remove the water, add hydrogen and string together other molecules into longer chains (via oligomerisation). Following further processing, these chains can then be burned as jet fuel.

However, there are questions surrounding the feedstocks used in both the FT and AtJ processes, with the population already outstripping the supply of food in many parts of the world. Alternatives include the use of plants, such as camelina, carinata and pennycress, which produce oil seeds and often grow in poor quality farmland. Other non-food feedstocks being explored include jatropha, which produces toxic inedible seeds that contain oil suitable for SAF production. It too can be grown in degraded soil in poor climates but the crop yield requires improvement before it becomes commercially viable.

Pros: Mature technology. Relatively cheap capital investment.

Cons: Also suitable for transport fuel uses, so demand is likely to increase sale price. Concerns over using land better utilised for food crop production.

The salty answer

Other options for FT feedstocks come from salty environments, such as coastal areas. Here, salt marsh grasses, such as halophytes – which can grow in salt water or in areas affected by sea spray – can provide biomass either via their seeds or their cellulosic biomass. Trials have also been conducted growing microscopic algae in salt water environments. These fast-growing plants can rapidly produce a feedstock and tests show they can provide up to 15 times more oil per square mile than other feedstocks. Some types of CO2 absorbing algae also make them ideal for carbon sequestration.

Pros: Abundant feedstock. High production ratio.

Cons: Relatively immature technology.

The rubbish answer

According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), UK households combined produce around 27.7m tonnes of domestic waste each year (around 400kg per person) with just 45% of it currently being recycled.

Gasification converts carbon-based material, like waste packaging, clothing, bottles, newspapers and even food into syngas, which can then be turned into SAF. There is a large feedstock and a key advantage of this method is that it will reduce the amount of waste being disposed of in landfill sites, thus reducing the damaging methane gas produced as it rots.

Pros: Relatively higher blend rates possible (+/–50%).

Cons: Feedstock availability in high demand. Vulnerability to supply chain shocks.

The liquid answer

OXCCU’s OX1 demonstration plant opened in Oxford in August 2024. It converts CO2 and hydrogen directly into long-chain hydrocarbons for use as SAF. A larger plan is scheduled to open in Hull in 2026. (OXCCU)

So-called Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels are created synthetically from CO2, water and renewable electricity. The three-step process begins with ‘green’ electricity sources being used to produce hydrogen. It is then synthesised with climate-neutral CO2 (for example, CO2 captured via a Direct Air Carbon Capture system) and converted into carbon feedstock via the FT process to create liquid hydrocarbons. These are then converted into a synthetic kerosene equivalent. Unlike other SAFs, some PtL fuels essentially use the CO2 released during combustion of carbon fuels in their creation, thus ‘closing the CO2 loop’ and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 90% compared to fossil fuels. Research is also being undertaken into converting solar power into jet fuel (using the sunlight to break up water and CO2 molecules). However, it is important to note that experts warn against green electricity being diverted from the grid to produce SAF and proffer that such power is better used to service sectors such as road vehicles and heating.

Pros: Abundant feedstocks. Likely the cleanest fuel possible.

Cons: Energy-intensive and expensive to produce. Dependent on clean electricity and captured carbon availability.

UK production

Average price of SAF - Fig 1. Average price of aviation fuel, per gallon, as of February 2025.

There is huge potential for the UK to lead the world in SAF production, and research carried out for the DfT indicates that by 2040 the sector could generate up to £1.66bn a year for the UK economy. Potentially, half of that figure could come from the export of intellectual property and the provision of engineering services alone. Producing its own fuel would also help the UK increase its fuel security and be less reliant on volatile supply chains, and the government also projects that up to 11,000 ‘green jobs’ could also be created across the UK. As of early 2025, the UK only has one industrial-scale SAF refinery facility. Owned by Phillips 66 and located in Humberside since 2017, the facility produces fuel from sustainable waste feedstocks. Meanwhile, through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), the government has issued grants to several aspiring SAF producers [see map below] and, in January 2025, a further £63m of funding was announced.

The price of sustainability

Life cycle analysis Fig 2. The well-to-wake GHG emissions (grammes of CO2 eq/MJ of trisobutane) resulting from Jet A-1compared to SAFs.

The projected price of SAF fluctuates wildly, depending on sources and agendas. Investigation by KPMG in 2022 suggested that, when compared to Jet A-1, the end user price varied from just a few percentage points (in nations where government incentives were in place) to up to a 500% increase. As of February 2025, the average price for SAF in the US was $9.02 per gallon – some 282% higher than the average price of $2.36 per gallon of Jet A-1 at the time. The adoption of SAF will most likely result in an increase in airline ticket prices but, as more passengers become conscious of the ‘greenness’ of the fuel their journey burns, airlines must also be increasingly transparent regarding their true life cycle well-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions. This considers how a feedstock is cultivated, where and how it is transported, and its ultimate conversion to fuel (see Figure 2). Understanding this helps fend off claims of ‘greenwashing’, which have beset the industry over the last few years.

While many European countries are trying to restrict the manufacture of crop-based biofuels, the resultant shift in demand for waste oil is outpacing supply, and waste products are now being imported from overseas (itself adding to the carbon life cycle of the fuel). In 2023, a report by Brussels-based NGO Transport & Environment claimed to have uncovered cases of fraudulent transactions where palm oil products were mislabelled as waste in order to circumvent regulations. With palm oil contributing to global deforestation, its use in SAF could have a far more detrimental effect on the climate than the Jet A-1 it is supposed to replace.

UK as a SAF superpower

Green Fuels Research, Petrofac and Cranfield University have collaborated to create FIREFLY, which aims to convert the approximately 53m tonnes of raw sewage sludge created in the UK each year into SAF. (Severn Trent Water).

As production is scaled up, and economies of scale come into effect, the cost of SAF will undoubtedly reduce but this requires incentivisation of fuel companies to invest in production facilities and new technologies and airlines to increase the amount of SAF it acquires. In its 2022 study SAF – Ready for lift-off?, KPMG emphasised that “while it remains cheaper for airlines to offset carbon emissions through trading schemes than through the use of SAF in place of Jet A-1, we do not expect SAF supply to meaningfully exceed government-mandated levels.”

In the Autumn Budget, the UK government pledged to support UK SAF development and committed to deliver £975m in R&D support. This support of the sector is reassuring for many. However, the UK is competing more than ever for private investment in the global market. Under the Biden administration, the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included trillions of dollars in incentives for low-carbon technologies, including tax credits to the worth of $1.25 per gallon of SAF produced. While the future of that policy remains unconfirmed, the EU is also issuing billions of euros in carbon allowances to help reduce the unit price of SAF.

The cost and complexity of testing is often cited as a significant barrier to new fuels entering the market. To help overcome this and, thus, make the UK more attractive to overseas investors, the UK DfT has provided £700,000 for the establishment of a SAF Clearing House. Opened in April 2024 as a central hub providing cross-industry support for SAF development, testing, certification and production, the facility aims to co-ordinate the approval process.

Through its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Innovation Programme, Innovate UK (IUK) is among the groups aiming to advance the UK SAF supply chain. Analysis by IUK shows that, by June 2024, £14.7bn had been invested in SAF development around the world. The UK ranks fourth in the world for SAF investment, with nine companies receiving overseas private investment from financiers. The road to net zero was never going to be quick or easy, but aerospace sector experts say one of the biggest hurdles to the production of sufficient SAF to meet demand is actually a lack of low-carbon power. The production of hydrogen is incredibly power intensive and the manufacture of sustainable fuel is equally hungry. In its Net Zero Carbon Road Map, experts at the Sustainable Aviation group estimate that the sector will require an additional 147TWh of additional renewable energy to achieve its contribution to net zero by 2050 (that is roughly half the entire UK’s current electricity consumption). It suggests that future hydrogen/electric aircraft will require 63TWh, SAF manufacture will require 50TWh and carbon removal technologies will need a further 34TWh.

Britain has the potential to be a major player in the global SAF market. If all of the projects funded by AFF grants come to fruition, the UK would have the capability to produce more than 1bn litres of sustainable fuel each year. Around 65% of the carbon reductions necessary to meet net zero 2050 targets are estimated to come from using SAF. The opportunities are many – let’s not waste them.

However, the hydrogen economy remains far from mature.

The economic feasibility and sustainable production of hydrogen fuel have yet to be ironed out, meaning the energy source is taking far longer to scale than was initially anticipated.

Business leaders and industry experts are being forced recalibrate their expectations, with much work to be done on actual implementation as the market edges from theory into application.

The decarbonising power of hydrogen

The trajectory of the hydrogen production industry has evolved in recent years.

The sector saw a sharp decrease in new project announcements in 2024, dropping by over 80% worldwide.

This pull-back represents a moderation from earlier ambitious projections as industry players refocus on effectively advancing existing projects and capital commitments.

""Decarbonising refinery fuel is essential and low-carbon hydrogen provides a clear pathway,"" said Eugenia Belloni Pocorob, bp's Lead H2 and CC(U)S for the Netherlands, during her speech at StocExpo 2025.

""The technical and financial challenges remain substantial, but the opportunity for emissions reduction is undeniable.""

The transport sector sees hydrogen's promise too.

Amit Rao, Principal Consultant at S&P Global, highlights hydrogen's long-established industrial uses and its burgeoning appeal in the aviation sector.

""We are seeing airline manufacturers investigating pure hydrogen solutions beyond sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),"" he notes.

""It may seem far-fetched now, but technological advances happen rapidly.""

However, the substantial cost linked with hydrogen projects, including Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), is particularly challenging.

""The scale of capital required for CCS projects is enormous,"" Amit explains.

""We have already seen major industry players reconsider their green commitments. The question is: where will the funding come from, and who will drive the transition?""

Traditional investment frameworks are also under scrutiny as investors typically favour shorter payback periods.

""The appetite for quick returns does not align with the realities of hydrogen investment,"" says Eugenia. ""We need a different type of investor - one willing to take a long-term view.""

Government policy has crucially bolstered early-stage projects in the UK, setting up competition frameworks that enhance the entire value chain's alignment.

""By aligning the entire value chain, these initiatives have made projects more viable,"" explains Matt Wilson, Head of New Energy Markets at Navigator Terminals.

""Future developments will build on this foundation.""

How geopolitics is impacting hydrogen strategies worldwide

Worldwide political landscapes significantly shape the course of hydrogen investment and project advancement.

Potential adjustments in US policy and increased trade conflicts could profoundly influence the sector.

""We need to wait out the Trump presidency to gain clarity on the long-term outlook,"" Amit says.

""Over the next four years, we are likely to see renewed trade conflicts—not just with China but across the board.""

In Europe, the redirection of funds towards defence could reshape priorities within the energy transition, potentially sidelining budgets meant for hydrogen projects.

""If governments allocate 3% or more of GDP to defence, other sectors will inevitably face budgetary constraints,"" says Amit.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/05a8f5757f43b72be62524f8b54cdaa0:4b36d662d01525769cdc0790d6a48110/gettyimages-2152072696.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 08:51:20.556897

The joint declaration emphasizes the urgency of advancing this partnership, stating: “This partnership must deliver short- and long-term solutions without delay to enable Sasol to export sustainable fuel, particularly aviation fuel, to the EU. This includes addressing compliance and regulatory issues. The EU further commits to supporting Sasol’s long-term decarbonisation efforts, especially at Secunda, thereby contributing to a Just Energy Transition.”

Sasol has also expressed optimism regarding South Africa's 2025 Budget Review, published by National Treasury on 12 March 2025. The budget outlines promising policy changes, particularly regarding the carbon tax framework, which aligns with South Africa's broader energy transition objectives. While these updates are subject to parliamentary approval, the adjustments indicate positive momentum for sustainable growth.

Key highlights of the carbon tax revisions include:

Retaining the basic tax-free allowance at 60% until at least 2030. This change deviates from the previously planned annual reductions starting in 2026 outlined in the Phase 2 Carbon Tax discussion paper.

Increasing the allowance for carbon offsets.

Extending energy efficiency incentives under the 12L rebate until 2030.

Maintaining the basic tax-free allowance for hard-to-abate sectors offers crucial flexibility for businesses to invest in their energy transition efforts. The expanded credit for carbon offsets is also seen as a vital step to foster growth in this emerging market within South Africa. Together, these policy measures are designed to stimulate substantial investments in South Africa’s energy transition, ultimately strengthening energy security, economic growth, and job creation.

“While we continue advancing our strategic goals, I am encouraged by these recent policy developments from the South African government and the EU,” said Simon Baloyi, President and CEO of Sasol. “This progress highlights the strong relationship between the two regions and represents a significant milestone in securing South Africa's sustainable, low-carbon energy future. With Sasol’s Secunda Operations playing a pivotal role, the transition must align with market demands and technical feasibility.”",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-18 08:51:23.643210

Although optimism about hydrogen’s role in driving decarbonisation continues to soar, the sector grapples with formidable obstacles in scaling operations and attaining cost-effectiveness.

Key stakeholders and thought leaders are recalibrating their outlooks, prioritising practical implementation as the market transitions from ambition to tangible progress.

Hydrogen's role in the green transition

The hydrogen industry is moving from an era of heightened enthusiasm to a more grounded approach.

Throughout 2024, announcements of new initiatives plummeted by more than 80% worldwide, with manufacturers retracting previous pledges.

Nevertheless, the outlook for the future suggests a pivot towards implementation and concrete advancements on current ventures and capital allocations.“Decarbonising refinery fuel is essential and low-carbon hydrogen provides a clear pathway,” Eugenia Belloni Pocorob, Lead H2 and CC(U)S for the Netherlands at bp, said at StocExpo 2025.

“The technical and financial challenges remain substantial, but the opportunity for emissions reduction is undeniable.”

Moreover, the transport sector is taking strides in incorporating hydrogen.

With its established role in industrial applications and budding interest from the aviation sector, hydrogen's breadth of impact continues to expand.

""We are seeing airline manufacturers investigating pure hydrogen solutions beyond sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),"" says Amit Rao, Principal Consultant at S&P Global.

“It may seem far-fetched now, but technological advances happen rapidly.”

Despite the benefits it can bring, the high cost of hydrogen projects, as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is a weighty challenge.

“The scale of capital required for CCS projects is enormous,” Rao says.

“We have already seen major industry players reconsider their green commitments. The question is: where will the funding come from, and who will drive the transition?”

Funding these ventures remains a considerable challenge.

The mismatch between the demand for swift financial returns and the long-term nature of hydrogen investments is pivotal.

Eugenia says: “The appetite for quick returns does not align with the realities of hydrogen investment. We need a different type of investor — one willing to take a long-term view.”

As well as this, government interventions in places like the UK have also been instrumental, providing competition frameworks that help align stakeholders and de-risk investments, making projects more feasible.

“By aligning the entire value chain, these initiatives have made projects more viable,” shares Matt Wilson, Head of New Energy Markets at Navigator Terminals.

“Future developments will build on this foundation.”

The impact of global politics and economic shifts

The play of geopolitical forces looms large over hydrogen’s future.

Shifts in US policy and potential trade conflicts could ripple through the sector, influencing investment directions and international cooperation.

Meanwhile, Europe faces its challenges with potential increases in defence spending which could pivot financial priorities away from energy initiatives.Amit warns that shifts in US policy could have far-reaching consequences.

“We need to wait out the Trump presidency to gain clarity on the long-term outlook,” he says.

“Over the next four years, we are likely to see renewed trade conflicts — not just with China, but across the board.

“The US is moving towards decoupling from global markets, which will have profound implications for European industry.”

The European commitment to defence spending, may change energy transition priorities.

Amit continues: “If governments allocate 3% or more of GDP to defence, other sectors will inevitably face budgetary constraints.”

Navigating the future

Despite the obstacles, there lies a guarded optimism within the hydrogen industry.

The number of projects may have diminished, but the maturing market and ongoing construction of previous commitments mark significant progress.

“We may have gone from 30 projects to fewer than five, but the fact that some are now moving into construction is significant,” Eugenia says.

“The energy transition is not just theoretical — we are starting to see real implementation.”Matt adds: “The projects we have in place are gaining traction. The policy framework is set, and the risk profile has improved.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/05a8f5757f43b72be62524f8b54cdaa0:4b36d662d01525769cdc0790d6a48110/gettyimages-2152072696.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 08:51:29.054677

“By reducing risks that come with manual cooking oil management, foodservice operators can further protect their bottom line by potentially reducing insurance premiums,” Cheng explained.
According to Trinity’s Director of Operations Mike Dole, they have had zero workers’ compensation claims since implementing the automated cooking oil management solution.
Total Oil Management’s customer portal also helps manage cooking oil to ensure efficient use of the system.","As owner and operator of 60 Zaxby’s restaurant locations across eight states, 1788 Chicken knows an important secret that is key to the taste of the restaurant’s famous fried chicken fingers.

“Having good quality oil in our fryers at all times is imperative,” said J. Cody Neal, vice president of operations for 1788 Chicken. “Otherwise, the chicken fingers that we put out just don’t taste like our chicken fingers.”

Despite the company’s standard operating procedures, Neal and his team had trouble determining whether all employees across the 60 locations were properly filtering and changing each restaurant’s oil. On top of that, changing out the oil was a difficult process that involved manually emptying hot oil into caddies, which were then carried through the back of the restaurants to a dumpster where it was poured into a grease trap. Then, the fryers had to be manually refilled with fresh oil poured from large jugs. The entire process opened the door to the industry’s two top safety risks: slip-and-fall accidents and burns.

After searching for a solution to the problem, Neal came across Restaurant Technologies‘ automated Total Oil Management solution, which allows employees to fill fryers with oil with just the push of a button, eliminating the need for manual handling. Additionally, oil is delivered in bulk to external holding tanks, reducing costs, improving maintenance and eliminating safety risks.

“Being able to simplify operations for the back-of-house was the biggest reason I wanted to make the switch,” Neal said. “It would be a relief to no longer worry about our people hauling oil across our kitchens or the risk of a caddy spilling and creating an unsafe and unsanitary mess.”

The move has also helped 1788 Chicken reduce its oil costs by .3% which, across 60 restaurant locations, resulted in annual savings of more than $500,000.

“With all of the moving parts in restaurants, the Total Oil Management solution can offer peace of mind during meal rushes that can sometimes be chaotic,” said David Cheng, public relations manager for Restaurant Technologies.

According to OSHA and various leading food safety organizations, two of the top safety concerns for foodservice operators are slip-and-fall accidents, along with burns–oil-related or otherwise, Cheng said.

The Total Oil Management solution addresses these concerns by significantly reducing oil spills that can lead to slip-and-fall accidents, and it can also significantly reduce oil burns by automating one of the dirtiest jobs in the kitchen.

By automating cooking oil management, operators can create a safer workplace for employees who can continue to work without having to worry about managing hot cooking oil—one of the most dangerous jobs in commercial kitchens. In turn, managers are given the peace of mind that employees will be available to work and can focus on more important tasks such as customer service.

“By reducing risks that come with manual cooking oil management, foodservice operators can further protect their bottom line by potentially reducing insurance premiums,” Cheng explained. “In short, it creates a more efficient kitchen and can also reduce costs long term.”

Trinity Corporation has also employed the technology at the seven Burger King locations it operates across Southeast Kentucky. According to Trinity’s Director of Operations Mike Dole, they have had zero workers’ compensation claims since implementing the automated cooking oil management solution.

Total Oil Management’s customer portal also helps manage cooking oil to ensure efficient use of the system.

“Instead of having to set a schedule every week, the portal provides valuable insights to help operators understand when the best time to filter and replace oil is,” Cheng explained. “Then, you’re not getting rid of fresh oil in case it’s a slower week or overusing oil that could hurt food quality in case it’s busier. It’s simply more efficient.”

As a result of those insights, since switching to the solution, Trinity Corp. has increased profits by 8% and reduced its cost of goods by 6%, saving about $300 each month on oil at each location.

“With improved visibility and better adherence to the filtration schedule, we’re easily getting an extra two days out of our oil, per fryer,” Dole said. “Getting notifications for issues like oil usage and being able to review how long employees filter the oil in the fryers helps us pinpoint where we can provide more training and development.”

This follows the recent publication of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology which includes specific accounting rules and practices on how to include SAF in per-passenger CO2 data. Initially, CO2 Connect will apply equal per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. In future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added.

“Corporations and individual travelers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President Commercial Products and Services.

Growing Number of CO2 Connect Participants

IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, directly contributed by airlines. This approach contrasts with other calculators that primarily rely on modeled averages. With the recent inclusion of Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas and Royal Air Maroc, some 60 airlines are now contributing data to CO2 Connect. With each new airline participant, the accuracy and transparency of IATA CO2 Connect’s calculations improves—for individual travelers and corporates.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonization powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.

Canada’s Aviation Plan exempts all jet fuel from federal Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR).
It’s hard for me to imagine how a government could greenlight fossil jet fuel burning more than this.","Shooting up

Let’s start by looking at the dizzying rise in jet emissions.

My first chart shows jet fuel burning since 1990. To illustrate the long-term trend, I've focused on the decade waypoints of 2005, 2015 and 2025.

That soaring black line is the amount of fossil jet fuel burned each year. The CO2 emitted is listed below in brown text. The amount of “sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF) used is shown by blue frosting sitting on top of that fossil fuel line. It's so little that it is essentially invisible at this scale.

Way back in 1990, governments knew that fossil fuel CO2 was overheating our planet. Many nations, including Canada, were promising to emit less. Back then, the global aviation industry emitted nearly half a billion tonnes of CO2 each year from burning 190 billion litres of fossil jet fuel.

Instead of reducing their climate damage, the industry ramped it up. Last year, airlines burned more than a billion liters of fossil jet fuel per day for the first time ever. That record fossil fuel burn dumped 970 MtCO2 into our atmosphere – double the industry’s rate in 1990.

This year, the aviation industry expects airlines to burn much more – in excess of 400 billion litres. That will break another aviation record by emitting more than one billion tonnes of CO2 in a single year.

What will stop this industry’s climate damage from soaring ever higher?

Certainly not a global recession like the one in 2009. And not even a worldwide pandemic lockdown, like humanity went through in 2020. Both caused jet fuel burning to dip temporarily. But I’ve left these speedbumps off my chart because the long-term trend blew right past them, full throttle. This relentlessly rising CO2 trend is driven by the industry’s multi-decade push to maximize growth in flights – which requires burning ever more jet fuel at the lowest possible cost.

SAF to the rescue?

The aviation industry says the only viable way to lower their climate pollution is by switching to “sustainable aviation fuels” (SAF). And they have a plan to switch. Or more accurately, a series of plans. My next chart shows how it started, and how it’s going.

The industry’s “Plan A” rolled out back in 2007. They set a target of ten percent SAF use in ten years.

You can see what success would have looked like on this next chart. The SAF goal is shown by that blue triangle labeled “Plan A”. But also look at the dotted line below it. That’s the amount of fossil jet fuel burning under the plan. Even if successful, the CO2 from fossil jet fuel burning would have kept rising at the same rate it had been – increasing by another three billion litres each year.

“Plan A” failed spectacularly because airlines ended up buying trivial amounts of SAF – one hundredth of one percent of their fuel use in 2017. Meanwhile, airlines increased their fossil jet fuel purchases a thousand times more.

“Plan B” rolled out the next year. Industry trimmed its target to just two percent SAF, and not until 2025. That’s shown on the chart as well, but this time the goal -- shown by a blue SAF triangle -- is so tiny that it’s hard to see. And notice in particular the dotted black line below it. This shows that Plan B allows the CO2 from fossil jet fuel burning to surge twice as fast as under Plan A.

In the end, airlines haven’t even been able to clear Plan B's low bar. The industry now forecasts SAF purchases this year will remain well below one percent of jet fuel purchases.

Actual SAF purchases are insignificant at the scale of these charts. While that is a problem, it is important to remember that climate progress isn’t measured by SAF use. It’s measured by how much CO2 is being added to the atmosphere.

As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states clearly: ""every tonne of CO₂ emissions adds to global warming.""

And these charts show that airlines now emit one and a half times as much CO2 each year as they did back in 2007 -- at the start of their SAF “Plan A”. That's rocketing away from climate safety.

Why are airlines bingeing on fossil fuels, instead of SAF?

Because bingeing on climate-damaging fuel is cheaper and no one is stopping them. In fact, most governments are greenlighting it through fossil fuel subsidies and exemptions.

Canada’s Action Plan

For a down home example of how governments are green lighting fossil jet fuel burning, let’s look at Canada’s Aviation Climate Action Plan 2022-2030.

I’ll start by pointing out four ways that Canada’s Aviation Plan keeps fossil jet fuel both cheap and dirty.

Pollution pricing. Canada’s Aviation Plan exempts most jet fuel from our national climate pollution fee (aka carbon tax). Earthbound travelers are charged $80 to emit each tonne of CO2 while jet-setters are allowed to pollute for free.

Carbon intensity. Canada’s Aviation Plan exempts all jet fuel from federal Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR). These regulations require other fuels to reduce their life-cycle carbon intensity over time. But Canada allows airlines to buy jet fuel that keeps getting dirtier over time. In fact, jet fuel in Canada is among the most carbon intensive in the world.

Most warming is ignored. Canada’s Aviation Plan acknowledges the science showing that two-thirds of the global warming to date that is caused by jet fuel comes from non-CO2 emissions.

These emissions include nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter and water vapor. The biggest warming impact from these comes when they combine to form contrails and cirrus clouds.

Canada’s policies, however, ignore 90 per cent of this warming. Only the CO2 emitted by domestic flights gets listed on Canada’s books or covered by Canada’s climate targets. That’s just ten percent of the total as shown on my chart above.

No limits on CO2. Canada’s Aviation Plan places no limit, or “cap”, on fossil jet fuel burning nor on the amount of CO2 the aviation industry can emit.

Cheap, dirty and unlimited. It’s hard for me to imagine how a government could greenlight fossil jet fuel burning more than this. Well … unless they were actively subsidizing fossil fuel production as well.

What about the solution – switching to SAF?

No SAF mandates. Canada’s Aviation Plan says SAF is “the only feasible alternative to using fossil-based jet fuel … the key pathway to achieving meaningful emissions reductions by 2050.” Clearly, getting SAF sales off the ground is important. To nudge that along, some nations now mandate minimum amounts of SAF. Canada does not. Instead, Canada’s Aviation Plan proposes an “aspirational goal” of 10 percent SAF by 2030.

No SAF production. Canada’s Aviation Plan says there is no meaningful amount of SAF produced in our nation because SAF currently costs airlines two to five times what they pay for fossil jet fuel. Airlines can buy all the cheaper fossil jet fuel they want. So they aren’t racing to pay more: “Canadian air carriers will signal SAF demand with offtake agreements, as appropriate and financially sound.”

The failure to build SAF refineries isn’t just a Canadian problem. A recent report, 2025 Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Report, says globally “the next 2-3 years will be crucial for scaling up SAF production, with approximately €1 trillion (CDN$1.5 trillion) in capital expenditure needed to establish 450-950 new production sites by 2030.” However, “the reluctance of infrastructure investors to commit to SAF projects stems from uncertainty regarding the business case.” That’s biz-speak for nobody in their right mind will spend a trillion dollars to make a product they can’t sell.

If SAF is the only solution, then someone needs to pay for it.

Paying for SAF with higher ticket prices.

Can jet travelers afford to pay for SAF?

Remember “Plan A” above that aimed for ten percent SAF? Or Canada’s current goal of ten percent SAF by 2030? Well, the World Economic Forum (WEF) calculated what this would cost jet travelers, and it turns out to be not very much: “a SAF premium of 2-3x and a blend of 10% SAF would see the price of a ticket increase by ~3-6%.”

My next chart illustrates this scenario.

The bar on the left of the chart shows the baseline ticket price for a typical flight today that burns fossil jet fuel only.

The non-fuel component of ticket pricing is shown by gold coins, while the cost of fossil jet fuel is shown by the silver coins.

Currently, fossil jet fuel accounts for between one sixth and one third of ticket prices. The WEF scenario assumes 30 percent, which is what I use on my chart.

The blue coins show the cost to replace ten percent of jet fuel with SAF. For example, in the middle scenario, SAF costs three times (3x) as much as fossil jet fuel. That would increase ticket prices by around six percent.

That's apparently too high a price to pay.

What do you think?

The richest one percent.

Studies show that the richest one percent of humanity is responsible for half the world’s aviation emissions. Recently, these wealthy jet-setters have been opening their wallets to fund a surge in expensive flight luxuries, from premium class seating, to private jets and ultra-exclusive airport clubs.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) recommends adding a CO2 tax to jet fuel is ""critical to more equitably reflect the climate impacts of air travel"". And argues: ""since frequent flyers likely account for half of all aviation emissions, progressive tax rates that increase with flight frequency, as well as higher taxes on premium class tickets, could discourage excessive flying or raise funding for investments in SAF production.""

Can the frequent fliers afford it? To illustrate how much wealthy flyers are spending on pure luxury jet fuel today, take a look at my next chart. It shows the fuel costs for seats in premium class.

According to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), the average premium class seat requires around four times more jet fuel than flying economy.

That luxury requires paying four times more for fuel – while also emitting four times more CO2.

First-class luxury can burn nine times more jet fuel – and emit nine times more CO2. That can rise to 14 times more per person for the ultra-luxury of a high-end suite.

By offering these luxury classes, airlines are actively encouraging their customers to burn many times more fossil jet fuel and emit many times more CO2. In fact, the more you end up burning and emitting the more royally they treat you. Pollute enough and you might be handed a glass of champagne as a thank-you.

But there is one luxury I’ve never seen airlines offer – flying without dumping fossil fuel CO2 in your wake. Airlines could easily do this by offering customers SAF certificates that cover 100 percent of that person's fuel. And it would likely cost passengers a lot less than it does to stretch their legs in premium class.

I would certainly pay for fossil-free luxury.

Then again, I’ve been boycotting fossil-fueled jet travel for two decades now. And, sadly, my expectations of this industry keep falling lower as its emissions keep soaring higher. So, I have net-zero faith that airlines will enable climate-safe solutions for their customers in time -- unless they are forced to.

In the meantime, the climate damage from the commercial airline industry will keep taking off...",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2019/12/18/flightradar24.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 06:50:19.140706

Sustainable Aviation Survey

The World Economic Forum conducts a survey of 30 aviation industry executives worldwide to understand their attitudes towards sustainable aviation development. More than two-thirds of the respondents believe that decarbonization in the aviation industry will continue, with the development of sustainable aviation fuel being the main driving factor. The global production of sustainable aviation fuel has doubled in the past two years and is expected to continue doubling this year. The European Union, the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions have developed roadmaps for the application of sustainable aviation fuel.

More than 70% of respondents are optimistic about the decarbonization targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organization for 2030. The COP29 conference held many activities related to the aviation industry, clarifying the rules for the application of carbon credits in the aviation industry to avoid double counting in Nationally Determined Contributions. Some respondents believe that jurisdictions can add mid-term targets on top of the 2030 and 2050 goals to measure carbon reduction effectiveness.

Sustainable Risks in Aviation Industry

Respondents rank the risks facing decarbonization in the aviation industry and identify the following three types of sustainable risks:

Technical risk

Availability and cost of SAF: Ranks first. The price and availability of fuel are the most concerning factors for respondents, and since 2022, the number of fuel related agreements has been decreasing. Due to limited current fuel production technology, although future production continues to increase, fuel costs will put pressure on operations in the short term.

Availability and cost of green electricity, hydrogen and infrastructure: Ranks sixth. Green hydrogen energy is an important factor in decarbonizing aviation, a raw material for sustainable aviation fuel, and may provide power for infrastructure. The respondents believe that the uncertainty of regulatory policies may lead to lower-than-expected levels of hydrogen production, and the cost-effectiveness of deploying hydrogen energy still needs to be considered.

Availability of hydrogen and battery-electric aircraft: Ranks seventh. Zero carbon aircraft powered by hydrogen energy are currently under development, but many aircraft manufacturers have encountered difficulties in funding preparation and technological research, which has slowed down the pace of this research.

Availability of carbon dioxide removals and out-of-sector carbon offsets: Ranks tenth. Carbon removal and carbon offset technologies compete with sustainable aviation fuels, and the cost of dealing with additional carbon emissions is usually higher than the cost of reducing carbon emissions at the source.

Policy risk

Alignment of SAF policy across regions and longevity of subsidies: Ranks second. Multiple jurisdictions around the world have developed sustainable aviation fuel policies, but there are differences in their standards and goals. Insufficient supply of raw materials in the short term may result in some jurisdictions being unable to achieve their goals.

Implementation of CORSIA and Effectiveness of carbon pricing and emissions trading schemes: Ranks third and fifth. 129 jurisdictions have joined the carbon offset plan, but airlines have limited ability to purchase carbon credits and are also required to comply with the carbon offset plan and local carbon emission trading system, which may slow down the implementation of the plan.

Geographical concentration of resources: Ranks eighth. The production of sustainable aviation fuel is highly dependent on biological raw materials, and developed economies typically import raw materials from developing economies. These trade activities may be influenced by factors such as policies and markets.

Sustainable risk

Traceability of sustainability criteria for SAF feedstocks: Ranks fourth. The raw material audit for sustainable aviation fuel will continue to strengthen, and the cost of using biological raw materials will increase, leading to an increase in fuel costs.

Greenwashing and consumer skepticism: Ranks ninth. Some jurisdictions believe that the use and promotion of sustainable aviation fuels may lead to greenwashing.

While enthusiasm for hydrogen’s potential in decarbonisation remains high, the industry faces significant challenges in scaling up and achieving economic viability.

Industry leaders and experts are reassessing expectations and focusing on execution as the market shifts from hype to reality.

What is hydrogen’s role in decarbonisation?

The hydrogen sector is transitioning from a period of peak optimism to a more pragmatic phase.

In 2024, new project announcements declined by more than 80% globally, with producers scaling back earlier commitments.

Looking ahead however, the focus is expected to shift towards execution and tangible progress on existing projects and investments.

“Decarbonising refinery fuel is essential and low-carbon hydrogen provides a clear pathway,” Eugenia Belloni Pocorob, Lead H2 and CC(U)S for the Netherlands at bp, said at StocExpo 2025.

“We are seeing airline manufacturers investigating pure hydrogen solutions beyond sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” he says.

“It may seem far-fetched now, but technological advances happen rapidly.”

Despite the benefits it can bring, the high cost of hydrogen projects, as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is a weighty challenge.

“The scale of capital required for CCS projects is enormous,” Amit says.

“We have already seen major industry players reconsider their green commitments. The question is: where will the funding come from, and who will drive the transition?”

Traditional investors are also hesitant to engage in projects with long payback periods, creating a need for investors willing to take a long-term view.

Eugenia says: “The appetite for quick returns does not align with the realities of hydrogen investment. We need a different type of investor — one willing to take a long-term view.”

On top of this, intervention from governments has played a decisive role in advancing early-stage projects.

In the UK, government-backed competition frameworks have helped de-risk investments by aligning the entire value chain.

“By aligning the entire value chain, these initiatives have made projects more viable,” shares Matt Wilson, Head of New Energy Markets at Navigator Terminals.

“We need to wait out the Trump presidency to gain clarity on the long-term outlook,” he says.

“Over the next four years, we are likely to see renewed trade conflicts — not just with China, but across the board.

“The US is moving towards decoupling from global markets, which will have profound implications for European industry.”

Rising defence spending in Europe could also reshape energy transition priorities.

Amit continues: “If governments allocate 3% or more of GDP to defence, other sectors will inevitably face budgetary constraints.”

Market adjustments and cautious optimism

Despite challenges, there's cautious optimism in the industry.

While the number of hydrogen projects has declined, awareness and momentum have grown, Eugenia points out.

“We may have gone from 30 projects to fewer than five, but the fact that some are now moving into construction is significant,” she says.

“The energy transition is not just theoretical — we are starting to see real implementation.”

Matt adds: “The projects we have in place are gaining traction. The policy framework is set, and the risk profile has improved.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/05a8f5757f43b72be62524f8b54cdaa0:4b36d662d01525769cdc0790d6a48110/gettyimages-2152072696.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 06:50:22.712516

As global pressure mounts to cut emissions, Asia is ramping up its SAF production—often outpacing local demand. With new projects coming online and exports on the horizon, this surplus could ultimately drive down prices, offering much-needed relief to airlines struggling with the high costs of greener fuel.

Rising Production: A Surplus on the Horizon

Expanding Capacity

Recent forecasts from Argus Consulting suggest that the Asia-Pacific region's SAF production capacity is set to hit 3.5 million metric tons per year by the end of 2025—a significant jump from 1.24 million tons in 2024. This dramatic expansion is fueled by at least five projects outside China that are scheduled to start production this year, targeting markets both regionally and in Europe.

A Production Boom Meets Tepid Demand

While production is surging, regional demand remains relatively weak. Unlike Europe—with its stringent mandate requiring 2% SAF for flights departing from EU and UK airports—Asia’s policy-driven demand is still in its infancy. In many Asian markets, mandated use of SAF will not come into effect until later this decade, allowing production capacity to build up faster than domestic consumption.

Export Opportunities and Price Implications

Fueling the Global Market

The current scenario could turn into a golden opportunity for airlines worldwide. As Asia's SAF production outpaces local demand, surplus fuel is expected to be exported, particularly to markets with higher mandated usage. Increased competition and higher volumes could potentially lower prices—a welcome change for airlines that have long decried SAF's cost and accessibility.

Price Pressure and Profitability Concerns

Despite the promise of lower prices, the situation isn’t entirely rosy. Industry insiders warn that if prices drop below production costs, some planned SAF projects might face financial difficulties. “Asian airlines are still more focused on ramping up flights, and SAF is not a top priority given it is still costlier than jet fuel,” noted Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.

Policy Mandates and Market Dynamics

A Patchwork of Regulations

In Asia, policy guidance on SAF is far from uniform. For instance, while Singapore and Thailand are set to enforce a 1% SAF mandate by 2026—potentially lifting demand to about 14% of production capacity—the rest of the region lags behind. South Korea will start its 1% mandate in 2027, and Japan aims for a 10% target by 2030. Meanwhile, China’s SAF projects have seen delays due to low consumption and the absence of clear regulatory directives.

The Tug-of-War Between Sustainability and Profit

Globally, aviation accounted for 2.5% of carbon emissions in 2023, and SAF (derived from waste oil and biomass) holds promise for a greener future. However, with only 0.3% of global jet fuel production coming from SAF last year—and global output reaching just 1 million tons against forecasts of 1.5 million—it's clear that the industry is still struggling to balance sustainability with economic viability.

Looking Ahead: Greener Skies or a Price Plunge?

Balancing Act for the Industry

Asia’s SAF journey is at a crossroads. On one side lies the potential for a greener aviation future, with expanded production capacity and competitive export opportunities. On the other, a mismatch between production and domestic demand—and the risk of prices falling below profitable levels—could stall some projects. With airlines like Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific already integrating SAF into their operations and others like Air New Zealand recalibrating their targets, the coming years will be pivotal in shaping the industry's trajectory.

Engage and Share Your Thoughts

The unfolding story of Asia’s SAF boom invites questions and sparks debate. Will the surplus production drive a global shift toward greener skies, or will economic pressures force a recalibration of ambitions? Share your thoughts and join the conversation as we track this dynamic evolution in sustainable aviation fuel.

With production capacity set to soar and policy mandates gradually coming into play, Asia’s SAF market is one to watch—where soaring ambitions meet the realities of economic and regulatory challenges, all under the quest for a greener future.

With Inputs from Reuters

In an era marked by shifting economic winds and mounting uncertainty, U.S. airlines are dramatically revising their forecasts and strategies. Recent announcements—from Delta to United, American to Southwest—highlight a notable retreat in earnings estimates as the industry braces for a challenging journey ahead.

Economic Headwinds and Corporate Caution

Economic indicators have recently taken a hit. With consumer and business confidence weakened by the fallout from tariffs and rising prices, airlines are preparing for the worst. The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s closely watched GDPNow tracker even suggests that the U.S. economy could shrink in the first quarter. This broader economic slowdown has led companies to cut back on corporate travel, while consumers are tightening their belts—factors that directly impact travel spending.

""Economic uncertainty is a big deal,"" remarked American Airlines CEO Robert Isom during a recent JPMorgan industry conference.

Strategic Shifts in an Uncertain Market

Airlines are not standing still. Each carrier is taking proactive measures to navigate these choppy skies:

Capacity Reduction: To avoid a wave of discounting and preserve margins, carriers plan to reduce capacity after the summer travel peak. For instance, American Airlines is trimming its presence in the lucrative Washington market due to a decline in government-related bookings.

Booking Strategy Overhaul: Delta has revamped its booking approach to better manage the softer domestic demand, while United Airlines is reducing capacity on government and transborder routes, even canceling overnight flights.

Cost-Cutting Measures: United is accelerating the retirement of 21 aircraft to save on maintenance costs—an aggressive move to streamline operations in a tough market.

A Contrast to Recent Optimism

Just a month ago, limited capacity and robust consumer demand had sparked talk of a multi-year profit boom. Today, the narrative has reversed. The ripple effects of diminished government spending and the cautious approach by corporate and leisure travelers have forced carriers like Southwest and United to downgrade their first-quarter revenue forecasts, citing challenges from reduced government travel to the lingering effects of regional disruptions like the California wildfires.

Navigating Through Stormy Skies

While premium and long-haul international travel still show resilience—and falling fuel prices offer some relief—the domestic market continues to falter. Recent air crashes and unpredictable weather events have further dented travel demand, intensifying the sense of urgency among industry leaders.

""We're going to accelerate [our focus on comparative advantage] as we go through what looks like a tougher economic time ahead,"" stated United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.

Looking Ahead: Can Innovation Outpace the Downturn?

The coming months will be crucial. As airlines adjust their strategies, investors and analysts are closely watching whether these measures will safeguard profitability amid headwinds. Will strategic capacity cuts and a refined focus on high-value travel segments be enough to weather this economic storm? Or are we on the brink of a broader industry transformation?

In these uncertain times, one thing is clear: the U.S. airline industry is reconfiguring its flight path. With dynamic changes in strategy and operations, the sector is determined to navigate through the turbulence—and perhaps, emerge more resilient on the other side.

What do you think? Is this the beginning of a new era for air travel, or just a temporary bout of turbulence?

SpiceJet, one of India’s longstanding budget carriers with 19 years in the skies, is now facing a storm of legal and financial challenges. The airline finds itself at the center of multiple insolvency petitions, threatening to ground its ambitions amid mounting debts and disputes with creditors.

A Fresh Wave of Insolvency Petitions

The Legal Showdown Begins

Three Ireland-based aircraft lessors—NGF Alpha, NGF Genesis, and NGF Charlie—have stepped into the legal arena by filing insolvency pleas under Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). These lessors claim dues totaling USD 12.68 million (approximately Rs 110 crore). The filings, now slated for a hearing on April 7, 2025, are a stark indicator of the mounting pressures on SpiceJet.

A Former Pilot Joins the Fray

Adding to the complexity, a former pilot has also filed an insolvency plea. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has taken notice and scheduled a separate hearing for this petition on April 15, 2025. The tribunal is currently examining whether the pilot’s claim might be barred by Section 10A of the IBC, a clause that restricts certain insolvency applications for defaults arising on or after March 25, 2020.

The Claims and Controversies

Allegations from the Lessors

The lessors allege that SpiceJet defaulted on payments related to the lease of five Boeing 737 aircraft. They have even raised serious claims involving the alleged theft of aircraft parts, including engines that were reportedly used in other planes. These allegations have only deepened the legal dispute, putting SpiceJet’s operational integrity under scrutiny.

Understanding Section 10A

Section 10A was introduced as a special provision to help companies navigate the post-lockdown economic revival. It prevents the initiation of a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) for defaults incurred after March 25, 2020, for a period of one year. The ongoing discussions at the NCLT regarding the applicability of this section add another layer of complexity to SpiceJet’s predicament.

The Broader Implications for SpiceJet

A History of Legal Challenges

This is not the first time SpiceJet has found itself embroiled in legal disputes. The airline is already entangled in multiple insolvency cases involving other creditors such as vendors and additional lessors like Willis Lease, Aircastle Ireland Ltd, Wilmington, and Celestial Aviation. Despite these challenges, no final orders have been passed yet, leaving the airline in a state of limbo.

Financial Strains and the Road Ahead

The wave of insolvency petitions comes at a time when SpiceJet is already grappling with significant financial difficulties. With creditors turning to legal avenues to recover dues, the airline must navigate through these choppy waters. Settlement talks are reportedly underway, offering a glimmer of hope that a resolution might be on the horizon. However, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether SpiceJet can recalibrate its strategy and emerge stronger, or if the legal challenges will ground its journey permanently.

Conclusion: Turbulence or a Temporary Dip?

As SpiceJet faces an unprecedented legal storm, industry watchers and passengers alike are left wondering about the airline’s future. Will the carrier manage to resolve these disputes and regain its financial footing, or are these insolvency petitions the harbinger of a more troubled future? The upcoming NCLT hearings and ongoing settlement discussions will be critical in charting the next chapter in SpiceJet’s long flight history. One thing is certain—the coming weeks promise drama, legal intrigue, and high-stakes negotiations in the world of aviation finance.

SpiceJet’s story is a vivid reminder of how even long-established carriers are not immune to the complexities of modern financial and legal challenges. The outcome of these proceedings will not only impact the airline but could also set important precedents in the interpretation of insolvency laws in the aviation sector.",https://www.100knots.com/airlines_dashboard/uploads/blog/1742276999.webp,N,,2025-03-18 08:51:54.859767
