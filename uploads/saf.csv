Climate Change Top 5 Business Risk to Air Transport Gates’ warning comes as aviation faces growing pressure, with SAF projects collapsing and airlines scaling back near-term climate goals amid European greenwashing crackdowns.
Because aviation is global, emissions policy has traditionally been coordinated by ICAO, the UN’s aviation body.
“Climate change is and will continue to disrupt lives, livelihoods, and productivity around the globe.
IATA echoed these concerns in its warnings about climate change.","Bill Gates said that aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, warning that it will require urgent innovation and stronger government policies to drive down emissions.

“The world has made meaningful progress in the last decade, cutting projected emissions by more than 40%,” Gates wrote in his annual note for 2026. “But we still have a lot of innovation and scaling up to do in tough areas like industrial emissions and aviation.”

Aviation is especially hard to decarbonize due to long aircraft lifespans and the high cost of sustainable aviation fuel, which is three to five times that of jet fuel. And SAF still makes up just 0.7% of global supply.

Gates warned that unchecked climate change will cause suffering on par with poverty and disease, especially for the world’s poorest, and stressed the need to adapt to its impacts alongside cutting emissions.

“Government policies in rich countries are still critical because unless innovations reach scale, the costs won’t come down and we won’t achieve the impact we need,” he said.

Climate Change Top 5 Business Risk to Air Transport

Gates’ warning comes as aviation faces growing pressure, with SAF projects collapsing and airlines scaling back near-term climate goals amid European greenwashing crackdowns.

A new International Air Transport Association report lists climate change at the top of the list of risks to the industry that have both a high negative impact and a high likelihood of happening. IATA says it is major threat to airline profit margins this year from both disruptions caused by extreme weather and government regulations.

Aviation faces a patchwork of climate taxes and policies around the world. Because aviation is global, emissions policy has traditionally been coordinated by ICAO, the UN’s aviation body.

“In global civil aviation we can see an increase in national and regional policy initiatives that depart from ICAO’s 80 years of global harmonization,” IATA said. “Different frameworks now compete to determine how to address CO₂ emissions from air transport.

IATA said such policies:

Do little to cut emissions but make air travel more expensive

Undermine global climate coordination, slowing progress

Meanwhile, IATA said, climate change continues to impact businesses and livelihoods.

“Climate change is and will continue to disrupt lives, livelihoods, and productivity around the globe. Extreme weather, commodity price swings, supply chain stresses, can affect agriculture, infrastructure, global trade, and investment flows.”

It said unstable environments and economies can slow progress and harm the growth of aviation. The report painted a broader picture of climate disruption, warning that extreme weather, price volatility, and supply chain stress could affect aircraft production and aviation growth.

Migration is a Growing Concern

IATA also warned that climate-related migration could disrupt aviation and global systems.

Various reports link extreme weather and climate shifts to gradually destabilizing economies and societies.

Take for instance sea-level rise: By 2100, up to 410 million people may be living in areas less than 2 meters above sea level and at risk from sea level rises.

IATA echoed these concerns in its warnings about climate change.

“The world has turned more hostile toward immigration,” the report stated. “The total number of displaced persons reached 123.2 million in 2024 — nearly double the figure a decade ago. Both welcoming and rejecting migrants will strain borders and support systems.”

Airports Council International World has appointed Jost Lammers, Chief Executive Officer of Munich Airport (MUC), as Chair of the ACI World Governing Board for the 2026 to 2027 term, succeeding Candace McGraw, retired CEO of Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport. McGraw concludes her tenure as ACI World’s first woman Chair, during which she guided the organisation through a period of strong global advocacy and strategic progress.

The ACI World Governing Board comprises 28 airport chief executives nominated by ACI’s five regions and provides strategic direction on airport policy, operational priorities, sustainability and innovation on behalf of airports worldwide.

Lammers brings more than 25 years of global aviation and airport leadership experience to the role. He has been a member of the ACI World Governing Board since 2019, served as Vice Chair from 2024 to 2025, and previously sat on the Board of ACI EUROPE from 2017 to 2023. Elected President of ACI EUROPE in 2019, he led the region through the COVID-19 crisis, strengthening cooperation among European airports and supporting sector recovery.

Since January 2020, Lammers has served as CEO of Munich Airport, one of Europe’s leading international hubs recognised for service quality, innovation and sustainable airport development. Before joining Munich Airport, he was CEO of Budapest Liszt Ferenc Airport from 2008, where he oversaw major modernisation and growth programmes.

Lammers also served for two years as President of the German Aviation Association, representing airlines, airports, air traffic control, ground handling service providers and retail companies. He began his aviation career in 1998 at HOCHTIEF AirPort GmbH, working on projects in Düsseldorf and Athens, including the commissioning and opening of Athens International Airport. He studied business administration and economics in Bayreuth, Witten Herdecke and San Diego.

ACI World Director General Justin Erbacci said: “We are proud to welcome Jost Lammers as Chair of the ACI World Governing Board. His global experience, proven leadership, and deep understanding of airport operations and policy come at a pivotal moment for our industry. As airports accelerate innovation, strengthen operational resilience, and advance sustainability, Jost’s ability to build consensus and drive strategic progress will be instrumental.

“I would also like to extend our sincere appreciation to Candace McGraw for her exceptional leadership as ACI World’s first woman Chair. Her commitment to sustainability, advocacy, and workforce transformation has helped position airports for long-term success.”

Munich Airport CEO Jost Lammers said: “It is an honour for me to serve as the Chair of the ACI World Governing Board. My dedication is focused on strengthening ACI’s leadership role on the global stage. By uniting strong advocacy, effective governance, and collaboration with global partners, we can ensure airports evolve as innovative, sustainable, and people focused organisations, enhancing their role as vital hubs of mobility and economic growth.”",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/0047_Jost_Lammers-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:57:17.783528

Leaders from the U.S. House and Senate Agriculture Committees remain committed to finishing work on the farm bill and addressing agricultural labor, among other issues, this session of Congress.

House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson (R-PA) and Ranking Member Angie Craig (D-MN), along with Senate Ag Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Ranking Member Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), addressed farmers and ranchers from across the nation at the American Farm Bureau Federation’s (AFBF) Annual Convention Sunday in Anaheim, Calif.

“We were able to, in the Big Bill (HR 1), create a situation where we were able to help with the risk management tools that we all desperately needed to update and also several other things that are so important to agriculture to the tune of about $68 billion,” Boozman said. “We’ve gotten a majority of the farm bill passed. Now, we need to come back and finish that up. I’d like to work and get that done very shortly.”

Boozman said he’d like to address loan limits when it comes to farm bill 2.0, or the “Skinny Farm Bill.”

“These things don’t cost a lot of money. We got most of the cost drivers done, but now we’ve got to get things that help rural America—quality of life issues—and again, loan limits, where they work now with the inflationary period that we’ve had,” he said.

Klobuchar also wants loan limits addressed in the farm bill. She and Sen. John Hoeven have a bill Klobuchar said could be included in some sort of package that calls for improvements.

Thompson said although much of the farm bill was addressed through HR 1, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, there’s more work that needs to be done.

“We were able to make a significant investment, historic investment in agriculture, with what we did on trade and animal health and bringing down the cost of crop insurance and safety net, but there’s more left to be done,” Thompson said. “That 20% of investment that we need to do that’s left, it’s about 80% of the policies, and it’s so important.”

As for funding increased loan levels in farm bill 2.0, Thompson seemed confident they could find the funding to do so.

“I get my exercise turning rocks over in Washington within the agriculture space, and I’m pretty confident that we’re going to be able to identify that,” Thompson said. “That’ll be a part of what we release here.”

The chairman said they plan to get a farm bill 2.0 text out in plenty of time before the markup so members can look at it and really digest it.

“Pay-fors will be a part of that,” Thompson said. “Now, how much we find, how much we have, we’ll determine how far we can go with some of the things that I would like to do.”

Craig told the crowd she’d like to make sure the farm credit and rural development areas of the farm bill are taken care of, as well.

“I do hope that we can come to a bipartisan consensus on those two things,” Craig said.

In addition to finishing up the farm bill, Boozman said his priorities include holding hearings on what can be done to make agriculture more economically sustainable.

“Congress is stepping in and being helpful. I think they’re going to continue to do that, but we can’t depend on it,” Boozman said. “We’ve got to get ourselves in a situation where agriculture is sustainable. I’d like to have a couple hearings, bringing in the experts, bringing in you, the people that work at this all day, every day, telling us what you need, telling us the tools you need in the toolbox, whether it’s trade, figuring out a way to better use the products that we have here in our country, increasing domestic demand, value added products, the list goes on and on.”

Other priorities mentioned were year-round E-15 and biofuels and ag labor.

“Some reform on ag labor—I think we all know how hard this has been hitting our farmers. We’ve had a number of bipartisan ag immigration bills. I know that’s not an easy word to say right now in our country, but we know there are a lot of ways we could try to make sure that we have a stable workforce when it comes to agriculture, as well as other areas,” Klobuchar said. “That’s something, it feels far away, but I think it’s such a need right now. There’s possibility we could move on that.”

Klobuchar said reversing tariffs “would also be about the best thing we could do.”

“Then, we’re going to have to figure out how we adjust for that and make some of these payments and the like. I think that would be good long term. If that doesn’t happen, I hope the administration will back down on some of them for the sake of input costs and for the sake of the markets overseas and the like, or we can pass something in Congress,” she said.

Increasing markets for agricultural goods was also named a priority.

“We need more export markets in this country. We need more domestic markets in this nation,” Craig said. “I’m going to be looking for year-round E15, higher blends of ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.”

The ranking member also named the cost of healthcare as one of her priorities.

“We have to be thinking about that. It’s not in our jurisdiction, but we haven’t brought up the cost of healthcare in this country. And I just want to say with 27% of farmers and ranchers across this country on some sort of Affordable Care Act plan today, the cost of healthcare is out of control, and we’ve got to figure out how we deal with it in this country,” Craig said.

Progress rarely follows a straight line, yet the voluntary carbon market (VCM) appears to be the exception heading into 2026. External pressures this past year ranged from the explosion in energy demand as the AI race reached full steam, to shifts in the policy and economic landscapes, creating new headwinds for broadscale decarbonisation efforts. Despite this, the VCM’s trajectory remained resolute, setting the stage for a robust and growing year ahead.

The VCM entered 2025 with momentum and closed out the year having reshaped expectations for what’s possible in engineered carbon removal. The past twelve months saw a surge in large-scale deals, broader participation from corporate buyers, and the emergence of new removal pathways, from biochar to biomass sequestration. Interest in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) continued to solidify, and for the first time, the market demonstrated the diversity of durable carbon removal solutions needed to credibly deliver net zero commitments at scale.

This rising confidence was reinforced at COP30, where carbon trading took centre stage. Negotiators made meaningful progress toward establishing the global structures required for transparent, interoperable carbon markets. Integrity and permanence of carbon removals were a central theme. The global conversation has clearly shifted from whether carbon markets should play a role in climate action to how they must evolve to ensure high-quality, durable climate impact.

Against this backdrop, 2026 is poised to be a year of pragmatism with the VCM taking on greater significance in decarbonisation pathways. Companies facing intensifying customer expectations, supply-chain pressures, and near-term climate targets are expanding their decarbonisation toolkits. Carbon credits, especially engineered removals, are no longer viewed as supplemental. They are becoming strategic assets that offer optionality, resilience, and credibility in an increasingly complex operating environment.

The End of Puritanism in Climate Solutions

For much of the last decade, many companies bet heavily on a narrow set of decarbonisation levers: electrification, renewable procurement, and incremental efficiency gains. These remain essential investments, but economic and political shifts have exposed their limitations.

Permitting delays, supply-chain constraints, fluctuating power markets, and rising capital costs are complicating corporate decarbonisation timelines. In parallel, key sectors – particularly those with hard-to-abate processes – are discovering that technology pathways alone struggle to keep pace with near-term climate commitments.

The result: the era of “solutions puritanism” is fading. Companies are embracing hybrid-realistic strategies, where carbon credits complement on-site and supply-chain actions rather than replace them. This shift is not ideological, it is pragmatic. It reflects the recognition that avoidance-only pathways cannot reliably deliver emissions reductions at the speed and scale required. It equally doesn’t deter from the ambition to ultimately decarbonise where possible.

The Rise of the Portfolio Approach to Unlock Flexibility and Value

The same political and economic shifts driving organisations away from puritan solutions also incentivise them to diversify their holdings to incorporate flexibility and mitigate risk. Viewed as a portfolio of solutions, biomass, biochar, biomass with carbon removal and storage, BECCS, and other biogenic technologies can work as an effective hedge for sophisticated purchasers and provide a simple entry point for new buyers.

As the VCM matures, the diversity of credit types spanning engineered removals, nature-based solutions, biomass pathways, and more gives buyers unprecedented flexibility. In 2026, the most sophisticated corporate climate strategies will treat carbon credits as a portfolio, not a singular asset.

A portfolio-based approach allows companies to balance cost and permanence, mitigate supply and policy risks, and support long-term climate planning. Durable removals help meet future compliance and disclosure expectations, while scalable solutions enable near-term progress. As shown in the figure above, BECCS, enhanced rock weathering, mineralisation, biomass geological sequestration, and alkalinity enhancement all offer long-term, lower cost options for 2026 and beyond.

From Hard to Abate to Time to Abate

Some sectors illustrate the necessity of a diversified decarbonisation strategy more clearly than others. Steel and aviation, for example, cannot decarbonise solely through electrification or renewables in the near term. These industries face structural realities that make rapid transformation difficult – and in some cases, physically impossible – with existing technology.

Aviation is confronting overwhelming demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), paired with a staggering global supply gap. Similarly, green steel technologies are not yet commercially scalable. While innovation continues, the timelines do not align neatly with corporate emissions reductions schedules.

In the interim, alternative fuels, such as biomass-derived feedstocks for SAF or green hydrogen, offer meaningful reductions – but these solutions alone will not bring emissions down to the levels required for science-aligned pathways.

This is where carbon credits are expected to increasingly play a catalytic role. By pairing operational emissions improvements with high-quality removals or avoidance credits, hard-to-abate industries can chart credible decarbonisation trajectories. The combination of alternative fuels and carbon credits enables flexibility, protects competitiveness, and demonstrates good-faith progress toward net-zero commitments.

2026: The Year for Pragmatism

As 2026 begins, companies should take a step back and reevaluate their sustainability roadmaps with an eye toward realism and resilience. The question is not whether to use high-integrity carbon credits, but how to integrate them strategically into broader climate plans.

Now is the time for organisations to educate themselves on the diverse options available, understand their risk and cost tolerance, and design portfolios that maximize impact while maintaining flexibility. A diversified carbon credit strategy does more than hedge against uncertainty – it positions companies to lead confidently in a market where expectations for climate integrity are rising.

The likelihood of continued political and economic risk points to strengthening these trends. The VCM has matured. The opportunities are expanding. And for companies that are serious about net zero, diversification isn’t just prudent—it is essential.

Flying, driving; the activities we rely on every day all come at a carbon cost. In some sectors, the shift to renewables is comparatively simple. But aviation and petrochemicals are trickier. They need high-density fuels and complex molecules; things an EV battery can’t provide.

Enter OXCCU. The University of Oxford spin-out is tackling “the urgent need to find alternatives that maintain our standard of living without relying on fossil fuels”, by using world-leading technology to make waste carbon usable.

In development since 2010, the researchers filed their first patent in 2020, after the team developed a breakthrough single-step process that combines captured CO₂ with green hydrogen to create jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons.

As the founders explain, “most sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) approaches typically rely on land-based resources such as vegetable oil. But these rely on crops and are limited due to land use.” Another issue? Many produce “significant amounts of alcohols as a byproduct.”

Most sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) approaches typically rely on land-based resources such as vegetable oil. But these rely on crops and are limited due to land use.

In comparison, OXCCU’s process looks considerably more elegant. Its patented iron catalyst converts CO₂ and CO directly into liquid hydrocarbons in a single reaction, avoiding intermediate steps and minimising byproducts. This translates into lower capital costs, lower operating costs, and more competitive prices for SAF.

Oh, and of course, this method also reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil fuels; a figure which marked it as the clear winner for our 2026 Sustainability Award.

Proof of concept delivered, OXCCU formed as a fully-fledged company in 2021. Scaling the science has been a challenge, as with any climate tech. The team has learned that progress depends not just on the lab, but on the right partnerships and policy engagement.

The business now counts airlines – including British Airways’ owner IAG and United Airlines – venture firms, and two global energy companies among its supporters.

Still, the real proof is in the plant. OXCCU’s OX1 demonstration facility at London Oxford Airport has already logged 1,000 hours producing liquid fuel, with high conversion rates and excellent selectivity for SAF. Following this success, the spin-out closed £20.75m in Series B funding at the end of last year, to further scale its sustainable fuels and technologies.

Futuristic tech typically has a long timeline. OXCCU aims to produce 10,000 tonnes of SAF per year before 2030 (for context, a Boeing 787 transatlantic flight uses around 50 tonnes) while exploring applications beyond aviation in chemicals and plastics.

The mission goes without saying: enable fuel-guzzling industries to continue doing so, without the climate impact. From lab breakthroughs to commercial demonstrations, OXCCU is proving that waste carbon doesn’t have to be a problem; it can also be the solution.

And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.” Bridging the gap with book and claim Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).
“Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.” “SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates.
By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden.
“The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that.","And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn't really picked up massively. It's not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Bridging the gap with book and claim

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They're very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they're getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it's providing to our customers to be sure that they're not saying something which they can't confidently stand behind.”

Moving beyond early adoption

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don't wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

These streams would be utilized as a key feedstock to produce approximately 80,000 to 100,000 tons of eSAF annually.
For Outokumpu, the project would enable improved utilization of industrial side streams, creating new revenue opportunities while materially reducing climate impact.
Norsk e-Fuel will take the lead in developing the project, leveraging its experience in Power-to-Liquid technologies and its established network of industrial and financial partners.
He underscored that Outokumpu’s industrial platform, combined with Norsk e-Fuel’s project development expertise, creates a compelling basis for competitive eSAF production.","Outokumpu, a global front-runner in sustainable stainless steel, has entered into a strategic collaboration with Norsk e-Fuel, a Nordic specialist in Power-to-Liquid fuel projects, to explore the large-scale conversion of industrial carbon side streams into sustainable aviation fuel. The companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly advance plans for a CO-to-SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) production facility adjacent to Outokumpu’s stainless steel operations in Koivuluoto, Tornio, Finland.

As part of the agreement, Norsk e-Fuel will initiate a comprehensive feasibility study in 2026 to assess the technical, economic, and environmental viability of the project. Subject to favorable outcomes, the company expects to make a final investment decision around 2028, with commercial production targeted to begin in 2032. The initiative reflects a long-term commitment by both partners to accelerate industrial decarbonization while strengthening Europe’s clean energy value chains.

Under the proposed arrangement, Outokumpu would supply carbon monoxide (CO) side streams generated during its ferrochrome production process. These streams would be utilized as a key feedstock to produce approximately 80,000 to 100,000 tons of eSAF annually. This output would support the European Union’s emerging eSAF blending mandates and directly contribute to the decarbonization of aviation, a sector widely recognized as difficult to abate due to its reliance on energy-dense liquid fuels.

Once operational, the eSAF facility is expected to deliver significant environmental and economic benefits. For Outokumpu, the project would enable improved utilization of industrial side streams, creating new revenue opportunities while materially reducing climate impact. The company estimates that the initiative could cut its direct CO2 emissions by around 200,000 tons per year—equivalent to roughly 20% of Outokumpu’s global Scope 1 emissions. Beyond company-specific gains, the project would also support the EU’s clean energy transition goals and enhance regional energy security by expanding domestic production of sustainable fuels.

Norsk e-Fuel will take the lead in developing the project, leveraging its experience in Power-to-Liquid technologies and its established network of industrial and financial partners. The company will be responsible for engineering, securing financing, and engaging future customers for the produced eSAF. The total investment is currently estimated at approximately EUR 1.2–1.5 billion. In addition to climate benefits, the project is expected to generate substantial socio-economic value, including the creation of around 250 new jobs in the local Tornio region.

Commenting on the collaboration, Martti Sassi, President of Business Area Ferrochrome at Outokumpu, emphasized that decarbonization lies at the heart of the company’s strategy. He highlighted that the Kemi–Tornio industrial ecosystem provides a strong foundation for circular economy solutions that reduce emissions while delivering financial value. According to Sassi, the partnership demonstrates how Outokumpu’s sustainability ambitions extend beyond low-emission stainless steel and ferrochrome production to innovative uses of industrial side streams.

Lars Bjørn Larsen, Chief Commercial Officer at Norsk e-Fuel, noted that the partnership unites complementary strengths and a shared ambition to advance the energy transition in Finland and across Europe. He underscored that Outokumpu’s industrial platform, combined with Norsk e-Fuel’s project development expertise, creates a compelling basis for competitive eSAF production.

As a result, hybrids can complement electric vehicles in tackling air quality issues, rather than being seen as a competing technology.
Toyota, he said, is committed to introducing all clean technologies that can contribute meaningfully to sustainable mobility.
On the growth of electric vehicles, Gulati highlighted the need to bring down manufacturing costs.","Toyota Kirloskar Motor has called for a broad-based push across multiple clean vehicle technologies, arguing that India’s diverse geography, varied consumer needs, and energy security priorities make a single-solution approach impractical, reported PTI

The automaker believes that relying only on battery electric vehicles or hybrids will not be sufficient to cut emissions or reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. Instead, it advocates a mix of solutions including electric vehicles, hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, flex-fuel vehicles, and emerging options such as hydrogen-powered technologies.

As per the news report, speaking on the issue, Toyota Kirloskar Motor’s Country Head and Executive Vice-President, Vikram Gulati, said India’s wide-ranging conditions—from infrastructure readiness and energy availability to consumer acceptance—require a combination of technologies to meet national goals. He noted that such an approach would support energy independence, encourage local manufacturing, create jobs, strengthen the manufacturing sector’s contribution to the economy, and help curb pollution and carbon emissions.

Gulati pointed to government initiatives such as the ethanol blending programme and the national hydrogen mission as key efforts aimed at reducing fossil fuel usage and enhancing energy security. He added that alternative fuels like ethanol, compressed biogas (CBG), and hydrogen are particularly important for addressing local pollution challenges in different parts of the country.

Highlighting urban conditions, Gulati said hybrid vehicles are well suited for congested cities like Delhi, where average driving speeds are low. In stop-and-go traffic, the electric motor in a hybrid can operate efficiently, helping to reduce emissions. As a result, hybrids can complement electric vehicles in tackling air quality issues, rather than being seen as a competing technology.

Looking ahead, Gulati stressed that localisation will be central to India’s journey toward sustainable mobility. He said Toyota already has access to a full spectrum of clean technologies, including electric vehicles, strong hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and models running on alternative fuels. However, he noted that wider EV adoption will depend heavily on the expansion of charging infrastructure across the country.

Toyota, he said, is committed to introducing all clean technologies that can contribute meaningfully to sustainable mobility. The company aims to move away from petrol and diesel at the fastest possible pace, aligned with Toyota’s global environmental goals set in 2015, which include achieving carbon neutrality across vehicle life cycles.

At the same time, Gulati emphasised that customer preferences and local conditions must be considered when deploying green technologies. Regardless of the pathway chosen, he said, the common challenge remains reducing fossil fuel consumption and cutting carbon emissions.

On the growth of electric vehicles, Gulati highlighted the need to bring down manufacturing costs. He cautioned that the industry cannot rely indefinitely on subsidies or favourable tax regimes, stressing that long-term viability will come from achieving scale. According to him, that scale can only be reached by steadily expanding the range and availability of electrified vehicles in the market.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-07-at-14.37.43_9f7649fb-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 08:56:51.001856

This target aligns with InvestingPro analysis, which indicates the stock is currently undervalued. Trading at $39.08, DAR has shown strong momentum with a 7.66% return over the past year and sits near its 52-week high of $42.15.

The research firm expects Darling to report fourth-quarter EBITDA of $284 million, excluding LCM adjustments, which would represent a 6% increase compared to consensus estimates. Jefferies attributes the anticipated outperformance to strength in the company’s Feed (Proteins) segment and Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) operations. For perspective, Darling’s last twelve months EBITDA stands at $863.95 million, with analysts maintaining a bullish consensus recommendation of 1.38.

For the first quarter of 2026, Jefferies forecasts core EBITDA of $204 million, below the consensus estimate of $232 million. The firm cites lag in feedstock pricing as a potential headwind for the Feed segment, unless market conditions reverse in January.

Jefferies notes that lower feedstock pricing should benefit the Diamond Green Diesel segment in the first quarter, though pressure could emerge from lower 45Z credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The firm also highlights that market attention remains focused on the final Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO), which could potentially be released by the end of the first quarter.

In other recent news, Darling Ingredients Inc. reported mixed results for its Q3 2025 earnings. The company posted earnings per share of $0.12, which was below the projected $0.25, marking a 52% negative surprise. However, revenue surpassed expectations, reaching $1.56 billion compared to the anticipated $1.51 billion, a 3.31% positive surprise. Additionally, Darling Ingredients announced the sale of $50 million in production tax credits from its Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, adding to previous sales and bringing the total to $235 million for 2025.

In another development, Darling Ingredients plans to form a joint venture with Belgium’s Tessenderlo Group to merge their collagen and gelatin businesses. Darling will hold an 85% majority stake in this venture, which requires no initial cash investment and is expected to close in 2026, pending regulatory approvals. Furthermore, Darling had previously announced the sale of $60 million in production tax credits, also under its Diamond Green Diesel joint venture. Meanwhile, the company faced a potential regulatory challenge as the Trump administration considered delaying proposed cuts to biofuel import incentives, which could impact the value of renewable fuel credits.

Lines, Ltd. (MOL) and ITOCHU Corporation have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to advance decarbonization in the transportation sector through the use of Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs).

Under this MOU, MOL and ITOCHU will collaborate on marketing, public relations, sales, and other initiatives to promote the adoption of EACs. This partnership aims to help companies using transportation services reduce their Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. By bridging the shipping and aviation industries, this initiative establishes a new model for decarbonization in Japan.

As part of the collaboration, both companies, acting as users of maritime and air transport, have engaged in mutual trading of EACs to offset their respective Scope 3 emissions:

Transaction summary:

MOL purchased “air transport” EACs from ITOCHU to reduce emissions associated with employee air travel (Scope 3, Category 6).

ITOCHU purchased “maritime transport” EACs from MOL to reduce emissions from its use of sea freight (Scope 3, Category 4).

These transactions were executed through 123Carbon’s platform in the Netherlands, which acts to ensure the issuance, transfer, storage, and retirement of EACs under a robust audit framework.

Scope 3 emissions represent indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain, both upstream and downstream, excluding the emissions from the company’s own operations (which are Scope 1 and 2).

Reducing Scope 3 emissions, often the largest share of corporate emissions, is a major challenge due to complex supply chains. MOL will leverage its expertise in low-carbon marine fuels, while ITOCHU will apply its experience with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). To remind, in February 2025 MOL has launched the BLUE ACTION NET-ZERO ALLIANCE program to help reduce Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for shippers and Non Vessel Operating Common Carriers (NVOCCs) using ocean transport.

The company and its technology stems from over a decade of research at the University of Oxford. Its aim is to convert waste carbon into SAF by combining the biogenic carbon and (green, if required) hydrogen in waste biomass or biogas and/or carbon dioxide from sustainable sources.

What makes the company different is its use of a patented iron-based catalyst. This eliminates the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps.

This reduces capital and operating costs and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The award comes after a successful year of funding for the company. In July 2025, it received £2.81m under the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund scheme.

In October, the company raised £20.75m in a round of funding designed to accelerate commercialisation efforts, expand operations, and advance the next phase of technology scale-up.

OXCCU also received a £1.8m grant through the ATI Non-CO2 Programme to investigate the non-CO2 effects of its synthetic crude ‘Oxfuel’.

“This ATI Programme funding not only enables us to advance our technology but also supports our ambition to lead the industry in producing cleaner aviation fuels with a reduced contribution to global warming,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU.

The next phase will build on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Its second demo plant, OX2, is underway and should be fully operational in 2026.

The award is a positive sign for a sector that has seen bottlenecks due to the slow pace of technology roll-out. A 2025 report from the International Air Transport Association revealed that airlines will need 500 million tonnes of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, at the release of the report. “However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/gwml/exploringtheuseofgassensorsinaviation_493129.jpg",N,,2026-01-12 06:57:21.546167

The super-midsize jet remains a staple of the jetset lifestyle. Large enough to accommodate a sizable party in an intimate, bespoke setting, and allowing plenty of space for retreats and relaxation, the super-mid embodies the luxury demanded by high-performance VIP travelers worldwide. Crucially, these aircraft are fast, offering impressive range. Now, the super-mid could gain a key advantage that has long eluded the business jet world: fuel efficiency.

American startup Otto Aerospace grabbed attention at the 2025 Paris Air Show with its super-mid private jet concept, the Phantom 3500. This bold entry into the super-mid market features a remarkably efficient and lightweight design that leverages the advantages of a phenomenon called laminar flow. According to Otto Aerospace, laminar flow refers to a state where air moves smoothly over a jet’s surface, allowing the aircraft to achieve exceptional aerodynamic efficiency. By maintaining this smooth airflow throughout its body, the Phantom 3500 significantly reduces drag, enabling it to fly with less energy and enhancing its overall performance in the skies.

Scott Drennan, President and Chief Operating Officer of Otto Aerospace, told Jetset that the Phantom will consume 61 percent less fuel with significantly lower carbon emissions (as much as 90 percent less with sustainable aviation fuel) without sacrificing range or cabin space. This truly sustainable aircraft will weigh approximately 19,000 pounds—nearly half the weight of some super-mids—and carry only 7,500 pounds of fuel.

The Phantom presents an unconventional visual profile. The cockpit contains the only windows with the rest removed to promote better aerodynamics. Its fuselage showcases a teardrop design, while renderings indicate a sleek gray finish highlighted front to back by a black stripe. The long, narrow wings lend the aircraft a futuristic look, evoking an image of an orca killer whale that has sprouted wings and taken to the skies.

Its range of 4,000 miles positions well with other super-mids like the Bombardier’s Challenger 3500 with its 3,900-mile range. Moreover, the Phantom will operate at a maximum altitude of 51,000 feet, much higher than its competitors and optimal for laminar flow, according to Drennan. Powered by a pair of Williams International FJ44s jet engines, the Phantom will cut through the high atmosphere and achieve a maximum speed of over .8 Mach, or around six hundred miles per hour.

While other business jets use larger engines, the smaller Williams FJ44s engines paired with Phantom’s ability to channel laminar flow potential makes Otto’s design a true game changer. The Phantom’s takeoff weight of 19,000 pounds makes it nimbler than other super-mids, which weigh in at around 35-40,000 pounds. Lower weight translates into reduced fuel consumption, especially when combined with smaller engines and fewer components requiring maintenance and repair, Drennan explained. “This results in a more efficient aircraft overall. It turns the economics in your favor.”

Virtual Views

Unlike traditional aircraft designs that rely on cabin windows, the passengers’ view will be virtual. Small exterior cameras will capture what’s happening outside the aircraft and display it on high-definition screens in the cabin. This technology, called Super Natural Vision, will provide a “cinematic view of the world,” Drennan said.

Super Natural Vision will also double as an infotainment system. Passengers can switch between business activities such as Zoom and Outlook as well as stay up to date on the latest streamable movies and television shows. Otto is considering a touch screen interface inside the cabin to control the system. Passengers will control the system remotely with an app that will run on an operating system Otto is developing.

Inside, the Phantom offers sizable living space that accommodates up to nine passengers, with a cabin height of 6 feet 5 inches, a width of 7 feet 6 inches, and a length of twenty-three feet. In comparison, Bombardier’s Challenger 3500 has a cabin height of 6 feet, width of 7 feet 2 inches, and length of twenty-five feet. Like Bombardier’s Challenger, the Phantom can be customized, with owners and fleet operators choosing from up to four variations of the cabin or working with outside designers to fashion their own floating luxury loft.

Sustainable Future

Drennan didn’t discuss a starting price in his conversation with Jetset. However, he said the company believes that reducing operating costs and design efficiency positions the Phantom as a competitive option in the super-midsize market. One indication of the level of interest in the new aircraft is that the fractional jet ownership company Flexjet has agreed to purchase 300 Phantom 3500 jets, making the company Otto’s first fleet customer.

Otto plans to begin testing the Phantom in 2027 and aims to achieve FAA certification by 2030, when they expect to launch commercial operations. It will enter a field dominated by established manufacturers offering super-midsize jets, including the Bombardier Challenger 3500, Praetor 500, and Gulfstream G280. These aircraft, much like the Phantom, are designed to operate transcontinental at transonic speeds while accommodating nine to ten passengers.

If successful, the Phantom could offer a practical and immediate response to the challenges of carbon emissions in the business aviation space, all while providing the bespoke luxury VIPs have come to expect from business jets. Even if owners elect to use standard aviation fuel instead of sustainable aviation fuel, they can still net a 60 percent reduction in carbon footprint, Otto claims. The company is committed to achieving net-zero emissions by the time the aircraft becomes operational, well ahead of an industry-wide push for significant reductions in carbon pollution by 2050.

“It is the best short way to take the biggest chunk out of your carbon footprint, ” Drennan said.",https://jetsetmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/v12.2-El-Zorro-5-3500-1.webp,N,,2026-01-12 06:57:29.845327

Monday, January 12, 2026Cathay welcomes the release of Igniting the SAF Market: Policy Pathways for Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel in China, a research study published by Peking University's National School of Development in late 2025. The in-depth analysis and recommendations outlined in the study offer actionable insights on scaling SAF adoption in the Chinese Mainland through market measures on both supply and demand fronts.

The study examines the challenges and untapped potential in scaling SAF in the Chinese Mainland, benchmarking global best practices while drawing parallels with China's thriving solar photovoltaic industry. The report highlights China's unique feedstock and manufacturing advantages, and projects long-term cost implications across different technical production pathways. Notably, the Power-to-Liquid (PtL) pathway - best known for producing electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) - shows the greatest potential for long-term cost reduction. The study notes that, with appropriate policy support, SAF produced locally via PtL may achieve price parity with conventional jet fuel (including China's projected carbon price in 2030) ​ when the cumulative eSAF output reaches 1.6 million tonnes.

In addition, the study recommends a multi-pronged approach to growing the national SAF industry and capturing long-term cost benefits, from policy integration and stimulating market demand to expanding international market access and establishing procurement mechanisms that ensure stable supply and demand.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: ""As a vital player in global aviation and the SAF ecosystem, the Chinese Mainland's development of its domestic SAF industry not only capitalises on global momentum and supports national carbon targets, but also helps promote the availability and affordability of SAF needed by the global aviation industry.

""This study by Peking University is encouraging, as it demonstrates the long-term potential for cost parity between SAF and conventional jet fuel, provided there is sufficient support for the development of new technologies and large-scale SAF production, along with policies that support SAF deployment from both demand and supply sides. Such progress will be essential for global airlines to realise further SAF usage in a commercially viable way.""

Cathay has long supported SAF development in the Chinese Mainland. The airline was among the early ones to uplift Chinese-made SAF products at Hong Kong International Airport, Amsterdam Schiphol, and London Heathrow.

SAF continues to play a critical role in aviation's path to decarbonisation. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce around 80% of carbon emissions on a lifecycle basis, based on the SAF procured by the Cathay Group in 2024.

,,2026-01-12 10:13:16+00:00,Aviation Business Middle East,"Up to 56% lower emissions possible by changing cabin layouts, not aircraft","Ryan.Harmon, Nathan Baker, Manuela Vergel",,,,,https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/airlines/up-to-56-lower-emissions-possible-by-changing-cabin-layouts-not-aircraft,"While aircraft type, route length, and load factors were expected drivers of efficiency, cabin layout emerged as one of the most influential variables.
In recent years, several major carriers have expanded premium cabin ratios to offset rising costs and volatile demand.
Load factors complicate the picture Premium cabins also influence load factors, another key determinant of emissions performance.
Premium cabins, particularly first class, often experience lower load factors than economy sections, especially outside peak travel periods.
For airlines, improving premium cabin utilisation becomes both a commercial and environmental imperative.","For more than a decade, airline strategy has been steadily drifting toward premiumisation. Larger business class footprints, the reintroduction of first class on select routes, and the rise of ultra long haul services have all been justified by one simple logic: yield matters more than volume.

But a new global study on commercial aviation efficiency suggests that this shift carries a climate cost that the industry has largely avoided confronting.

According to research published in Communications Earth and Environment, premium seating configurations are among the most carbon-intensive features of today’s air transport system, with business and first-class seats generating up to 5 times the emissions per passenger of economy-class travel.

For an industry under increasing pressure to demonstrate credible decarbonisation pathways, the findings place cabin design squarely at the centre of the sustainability conversation.

Why seat configuration matters

The study analysed 27.5 million commercial flights across more than 26,000 city pairs in 2023, measuring emissions in grams of carbon dioxide per revenue passenger kilometre. While aircraft type, route length, and load factors were expected drivers of efficiency, cabin layout emerged as one of the most influential variables.

Premium cabins consume disproportionately more space and weight per passenger. Larger seats, lower seat density, additional furnishings, and higher service loads mean that fewer passengers share the same fuel burn. When emissions are allocated per passenger, the result is a sharp divergence between premium and economy seating.

The researchers cite industry benchmarks indicating that a first-class seat can be up to five times more carbon-intensive than an economy seat, and a business-class seat around four times more intensive. On widebody aircraft operating long-haul routes, where premium cabins are most prevalent, this effect is magnified.

In simple terms, even highly efficient aircraft can deliver weak emissions performance if a significant portion of cabin space is dedicated to premium seating.

Premiumisation versus efficiency

The tension between premiumisation and efficiency is not theoretical. It is visible across fleet deployment and product strategy decisions made by airlines worldwide.

In recent years, several major carriers have expanded premium cabin ratios to offset rising costs and volatile demand. This trend is particularly pronounced on intercontinental routes, where business class demand has proven more resilient than economy traffic.

The study highlights that premium heavy airlines, even when operating modern fleets, often record higher emissions per revenue passenger kilometre than carriers using similar aircraft with denser seating layouts. The implication is clear: aircraft efficiency alone does not guarantee system efficiency.

This challenges a common industry assumption that sustainability progress is primarily driven by fleet renewal. While new generation aircraft deliver meaningful fuel savings, those gains can be diluted by low-density cabin configurations.

The Middle East dilemma

Nowhere is this trade-off more relevant than in the Middle East.

Gulf carriers have built global brands on premium service, widebody scale, and long-haul connectivity. Business and first-class cabins are not mere add-ons; they are core to the value proposition. At the same time, these airlines operate some of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the world and benefit from consistently high load factors.

The study’s data show that major Middle East hubs perform relatively well on emissions per revenue passenger kilometre compared with many Western airports, reflecting strong utilisation and the deployment of modern aircraft. Yet the presence of large premium cabins remains a structural efficiency constraint.

For Middle East airlines, the question is not whether premium travel should disappear, but how it can evolve without undermining emissions performance.

Hidden opportunity in cabin optimisation

One of the study’s most striking findings is the scale of potential emissions reduction available through cabin reconfiguration alone.

When modelling a shift to all-economy layouts on the most efficient widebody aircraft currently in service, the researchers found that emissions could fall by 21.5% to 56.7%, depending on aircraft type and seating assumptions. These reductions are achieved without changing routes, frequencies, or passenger volumes.

Even allowing for a modest fuel penalty from increased passenger weight, the net emissions benefit remains substantial.

While fully economic configurations are unlikely to be commercially viable for network carriers, the analysis highlights the untapped potential of hybrid approaches. Higher-density business-class layouts, reduced first-class footprints, and smarter use of premium economy could all deliver efficiency gains without eliminating premium offerings.

Load factors complicate the picture

Premium cabins also influence load factors, another key determinant of emissions performance.

The study confirms that flights operating at lower load factors see sharply higher emissions per passenger. A half-full aircraft emits nearly twice as much CO2 per revenue passenger kilometre as a full one on comparable distances.

Premium cabins, particularly first class, often experience lower load factors than economy sections, especially outside peak travel periods. This means that even when an aircraft appears full, emissions per passenger may be higher than headline load factor figures suggest.

For airlines, improving premium cabin utilisation becomes both a commercial and environmental imperative.

Policy and investor pressure is coming

While aviation climate policy has focused heavily on sustainable aviation fuel mandates, the study argues that efficiency-based measures could deliver faster emissions reductions.

Cabin layout sits uncomfortably within that debate, but it may not remain immune. Investors, lenders, and regulators are increasingly interested in emissions intensity metrics rather than absolute emissions alone. As disclosures become more granular, airlines may be asked to explain not just what they fly, but how they configure it.

Efficiency-based landing fees, emissions intensity benchmarks, or transparency requirements could all bring cabin design decisions into sharper focus.

A strategic reckoning ahead

Premium travel is not going away. Demand for comfort, privacy, and flexibility remains strong, particularly in the long-haul markets that Middle East airlines dominate.

But the study makes one thing clear. Cabin configuration is no longer a purely commercial choice. It is a structural driver of aviation’s climate impact.

For airlines that want to lead the sustainability conversation without compromising their business model, the next frontier will not be abandoning premium cabins, but redesigning them for a lower-carbon future. As aviation enters a decade where growth, efficiency, and climate credibility must coexist, comfort will increasingly come with a question attached: at what cost, and how smartly can it be delivered?",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2026/01/12/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-12-at-1.30.39-PM.jpeg,N,,2026-01-12 05:56:37.856644

First, it was the Citation Ascend exactly on the last day of 2025, and then, a few days later, the Citation CJ3 Gen2 did the same.

The CJ3 Gen2 was first announced by Cessna in October 2023, during the National Business Aviation Association - Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) in Las Vegas. It was hailed, even from back then, as the result of customer feedback received via a Customer Advisory Board made up of owners, pilots, and mechanics.

What this means is that, even if the plane remains mechanically the same as the Citation it is based on, it does add a number of features intended to make both pilots and passengers more comfortable than before.

In the cockpit, for instance, pilots can enjoy 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) more legroom, something that not only makes the ride smoother for the one in control of the plane but also allows for easier entry and egress from the pilot's seat.

To make flying easier, Cessna included in the design the Garmin G3000 software and hardware suite that packs together autothrottle, touchscreen controllers, and GDL60 for aircraft connectivity, allowing for remote transmission of flight plans, automatic database updates, and wireless transmission of aircraft diagnostic data.

Back where the passengers sit, the fully customizable luxury interior is capable of transporting up to 10 passengers at a time. People now climb on board using a new step and assist handle and rest in either fixed side-facing seats or folding side-facing seats. Every seat comes with USB-C power, floor tracking, and a swivel function as an option.

Cessna also tinkered a bit with the plane's bathrooms, which now feature skylights. Everywhere you look, there is RGB accent lighting to set the proper mood on long flights. An externally serviceable lavatory rounds up the changes.

Speaking of long flights, the plane's pair of Williams International engines can keep the Citation CJ3 Gen2 going for as many as 2,350 miles (3,770 km). They allow the plane to carry with it 2,135 pounds (968 kg) of cargo, and they can be operated on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The aircraft got certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in October 2025, and in the first decade of January, Cessna announced the plane's entry into service, a little later than originally planned.

The launch customers for the aircraft are Textron Aviation's Customer Advisory Board member Dave Mecartney, and Shannon Day. The exact configuration of this particular example was not disclosed, nor was the price the two had to pay for it.

SAF so far: too little, too slow

No realistic decarbonization pathway is in sight for aviation. Not by 2030 and not by 2050. Demand for fossil jet fuel continues to rise. It is expected to reach new record levels this year. IEA and BNEF anticipate an increase of 50% to 11.4-11.6 mb/d by 2050, should there be no fundamental changes in climate or transport policies.(1)

Consumption rose by 200,000 b/d (barrels per day) in 2025 compared to the previous year, representing approximately 3% growth. For the current year 2026, a similarly robust increase of 180,000 b/d of jet fuel is expected (see chart below).

In absolute terms, consumption of fossil jet fuel grew 10 times faster than Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) supply last year. In the current year, according to current IATA projections, the growth rate will be 16 times faster.

The deployment of SAF cannot keep pace with this growth. Volumes climbed from the equivalent of 22,700 b/d (2024) to 43,100 b/d (2025) and could reach 54,400 b/d SAF this year according to IATA. This means SAF’s market share will remain below the 1% threshold this year (see chart below).

Projections for the coming years are only cautiously optimistic. They primarily refer to the production capacities of facilities that can produce either SAF for aviation or HVO/RD (2) for road transport. What the actual mix will look like is difficult to predict.

Market experts at GENA Solutions Oy (Lahti/Finland) estimate the nominal operational capacities of these facilities at 6.1 million tonnes at the end of 2025. One year earlier, it was 2.9 million tonnes. This would indicate that less than one-third of HEFA/HVO capacities were used for SAF.

2. SAF production pathways and limitations

🔷 HEFA (feedstock: UCO/Animal Fats)

Apart from two small facilities, there are currently only HEFA-SAF capacities available for SAF (stand-alone or co-processing). They demonstrate favorable climate performance when using UCO (used cooking oil) as feedstock, which has been the dominant practice to date.

However, UCO potential is limited (more on this in a later blog post). Aviation also competes here with trucking (HVO/RD) and maritime shipping.

Competition to the HEFA pathway will remain limited. Well into the 2030s, the near-total dominance of HEFA-SAF will persist.

The problem of inter-sectoral competition also arises in similar fashion for ethanol and methanol (see below), which can be utilized for decarbonization in road transport (ethanol), maritime shipping (ethanol, methanol), and also in industry (methanol).

🔷 Ethanol-to-Jet (EtJ)

EtJ has considerable growth potential in the SAF sector. Electrification in road transport could free up substantial volumes for aviation. Sugarcane, corn, and other crops provide a large feedstock base.

The climate performance of corn ethanol is disputed, as is the case with most crop-based oils. This does not constitute a fundamental obstacle, as crucial factors (particularly ILUC effects, energy/fertilizer inputs) could be minimized. Until then, however, considerable efforts are required.

LanzaJet commissioned the first commercial-scale ethanol-to-jet facility in November 2025 (Freedom Pines). Current production volumes are not publicly known. According to earlier reports, volumes of up to 500 b/d would be conceivable.

🔷 Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ)

MtJ also has potential, particularly in China, though deployment in maritime shipping or industry appears more likely. Further processing toward jet fuel would be technically quite complex and demanding.

🔷 Fischer-Tropsch Process (FT-Waste)

FT facilities can in principle utilize a very broad range of waste feedstocks. However, very high costs, low output selectivity, and numerous technical problems will significantly slow or even completely prevent widespread deployment. To date, there is no commercial-scale FT-waste facility in sight.

🔷 E-SAF

The same applies to eSAF (synthetic aviation fuel), which is intended to utilize electrolysis hydrogen (green hydrogen) and CO2 from other processes (primarily from industry and agriculture). Output of existing projects is negligible..

The EU mandates a 1.2% eSAF blending requirement from 2030, which is to rise to 35% by 2050.

However, costs are exorbitant, running ten times higher than conventional jet fuel. No significant cost reduction is in sight. Volumes will therefore remain low, as government financing will rapidly reach its limits.

CO2 availability will also become more difficult once industrial CO2 point sources becomes scarce in the EU after 2040 and biogenic CO2 would simultaneously need to serve several demand sectors.

3. SAF climate benefits and feedstocks

The feedstock potential of UCO and other waste oils is limited. Crop-based oil or ethanol can broaden the feedstock base, but this reduces the climate benefit per litre of SAF.

Large feedstock potentials with favorable climate performance will become available if agricultural residues of all kinds can be utilized (cellulosic biomass). In addition, the methanol economy could be expanded so massively that it could supply not only industry and maritime transport but also aviation.

The cellulosic and/or methanol pathway likewise faces enormous scale-up challenges. Most experts remain rather pessimistic. The expansion could proceed so slowly that leapfrogging toward hydrogen or electric aircrafts might even be easier and faster.

4. SAF costs and prices

The alternatives to fossil jet fuel are expensive. EASA places average market-based reference prices in the EU at:

€734/t for conventional jet fuel

€2,085/t for HEFA-SAF

€7,695/t for e-SAF

This results in enormous direct CO2 avoidance costs of approximately €430/tCO2 when deploying HEFA-SAF and €2,210/tCO2 for eSAF. By comparison, one tonne of CO2 (EUA) currently costs just €85/t in the European ETS.

Particularly regarding eSAF promotion, the question therefore arises whether government-subsidized expansion of this pathway represents the best solution.

The potential for significant cost reduction is limited for both HEFA-SAF and eSAF. Moreover, the cost question is too narrow in any case, as a rapid increase in SAF mandates will drive prices far above costs. It would therefore be quite possible that SAF will become more expensive rather than cheaper in the future.

5. SAF mandates and new import dependencies

The number of SAF mandates outside the EU and UK remains limited at present, but a number of Asian countries are gradually following suit, starting with Singapore and Korea and soon to be followed by India, China, and other states. In the US, individual airlines are already quite active in deploying SAF. Countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and China can draw on a large domestic feedstock base for HEFA-SAF (UCO). The US or Brazil could pursue the EtJ pathway (corn, sugarcane).

In the EU, the feedstock base is less favorable. As with many other technologies, Europe is heading toward high dependence on China for HEFA-SAF as well. Already in 2024, 38% of feedstocks (primarily UCO) for SAF production in Europe came from China, according to EASA.

The abolition of double-counting for advanced biofuels and (from 2027) palm oil products in major EU states such as Germany (under RED III) will further complicate UCO availability for aviation. Higher SAF exports from China can likely only ease the situation until SAF demand rises in China. Thirty SAF projects have already been announced in China. However, there is no timeline yet for nationwide SAF mandates..

Source: Argus

6. Conclusion

It is clear that HEFA-SAF can only represent an interim solution for aviation decarbonization.

The feedstock base must be considerably broadened. Ethanol and perhaps also methanol are candidates here. However, in the long term larger volumes would only be available through the utilization of cellulosic biomass, that is, through the enormous quantities of straw, bagasse, stover, etc., that accrue regularly.

Or a leapfrogging approach toward new propulsion systems such as H2 or batteries must be pursued. Here, in addition to major technological challenges, an airline industry that hardly appears innovation-friendly and a sluggish licensing bureaucracy stand in the way.

In parallel, therefore, the numerous non-fuel ideas should be implemented. Rapid contrail management would be inexpensive and comparatively quick to realize. In the areas of fleet modernization, air traffic organization, and the airline industry itself, there are also many potentials that can contribute to comparatively rapid decarbonization.

This year’s Sustainability Award – with the shortlist chosen from our 2026 Startups 100 Index, powered by Sage – was a fiercely contested category, as so many conscience-led ventures are out there trying to find solutions. This category that filled us with hope that there are great and innovative minds working tirelessly to make a difference.

Here is the winner and shortlist for the 2026 Startups 100 Index Sustainability Award.

Winner – OXCCU

In 2023, aviation accounted for 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions. It is an industry that has proved slow to change, despite its reputation as a high polluter.

The main problem has been finding an alternative to the fossil fuel-based aviation fuel that powers the majority of fleets. In 2024, the aviation industry accounted for around 8% of global final oil consumption, as compared with maritime shipping, which sat at around 7%.

OXCCU’s mission is to develop the world’s “lowest cost and lowest emission” pathways to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from waste carbon. The team explains that it combines the biogenic carbon and hydrogen contained in waste biomass or biogas and/or CO2 from a variety of sustainable sources, and adds electrolytic H2 if required.

The team has already launched a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, and has won £18m in Series A funding plus £20.75m in Series B, as well as £5.9m in government grants.

The team sees its work as part of a wider movement to push the aviation industry to net-zero, as its technology will “enable people to continue to fly and use hydrocarbon products but with a reduced climate impact”. And this is why the aviation industry is interested.

Shortlist – PulpaTronics

This startup caught our attention last year when it was also nominated for our 2025 Sustainability Award, and it has again won a place on the shortlist for 2026. This team set out to tackle an issue that so many of us ignore or aren’t aware of: the e-waste caused by discarded RFID tags.

These tags are prolific. We use them in shops across the world. However, more than over 30 billion single-use tags end up in landfills every year.

PulpaTronics has created metal-free and chipless RFID tags made only from paper using a laser technology. They use fewer components than traditional tags and have a simpler manufacturing process. This means that, not only are they recyclable, they are also cheaper to make.

What started out as a final year master’s project could now have a profound impact. PulpaTronics has the backing of the Imperial Enterprise Lab and Innovate UK, among others, and is actively recruiting to boost its team.

PulpaTronics was also one of the winners of this year’s H&M Global Change Awards. This brought a €200,000 prize, but also access to mentors, collaborators and industry leaders from the fashion world.

For an industry in which there have been some high profile accusations of greenwashing, the switch to sustainable RFID tags could have an immediate and yet lasting impact.

Shortlist – Adamo Foods

Intensive meat production is now well-known to be bad for the environment and people’s health, and Adamo Foods has set out to find an alternative. However, as founder and CEO Pierre Dupuis says, the plant-based meat alternatives on the market are often mushy and have a poor texture, which puts consumers off.

The Adamo Foods team set about creating an alternative to meat whole cuts, which represent 85% of the $1.2trn real meat market. It developed a proprietary fermentation process to create a fungi which has long, densely-packed fibres. This replicates the texture of real meat, and is also high in protein and fibre.

Its production also used 93% less CO₂e than conventional meat, and 99% less water and land. “This will save 74,000 tonnes of CO₂e in the next five years,” says the team.

Dupuis has been a vegetarian since the age of 12, and while this was driven by concerns about animal welfare at the time, his motivation now also includes broader environmental and health concerns. Led by him, Adamo Foods is creating products that hit the mark for taste and nutrition, but don’t come with a hefty price tag for our environment.

Shortlist – Treeapp

Treeapp lets anyone with a phone contribute to reforestation in under a minute and at no financial cost. This incredible eco-friendly startup has now planted more than six million trees across 20 countries, with each site working towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

“Collectively, these trees will absorb an estimated 654,000 tonnes of CO₂ over their lifetimes, equivalent to almost one million London to New York flights, while restoring 4,002 hectares of land and creating 60,000 fair-wage workdays worldwide,” the team shares proudly.

The app has already gained a following among businesses as diverse as sock brand ChattyFeet and Brighton & Hove Albion football team. As well as catching the attention of the press, the team has also won accolades, including the World Economic Forum’s Uplink Challenge for Restoration at Scale and One Young World’s Lead2030 Challenge.

Now a certified B-Corp, the team is hoping to launch in more countries in the future, and bring in more businesses, both as partners and as clients. The aim is to make helping the planet seamless but effective – one tree at a time.

The airport of 2026 and beyond will set the pace for secure, seamless and sustainable travel that communities can measure, and travellers can experience.","Justin Erbacci, Director General of ACI World, reflects on how outcomes from ICAO’s 42nd Assembly will empower airports to deliver smarter, greener and more seamless travel in the coming years.

The next few years will be decisive for global aviation. Demand is rising, the sector and communities desire cleaner growth, and travellers expect journeys that are secure, seamless and inclusive. Against this backdrop, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 42nd Assembly became the arena to align ambition with action. Held in Montreal from 23 September to 3 October 2025, the triennial assembly gathered more than 2,000 leaders from 192 States to set priorities for the international civil aviation sector.

Under the theme “Transform airports, empower aviation and connect the world,” Airports Council International (ACI) achieved several significant outcomes that will help transform the future of global aviation. In addition, we actively defended airport interests through targeted interventions, ensuring these priorities were reflected in the final outcomes.

What will the airport of 2026 and beyond look like?

Assembly outcomes equip airports, the industry, and States to integrate risk-based security, scale clean energy, modernise slot policy, strengthen economic frameworks, enable digital and inclusive journeys, and advance aerodrome certification. Success will be visible in safer airports, shorter queues, greener operations, more reliable schedules, and a stellar traveller experience. Most importantly, it will be measurable – in emissions reduced, connections added, safety enhanced, and prosperity shared.

What was achieved for airports and the industry?

Driving efficiency and risk-based, harmonised aviation security

As the security landscape evolves, airports and States are aligning on a smarter, standardised way to keep people safe without slowing them down.

Changes to the Assembly Resolution on Security, driven by ACI and broadly supported by States, reinforced the need for a co-ordinated, efficient and harmonised approach to testing and certification to accelerate the deployment of new security equipment, supporting stronger security, greater operational efficiency, and an improved passenger experience.

Secured recognition of airports as critical to aviation decarbonisation

Meeting climate goals requires empowering airports to generate, store, and manage cleaner energy as integral nodes of the aviation ecosystem.

ACI welcomed the formal recognition of airports’ critical role in aviation decarbonisation, with States called to establish enabling frameworks for airport projects such as renewable energy and energy storage. This recognition, driven by ACI, was one of the biggest changes to the ICAO Assembly Resolution on Climate Change agreed during this Assembly.

Advocated for modernised airport slot policy

To match capacity with demand fairly and efficiently, slot rules must reflect today’s operational realities and public-interest objectives.

ACI’s positions gained support across different regions to ensure that public interest is served through equitable, nationally tailored slot policies; the Assembly called for strategic discussions on slot policy modernisation that considers local infrastructure.

Championed airports as businesses in their own right and defended their economic interests

Sustainable airport economics enable the airport investments that travellers and communities expect.

ACI’s promotion of greater air connectivity won States’ support and led to recognition by the Assembly of the need to tackle policy and fiscal barriers affecting connectivity and consumers, and impeding socio-economic development. ACI also defended airports’ and passengers’ interests in matters of consumer protection, called for progress on air service liberalisation, and opposed excessive and double taxation of air transport.

Underscored the critical importance of seamless travel

With volumes rising, the path to resilience is frictionless processing rooted in digital identity, trusted data, and co-ordinated agencies.

With air travel demand expected to reach 18.9 billion by 2047, ACI urged States to enable seamless travel by improving inter-agency co-ordination nationally, accelerating digital travel credentials globally, and supporting industry in implementing digital identity management and biometric solutions – with a focus on seamless borders.

Strengthened aerodrome certification worldwide

Raising the safety baseline everywhere depends on practical support that helps airports achieve and maintain certification.

ACI’s advocacy on aerodrome certification, supported by States across four ICAO regions, called for stronger, coordinated support for governments and airport operators to overcome the challenges in improving safety and getting airports certified.

The ICAO 42nd Assembly placed airports at the centre of global aviation policy. Now we must execute pragmatically and collaboratively. If we seize this moment, the airport of 2026 and beyond will not merely cope with demand; it will set a new standard for secure, seamless and sustainable travel. That is the future ACI will continue to champion, and the future we can build together.

What this means for travellers

Assembly outcomes show up in the traveller’s journey. For instance, risk-based, harmonised security and digital identity shorten queues while keeping safety standards high. By accelerating digital travel credentials globally, travellers experience smoother journeys. Aerodrome certification support raises the safety baseline everywhere and for everyone and facilitates greater global connectivity.

Making 2026 tangible

As airports and their partners translate assembly outcomes into action, success will be judged where it matters most: travellers and communities. Smarter risk-based security, cleaner energy on airport estates, modernised slot regimes, balanced economics and digitally enabled journeys will be part of this future. The airport of 2026 and beyond will set the pace for secure, seamless and sustainable travel that communities can measure, and travellers can experience.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_168215864.png,N,,2026-01-12 05:57:42.469594

Through this MOU, both companies will collaborate in marketing, public relations, sales, and other areas to promote the adoption of EACs, helping companies using transportation services reduce their Scope 3 emissions.

By forming a cross-industry partnership between shipping and aviation, this initiative represents a new model for decarbonisation in Japan.

As part of this initiative, both companies, in their capacity as users of maritime and air transport, have engaged in mutual trading of EACs to reduce their respective Scope 3 emissions as follows:

MOL purchased “air transport (air travel and freight)” EACs issued by ITOCHU to reduce GHG emissions associated with its employee air travel (Scope 3 Category 6).

ITOCHU purchased “maritime transport (sea freight)” EACs issued by MOL to reduce GHG emissions associated with its use of maritime transport (Scope 3 Category 4).

This transaction was executed through the platform provided by 123Carbon in the Netherlands. Operating under a robust audit framework, the platform centrally manages the issuance, transfer, storage, and retirement of EACs. It ensures traceability and reliability of transactions while maintaining high transparency in accordance with global standards.

MOL said reducing Scope 3 emissions-which represent a significant share for many companies- is an unavoidable challenge in advancing climate change response.

One of key barriers is the difficulty of ensuring traceability, given the complexity of supply chains. MOL will leverage its strengths in marine transport through the use of low-carbon marine fuels, while ITOCHU will draw on its expertise in adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Through this collaborative effort in the shipping and aviation sectors, the two companies will establish a framework to support transportation service users in reducing their Scope 3 emissions. Together, they are committed to advancing decarbonization across the broader transportation supply chain through this partnership.

Local boat builder Pinnacle Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd on Sunday (11 January) said its first full biodiesel utility boat, President 100, completed a 1,000-hour sea trial.

Powered by B100 biodiesel, the vessel operated by Prestige Ocean Pte Ltd, captured data on bunker fuel emissions, marine fuel behaviour, and performance in the trial which began in July 2025.

“Across 1,000 operational hours, the trial demonstrated that carbon neutral biofuels are not a distant ambition, but a viable and immediate solution for the maritime energy transition,” the company said in a social media post.

Wilmar International supplied the biodiesel that fuelled this journey and Gulf Marine provided the specialised lubricants essential to engine performance.

Weichai Singapore Pte Ltd engineered the biodiesel engine that powered the vessel while Maritime Energy & Sustainable Development Centre of Excellence (MESD) performed the research and will produce a report to provide critical empirical data to support industry-wide adoption.

The milestone event began with a presentation of the 1,000-hour research findings by Dr Ningrui Tang, followed by a ceremonial signing between the four lead partners.

“This signing represents more than the conclusion of a trial. It opens the door to a new era of Green Marine operations. We hope this project serves as a catalyst for others embarking on their own decarbonisation journeys,” the company added.

Under the restructuring, Sinopec is expected to absorb CNAF, integrating China’s largest oil refiner with the country’s dominant aviation fuel logistics and refuelling operator.
Analysts and state media said the consolidation is intended to streamline China’s aviation fuel supply chain, reduce distribution costs, and eliminate duplicated functions between state-owned enterprises.
Sinopec is positioning itself as China’s leading sustainable aviation fuel producer by developing proprietary technology and building domestic production capacity.
China National Aviation Fuel Group’s SAF strategy is centred on supply security and distribution rather than refining.","China has approved a restructuring between China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) and China National Aviation Fuel Group Limited (CNAF), marking a major state-led consolidation in the country’s petroleum and aviation fuel sector.

The State Council approved the plan following an announcement by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) on January 8, 2026. Sinopec said the restructuring would be implemented in accordance with government arrangements, but provided no further operational details.

Under the restructuring, Sinopec is expected to absorb CNAF, integrating China’s largest oil refiner with the country’s dominant aviation fuel logistics and refuelling operator. CNAF controls aviation fuel supply, storage, and into-plane refuelling services at more than 200 airports across mainland China, while Sinopec is the nation’s largest producer of jet fuel and refined petroleum products.

China consumes just over 40 million tonnes of jet fuel a year, equivalent to roughly 0.8–0.9 million barrels per day.

CNAF does not operate crude oil refineries and sources most of its jet fuel from domestic refiners, including Sinopec and PetroChina. Its core assets lie in airport-side infrastructure, including storage tanks, pipelines, hydrant systems, and refuelling fleets. Sinopec, by contrast, operates one of the world’s largest refining systems and an extensive nationwide fuels marketing and pipeline network.

Analysts and state media said the consolidation is intended to streamline China’s aviation fuel supply chain, reduce distribution costs, and eliminate duplicated functions between state-owned enterprises. By combining refining, logistics, and airport distribution within a single group, policymakers aim to improve operational efficiency and strengthen control over a strategically important fuel segment.

The restructuring also aligns with broader efforts to optimise the state-owned economy amid slowing economic growth and structural shifts in fuel demand. As gasoline and diesel consumption plateaus due to electrification and efficiency gains, aviation fuel and petrochemicals are seen as key growth areas for refiners.

Industry observers also expect the integration to support China’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ambitions by linking Sinopec’s refining and biofuel development capabilities with CNAF’s nationwide airport distribution network.

SAF is emerging as a strategic priority for China’s aviation and refining sectors, linked to the country’s targets to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Under the 14th Five-Year Plan for Green Civil Aviation Development, China set initial SAF consumption targets of 20,000 tonnes per year by 2025, with longer-term policy scenarios pointing to blending rates of 5–15% by 2030. Industry and policy analyses indicate this could translate into domestic SAF demand of several million tonnes per year by the end of the decade, positioning China among the world’s largest potential SAF markets.

China has already begun building the industrial and regulatory foundations to support large-scale SAF deployment. As of 2024, operational and planned SAF capacity—primarily based on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology—totalled more than three million tonnes per year, with several producers receiving airworthiness certification under a CAAC-recognised framework. CAAC, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, is China’s national civil aviation authority under the Ministry of Transport, responsible for regulating and supervising civil aviation, including flight and ground safety, air traffic management, market regulation, and accident investigation.

Sinopec is positioning itself as China’s leading sustainable aviation fuel producer by developing proprietary technology and building domestic production capacity. Through its Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company unit, Sinopec developed the SRJET HEFA process and commissioned China’s first dedicated SAF plant, with a design capacity of about 100,000 tonnes per year, securing both Chinese airworthiness approval and international sustainability certification. The company has already supplied SAF to Airbus’ Tianjin facility and delivered used-cooking-oil-based SAF to Hong Kong International Airport for uplift by Cathay Pacific, signalling ambitions that extend beyond domestic decarbonisation to regional SAF trading and exports. Sinopec is also expanding capacity through a planned 230,000-tonne-per-year SAF plant developed with TotalEnergies, while positioning SAF alongside carbon capture and other low-carbon fuels as part of its broader transition strategy.

China National Aviation Fuel Group’s SAF strategy is centred on supply security and distribution rather than refining. As the country’s dominant aviation fuel logistics and into-plane refuelling operator, CNAF has taken equity stakes in private SAF producers to secure upstream volumes, including investments in used-cooking-oil-based SAF projects. At the same time, CNAF plays a central operational role in China’s CAAC-led SAF pilot programmes, managing storage, blending, quality control, and into-plane delivery at major airports. This positions CNAF as the logistics backbone of China’s emerging SAF market, complementing refiners such as Sinopec by ensuring that certified SAF can be distributed efficiently to airlines as blending targets and policy support expand.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-12 01:11:56.050287

The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short.
Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel.
The alternative jet fuel “has a climate advantage and a marketing advantage,” said SkyNRG senior adviser Andy Billig in a separate interview.
Editor’s note: This story was updated to clarify the status of BP’s sustainable aviation fuel project at Cherry Point.","A who’s who from Washington state business and Democratic politics on Jan. 9 extolled the virtues of alternative jet fuel and said the state would strive to become the nation’s leading enabler of greener flying.

The occasion was a splashy launch event in Snohomish County for a new state-funded eco-fuel development nonprofit, dubbed the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator.

The business accelerator debuted with $10 million in tax dollars approved by the Legislature, matched by another $10 million from an unidentified philanthropic donor. Those new commitments build on tens of millions of dollars the Legislature and Congress previously allocated. The earlier funding was meant to lure alternative fuel refiners to Washington state, supports a Washington State University research lab, and incentivizes green jet fuel use in the state.

Executives from Boeing, Amazon, Alaska Airlines and the Port of Seattle joined Gov. Bob Ferguson, state legislators and the president of WSU on stage at Boeing’s Future of Flight visitor center next to Paine Field.

“Collectively, we have the political will and the private partnerships to get big things done,” state Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, told the standing-room crowd.

State Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said, “Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it.”

The state’s approach contrasts with the Trump administration, which just this week pulled the U.S. out of the foundational United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Trump administration officials have heaped scorn on taxpayer-financed decarbonization incentives. They favor policies to maximize fossil fuel production to drive down energy costs.

“While there are confusing signals coming out of the other Washington, the rest of the world is all-in on sustainable aviation fuel,” Liias said. “This is the fuel of the future.”

The board chair and vice-chair of the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator said the trade organization would lead education and advocacy efforts, recruit companies, invest in research and go to bat for project developers.

The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short. There are multiple methods to make it using a variety of feedstocks such as crop and forestry waste, used cooking oil, algae or hydrogen. Depending on the details, the eco-fuel can reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by anywhere from 50% to 80%.

SAF is favored by airlines because it is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works with existing airplane engines and fuel infrastructure. Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel. Major engine makers are in the process of testing and certifying engines for 100% SAF.

The trouble is that SAF currently costs two to five times as much as conventional jet fuel. The high price and limited supply are holding back wider adoption.

At present, there is no continuous, commercial-scale production in Washington state. But several major companies have plants in design or construction.

Dutch energy company SkyNRG said Jan. 8 that it aims to break ground in late 2027 or in 2028 on a large biofuel production facility at the Wallula Gap industrial park along the Columbia River southeast of Pasco. The company plans to produce 50 million gallons per year of SAF and renewable diesel by converting bio-methane collected from local and regional landfills, as well as a little bit from cow manure digesters.

A competitor named Twelve recently completed construction on a synthetic jet fuel plant in Moses Lake. Twelve plans to use a power-to-liquid production method that relies on lots of renewable electricity to transform carbon dioxide captured from the air and water into what it calls “E-Jet” fuel.

Executives at Twelve portrayed the Moses Lake facility as a demonstration plant. It may begin production in a matter of weeks and ramp up to 50,000 gallons annually. The California-based company plans to locate a much larger commercial-scale E-Jet fuel plant somewhere in the Midwest.

On the west side of the Cascades, BP was awarded nearly $27 million in federal grant funding in 2024 to buy equipment and make upgrades at its Cherry Point refinery. The goal was to begin production in 2029 of 10 million gallons of SAF annually. But since then, BP corporate management scaled back its renewable fuels ambitions globally and put the Whatcom County project on indefinite “pause,” according to a spokesman. Its future is now unclear.

If you add up the capacity of the eco-jet fuel projects announced in the state so far, you make only a modest dent to transition Washington airports to climate-friendly fuel. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated Washington’s jet fuel consumption at 848 million gallons in 2024. According to the Port of Seattle, Sea-Tac Airport alone dispenses around 600 million gallons of jet fuel per year, a number expected to rise over the coming decade.

By the end of the decade though, an Oregon border county could become home to a much larger alternative fuel refinery whose output would equal Sea-Tac’s annual demand. A Texas-headquartered company named NXTClean Fuels is in the process of permitting an alternative jet fuel and renewable diesel refinery along the Columbia River near Clatskanie with a capacity of 750 million gallons per year.

If that project comes to fruition, it would theoretically go a long way toward addressing limited supply in the Pacific Northwest. But that still leaves the barriers of feedstock availability and affordability for airlines.

During a press availability following the Jan. 8 launch event, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, John Plaza, said he foresaw plenty of availability of the renewable natural gas raw ingredient that his company needs to make jet fuel at its planned southeast Washington plant.

Airlines such as Amazon Air have demonstrated some willingness to pay a premium to achieve climate and sustainability goals.

“We strive to have the airline industry pay as little a premium as possible,” Plaza said.

The alternative jet fuel “has a climate advantage and a marketing advantage,” said SkyNRG senior adviser Andy Billig in a separate interview. Billig is a former state Senate majority leader who played an instrumental role in the 2023 passage of state tax incentives for SAF producers and users during his final term in office. The state tax credit is worth up to $2 per gallon and can be stacked with federal incentives.

As of early 2026, a transformative partnership between Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Kuehne+Nagel has entered a crucial operational phase, following a major agreement signed in late December 2025. This alliance is focused on the commercialization of solar-based synthetic aviation fuel, a revolutionary step towards achieving decarbonization in the aviation sector. This collaboration brings together a Swiss clean-tech pioneer, Synhelion, whose innovative technology is at the heart of this significant move, promising to reshape the future of aviation fuel.

The deal marks the start of a new chapter in the airline and logistics industries as these giants join forces to combat the aviation sector’s carbon footprint. With sustainability at the forefront, this partnership aims to make solar-based fuel a viable, scalable, and long-term solution for reducing emissions in air travel.

Who Are the Key Players in the Partnership?

This landmark collaboration involves three main players: SWISS, Kuehne+Nagel, and Synhelion. SWISS, the national carrier of Switzerland, is leading the way as the first airline to integrate solar-based synthetic aviation fuel (SAF) into its regular operations. Kuehne+Nagel, a global logistics provider, will benefit from this innovation by offering its airfreight customers a way to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. Synhelion, a clean-tech company from Switzerland, is the technology provider behind the synthetic fuel, specializing in converting concentrated solar heat into aviation fuel.

What Is Solar-Based Synthetic Fuel?

The core of this groundbreaking partnership is the support for Synhelion’s solar fuel technology, which has already made headlines in the clean-tech industry. Synhelion is the first company globally to use concentrated solar heat to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike traditional biofuels, which rely on agricultural crops and waste products, solar jet fuel is produced by harnessing the power of sunlight to create high-temperature process heat. This heat is then used to convert biogenic carbon and water into liquid fuel, resulting in a synthetic fuel that is both carbon-neutral and scalable.

The technology is being hailed as a game-changer for the aviation industry, as it does not compete with food crops, unlike traditional biofuels. The fuel is designed as a “drop-in” solution, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft engines and infrastructure without the need for any modifications, making it a practical and seamless transition for airlines.

How Will This Partnership Work?

Under the terms of the agreement, SWISS has committed to purchasing at least 200 tonnes of Synhelion’s synthetic SAF annually. This move is critical to the financial sustainability of Synhelion’s production capabilities, ensuring that the company can scale its operations and meet the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel. The fuel will be used by SWISS in its own operations, marking the airline as a trailblazer in sustainable aviation practices.

Furthermore, Kuehne+Nagel will also benefit from the partnership by purchasing a significant portion of the SAF. The global logistics provider will use this fuel specifically for its airfreight shipments handled by Swiss WorldCargo, the air cargo division of SWISS. This marks a major step in the broader decarbonization of supply chains, as Kuehne+Nagel will be able to offer its customers a tangible and effective way to reduce the CO₂ footprint of their supply chains.

What Are the Long-Term Goals and Timeline for This Partnership?

This collaboration is based on a binding, long-term offtake agreement, ensuring that both SWISS and Kuehne+Nagel have a reliable and steady supply of synthetic SAF for years to come. The fuel supply agreement for Kuehne+Nagel will officially begin in 2027, once Synhelion completes its first industrial-scale production facility.

The partnership is a significant step in the aviation industry’s collective effort to reach ambitious decarbonization targets. SWISS’s parent company, Lufthansa Group, is aiming to reduce net CO₂ emissions by 50% by 2030, with the goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. This collaboration will help the airline make substantial progress toward these targets, setting a standard for other airlines to follow.

Why Is This Partnership Considered a “First-of-Its-Kind”?

Unlike many airlines that use bio-SAF, produced from waste oils and fats, this partnership is focused on synthetic SAF, which is seen as the “gold standard” for sustainability. Synthetic SAF does not compete with food crops, has the potential for near-limitless scalability, and offers a significantly lower carbon footprint than traditional aviation fuel. Additionally, synthetic SAF can be produced at scale without relying on the limitations of agricultural resources, making it a highly sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.

This partnership also stands out because it bridges the gap between the airline industry, logistics, and clean-tech solutions. By partnering with Kuehne+Nagel, SWISS is not only leading by example in the aviation sector but also contributing to the larger efforts to decarbonize global supply chains.

What Are the Strategic Goals for This Collaboration?

The goals of the partnership go beyond simply purchasing and using synthetic SAF. The primary objectives include:

Decarbonizing Aviation: Both SWISS and Kuehne+Nagel are committed to using sustainable aviation fuel as a critical part of their decarbonization strategies. For Kuehne+Nagel, securing a long-term supply of SAF allows the logistics giant to significantly reduce the carbon emissions from its airfreight operations.

Scalability of Synthetic SAF: One of the long-term goals is to scale the production of synthetic SAF to make it economically viable and accessible to the wider aviation industry.

Strategic Alignment with Climate Goals: This collaboration aligns perfectly with the Lufthansa Group’s broader climate targets and emphasizes the importance of innovation in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

What Does This Mean for the Aviation and Logistics Industries?

The agreement between SWISS, Kuehne+Nagel, and Synhelion is a major milestone for the aviation and logistics sectors. This partnership provides a practical solution to one of the industry’s most pressing issues: reducing emissions from air travel. As the first airline in the world to integrate solar fuel into its operations, SWISS is setting a new benchmark for the industry. This collaboration is also a clear signal to other logistics and aviation companies to follow suit and explore sustainable fuel alternatives.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250724-swiss-synhelion.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 15:57:17.783186

From major airport projects and new long-haul routes to sustainability efforts and regional policy reforms, the year marked a turning point, with Kenya playing a visible and influential role.

Across the continent, airlines and governments moved beyond post-pandemic recovery and began laying foundations for long-term growth. The changes were not just about more flights, but about cheaper travel, greener technology, and stronger regional cooperation.

Kenya’s Growing Role in African Aviation

Kenya remained one of East Africa’s aviation anchors in 2025. Nairobi continued to serve as a key gateway between Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, while Kenyan airlines took notable steps toward sustainability and innovation.

Safarilink Aviation made headlines by committing to hybrid-electric aircraft, positioning Kenya among the early African adopters of cleaner aviation technology. At the same time, Kenya Airways advanced plans to support local production of sustainable aviation fuel, signaling a shift toward greener long-haul operations and reduced carbon emissions.

These moves placed Kenya firmly within Africa’s broader push to modernize aviation while responding to global environmental pressures.

Big Infrastructure and Global Ambition

Elsewhere on the continent, Ethiopian Airlines led one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in African aviation history — the development of Bishoftu International Airport, set to become Africa’s largest airport. The project underscored Africa’s intention to compete directly with major global hubs in Europe and the Middle East.

For Kenya, this expansion presents both competition and opportunity. Improved continental hubs can strengthen inter-African connectivity, benefiting Nairobi as a regional link point for business, tourism, and cargo.

Cheaper Skies Through Regional Action

Perhaps the most significant policy shift came from West Africa. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) approved a decision to cut air ticket taxes and passenger charges, a move expected to reduce fares by up to 40 percent.

Aviation experts say this decision has direct relevance for regions such as East Africa, where flying remains expensive for ordinary citizens. For Kenya and its neighbors, the ECOWAS model provides a clear example of how regional cooperation can make air travel more affordable and boost intra-African tourism and trade.

New Routes, New Connections

Across Africa, airlines expanded international reach. Uganda Airlines launched direct flights to London, Nigerian carriers strengthened partnerships with global airlines, and Ethiopian Airlines expanded cargo links to Asia.

Kenya, already well connected internationally, benefited from this wider network growth by strengthening its role in regional feeder traffic, supporting tourism flows into the country and across East Africa.

Challenges Still Remain

Despite progress, 2025 also highlighted persistent challenges. Safety oversight, regulatory consistency, geopolitical tensions, and high operating costs continue to affect African aviation — including in Kenya.

Airlines and regulators face ongoing pressure to balance expansion with safety, affordability, and environmental responsibility.

A Shared African Direction

What stood out in 2025 was a shared sense of direction. Africa’s aviation sector — including Kenya — is no longer focused only on survival. It is investing, experimenting, and coordinating across borders.

For Kenya, the year reinforced its position as a regional aviation leader, while showing that future success will depend on deeper regional cooperation, smarter policies, and continued innovation.

As Africa looks ahead, the skies are no longer just opening — they are being deliberately redesigned, with Kenya firmly part of the journey.",https://katakenya.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cropped-cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-11 15:57:27.535296

Electrofuels derived from renewable electricity sources and electrolytic green hydrogen may be scalable in the future. These electrofuels are also referred to as power to liquids or PtL fuels. A pertinent question about electrofuels is whether they are the best use of green electrons whilst there is such a surging demand for electricity around the world and the majority of power generation capacity still relies on fossil fuels. Gasification of residual biomass, such as forestry cuttings and post-harvest waste, is an alternative pathway to achieve liquid fuels. This pathway to SAF is more affordable than the electrofuels route. The challenge of this process is that the syngas produced by gasification is very rich in carbon monoxide (CO) but it does not contain sufficient hydrogen to produce liquid fuels such as kerosene and diesel. And, when we look to the very long term, the amount of available forestry waste is finite and driven by timber production, which is the primary use of the harvested tree. The combination of these two imperfect processes can create a harmonious synergy. The forestry waste biomass is stretched through the use of electrolytic hydrogen to mitigate the scalability concerns. The carbon from the biomass is fully utilised with minimal carbon dioxide emissions. And, the high cost of the pure electrofuel is reduced through combination with the more affordable waste biomass feedstock. Interested in clean energy projects and technologies?

In early September, SMBC Aviation Capital announced a definitive agreement with Sumitomo Corporation, Apollo and Brookfield to acquire Air Lease Corporation through a newly established entity, Sumisho Air Lease Corporation (Ireland) DAC.

The landmark agreement, which is due to close in the first half of 2026, will see the company renamed as Sumisho Air Lease Corporation.

Its order book is expected to transfer to SMBC Aviation Capital as part of the transaction, with the latter to act as servicer to the portfolio.

Leading SMBC Aviation Capital in the deal, valued at $7.4bn, is Peter Barrett, a veteran of the aircraft leasing industry who has been its chief executive for 21 years.

Barrett joins me over a video call from Budapest, where he is visiting customers. A few days earlier, he was in Vietnam.

These visits are a key part of his role for the company that leases and trades commercial jet aircraft to a diverse global customer base of over 150 airline and investors in more than 50 countries.

The aviation industry has endured a turbulent few years, with shocks including a worldwide pandemic and various unexpected geopolitical events.

How has Dublin-headquartered SMBC Aviation Capital, which currently has a fleet of 989 owned, managed and committed aircraft, adapted its business?

“I’m at this 35 years, so I remember the first Gulf War, the SARS crisis, 9/11 and the financial crisis. [Aviation is] a fantastic industry but given the scope and nature of it, it’s inevitably going to be impacted by events around the world.”

Covid, however, took the entire industry by surprise.

“Nobody, including ourselves, really modelled a world where aviation was shut down for over a year.

“The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the events there mean it’s been a testing period . My philosophy since then has been ‘you can’t predict the future, but you can prepare for different eventualities’.”

Barrett says they are fortunate to be one of the best-capitalised of the big aircraft leasing companies, owned by a Japanese institution with one of the strongest credit ratings in the industry.

Ultimately, he adds, testing times allow for opportunities of growth and a chance to support customers.

“While aviation is cyclical, it is a consistently growing industry. As the world gets wealthier, as middle classes around the world grow, people want to travel.

“A big market for us is Mexico, which has a very strong, growing aviation low-cost market. If you have the choice of spending 36 hours on a bus or two hours on an airplane, if you can afford it you’ll obviously take the airplane and that’s a trend we see around the world.”

This growing appetite for convenient travel means potential for exponential expansion in the coming years.

Their young, predominantly narrow-body fleet has an average age of 5.64 years, which means they’re well equipped to meet customer requirements for modernity.

“It is a truly global business. So a 737 [aircraft] in Shanghai is the same as a 737 in Stockholm and a 737 in Sao Paulo. And that’s not true of most asset classes. Most assets are quite localised and the environment tends to be more fragmented,” Barrett says.

That doesn’t belie the intricacies of the business when it comes to transborder red tape, tax and legal systems as well as the sheer value of the aircraft and the highly complex nature of their systems.

Barrett describes their balance sheets as very large and says the funding cost of capital is an absolute competitive necessity.

“But the airplanes are the same everywhere in the world. And people recognise it as a global industry. So while there is complexity about it, and there are national and border issues, the fundamentals of what you’re trying to achieve in each jurisdiction or each market is fundamentally the same.”

He believes that, culturally, Irish people have an advantage in the business.

“I think people tend to see us as fairly neutral in that we don’t have any colonial past and we’re not a big player economically in the world, relatively speaking,” he says.

“I also think it’s really important that you try and understand and respect people’s cultures. They are different. They will do things differently. I won’t necessarily approach things the same way, but if you try to put yourself a little bit in their shoes, I think that makes a big difference.”

GROWTH

India, he says, has been a particular growth market for the company over recent years. He notes that the statistics there are “jaw-dropping”.

“[India has] 1.5 billion people, a huge continental country, an increasingly growing and mobile middle class, a road and rail network that is not up to the [job] of transport and moving people around the way that we need for a vibrant economy.

“So aviation has grown significantly. We’ve two very large customers there, Air India and IndiGo, the two biggest airlines in India.”

Colombia is another key area for the company, with an important customer in its national airline, Avianca.

“It’s just a very mountainous country. Building roads and railways is very difficult. So air travel is much more pragmatic,” he says.

Barrett is passionate about the business and firmly believes aviation is a force for good in both developed and developing economies.

“It drives economic activity. It supports businesses finding new customers and new markets. It supports tourism.

“I was in Vietnam meeting with the airlines there. They were very focused, because of the growth in manufacturing there over the last number of years, on cargo.”

While developing markets are full of promise, Barrett also emphasises the importance of their established customer base.

“Markets like North America and, indeed, Europe. While these are mature markets, they do need to replace older aircraft. Also, air travel is still growing there.”

SUSTAINABILITY

One aspect of the business increasingly under the spotlight is the need for increased industry-wide sustainability.

Barrett recognises the difficulties inherent in that change.

“Decarbonisation of aviation is going to be very difficult. It’s going to take a lot of time, it’s going to take a lot of effort and it’s going to be expensive. The most impactful thing we are doing today is helping customers replace less fuel-efficient aircraft [with] more fuelefficient aircraft, and that reduces the carbon footprint.

“Those numbers on an individual aircraft might be 10, 15 or 20 per cent. When you add all that up across lots of airplanes, it’s a meaningful number.”

The client Barrett is meeting in Budapest is getting their 250th aircraft. It’s brand new and considered one of the most per-seat efficient aircraft in the world.

“So you are talking about cycles of technology change here. There’s not going to be a 250-seater batterypowered aircraft in production today or tomorrow, and it probably won’t be for many decades to come. But there will be new-technology aircraft, probably towards the end of the next decade, and they will be even more efficient.”

As an industry there are aspects that they can change to reduce the carbon footprint, Barrett says, specifically around sustainable aviation fuel, operational efficiencies and air traffic control.

SMBC Aviation Capital has, in conjunction with Trinity College Dublin, opened a research facility which is looking at the processes for making sustainable aviation fuel.

“It is fantastic. In the overall scheme of things it’s relatively small, yeah, but I’m a passionate believer in an industry that does a lot of good in the world.

ANTICIPATING THE MARKET

While the financial markets might be key, Barrett says a prudent liability strategy is critical to success.

“We look at consumer demand and consumer trends. Post-Covid we see some evidence that consumers have reprioritised travel in their hierarchy of needs.”

They also closely track the manufacturers’ activity both in long-term strategy and short-term production.

With airframe and engine manufacturers all experiencing a variety of challenges over the last decade, it’s imperative to stay close to that side of the market too.

“I’m a reasonably avid reader of current affairs and the paper I open every morning is Financial Times. And every article you read is probably relevant to our industry, be it oil prices, the cost of money, geopolitics, technology, social trends and social behaviours. You need to keep a very broad radar and look at lots of different things to really manage the business.”

LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY

Barrett’s leadership philosophy is straightforward.

“Leadership is a combination of things. Authenticity is very important, having a clear sense of where you’re going and being guided by your own lights. You can’t be flip-flopping on strategy, tactics or style.

“All of us as leaders have strengths and weaknesses. I’m very conscious of that. But being consistent and having an element of predictability and dependability is important for all your counterparts, be that your colleagues, customers or stakeholders.”

Communication, Barrett adds, is really important and one of the hardest things to get right in any job.

The chief executive advocates “playing the long game” as critically important in his industry.

“We buy 25-year assets, we write 12-year leases. You need to think about your business and what you’re doing as a leader, not in the context of today or tomorrow or next week, although obviously the short term is something you need to deal with. You always need to keep an eye on the long game. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.”

Barrett credits this view as one of the strengths of their business and one of the reasons for the excellent partnership with their Japanese shareholders, who tend towards a long-term view.

Predictably, Barrett’s job entails an inordinate amount of travel.

“It’s an unusual life. I accept that. As you get older, it gets frankly more demanding physically. But I still enjoy it. And look, it’s a great pleasure and, indeed, privilege to travel around the world and meet really interesting people. I’m exceptionally fortunate in life. I would recommend it to anybody.”",https://businessplus.ie/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/flying-high-LI.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 15:57:42.188599
,,2026-01-11 15:04:42+00:00,Ahram Online,Surge in Qatari investment - Egypt - Al-Ahram Weekly,Not Available,,,,,https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/560060.aspx,"Qatar announced in 2025 that it would dedicate a $7.5 billion investment package to Egypt, and in late 2025 Qatari investments in Egypt totalled around $3.2 billion across 266 companies.
Abdallah explained that escalating concerns resulting from political tensions have pushed investments towards partnerships with governments, a trend reflected in Gulf investments, including Qatari investments in the Al-Alam Al-Roum deal in Egypt.
Abdallah noted that Egypt offers attractive incentives for foreign investment, from which Qatari investments also benefit, given the Egyptian market’s high profitability rates and lower tax levels compared to Europe and North America.
Adel said that the recent Qatari investments are the result of important relations and partnerships that strengthen ties between Egypt and Qatar at the political, strategic, economic, commercial, and industrial levels.
This makes real-estate investment, including tourism-related real estate, a store of value for individuals, companies, and states alike, Adel said.","After a $29.7 billion real-estate and tourism deal on the North Coast and a $200 million agreement to produce sustainable aviation fuel in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone), Qatar has finalised an agreement to supply Egypt with liquefied natural gas (LNG) during the summer months.

This is the most recent form of cooperation between the two countries after a year in which many important agreements were signed. Qatar announced in 2025 that it would dedicate a $7.5 billion investment package to Egypt, and in late 2025 Qatari investments in Egypt totalled around $3.2 billion across 266 companies.

Recent months have witnessed a noticeable strengthening of economic relations between Egypt and the Gulf states, particularly Qatar, which has begun diversifying its investment destinations across various countries worldwide, Farag Abdallah, an economist and member of the Egyptian Association for Political Economy, told Al-Ahram Weekly.

He noted that the global economy is experiencing imbalances due to rapid political developments, which in turn affect the movement of capital seeking to minimise risks and contribute to reshaping the global investment landscape.

Abdallah explained that escalating concerns resulting from political tensions have pushed investments towards partnerships with governments, a trend reflected in Gulf investments, including Qatari investments in the Al-Alam Al-Roum deal in Egypt.

In December 2025, Egypt received $3.5 billion from Qatari Diar, the real-estate arm of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, as part of an investment agreement for the development and expansion of the Samla and Al-Alam Al-Roum Project on the northwestern coast of Matrouh governorate, with total investments amounting to $29.7 billion.

Of this sum, Egypt received $3.2 billion representing the value of the land last week.

Qatar has recently been moving towards diversifying its investment portfolio, even if returns are lower than oil revenues, in anticipation of potential changes in the global economic system, Abdallah said. This has prompted it to invest in assets and minerals instead of retaining its oil revenues in US and European banks.

Abdallah said that Qatar had injected around $55 billion of investments into Turkey following the earthquake that struck the country a year and a half ago in an example of its trend to invest in assets. He noted that Egypt’s stable political and economic environment makes it well positioned to attract further investments.

Abdallah noted that Egypt offers attractive incentives for foreign investment, from which Qatari investments also benefit, given the Egyptian market’s high profitability rates and lower tax levels compared to Europe and North America.

He highlighted Egypt’s role in establishing the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum and transforming it into an intergovernmental organisation headquartered in Cairo, a development that has strengthened Egypt’s position as a gas trading hub and contributed to attracting major deals in gas liquefaction and re-export.

Qatar Energy announced that it will supply Egypt with up to 24 shipments of LNG during the summer of 2026, under an agreement signed between the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) and the Qatari company.

The agreement comes as a continuation of the success of bilateral cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the supply of LNG.

Karim Adel, president of the Al-Adl Centre for Economic and Strategic Studies, a think tank, told the Weekly that Egypt has a strong track record in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), relying on a system of tax exemptions, the availability of advanced basic and technological infrastructure, and efforts to remove obstacles facing the establishment of diverse business activities.

He explained that Egypt has become both a regional and a global hub due to its strength in key sectors, most notably agriculture and energy, supported by its unique geographical location and its role as the main gateway for business and investment in Africa.

Adel said that the recent Qatari investments are the result of important relations and partnerships that strengthen ties between Egypt and Qatar at the political, strategic, economic, commercial, and industrial levels.

He expects the coming period to see the implementation of a number of joint projects between the two sides, particularly in infrastructure development, energy, and transport, alongside the review of opportunities related to infrastructure and technology development.

Egypt and Qatar aim to achieve sustainable development and build a smart environment by focusing on mechanisms to realise sustainability and protect the environment in the light of global environmental challenges, he added.

The contribution of real-estate activities to Egypt’s economy has increased over recent years, reaching around 20 per cent of GDP. This makes real-estate investment, including tourism-related real estate, a store of value for individuals, companies, and states alike, Adel said.

He said that maximising the economic returns from these investments depends on the speed with which agreed-upon real estate, tourism, and hotel projects can be implemented, given their role as a key driver for various economic sectors in Egypt, including transport and logistics, communications and technology, construction, tourism, and housing.",https://english.ahram.org.eg/Media/News/2026/1/11/41_2026-639037467040427814-42.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 10:57:49.220964

Speaking at the Vibrant Gujarat Regional Conference in Rajkot on Sunday (January 11), Ambani told the conference about Reliance’s plans to spread the investment amount across 5 key commitments that have been listed as follows.

Investment and employment creation

Ambani hailed Reliance as the biggest private investor in Gujarat, having invested over ₹3.5 lakh crore in the state over the past five years. Ambani laid out employment creation as the company’s first commitment to the state through its ongoing and upcoming projects.

“We will double our precious investment of ₹3.5 lakh crore to ₹7 lakh crore over the next five years. This will create exponential employment, livelihoods, and prosperity for every Gujarati and every Indian,” he said at the conference. “For Reliance, Gujarat is our body, heart, and soul. We are a Gujarati company,” he added.

Global leadership in green energy

As a part of Reliance’s second commitment to the state, Ambani intends to establish Indian leadership in clean energy and green materials with Gujarat’s Jamnagar at the heart of his plans.

At Jamnagar, Reliance is building the world’s largest integrated clean energy ecosystem which includes manufacturing of solar power, battery energy storage, green hydrogen, green fertilisers, sustainable aviation fuel, maritime fuels, and advanced materials.

“Jamnagar, once the world’s largest exporter of hydrocarbon fuels, will in the coming years become India’s largest exporter of green energy and green materials,” Ambani proclaimed at the event.

Powering India’s growth story

Promising to produce a large amount of electric energy, Ambani said that Reliance’s multi-gigawatt, utility-scale solar project, among the largest in the world, will deliver round-the-clock clean power through advanced storage and modern grid integration aimed at powering India’s growth story.

Artificial intelligence

The fourth commitment is to make Gujarat India’s artificial intelligence pioneer. Speaking at the conference that was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Ambani said Jio is building India’s largest AI-ready data centre in Jamnagar with the goal of making AI affordable and accessible to every Indian.

“Jio will launch India’s first people-centric AI platform, built in India for India and the world. It will enable every citizen, starting from Gujarat, to access AI services in their own language, on their own devices, every day, making them more efficient and productive,” he declared.

Preparing for 2036 Olympics

Reliance’s fifth commitment engages the company in a partnership with the Gujarat government’s Olympic ambitions and social initiatives. At the conference, Ambani said the Reliance Foundation fully supports the Prime Minister’s vision of bringing the 2036 Olympic Games to Ahmedabad.

“As part of this effort, Reliance will partner with the Gujarat government to manage the Veer Savarkar Multisports Complex in Naranpura, which will serve as a hub for national and international sporting events and for training future champions,” he said.

Ambani also announced the establishment of a world-class hospital in Jamnagar in the Saurashtra region and the expansion of Reliance’s educational institutions. “The development of Gujarat is central to everything we do,” he added.

Towards the end of his address, Ambani noted the recent changes in the world’s geopolitical order and said that India remained resilient. “The world is changing rapidly and geopolitical developments are creating new challenges and uncertainties.

This appointment marks a key moment in the global push for decarbonisation, with Griffiths bringing his vast industry experience to lead the effort to scale SAF adoption worldwide.

Paul Griffiths at the Forefront of SAF Adoption

As the aviation sector continues to face increasing pressure to tackle its climate impact, SAF is recognised as one of the most viable near-term solutions to reduce flight emissions. SAF has the potential to cut emissions by up to 80%, offering a clear pathway for the aviation industry to meet its ambitious net-zero goals. However, despite its potential, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of the global jet fuel supply. This gap underscores the need for concerted action to accelerate its production and adoption, which Griffiths will now champion through the SMI’s SAF Pathfinder Initiative.

The SAF Pathfinder Initiative, which Griffiths now leads, unites key stakeholders from across the aviation, energy, finance and policy sectors. Its primary focus is on mobilising investment, driving demand and advocating for harmonised global policies that support the production and adoption of SAF. Additionally, the initiative aims to facilitate the necessary infrastructure upgrades and foster collaboration across the supply chain to overcome the production and cost barriers that have hindered SAF’s widespread use.

Dubai Airports’ Proven Commitment to Sustainability

Paul Griffiths’ leadership in this initiative is backed by his strong track record in sustainability. Under his guidance, Dubai Airports has already made significant strides in reducing its environmental impact. The airport operator has achieved Level 4 “Transformation” accreditation from Airports Council International (ACI), a distinction that places Dubai Airports among the top 5% of airports globally for its sustainability efforts. This recognition highlights the effectiveness of Griffiths’ leadership in promoting sustainability and fostering collaborations with partners.

Dubai Airports has also been at the forefront of several initiatives to reduce emissions, including the implementation of biodiesel-powered ground fleets and the development of green infrastructure projects at both Dubai International (DXB) and Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International (DWC). These initiatives align with the broader goals of the SAF Pathfinder Initiative, reinforcing Griffiths’ commitment to driving decarbonisation within the aviation sector.

Accelerating Global SAF Adoption

With the aviation industry’s 2050 net-zero target approaching, the need to scale up SAF production and usage has never been more urgent. Griffiths, alongside the SMI, is focused on creating the necessary conditions for SAF to play a central role in decarbonising aviation. The SAF Pathfinder Initiative will seek to unlock investment, overcome regulatory barriers and build a strong global network of stakeholders committed to SAF adoption.

Jennifer Jordan-Saifi, CEO of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, emphasised the importance of SAF as a catalyst for decarbonisation not only within aviation but also for driving the global expansion of sustainable technologies and investments. With Griffiths’ proven leadership in the sustainability space, the SMI is poised to make significant strides in accelerating SAF adoption and driving the industry closer to a sustainable future.

As the global aviation sector looks ahead, the appointment of Paul Griffiths to lead the SAF Pathfinder Initiative signals a renewed commitment to sustainable aviation practices. Under his guidance, SAF is set to become a cornerstone of the aviation industry’s journey toward a low-carbon future, contributing to the global fight against climate change while helping to ensure the continued growth and success of the aviation sector.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sustainable-Aviation.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 10:58:00.328929

Under the partnership, NCC Bank will reduce emissions linked to its shipments by 30 per cent by using the GoGreen Plus service, which targets Scope 3 emissions.
The service uses an “insetting” approach that allows DHL to replace fossil fuels with Sustainable Aviation Fuel across its global network.
Md Miarul Haque, managing director of DHL Express Bangladesh, said: “We are thrilled to welcome NCC Bank to our GoGreen Plus initiative.

Under the partnership, NCC Bank will reduce emissions linked to its shipments by 30 per cent by using the GoGreen Plus service, which targets Scope 3 emissions. These are indirect emissions generated across a company’s value chain, including transportation and distribution.

The service uses an “insetting” approach that allows DHL to replace fossil fuels with Sustainable Aviation Fuel across its global network. Through a book-and-claim system, the resulting environmental benefits are allocated to customers investing in the solution, even if their individual shipments are not physically transported using aircraft powered by sustainable fuel.

GoGreen Plus is currently the only solution in the global express logistics sector that enables customers to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel to reduce emissions associated with their shipments.

Md Miarul Haque, managing director of DHL Express Bangladesh, said:

“We are thrilled to welcome NCC Bank to our GoGreen Plus initiative. By adopting sustainable aviation fuel, NCC Bank is taking a meaningful step toward reducing the environmental footprint of its shipments. Together, we can accelerate the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel across the air transport industry.”

DHL Express launched the GoGreen Plus service in 2023 to help customers reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from air freight through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The initiative is supported by long-term supply agreements with BP, Neste, Cosmo Energy and the Cathay Group.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is produced from alternative raw materials such as used cooking oil, waste and hydrogen, which have a lower-emission energy profile compared with conventional jet fuel derived from mineral oil.

The GoGreen Plus service supports DHL Group’s commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a focus on decarbonising air transportation, which accounts for the largest share of the group’s carbon footprint.",https://www.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/2026-01/dhl.jpeg,N,,2026-01-11 07:57:49.362856

Emissions do matter, but the way to speed up the transition is to focus on economic outcomes: lower, more stable energy costs and local ownership of our energy assets.

Several solutions focused on transforming our fossil assets to locally owned renewable energy assets will expedite our energy independence and resilience.
Or we can move into the green asset corner, which means local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi.","Moving from fossil assets to green assets will bring local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi.

Hawai‘i is the most petroleum-dependent state in the nation. We rely on oil for about 65% of our electricity and spend billions of dollars annually on it.

This dependence has resulted in high electricity and transportation costs and exposure to supply and price volatility. This vulnerability underscores why clean energy should be framed as a fight for energy independence. Emissions do matter, but the way to speed up the transition is to focus on economic outcomes: lower, more stable energy costs and local ownership of our energy assets.

Political scientist Jessica Green argues that climate politics is really a competition with trillions of dollars at stake. Fossil fuel asset owners are incentivized to delay the transition to protect their investments. Vulnerable asset owners face the consequences of climate change, e.g., property losses and higher insurance costs. Green asset owners are stakeholders whose assets gain value as the transition accelerates. We must consider these dynamics to accelerate progress.

Hawaiʻi already has many green asset owners. We have thousands of households with rooftop solar benefiting from reduced energy costs, owners of over 40,000 EVs on our roads converting gas to local electricity spending, and electric grids with 36% to 50% renewable energy. Importantly, electricians, installers, auditors, mechanics, engineers, and operators are also asset owners.

Our main fossil asset owner is Par Pacific, through its refinery and fuel distribution network. But it is already evolving, with part of the Kapolei refinery being converted to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel for Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines in 2026. This is what a practical transition looks like and an example of how fossil fuel assets can be repurposed while protecting our workforce and economic capacity and increasing energy independence.

Clearly, much more must be done to achieve our energy future. Several solutions focused on transforming our fossil assets to locally owned renewable energy assets will expedite our energy independence and resilience. Each solution must perform its specific job well, prevent undesired consequences, and work with others so that the transition becomes self-reinforcing.

Here are a few priorities for our government and business leaders to consider in 2026:

Priority 1: Standardize and streamline permitting and modernize interconnection. This will speed up deployment of common projects (e.g., rooftop solar, EV chargers, batteries), prevent yearslong project delays for large grid-scale projects, and enable innovation in clean, firm power.

Priority 2: Scale green loans, rebates, and tax credits for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean transportation. Incentivize the transition with close attention to our low- and moderate-income households and small businesses.

Priority 3: Accelerate fleet electrification by deploying EV charging infrastructure and basing procurement on total cost of ownership, not just purchase price. This will ensure that our transportation goals are met and build general momentum for the transformation of our ground transportation system.

Priority 4: Fund workforce development programs to avoid worker capacity bottlenecks in clean tech, create career opportunities for our youth, and build economic resilience.

Priority 5: Create a carbon dividend program using our barrel tax. This would direct revenue to households, with additional support to those most exposed to energy price increases. This would protect households, provide businesses with certainty, and encourage investment in energy efficiency and clean transportation.

Priority 6: Publish a quarterly scorecard (with state, county, and utility inputs) to track progress on relevant metrics, e.g., rebate utilization, permit processing times, interconnection queue metrics, fleet and charger deployment, and household energy and fuel cost index.

Many of these changes can leverage federal grants, bonds and service-based delivery arrangements that don’t require upfront capital. Households and businesses can use PACE financing, solar leases, and community solar to convert capital expenditures into monthly energy and transportation costs at or below what they already pay.

We have a choice: the fossil asset corner, which means reliance on energy imports and vulnerability. Or we can move into the green asset corner, which means local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi. The choice is clear.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2022/02/25135544/east-maui-windmills-renewable-energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 10:58:06.095040

Právě tento stát patří mezi přední producenty medu v Americe. Každoročně vyprodukoval zhruba 18 milionů kilogramů a přinesl včelařům zisk téměř 67 milionů dolarů (1,4 miliardy Kč).

Ráj se ovšem pomalu mění. Přirozené prostředí, na kterém život včel závisí, nahrazují plochy s kukuřicí a sójou. V Severní Dakotě se produkce kukuřice od přelomu století čtyřnásobně zvýšila na 16,5 milionu akrů (6,7 milionu hektarů). „Dříve jsme z jednoho úlu získávali 64 kilogramů medu,“ říká Miller. Jeho včelstvo však slábne, letos získal v průměru 15 kilogramů.

Za razantním úbytkem českého medu stojí i novodobí „bio-chovatelé“, říká včelař

Podle předběžné analýzy organizace Apiary Inspectors of America (AIA) v loňském roce američtí včelaři přišli o více než polovinu svých včelstev. „Naše odhady naznačují, že včelařské provozy v USA ztratily během sezony 2024–25 více včelstev než v kterémkoli jiném roce v historii záznamů,“ uvedla organizace.

Poptávka po biopalivech

Kromě nemocí a používání pesticidů experti označují za problematickou aktuální poptávku po biopalivech. Jejich výroba z kukuřice a sóji totiž vede k přeměně přírodních travnatých ploch na monokultury, což ohrožuje včelí populace a narušuje rovnováhu místních ekosystémů, napsala agentura Bloomberg.

V loňském roce vzrostla americká výrobní kapacita biopaliv z 5 000 na 30 000 barelů denně. Spotřeba biopaliv, včetně těch leteckých, se pravděpodobně bude zvyšovat, a to kvůli rostoucí poptávce po letecké dopravě, poklesu používání tradičních fosilních paliv a také politickým iniciativám a regulacím.

Udržitelné létání je chiméra. Alternativy paliv klimatu nepomohou, říká studie

Jednou z nich je iniciativa Joe Bidena z roku 2021, která měla za cíl podpořit výrobu udržitelných leteckých paliv (SAF) ve Spojených státech a která nabídla producentům biopaliv daňové úlevy na podporu produkce.

Podle analýzy vědeckého pracovníka Bradena Limba z Colorado State University je pro splnění cílů SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) do roku 2050 potřeba o 50 procent více orné půdy pro kukuřici a sóju.

„Maximální množství půdy, které jsme v jednom roce přeměnili na ornou půdu, což je přibližně 0,73 hektarů, by muselo být zčtyřnásobeno každý rok po dobu příštích 30 let,“ řekl Limb. Podle něj sója a kukuřice nejsou optimálním řešením. Limb doporučuje zaměřit se na jiné plodiny, jako je čirok nebo ozdobnice.

Letecké společnosti zkoumají různé možnosti ke snížení emisí, včetně SAF. Průmysl se zavázal k používání biopaliv a Mezinárodní organizace pro civilní letectví (ICL) přijala ambiciózní cíl dosáhnout nulových čistých emisí uhlíku do roku 2050, což by vyžadovalo značné vstupy biopaliv.

Známe recept na snížení emisí. Létejte pomaleji, radí univerzitní studie

„Obávám se, že k udržitelným leteckým palivům nepřipojíme environmentální etiku. Pokud bychom správně připojili environmentální měřítka a výsledky k platbám za daňové úlevy, mohli bychom pohnout věcí na podporu zemědělců při přijetí praktik, které zvýší rozmanitost krajiny,“ zmínila Katrina Klettová, doktorandka na minnesotské univerzitě, která studuje změny ve využívání půdy a zdraví včel medonosných.

Někteří odborníci nicméně upozorňují, že produkce udržitelných leteckých paliv může být příliš drahá. Agentura Bloomberg například zmínila, že v roce 2023 došlo ke snížení daňových úlev pro výrobce SAF v důsledku toho může být biopalivo ve srovnání s běžným leteckým palivem méně konkurenceschopné, uzavřel Bloomberg.",https://1gr.cz/tempimg/fb/2026/1/JAD75ed27811f_profimedia_0697912629.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 03:56:44.911115

The aviation industry is in the middle of an uncomfortable transition. Airlines need more efficient engines to survive brutal fuel costs and carbon regulations, while passengers still expect cheap tickets and on-time flights. Engine OEMs sit squarely in the crosshairs of this tension. MTU Aero Engines has quietly positioned itself as one of the most important enablers of this new era: a specialist in high-efficiency engine modules, lifecycle services, and next-generation propulsion research that airlines and airframers increasingly cannot ignore.

Unlike headline-grabbing aircraft manufacturers, MTU Aero Engines focuses on what really keeps jets in the air: high-pressure compressors, low-pressure turbines, turbine center frames, and the complex maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) ecosystem around them. Its technology is inside some of the most widely used engines on the planet, particularly in the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan (GTF) family. As the aviation sector scrambles to cut emissions while ramping back to—and beyond—pre-pandemic traffic levels, MTU Aero Engines has become a leverage point for efficiency, reliability, and sustainability.

Inside the Flagship: MTU Aero Engines

MTU Aero Engines is not a single consumer-facing product but an integrated portfolio of propulsion technologies and services that underpin modern fleets. Its core proposition: design and manufacture mission-critical modules for commercial and military engines, then stay embedded throughout the lifecycle with high-value MRO offerings and digital services. That combination of hardware and recurring-services revenue is what makes MTU Aero Engines strategically important—and hard to dislodge.

On the hardware side, MTU Aero Engines has three standout pillars:

1. Geared Turbofan Leadership

MTU is a key partner in Pratt & Whitneys PW1000G geared turbofan family, used on aircraft like the Airbus A320neo, A220, and Embraer E-Jets E2. In this program, MTU Aero Engines is responsible for major components including the high-speed low-pressure turbine and parts of the high-pressure compressor, as well as being a risk- and revenue-sharing partner.

The GTF architecture uses a reduction gearbox between the fan and the low-pressure turbine. This allows each section to spin at its optimal speed, delivering:

Double-digit reductions in fuel burn compared with previous-generation engines.

Significantly lower noise footprints, crucial for airport community acceptance.

Substantial CO2 and NOx emissions reductions.

MTU Aero Engines engineering and manufacturing capabilities are woven into the most efficiency-critical parts of this system. When airlines choose GTF-powered aircraft for better economics and environmental performance, MTU Aero Engines indirectly wins.

2. High-Pressure Compressors and Turbines

Across multiple engine families from partners like Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, and Rolls-Royce, MTU Aero Engines contributes high-pressure compressor (HPC) and turbine modules. These components operate at extreme temperatures and pressures, and incremental gains in efficiency directly translate into lower fuel burn.

Key technical areas where MTU Aero Engines differentiates:

Advanced materials and cooling to withstand rising turbine inlet temperatures as OEMs chase better thermodynamic efficiency.

Aerodynamic optimization of compressor stages using high-fidelity simulations and digital twin concepts.

Lightweight design balancing durability and lifecycle cost with weight savings that airlines can monetize on every flight.

3. Military Propulsion and European Sovereignty

On the defense side, MTU Aero Engines is a significant player in European engine programs, including roles in the Eurofighter Typhoon and future fighter systems. This provides not just revenue diversification but also positions the company as a key asset in Europes push for technological sovereignty in defense and aerospace.

Lifecycle and MRO as a Strategic Product

In aviation, the engine is sold once but serviced for decades. MTU Aero Engines MRO network is effectively a product of its own: a bundled offering of overhaul, repair, parts management, and data-driven optimization for airlines and lessors.

Highlights include:

Global MRO footprint for narrowbody and regional jet engines, including GTF, V2500, CF34, and others.

Predictive maintenance based on engine health monitoring, using sensor data and analytics to reduce unplanned downtime.

Customized service packages that let airlines pay per flight hour, shifting capex to opex and reducing financial risk.

In a market where reliability issues and groundings can devastate airline schedules and P&L, this lifecycle capability is a core part of MTU Aero Engines value proposition.

Betting on Sustainable Aviation

Crucially, MTU Aero Engines is not just optimizing todays kerosene-based engines. The company is investing in:

SAF compatibility and combustion technologies that work with sustainable aviation fuel blends.

Water-Enhanced Turbofan (WET) concepts, aimed at further cutting fuel burn and emissions by recovering waste heat and using water injection.

Hydrogen-ready and hybrid-electrical studies in cooperation with European partners, exploring how future engines can radically reduce climate impact.

This pipeline matters because airlines and regulators are signaling that incremental efficiency gains wont be enough in the 2030s and 2040s. MTU Aero Engines long-game here is to stay indispensable as propulsion architectures evolve.

Market Rivals: MTU Aktie vs. The Competition

MTU Aero Engines operates in a tightly held club. In commercial and military jet engines, a handful of giants dominate: General Electric, Rolls-Royce, and Pratt & Whitney (Raytheon Technologies) are the best-known names. But MTU has carved out a role as a specialized partner and module supplier that competes and cooperates with these players simultaneously.

Compared directly to General Electrics LEAP program (through CFM International, the joint venture of GE Aerospace and Safran), MTU Aero Engines takes a different stance in the value chain. LEAP is a full engine family powering aircraft like the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX. GE-Safran fully control the engine product, brand, and aftermarket.

By contrast, MTU Aero Engines participates as a major risk- and revenue-sharing partner in the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM and related PW1000G variants rather than owning a standalone engine franchise. The trade-off:

Lower program control than GE over the entire engine.

Lower capital intensity and more diversified exposure across different platforms and OEM partners.

Strong MRO leverage thanks to its module expertise and joint ventures.

On the narrowbody workhorse battlefield, LEAP and the PW1000G family are direct rivals. Engine selection campaigns at Airbus and Boeing become indirect competitive arenas for MTU Aero Engines versus CFM, even if MTU logos are not on the nacelles.

Compared directly to Rolls-Royce Trent engines such as the Trent XWB

Rolls-Royce plays heavily in the widebody segment with its Trent family. The Trent XWB powers the Airbus A350 and has built a strong reputation for efficiency on long-haul routes. Rolls-Royce, however, is more concentrated in widebodies and has faced well-documented earnings volatility due to that segments cyclical nature and pandemic exposure.

MTU Aero Engines exposure is more balanced, with a stronger tilt towards narrowbodies and regional jets—segments that typically recover faster and offer higher frequency usage, which in turn means more predictable MRO revenues. The company also cooperates with Rolls-Royce on some military and industrial programs, again illustrating its hybrid role as both collaborator and competitor in different niches.

Safran and the European industrial ecosystem

Safran, via CFM International, is another direct competitor in the module and MRO space. Compared to Safran, MTU Aero Engines is smaller but more focused. Safran stretches across landing gear, interiors, avionics, and more, while MTU doubles down on propulsion and services.

This specialization lets MTU Aero Engines invest deeply in compressor and turbine technology without diluting R&D over too many product lines. In an era of stricter emissions targets and complex new materials, such focus is strategically valuable.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

MTU Aero Engines doesnt dominate headlines—but it punches above its weight by being in the right places of the propulsion stack.

1. Technology where it really counts

The companys strengths in high-pressure compressors, turbines, and low-pressure turbine modules give it leverage over the single biggest cost line for airlines: fuel. Every fractional percentage of efficiency MTU Aero Engines squeezes out of those stages translates into tangible savings and lower emissions. While full-engine OEMs grab the marketing glory, MTU sits in the value-dense heart of the machine.

2. Risk-sharing rather than winner-takes-all bets

Instead of betting the entire company on one engine family, MTU Aero Engines spreads its exposure as a partner on multiple platforms. That diversification has strategic benefits:

Resilience if one engine type faces technical or regulatory setbacks.

Access to long-term service revenues across different fleets and regions.

Stable relationships with multiple global OEMs instead of dependence on a single prime contractor.

3. Recurring revenue through MRO and digital services

Aircraft engines are one of the most service-intensive components in aviation. MTU Aero Engines MRO infrastructure is a structural advantage: it locks in customers for decades, creates data flywheels (more engines serviced equals better insight into wear patterns and failure modes), and supports incremental product improvements without waiting for full engine redesigns.

As airlines adopt power-by-the-hour models and seek predictable maintenance cost envelopes, MTU Aero Engines ability to bundle hardware, services, and analytics becomes a core differentiator.

4. Future-ready innovation in sustainable propulsion

Aviations climate problem wont be solved by tweaking existing engines alone. MTU Aero Engines work on Water-Enhanced Turbofans, SAF-ready combustion, hydrogen studies, and hybrid-electric concepts positions it not just as a participant in the current generation of engines, but as an enabler of what comes next.

Compared to more diversified conglomerates, the company can aim its R&D laser directly at propulsion, rather than competing internally for capital against non-aviation divisions.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

MTU Aktie (ISIN DE000A0D9PT0) is effectively a liquid proxy on the future of high-efficiency commercial and military propulsion, plus the aviation aftermarket. As of the latest market data available from multiple financial sources, MTU Aero Engines share price reflects a combination of cyclical aviation demand, program-specific headlines (notably around the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan), and long-term bets on sustainable propulsion.

Stock snapshot and performance context

Using real-time data from at least two major financial platforms, the most recent trading information shows MTU Aktie around its current market level with the quoted price and performance based on the last available trading session. Where markets are closed, investors rely on the last close price as the reference point. That price bakes in:

Short-term sentiment around engine reliability issues on specific fleets and how those impact MTUs MRO volumes and warranty exposure.

Medium-term expectations for narrowbody and regional jet recovery, where MTU Aero Engines has strong positioning.

Long-term optimism about the companys role in GTF evolutions, European defense programs, and next-generation sustainable propulsion.

How the product portfolio feeds into valuation

From an investor lens, MTU Aero Engines product and technology footprint translates into several key drivers for MTU Aktie:

Embeddedness in key fleets – participation in major narrowbody platforms via GTF and legacy programs provides a long runway of flight hours and, therefore, service revenue.

MRO as a stabilizer – even during downturns, engines must be maintained. That makes the aftermarket a partial hedge against new-build volatility.

Upside from sustainability – if regulators tighten emissions rules faster than expected, demand for more efficient engines and upgrades accelerates. MTU Aero Engines stands to benefit from that pressure rather than be harmed by it.

Defense diversification – military engine and service programs provide counter-cyclical ballast, smoothing the earnings profile that underpins MTU Aktie.

In other words, when investors buy MTU Aktie, they are not just buying a German industrial name; they are buying into a specific thesis: that propulsion will remain the choke point of aviation efficiency and that MTU Aero Engines will stay at the center of that bottleneck, monetizing both incremental improvements and disruptive shifts.

The bottom line

MTU Aero Engines is not the flashiest brand in aviation, but it is one of the most strategically placed. Its mix of high-value engine modules, deep MRO infrastructure, and credible R&D roadmap for sustainable propulsion gives it a competitive edge against more vertically integrated giants. For airlines, that translates into better fuel economics and lifecycle reliability. For investors in MTU Aktie, it represents a focused, technology-driven way to participate in the next chapters of global aviation.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405041_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 01:57:37.922582

Rising electricity demand, climate imperatives, and shifting global energy markets are converging at a moment when decisions taken today will shape our economic resilience, competitiveness, and energy security for decades to come.

For a country that depends on imported fuels for close to 90 per cent of its energy needs, the global energy landscape is not an abstract concern — it is felt directly in electricity bills, transportation costs, food prices, and the overall cost of living. The challenge therefore is clear: How do we secure reliable, affordable energy today while building a cleaner more sustainable system for tomorrow?

Emerging from a year marked by price volatility, geopolitical shocks, and seismic swings in global market sentiment, Jamaica’s oil and gas sector enters 2026 with cautious optimism, aided by growing confidence in emerging energy-source options and the continued rise in electricity demand.

Internationally, the oil and gas market remains volatile. Geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, and shifting trade policies continue to inject uncertainty into price forecasts. While analysts expect only modest demand growth in 2026, supply dynamics and geopolitical risks mean that price stability is far from guaranteed.

For Jamaica, this volatility matters. Our energy security is tightly linked to global markets, and we are therefore exposed to shocks beyond our control. As the country’s primary petroleum supplier, Petrojam carries a national responsibility to ensure reliable fuel supply, even in turbulent global conditions. At the same time, we are accelerating efforts to reduce carbon intensity and support the country’s long-term transition to cleaner energy.

ENERGY SOLUTIONS TO WATCH IN 2026

Renewable energy is poised to continue its growth as one of the world’s fast-growing energy sources, and Jamaica is firmly aligned with this trend. Solar and wind already play an important role in our electricity mix and further expansion is expected.

Petrojam is pursuing multiple initiatives to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix aligned to the country’s move towards cleaner, more sustainable energy. Petrojam is also playing an enabling role in facilitating the adoption and blending of low-carbon fuels, and helping to create the necessary infrastructure and regulatory alignment to accelerate this transition to cleaner energy.

While not a renewable, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is emerging as a critical transition fuel for Jamaica. It offers lower emissions than heavy fuel oil and diesel, greater price stability, and strong potential for use across electricity generation, manufacturing, and public transportation.

Petrojam is positioning itself to play a key role in LNG supply and distribution, supporting the shift of power generation and industrial users to cleaner fuels. LNG will be a key bridge between today’s petroleum-based system and tomorrow’s low-carbon energy future.

Advanced biofuels derived from sustainable biomass, agricultural residues, and solid waste are also gaining traction globally. These fuels offer real potential to reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors.

Of note is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can significantly lower the carbon footprint of air travel. As a major tourism destination and aviation hub, Jamaica stands to benefit strategically from early engagement in SAF development. Renewable diesel and green methanol for marine transport are also emerging opportunities as the shipping sector moves toward decarbonisation.

EMERGING FRONTIERS: NUCLEAR AND HYDROGEN

Globally, there is renewed interest in nuclear energy, particularly as a reliable, carbon-free base load power source for energy-intensive activities such as data centres supporting artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Advances in small modular reactors (SMRs) are making nuclear more accessible to smaller economies.

In Jamaica, nuclear energy remains at the exploratory stage. Petrojam has been invited to be a part of the International Centre for Environmental and Nuclear Sciences (ICENS) Working Group, which is examining the potential role of nuclear in a low-carbon energy future, including its application in electricity generation and pink hydrogen production (hydrogen generated from the electrolysis of water using nuclear energy).

Nuclear energy offers low operating costs and high reliability once online, delivering large volumes of carbon-free electricity at stable and predictable prices. By reducing exposure to fuel price volatility it has the potential to support economic development and help level the playing field between high- and low-income countries.

Meaningful consideration of nuclear must be balanced and aligned with safety standards, regulatory readiness, waste management, and public acceptance. The objective at this stage is knowledge preparedness and informed national dialogue.

ENERGY SUBSTITUTION: A GRADUAL REALITY

While the global conversation often suggests rapid substitution away from fossil fuels, the reality for small, developing economies is more complex. Infrastructure constraints, financing requirements, and the need for system reliability mean that energy transition must be carefully managed.

For Jamaica, the path forward is not abrupt replacement but strategic diversification — layering renewables, LNG, and emerging fuels alongside existing petroleum supply to ensure reliability, affordability, and resilience.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance is no longer optional; it is increasingly a prerequisite for attracting capital, maintaining regulatory credibility, and building public trust.

In 2026 Petrojam will be further strengthening its ESG framework, with particular focus on reducing our carbon footprint, enhancing transparency, and improving governance systems. As Jamaica explores offshore oil potential, a strong ESG foundation will be essential to guide responsible development, environmental protection, and stakeholder confidence.

JAMAICA’S REGIONAL ROLE

Beyond domestic supply, Petrojam continues to support regional energy resilience through trade. By refining and supplying high-quality fuels to Caricom member states, we contribute to economic stability and regional integration. 2026 presents an opportunity to further define Jamaica’s role as a regional energy hub- leveraging our infrastructure, logistics capability, and strategic location to support neighbouring economies.

Jamaica’s energy future will be determined not only by technology choices, but by the value we deliver, the depth of our sustainability efforts, and the speed at which we adapt. The energy transition is not just an environmental imperative — it is an economic strategy, a competitiveness issue, and a national resilience priority.

Petrojam stands at the centre of this transition, repositioning to become Jamaica’s multi-energy innovator supporting renewables, advancing LNG, enabling biofuels and SAF, and preparing for emerging technologies. By acting early, building digital and operational resilience, forging strategic alliances, and staying ahead of global energy trends, Jamaica can secure a future that is cleaner, more affordable, and more resilient.

The decisions we take in 2026 will shape our energy security for a generation. If we get them right, Jamaica will not only meet its energy needs but will lead in building a modern, sustainable energy system for the Caribbean.",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/jamaicaobserver/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/01/image_1-193-1024x576.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 00:56:37.048948

Climeworks: Direct Air Capture Pioneer Climeworks has become synonymous with direct air capture technology, operating the world’s largest facilities for removing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere.
2.Carbon Engineering: Synthetic Fuels from Air Carbon Engineering pursues direct air capture with a focus on creating useful products rather than just storing carbon underground.
The process resembles industrial-scale fermentation where specialized bacteria metabolize carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from steel mills or chemical plants.
Heirloom Carbon: Enhanced Mineral Weathering Heirloom Carbon Technologies accelerates mineral weathering, a natural process where rocks absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide over geological timescales.","The race to remove carbon from our atmosphere has evolved from theoretical discussions into a high-stakes technological competition. As the world acknowledges that reducing emissions alone will not solve climate change, carbon capture has become essential infrastructure for a sustainable future. These ten startups represent the cutting edge of technologies designed to either prevent industrial emissions from reaching the atmosphere or remove carbon dioxide that is already there.

Understanding carbon capture requires recognizing it encompasses multiple approaches. Point-source capture attaches to industrial facilities like cement plants or steel mills where emissions are concentrated. Direct air capture extracts carbon dioxide from ambient air where it exists at just over four hundred parts per million. Other methods accelerate natural mineralization processes or use biological systems to sequester carbon. Each approach has distinct advantages regarding cost, energy requirements, storage permanence, and scalability.

1. Climeworks: Direct Air Capture Pioneer

Climeworks has become synonymous with direct air capture technology, operating the world’s largest facilities for removing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The Swiss company’s technology uses large fans to draw air through filters containing materials that selectively bind with carbon dioxide molecules. Once saturated, the system heats these filters to release concentrated carbon dioxide for storage or utilization.

The company’s Orca and Mammoth facilities in Iceland, developed in partnership with Carbfix, represent the state of the art in permanent carbon removal. They capture carbon dioxide from the air and inject it deep underground into basalt rock formations where it mineralizes into solid carbonate within a few years. This permanence addresses a critical challenge in carbon removal by ensuring captured carbon cannot leak back into the atmosphere.

Climeworks has attracted major corporate customers including Microsoft, Stripe, and Shopify who purchase carbon removal credits. While costs remain high, the company has demonstrated a clear pathway for price reductions as production scales, similar to how solar panel costs declined dramatically over decades of manufacturing improvements.

2.Carbon Engineering: Synthetic Fuels from Air

Carbon Engineering pursues direct air capture with a focus on creating useful products rather than just storing carbon underground. The Canadian company, backed by investors including Bill Gates and Occidental Petroleum, captures atmospheric carbon dioxide and combines it with hydrogen to create synthetic liquid fuels suitable for vehicles and aircraft.

This approach addresses aviation’s unique challenge. Unlike automobiles that can transition to batteries, aircraft require energy-dense liquid fuels for long-distance flight. Carbon Engineering’s fuels are essentially carbon-neutral because emissions from burning them equal the carbon captured from air to make them, creating a closed loop rather than adding new atmospheric carbon.

The company’s first commercial-scale facility in Texas aims to demonstrate that synthetic fuels can compete economically with conventional petroleum. This project represents a crucial test of whether direct air capture can move beyond niche applications into mainstream energy markets.

3. Carbfix: Permanent Mineralization Storage

Carbfix accelerates a natural geological process that ordinarily takes thousands of years. The Icelandic company injects carbon dioxide dissolved in water deep underground into basalt rock formations where it reacts with minerals to form stable carbonates. Essentially, they convert gaseous pollution into permanent stone.

The elegance of this approach lies in its security. Once mineralized, carbon cannot leak back regardless of surface conditions, unlike storage in porous reservoirs where gas might escape through geological faults. The transformation is chemical and permanent, requiring extreme heat to reverse.

While Carbfix benefits from Iceland’s unique geology and abundant geothermal energy, the company works to demonstrate that similar basalt formations exist worldwide. Partnerships with Climeworks and industrial emitters showcase the technology’s versatility for both air-captured and point-source carbon.

4. Charm Industrial: Agricultural Waste to Carbon Storage

Charm Industrial recognized that agricultural waste represents carbon recently pulled from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Rather than letting crop residues decompose and release this carbon, Charm converts them into stable bio-oil through pyrolysis, then permanently stores this liquid underground.

The company collects agricultural residues like corn stalks and forest thinnings, heats them in low-oxygen environments, and produces carbon-rich bio-oil suitable for geological storage. This approach addresses multiple challenges simultaneously by providing waste management solutions for farmers while creating carbon removal revenue streams.

Charm’s distributed model uses mobile pyrolysis units transported to biomass sources, avoiding expensive centralized infrastructure and transportation emissions. The company has delivered carbon removal credits to corporate buyers and continues expanding across agricultural regions.

5. LanzaTech: Microbes Transform Industrial Emissions

LanzaTech developed a biological carbon capture approach using engineered microorganisms that consume carbon-rich industrial waste gases and convert them into valuable chemicals and fuels. The process resembles industrial-scale fermentation where specialized bacteria metabolize carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from steel mills or chemical plants.

The company captures gases that would otherwise be flared or vented, flowing them through bioreactors containing proprietary bacteria that produce ethanol and other chemicals. This ethanol becomes fuel or building blocks for plastics, cosmetics, and textiles. Major brands including Zara and Lululemon have incorporated LanzaTech materials into their products.

With commercial facilities operating across China, India, and Belgium, LanzaTech has proven that captured industrial carbon can genuinely compete with virgin fossil resources in global supply chains while generating economic value beyond environmental benefits.

6. Heirloom Carbon: Enhanced Mineral Weathering

Heirloom Carbon Technologies accelerates mineral weathering, a natural process where rocks absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide over geological timescales. The company speeds this from thousands of years to days using engineered limestone materials optimized for carbon uptake.

The process crushes limestone into fine powder spread across trays exposed to air. High surface area enables rapid carbon dioxide absorption. Once saturated, Heirloom heats the material using renewable energy to release concentrated carbon dioxide for storage while regenerating the limestone for reuse.

By working with abundant, well-understood materials already produced at massive scales for construction and agriculture, Heirloom taps into existing supply chains rather than building entirely new industrial ecosystems. The company has demonstrated its technology in California and attracted significant climate investment.

7. Verdox: Electrochemical Carbon Capture

Emerging from Massachusetts Institute of Technology research, Verdox developed an electrochemical approach that dramatically reduces energy requirements compared to conventional thermal processes. Instead of using heat to release captured carbon dioxide, the technology uses electricity to switch specialized materials between carbon-absorbing and carbon-releasing states.

The company’s capture cells contain electrode materials that bind carbon dioxide when voltage flows in one direction and release it when reversed. This electrochemical swing requires significantly less energy than heating materials to high temperatures and runs on renewable electricity rather than requiring heat sources.

Verdox targets industrial facilities with concentrated carbon dioxide streams in exhaust gases, focusing initially on cement plants, steel mills, and other heavy industrial sources difficult to decarbonize through other means. The company has raised substantial funding and works toward commercial-scale demonstration projects.

8. CarbonCure Technologies: Carbon-Storing Concrete

CarbonCure developed an elegantly simple approach by injecting carbon dioxide into concrete during mixing. The carbon reacts with calcium in cement to form calcium carbonate minerals that permanently embed in the concrete while improving compressive strength.

This addresses a crucial challenge since concrete production generates roughly eight percent of global emissions yet remains essential for construction. CarbonCure enables concrete producers to reduce cement content while simultaneously storing captured carbon dioxide. The mineralized carbon becomes part of building structures for their entire lifespan.

The technology retrofits onto existing concrete mixing equipment with minimal workflow changes, enabling rapid adoption across hundreds of facilities. Major projects by Microsoft and Amazon have incorporated CarbonCure concrete, demonstrating market acceptance for carbon-storing building materials.

9. Running Tide: Ocean-Based Carbon Sequestration

Running Tide enhances natural ocean carbon cycles through systems that deploy biomass into deep waters for long-term sequestration. Founded by commercial fishermen and engineers, the company grows kelp and other fast-growing biomass, then sinks it to ocean depths where extremely slow decomposition rates keep carbon stored for centuries or millennia.

The approach also incorporates alkalinity enhancement using limestone to counteract ocean acidification while enhancing carbon storage potential. Running Tide conducts extensive monitoring using autonomous vessels and sensors to verify carbon sequestration and avoid unintended ecological impacts.

Ocean-based carbon removal faces unique verification challenges since tracking deep ocean carbon is inherently difficult. Running Tide has invested heavily in developing monitoring methodologies that provide confidence to carbon credit buyers while satisfying scientific scrutiny.

10. Twelve: Electrochemical Carbon Conversion

Twelve developed an electrochemical process converting carbon dioxide and water into useful chemicals including ethylene for plastics and jet fuel components. The technology uses renewable electricity to drive chemical reactions that transform captured carbon into products replacing those currently made from fossil fuels.

The company’s reactors employ specialized catalysts and electrode designs to efficiently convert carbon dioxide into target molecules. This represents circular carbon use where the same atoms cycle through the economy multiple times rather than following a one-way path from underground reserves to the atmosphere.

Partnerships with Alaska Airlines for sustainable aviation fuel and consumer goods companies demonstrate that carbon-based products can meet quality standards of conventional fossil-derived materials while offering superior environmental profiles.

The Future of Carbon Capture

These ten companies represent diverse philosophies for addressing the same urgent challenge: removing excess atmospheric carbon dioxide and preventing new emissions. Some focus on permanent geological or mineralized storage, others pursue utilization pathways creating economic value, and still others enhance natural carbon cycling processes.

This diversity reflects reality. No single solution will address the massive scale of climate challenges. We will likely need all these technologies deployed across different contexts where each approach’s particular strengths align with local conditions and requirements. Direct air capture suits locations with abundant renewable energy and suitable geology. Point-source capture fits industries continuing emissions during energy transition. Utilization pathways create economic incentives accelerating deployment.",https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Just-Explore-27.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 07:57:54.153039

Jakarta, HAI SAWIT – Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional atau International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) resmi menyetujui limbah cair sawit sebagai bahan baku bahan bakar pesawat berkelanjutan pada akhir November 2025 lalu.

Keputusan besar ini menempatkan Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) sebagai instrumen kunci mitigasi emisi aviasi global. Indonesia kini memiliki peluang besar menjadi produsen utama bahan bakar pesawat rendah karbon dunia.

Dilansir dari laman Indonesia Palm Oil Strategic Studies (IPOSS), Minggu (11/01/2026), proses pengakuan ini memakan waktu satu tahun melalui pengusulan nilai ambang batas emisi karbon pada dokumen resmi Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Keunggulan Emisi POME

Data teknis menunjukkan keunggulan signifikan limbah cair sawit dalam menekan polusi udara dari sektor penerbangan. Berikut adalah fakta angka hasil perhitungan yang telah disetujui secara internasional:

Nilai emisi POME ditetapkan sebesar 18.1 gCO2e/MJ.

Angka tersebut 79,6 persen lebih rendah daripada emisi avtur fosil konvensional.

POME kini berstatus bahan bakar aviasi rendah karbon bersertifikat internasional.

Pertumbuhan penumpang pesawat global yang diprediksi menembus 8 miliar orang pada 2041 memicu lonjakan emisi luar biasa. Tanpa intervensi bahan bakar hijau, emisi sektor aviasi bisa mencapai 21,2 gigaton karbon dioksida.

Indonesia sendiri memproyeksikan jumlah penumpang mencapai 390 juta orang pada 2037. Kondisi ini menuntut penyesuaian cepat terhadap standar penerbangan berkelanjutan melalui pemanfaatan potensi industri Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) nasional secara masif.

Peran Strategis IPOSS dan Tripatra

Keberhasilan ini merupakan hasil kolaborasi teknis antara pemerintah dengan berbagai pihak pendukung. IPOSS bertindak selaku lembaga pemikir kebijakan sawit yang mengawal perhitungan nilai emisi hingga negosiasi pada tingkat teknis di markas ICAO.

Sementara itu, Tripatra berperan melakukan penghitungan nilai Life Cycle Emissions (LCA) serta menyusun rencana investasi perdana pembuatan SAF berbasis POME. Langkah ini memastikan setiap data teknis memiliki bukti akurat yang dapat diterima dunia.

Persetujuan internasional ini memberikan landasan regulasi kuat bagi implementasi mandatori SAF pada industri penerbangan domestik maupun internasional. Indonesia memiliki modal bahan baku beragam yang sudah diakui secara global saat ini.

Selain POME, bahan baku lain seperti minyak jelantah atau Used Cooking Oil (UCO) serta Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD) menjadi tumpuan. Gabungan potensi ini mampu menyuplai kebutuhan bahan bakar pesawat dalam jumlah besar.

Total potensi suplai mencapai 2 hingga 3 juta kiloliter SAF.

Pemerintah mendorong implementasi mandatori sebesar 5 persen pada tahun 2030.

Maskapai kini lebih mudah mengklaim pengurangan emisi melalui skema CORSIA.

Limbah sawit yang sebelumnya terbuang kini berubah menjadi komoditas sarat devisa bagi negara. Pemanfaatan POME sebagai bahan baku SAF secara hukum internasional kini sudah sah dan memiliki kepastian pasar jangka panjang.

Strategi ini memperkuat posisi Indonesia dalam persaingan energi hijau global di masa depan. Sertifikasi rendah karbon ini sekaligus menepis anggapan negatif mengenai keberlanjutan produk turunan kelapa sawit di mata masyarakat internasional.***

TARAKAN – Dukungan Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan (BPDP) unit di bawah Kementerian Keuangan yang mengelola dana perkebun terhadap sektor hilir, kembali nyata dirasakan di Bumi Benuanta.

Melalui kemitraan strategis, BPDP menyokong penuh gelaran Workshop Pengolahan Minyak dan Limbah Kelapa Sawit bagi UMKM yang dilaksanakan di Ballroom Hotel Lotus Panaya, Jumat (9/1/26).

Kegiatan ini dihadiri jajaran petinggi daerah, termasuk Kepala Dinas Pertanian dan Ketahanan Pangan Kaltara, Ir. Heri Rudiyono, M.Si, serta Kepala Disperindagkop UKM Kaltara, Dr. Hj. Hasriyani, SH., MM, bersama puluhan petani dan pelaku usaha kecil dari berbagai kabupaten/kota.

Ketua Dewan Pimpinan Wilayah (DPW) APKASINDO Kaltara, Muhammad Khoiruddin, menekankan dukungan BPDP adalah momentum emas bagi petani sawit Kaltara untuk berhenti menjadi “penonton” di tanah sendiri.

“Kami di DPW APKASINDO Kaltara melihat bahwa selama ini petani kita terlalu bergantung pada fluktuasi harga TBS (Tandan Buah Segar). Dengan dukungan BPDPKS dalam workshop ini, kita ingin mengubah pola pikir itu. Petani harus mulai melirik potensi hilirisasi. Jangan hanya menjual buah mentah, kita harus mampu mengolahnya menjadi minyak goreng atau produk turunan lainnya dalam skala UMKM,” tegas Khoiruddin.

Ia juga menambahkan Kaltara memiliki potensi CPO dan PKO yang sangat melimpah, namun belum tergarap maksimal oleh tangan-tangan lokal.

“Masalah utama kita adalah teknologi dan pengetahuan. Lewat workshop ini, kami ingin memastikan UMKM di Kaltara punya daya saing. Kita ingin di masa depan, ada merek minyak goreng lokal atau pupuk organik hasil limbah sawit asli produksi petani Kaltara yang beredar di pasar. Ini bukan sekadar pelatihan, ini adalah langkah menuju kedaulatan ekonomi petani sawit,” imbuhnya.

Senada dengan hal tersebut, Sekretaris Jenderal (Sekjen) DPP APKASINDO, Dr. Rino Afrino, ST., MM., C.APO, memberikan wawasan mengenai nilai ekonomi dari limbah yang selama ini terbuang.

“Dunia internasional kini mencari minyak jelantah atau limbah sawit untuk diolah menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat. Jadi, tidak ada yang terbuang. Semua proses dari TBS hingga limbah memiliki peluang ekonomi yang berlipat ganda jika kita menguasai teknologinya,” jelas Dr. Rino.

Workshop yang didukung BPDP ini memiliki sembilan target utama guna memperkuat ekosistem sawit rakyat, di antaranya meningkatkan keterampilan teknis mengolah sawit menjadi produk bernilai tambah seperti kosmetik dan farmasi. Merumuskan pembangunan pabrik pupuk organik skala UMKM dari limbah sawit untuk menekan biaya produksi kebun.

Selain itu, membantu UMKM menciptakan produk inovatif yang sesuai dengan standar keberlanjutan (sustainability) agar mampu menembus pasar internasional.

Melalui sinergi antara BPDP, pemerintah daerah, dan APKASINDO, workshop ini diharapkan mampu menciptakan jejaring kerja yang kuat.

Dengan penguasaan teknologi pengolahan limbah dan minyak, petani sawit Kaltara diharapkan dapat meningkatkan pendapatan mereka sekaligus mendukung posisi Indonesia sebagai pemimpin industri sawit global yang ramah lingkungan.(*)",https://i0.wp.com/www.metrokaltara.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG-20260110-WA0027.jpg?fit=1280%2C960&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-10 21:56:30.018633

Airbus predicts the commercial aircraft services market in the region to grow from $52 billion today to $129 billion by 2043. Additionally, they estimate a need for 999,000 new skilled personnel in Asia, comprising pilots, technicians, and cabin crew.

Boeing’s 2024 Commercial Market Outlook also supports this growth narrative, citing a tripling of air traffic in Southeast Asia by 2043, with a projected fleet expansion to 4,960 jets. They predict an annual passenger air traffic growth rate of 7.2%, which is significantly higher than the global average of 4.7%. This expansion in aviation will create opportunities for many, including the hiring of 234,000 new personnel to support the rising demand for air travel.

Several factors drive this rapid growth in Southeast Asia. The region’s economic landscape is characterized by a combined GDP of approximately $3 trillion, with diverse income levels among ASEAN member countries. As disposable incomes rise, particularly among the burgeoning middle class, there is increasing demand for air travel. This trend is evidenced by strategic market insights that showcase the growth rate of the middle class in Asia outpacing that of Western nations.

Countries like Vietnam and the Philippines are emerging leaders in plane orders. Vietjet has placed significant orders for A330neo aircraft, signaling its expansion into long-haul networks, while Cebu Pacific made headlines with a record-breaking order for 152 Airbus aircraft, cementing its status as a leading low-cost carrier.

The geographical challenges of Southeast Asia, with many nations being archipelagos, further emphasize the necessity of regional air connectivity. Improved airline services offer safer and faster travel options compared to traditional maritime routes, which have historically been associated with high accident rates. The rise of low-cost carriers has also enabled overseas workers to visit their families more frequently, thereby enhancing overall quality of life.

Moreover, sustainable aviation initiatives are beginning to take shape in the region, albeit at a slower pace compared to Europe and North America. Collaborations between Airbus, AirAsia, and local governments aim to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, which could significantly contribute to reducing the aviation industry’s environmental impact.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-10 19:56:38.206090

Adoption of renewable diesel as an immediate solution

This fuel, identified by its distinctive pink color, is formulated for all diesel engines and offers a reduction of up to 90% in net CO2 emissions compared to its fossil version. Repsol thus reaffirms that the decarbonization of transport by means of sustainable liquid fuels is a tangible alternative, especially in a context where 97% of the vehicle fleet in Europe still uses combustion engines.

Phillips 66 sits in the crosshairs of the energy transition. It is big enough to matter in global fuel and chemicals markets, and exposed enough to be disrupted by electrification, efficiency gains, and aggressive climate policy. The company’s namesake product platform – Phillips 66, encompassing fuels, midstream logistics, chemicals, lubricants and now low?carbon solutions – is being forced to answer a hard question: how do you run a profitable hydrocarbon business while the world is demanding less carbon?

The answer, at least for now, is not to abandon fossil molecules but to upgrade them. Phillips 66 is betting on a mix of high?complexity refining, advantaged logistics, petrochemicals via its Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) joint venture, and an expanding slate of lower?carbon offerings from renewable diesel to carbon capture and hydrogen integration. Instead of a single hero product, Phillips 66 functions more like a platform: a network of assets, technologies and proprietary processes tuned to squeeze out margin and emissions reductions from every barrel and every Btu that passes through its system.

This is not the loud, brand?forward pitch you get from an EV pioneer or a consumer?facing tech giant. It’s infrastructure?level innovation, where winning looks like quiet reliability, steady free cash flow, and decarbonization that is material on a megaton scale. Yet the stakes are huge. For investors in Phillips 66 Aktie and for policymakers trying to keep grids stable while lowering emissions, the way this product platform evolves over the next decade matters a lot.

Get all details on Phillips 66 here

Inside the Flagship: Phillips 66

The core Phillips 66 offering is a vertically integrated energy and chemicals platform spanning refining, midstream logistics, marketing, and petrochemicals. Rather than a single refinery or product line, think of Phillips 66 as a tightly choreographed system: crude and NGLs in, transportation fuels, specialty products and chemicals out, with every node optimized for cost, yield, and increasingly, carbon intensity.

On the conventional side, the Phillips 66 refining portfolio is built around complex, coastal refineries that can process discounted, heavy or opportunity crudes and upgrade them into higher?value products. That complexity is a quiet but powerful feature: coking, hydrocracking, and advanced distillation capacity let Phillips 66 pivot yields between gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and petrochemical feedstocks based on demand and crack spreads. The company has been divesting lower?margin inland refineries and doubling down on sites with export access and integration with chemicals and midstream assets.

A standout example of this evolution is the Rodeo facility in California, which Phillips 66 is converting from a traditional oil refinery into one of the world’s largest renewable fuels plants. Once fully ramped, Rodeo Renewed is designed to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and other wastes. That’s not just a feel?good story; it’s a technical flex that combines hydrotreating expertise, hydrogen management, and feedstock optimization into a commercial?scale low?carbon product line that taps into lucrative California and federal credit markets.

In chemicals, the company’s Chevron Phillips Chemical joint venture is a second flagship pillar of the broader Phillips 66 product universe. CPChem is a major global producer of polyethylene, specialty chemicals and petrochemical intermediates. Its current and planned projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East are designed to leverage cheap natural gas liquids and export access to high?growth markets in Asia and beyond. This is the less visible but strategically crucial piece of the business, converting hydrocarbons into long?lived materials rather than fuels burned in an engine.

Layered on top of this industrial backbone is a suite of performance products and services under the Phillips 66, 76 and Kendall brands: branded transportation fuels, high?spec engine oils, industrial lubricants and specialty products. These offerings target both retail motorists and commercial and industrial customers, where performance claims (engine protection, extended drain intervals, fuel efficiency) translate directly into customer stickiness and margin.

Increasingly, the Phillips 66 product story includes low?carbon solutions. Beyond renewable diesel and SAF, the company is piloting and evaluating carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) at refinery and chemicals facilities; exploring hydrogen applications for process heat and fuels; and working on ways to lower the lifecycle emissions of its existing fuels and petrochemical products. None of these individually define the brand yet, but together they show a direction: decarbonize the barrel you have while preparing for a world that needs more molecules with fewer emissions.

Market Rivals: Phillips 66 Aktie vs. The Competition

Phillips 66 operates in one of the most competitive spaces in global industry: integrated and downstream energy. Its closest peers are U.S. and global refiners that are also trying to refit fossil?heavy product portfolios for a carbon?constrained world. Compared directly to Valero Energy’s refining and renewable diesel platform, Marathon Petroleum’s refining and MPLX midstream business, and the more globally diversified model of BP’s downstream and convenience business, the Phillips 66 product stack looks distinct in a few important ways.

Valero Energy’s flagship rivalry product is its highly optimized Gulf Coast refining network and the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, which has become one of the world’s largest renewable diesel producers. Valero’s pitch is simple and sharp: scale, cost discipline, and aggressive capital allocation into high?return renewable diesel projects. Where Phillips 66 leans into integration with chemicals and logistics, Valero leans into pure?play refining leverage with a growing green fuels segment.

Marathon Petroleum, meanwhile, has turned its product platform into a refining?plus?midstream machine built around its MPLX partnership. After divesting Speedway, Marathon has focused on refinery optimization and midstream cash generation. Its renewable diesel product line, including the Martinez Renewable Fuels project in California, competes head?to?head with Phillips 66’s Rodeo Renewed in the West Coast low?carbon fuels market.

Then there is BP’s downstream and convenience operation, anchored by its Castrol lubricants and a global fuels marketing business. Compared directly to BP’s convenience & mobility product ecosystem – which spans retail stations, EV charging, premium fuels and lubricants – Phillips 66’s portfolio skews more industrial and North America?heavy. BP aims to turn forecourt real estate into a decarbonized mobility hub, while Phillips 66 is more focused on squeezing value from its refining, midstream, and chemicals platforms and selectively expanding lower?carbon fuels.

On the chemicals front, Chevron Phillips Chemical (part of the Phillips 66 universe) goes up against behemoths like ExxonMobil Chemical, Dow, and LyondellBasell. Compared directly to ExxonMobil’s performance polymers and chemical solutions product line, CPChem’s growth projects are more targeted and partnership?driven, emphasizing advantaged feedstock positions in the U.S. and the Middle East. The rivalry here is less about brand and more about who can bring on world?scale crackers and polyethylene plants at the lowest cost and with the most resilient demand profile.

Where Phillips 66 arguably concedes ground is in brand visibility to end consumers. BP and Shell can wrap their downstream products in a green narrative at the retail pump and on EV chargers. Valero and Marathon command outsized market share in key U.S. regions. Phillips 66, by contrast, often flies under the radar outside its core branded fuel regions, even as it quietly executes on projects that materially reshape its emissions and earning power.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

The core competitive edge of Phillips 66 is not a single breakthrough technology but the way its refining, midstream and chemicals assets are stitched together into a high?optionality product platform. In practice, that translates into a few structural advantages.

1. Integration with chemicals, not just fuels. Unlike pure?play refiners, Phillips 66 has a major stake in petrochemicals through Chevron Phillips Chemical. That means a larger share of its hydrocarbon molecules can end up in long?lived plastics and specialty chemicals rather than short?cycle fuels. In an energy transition world, that matters: fuels volumes will face structural headwinds from EVs and efficiency, while demand for many plastics and chemical intermediates continues to grow, especially in emerging markets.

2. High?complexity coastal refineries with export optionality. Phillips 66 has been pruning its refinery portfolio to emphasize complex coastal sites tied into product export lanes and petrochemical feedstock markets. That gives the company a crucial edge in product placement: it can swing barrels to higher?margin regions and adjust yields quickly as global product balances shift. In a volatile macro and regulatory environment, that flexibility is a profit multiplier.

3. Real, not rhetorical, low?carbon products. While nearly every energy major talks about net zero, fewer have deployed significant capital into commercially scaled low?carbon products that leverage their existing process knowledge. Renewable diesel and SAF at Rodeo Renewed, alongside co?processing and efficiency upgrades at other sites, give Phillips 66 a tangible entry into low?carbon liquids. These products can command premium pricing, ride policy tailwinds, and extend the life of downstream infrastructure even as carbon constraints tighten.

4. Disciplined capital and portfolio management. The company has been actively selling non?core or underperforming assets and recycling capital into higher?return projects in midstream, renewable fuels, and CPChem expansions. That helps keep the product portfolio skewed toward assets that can earn through the cycle and support shareholder returns. In a sector often criticized for value?destructive capex, that discipline is itself a competitive feature.

5. Industrial?grade resilience. Phillips 66’s product universe is built around logistics resilience: pipelines, terminals, export docks, and storage. This backbone may not be glamorous, but it keeps fuels and feedstocks flowing during disruptions and enables arbitrage across basins. As climate?related extreme weather and geopolitical shocks become more frequent, this resilience becomes a sellable attribute to customers, regulators, and investors.

Put together, these factors give Phillips 66 a nuanced but powerful USP: it is one of the few large?scale energy companies capable of generating strong free cash flow from hydrocarbons today while methodically bending the emissions curve of those same products and pivoting more barrels into chemicals and low?carbon fuels over time.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

For investors in Phillips 66 Aktie (ISIN US7185461040), the performance of this product platform is not an abstract story; it feeds directly into earnings, cash returns, and how the market values the company relative to peers.

Using live market data as of the latest trading session, Phillips 66 shares trade in a range that reflects both its cyclical refining exposure and growing confidence in its transition strategy. According to real?time quotes from major financial sources including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, the stock’s most recently available price data show that the company is solidly in large?cap territory, with a market capitalization in the tens of billions of dollars and a valuation multiple that typically sits at a discount to the broader market but broadly in line with U.S. downstream peers. Where markets have rewarded Phillips 66 lately is in its ability to convert elevated refining margins and strong CPChem contributions into robust free cash flow, which is being directed toward dividends, share buybacks, and selective growth projects like Rodeo Renewed.

Crucially, the success of specific product initiatives is beginning to show up in analyst models. Renewable diesel and SAF volumes at Rodeo Renewed and Martinez?style peers are increasingly baked into long?term margin forecasts. CPChem’s global growth projects, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East, provide visibility into non?refining earnings power. Midstream and logistics assets, once seen primarily as supporting infrastructure, are valued more like cash?generating toll roads that stabilize earnings when refining cycles turn down.

Markets also track Phillips 66’s decarbonization metrics and capital allocation closely. Demonstrable emissions reductions per barrel, growing low?carbon product volumes, and credible CCUS and hydrogen pathways reduce perceived transition risk. That, in turn, can compress the discount rate investors apply to future cash flows, supporting a stronger equity multiple than a pure?play, no?transition refiner might command.

In that sense, the Phillips 66 product platform is both a cash engine and a signaling device. Each incremental renewable diesel project, each chemicals expansion, each efficiency gain in refining and midstream sends a message that this is not a business planning to run in place until demand disappears. For Phillips 66 Aktie, that evolving narrative – from traditional refiner to integrated, lower?carbon energy and chemicals platform – is a key driver of how the stock is priced against rivals like Valero, Marathon Petroleum, and the downstream arms of the supermajors.

The transition will not be smooth, and the macro backdrop for fuels and chemicals will remain volatile. But if Phillips 66 can keep proving that its product upgrades and portfolio shifts translate into durable margins and lower carbon intensity, its stock will be less a hostage to the next down?cycle and more a geared play on a pragmatic, molecule?centric energy transition.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405029_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 17:56:42.662936

As corn producers head into another growing season, economic headwinds are intensifying — not from just one direction, but from both sides of the balance sheet.

While production costs remain stubbornly high, corn prices have sharply declined, squeezing farm margins and prompting a push for long-term demand growth.

Krista Swanson, chief economist with the U.S. National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), outlined the association’s upcoming Q1 economic outlook and what it signals for U.S. corn producers.

“Costs have been a huge focus of ours over the past six months,” she says, pointing to a plateau in production expenses that has held since 2022.

While some minor easing has occurred, the USDA projects the cost to grow an acre of corn will average $917 in 2026 — only 1 per cent lower than 2022 levels.

“Meanwhile, the market-year average price for corn is expected to be 37 per cent lower than 2022,” she adds.

Swanson noted fertilizer makes up about a third of operating costs and draws much attention, but increases in seed, pesticides, land, and machinery are also significant.

From an economist’s perspective, she warned that continued government payments, such as the USDA’s recent $44/acre “bridge” program, may also inadvertently contribute to price rigidity for those same inputs.

Beyond costs, Swanson is focused on the demand side, where new market opportunities could change the trajectory.

While year-round E15 ethanol remains a top short-term goal, she says longer-term strategies are being developed.

“Ethanol isn’t just a motor fuel … there are opportunities in maritime fuels, sustainable aviation fuel, and bioproducts,” she explained.

Diversification is another bright spot. Roughly 40 per cent of U.S. corn exports go to Mexico, but Swanson says the broader export pie is well-divided, with markets like Japan, Colombia, and South Korea contributing to feed and fuel demand.

As producers weigh planting decisions for 2026, the high cost of corn production versus soybeans looms large.

Still, futures price ratios and farmer preferences continue to favour corn. Whether that holds, Swanson says, will be a key trend to watch as the new crop year unfolds.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/648/files/2025/09/corn-stock-9725.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 13:57:20.677289

Melalui kemitraan strategis, BPDP menyokong penuh gelaran Workshop Pengolahan Minyak dan Limbah Kelapa Sawit bagi UMKM yang dilaksanakan di Ballroom Hotel Lotus Panaya, Jumat (9/1/26).

​Kegiatan ini dihadiri jajaran petinggi daerah, termasuk Kepala Dinas Pertanian dan Ketahanan Pangan Kaltara, Ir. Heri Rudiyono, M.Si, serta Kepala Disperindagkop UKM Kaltara, Dr. Hj. Hasriyani, SH., MM, bersama puluhan petani dan pelaku usaha kecil dari berbagai kabupaten/kota.

​​Ketua Dewan Pimpinan Wilayah (DPW) APKASINDO Kaltara, Muhammad Khoiruddin, menekankan dukungan BPDP adalah momentum emas bagi petani sawit Kaltara untuk berhenti menjadi “penonton” di tanah sendiri.

​”Kami di DPW APKASINDO Kaltara melihat bahwa selama ini petani kita terlalu bergantung pada fluktuasi harga TBS (Tandan Buah Segar). Dengan dukungan BPDPKS dalam workshop ini, kita ingin mengubah pola pikir itu. Petani harus mulai melirik potensi hilirisasi. Jangan hanya menjual buah mentah, kita harus mampu mengolahnya menjadi minyak goreng atau produk turunan lainnya dalam skala UMKM,” tegas Khoiruddin.

​Ia juga menambahkan Kaltara memiliki potensi CPO dan PKO yang sangat melimpah, namun belum tergarap maksimal oleh tangan-tangan lokal.

​”Masalah utama kita adalah teknologi dan pengetahuan. Lewat workshop ini, kami ingin memastikan UMKM di Kaltara punya daya saing. Kita ingin di masa depan, ada merek minyak goreng lokal atau pupuk organik hasil limbah sawit asli produksi petani Kaltara yang beredar di pasar. Ini bukan sekadar pelatihan, ini adalah langkah menuju kedaulatan ekonomi petani sawit,” imbuhnya.

Senada dengan hal tersebut, Sekretaris Jenderal (Sekjen) DPP APKASINDO, Dr. Rino Afrino, ST., MM., C.APO, memberikan wawasan mengenai nilai ekonomi dari limbah yang selama ini terbuang.

​”Dunia internasional kini mencari minyak jelantah atau limbah sawit untuk diolah menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat. Jadi, tidak ada yang terbuang. Semua proses dari TBS hingga limbah memiliki peluang ekonomi yang berlipat ganda jika kita menguasai teknologinya,” jelas Dr. Rino.

​Workshop yang didukung BPDP ini memiliki sembilan target utama guna memperkuat ekosistem sawit rakyat, di antaranya meningkatkan keterampilan teknis mengolah sawit menjadi produk bernilai tambah seperti kosmetik dan farmasi. Merumuskan pembangunan pabrik pupuk organik skala UMKM dari limbah sawit untuk menekan biaya produksi kebun.

Selain itu, membantu UMKM menciptakan produk inovatif yang sesuai dengan standar keberlanjutan (sustainability) agar mampu menembus pasar internasional.

​​Melalui sinergi antara BPDP, pemerintah daerah, dan APKASINDO, workshop ini diharapkan mampu menciptakan jejaring kerja yang kuat.

IIFCL Prepares for Stake Dilution and IPO

India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) is preparing to dilute up to 25% of its government stake as part of its next phase of evolution, ahead of the proposed Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the Financial year 2027.

Speaking with ANI, Deputy Managing Director Palash Srivastava on Saturday, said that this move is likely part of the government's strategy to raise funds for infrastructure development and to promote private-sector participation. ""There is a lot of preparation to do, and we are on course for this to happen,"" Srivastava told ANI, adding that the timing of the proposed divestment aligns with a period when IIFCL's funding strategy is increasingly integrated with global capital markets.

IIFCL DMD's remarks came in the backdrop of reports that the government is considering selling stakes in IIFCL, its long-term infrastructure lending arm, and that the ministerial panel is expected to finalise the IPO structure, which may combine fresh equity issuance and a partial government stake sale to meet public shareholding norms.

IIFCL is a wholly owned Government of India company that provides long-term financing and advisory services for viable infrastructure projects in India, covering sectors such as energy, transport, water, and digital infrastructure, with the aim of boosting national development.

Impact of Global Interest Rates

Talking on how global interest rate cycles affect infrastructure financing, Srivastava said IIFCL is ""very much linked to the global financing system"" and regularly borrows internationally on the strength of its own balance sheet. ""We have found that international market rate cuts also help our rates go down,"" he said.

He said IIFCL's borrowing rates are flexible and benchmark-linked. ""When the benchmark rates are cut, our rates also come down,"" Srivastava said, noting that this improves margins on infrastructure projects and makes IIFCL's participation in direct lending and takeout finance more competitive.

Highlighting the importance of floating-rate structures, he said, ""The floating rate regime is helping us tide over,"" adding that close to 55 per cent of IIFCL's portfolio is currently on a floating-rate basis. He said institutions funded through amortising and floating-rate loans or bonds benefit more from rate cuts, while those relying largely on fixed-rate bonds may see less impact.

Driving India's Green Transition

On India's green transition, he said development finance institutions are ""actually the main influencers"" in making infrastructure projects green. He said the transition covers multiple dimensions, starting with renewables, where India has already made significant progress. ""About 500 gigawatt of solar and wind capacity is already in place,"" he said, adding that further expansion will not only help meet national targets but also promote manufacturing through green energy.

Srivastava said DFIs are also enabling the transition of hard-to-abate sectors. Referring to sustainable aviation fuel, he said, ""We have actually financed the sustainable aviation fuel export from India into the UK,"" demonstrating how financial institutions can provide enabling finance and effective support mechanisms for green transition.

Supporting Green MSMEs

On MSMEs, Srivastava said green transition must also extend to small enterprises. ""Our MSMEs also have to turn green,"" he said, adding that IIFCL is working with NITI Aayog on a programme to aggregate MSMEs in industrial clusters or estates.

""Aggregation is going to help,"" he said, noting that green energy can be supplied through rooftop solar or open access, while overcoming RESCOs' reluctance to take individual MSME credit exposure.

He said DFIs are also contributing through blended finance and guarantee mechanisms. ""There are certain conversations about green guarantees and green insurance,"" he said, describing them as part of the broader toolkit to help the Indian industry transition to green.

Navigating Geopolitical Risks and Supply Chains

On geopolitical risks, Srivastava said geopolitics is ""a very important contributor"" to long-term infrastructure outcomes, especially in maritime infrastructure. ""Geopolitics affects trade first and foremost,"" he said, adding that trade dynamics shape the infrastructure ecosystem supporting export and import activity.

He said recent disturbances have shown how trade corridors and connectivity plans can be disrupted, underscoring the need for resilience in long-term infrastructure planning.

Turning to global supply chains, Srivastava said diversification trends have accelerated in recent years. ""Most economies don't want to put all their manufacturing in one country,"" he said, adding that manufacturing and secondary economic activities are increasingly shifting from the Global North to the Global South.

He said this presents opportunities for India, particularly in electronics manufacturing. ""We have been in conversations with bilateral partners like JBIC,"" Srivastava said, noting that long-term blended finance can help develop clusters, create value chains and strengthen shipping and logistics linkages.

Srivastava also said IIFCL has been in touch with the Sagarmala Development Finance Corporation and may partner with it under the proposed Maritime Development Fund.

Embracing Technology: AI and Blockchain

Further on technology, he said artificial intelligence should be seen as ""a smart support system"" rather than a replacement for human judgment. ""I don't see it as anything more than an iteration over the decision support systems we already have,"" he said.

He said IIFCL has begun planning a transition to AI and machine learning to flag regulatory, compliance, international mandate-specific, and technology risks when a case is uploaded. ""This will enable an appraiser to get a broad brush reference immediately,"" he said.

Srivastava also discussed blockchain and smart contracts, noting that IIFCL would like to move toward smart financing. ""This will enable just-in-time financing to flow to projects and bring down the overall cost of financing,"" he said.

Addressing Market Perceptions and Demand

On global slowdown concerns, Srivastava said the key challenge to infrastructure growth is perception. ""The risk perception definitely affects investments,"" he said, stressing that policy continuity, consistent stress asset resolution and predictability in awards are critical to sustaining private sector capital expenditure.

On infrastructure demand, he said India's requirements remain structurally strong. ""As a country of 1.45 billion people, we definitely have a lot of infrastructure to build,"" Srivastava said, adding that domestic infrastructure demand is not materially affected by international impulses.

Integrating Climate and Disaster Resilience

On climate risk, Srivastava said infrastructure projects typically span 20 to 25 years, making climate considerations unavoidable. ""These days, we are designing for climate events,"" he said, citing floods, droughts, cyclones and high-speed winds.

He said design parameters increasingly account for 1.5-degree and 2-degree temperature-rise scenarios, even though this entails additional costs. ""Together with CDRI, we have evolved a framework whereby financing for disaster-resilient infrastructure could be taken up,"" he said.

Evolving Funding and Hedging Strategies

On funding strategy, he said external commercial borrowings are becoming a structural necessity. ""If I am trying to borrow money for 15 years or 20 years, I am not getting it in the commercial market in India,"" he said.

He added that IIFCL recently raised a 15-year amortising overseas loan at a very competitive cost using structured finance and hedging. ""Hedging is not such an issue,"" he said, noting that international banks can provide all-in hedging solutions.

On currency markets, Srivastava said improved rupee-dollar hedging frameworks could support deeper and more stable derivative markets. ""If DFIs collaborate, we could create economies of scale and get better hedging solutions,"" he said.

Internal Reinvention and New Offerings

Highlighting internal developments, he said IIFCL has constituted 11 task forces to reinvent the institution. ""We are looking at a batch of new product offerings,"" he said, including bridge finance to address the 6 to 18 month delay in financial closure and subordinated debt products to support state governments in projects such as hybrid annuity models.

He said IIFCL is also standardising monitoring, reporting and verification protocols for green finance. ""We want a common MRV protocol,"" he said, so that international green capital does not impose additional conditionalities on Indian institutions.

Srivastava added that IIFCL is strengthening engagement with India-based multilaterals such as the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the Global Bioenergy Alliance as it prepares for the next phase of growth. (ANI)

Deutsche Lufthansa AG is no longer just a legacy flag carrier fighting for survival in a brutally competitive sky. It is repositioning itself as a premium, digitally driven, and increasingly climate-conscious aviation platform, spanning the Lufthansa, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, and Discover brands. After years of pandemic shock, labor disputes, and capacity dislocations, the company is now re-architecting how a traditional network airline should look and feel for the next decade.

The core problem Deutsche Lufthansa AG is trying to solve is two-fold: make long-haul flying profitable again while convincing travelers that premium seats, flexible digital services, and greener operations justify paying more in a world that has grown used to rock-bottom fares and remote work. That challenge sits at the heart of every strategic move the group is currently making: from its multi-billion-euro cabin retrofit program to its digital self-service push and high-profile sustainability commitments.

For business travelers, the pitch is a rebuilt product experience under the ""Lufthansa Allegris"" banner. For leisure travelers, it is more choice via Eurowings and Discover. For investors, it is a story of margin repair, disciplined capacity growth, and structurally higher yields. Together, these define Deutsche Lufthansa AG as a product, not just a stock ticker.

Inside the Flagship: Deutsche Lufthansa AG

At the center of Deutsche Lufthansa AG today is an aggressive modernization of its fleet and cabins, wrapped in a broader platform strategy. The company is rolling out its new long-haul experience, marketed as Lufthansa Allegris, across the Boeing 787, Airbus A350, and the upcoming Boeing 777-9 fleet. This is not just a new seat; it is a full reset of how the airline monetizes every square meter of the cabin.

In premium cabins, Lufthansa Allegris introduces multiple business-class seat types in the same cabin — including extra-long beds, throne-style single seats with extra privacy, and seats with baby bassinets and more storage. Instead of a monolithic business class, Deutsche Lufthansa AG is essentially creating a micro-portfolio of business products within one configuration, giving the airline more levers to upsell frequent flyers and corporate travelers based on specific needs. First class, reintroduced on select A350 routes, is being reimagined as ultra-private suites with nearly floor-to-ceiling walls and large double seats that target the very top end of the market.

In premium economy and economy, the innovation is more about smart standardization and incremental comfort. Wider seats, larger IFE screens, improved cushioning, and better ergonomic design are table stakes. But Deutsche Lufthansa AG is also adding more ancillary revenue hooks: pre-selection of specific rows or comfort seats, paid extras like additional legroom, and bundled travel options that mix seat selection, baggage, and onboard services into dynamic offers.

On the ground and in the app, the company is leaning into digitalization. The Lufthansa Group app ecosystem focuses on real-time rebooking, automated disruption handling, and biometric-enabled journeys at some hubs. The goal: fewer chaotic airport lines, more self-service, and lower operational friction when weather, strikes, or crew issues hit. The airline is also investing in continuous pricing and offer management technology to shift away from traditional static fare buckets toward more agile, demand-based pricing.

Sustainability remains a major strategic pillar. Deutsche Lufthansa AG is renewing its fleet with more fuel-efficient aircraft like the Airbus A350, Boeing 787, and A320neo family, and it has committed to ramping up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage in cooperation with corporate customers. The proposition to climate-conscious travelers and corporate clients is clear: fly with a network carrier that is at least trying to bend the emissions curve via newer hardware and alternative fuels.

Behind the scenes, the group structure remains a key feature of the Deutsche Lufthansa AG product. It is not a single airline, but a portfolio of brands calibrated for different markets: SWISS as the premium Swiss hub carrier, Austrian Airlines as Vienna’s connector, Brussels Airlines for Belgium and Africa, Eurowings and Discover for point-to-point European and leisure routes. This allows the group to tailor its cost structure and brand positioning while leveraging shared systems, pilots, maintenance, and loyalty via Miles & More, one of Europe’s most powerful frequent flyer programs.

Market Rivals: Lufthansa Aktie vs. The Competition

Deutsche Lufthansa AG operates in one of the most unforgiving competitive arenas: European aviation, squeezed from all sides by low-cost carriers within Europe and deep-pocketed Gulf and Asian airlines on long-haul routes. When you look at the ""product"" that Deutsche Lufthansa AG is selling — a full-service, hub-and-spoke, global network — the closest direct competitors are International Airlines Group (IAG, with British Airways and Iberia), Air France-KLM, and to some extent the Gulf giants Emirates and Qatar Airways on key intercontinental flows.

Compared directly to British Airways under the IAG umbrella, Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s new Allegris cabins are designed to close and, on some routes, surpass the product gap that had opened up in business and first class. BA’s Club Suite was an early move toward privacy-first business cabins with doors; Lufthansa’s multi-seat-type approach raises the bar by offering differentiated micro-products within the same cabin, potentially out-monetizing BA if the upsell strategy works. Where British Airways still leans heavily on London Heathrow as a single mega-hub, Deutsche Lufthansa AG plays a multi-hub game through Frankfurt, Munich, Zurich, Vienna, and Brussels, offering passengers more routing options but at the cost of additional operational complexity.

Compared directly to Air France-KLM, especially Air France’s lauded latest business-class cabins, Deutsche Lufthansa AG competes on breadth and system scale. Air France has strong brand appeal and cabin design, particularly on Paris-origin premium traffic, while KLM excels with passenger friendliness through Amsterdam Schiphol. Lufthansa Group counters with a wider brand portfolio, a larger corporate customer base in Germany and central Europe, and more diversified hub risk. Where Air France-KLM leans into a stylish, service-led French and Dutch identity, Deutsche Lufthansa AG markets a blend of German precision, reliability (when operations run smoothly), and functional premium.

Then there are the Gulf carriers. Compared directly to Emirates’ flagship long-haul product or Qatar Airways’ Qsuite, Deutsche Lufthansa AG cannot always match the glam factor on every route, especially in first class or top-tier business-class suites. The Gulf carriers benefit from lower labor cost bases, favorable geography for east–west connections, and relatively unconstrained hub expansion. Lufthansa’s counter is a strong position in Europe-originating corporate demand, shorter total journey times for many Europe-based travelers, and a more integrated relationship with Star Alliance partners like United Airlines and Singapore Airlines. For a Frankfurt-to-New York corporate traveler, the question isn’t whether Emirates has flashier cabins; it is whether Lufthansa’s schedule, loyalty program, and corporate deals offer superior end-to-end value.

On intra-European routes, Eurowings and Lufthansa’s short-haul network go head-to-head with low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and easyJet. Here, the product is less about luxury and more about schedule breadth, connectivity into the long-haul network, and reliability. Ryanair wins on price almost every time; Deutsche Lufthansa AG tries to win on network integration, allowing a passenger from a secondary German city to connect seamlessly onto an intercontinental flight through Frankfurt or Munich.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s edge is not a single killer feature. It is the combination of product modernization, network strength, and ecosystem depth that makes its proposition hard to replicate at scale.

First, the cabin strategy is tuned for monetization. Lufthansa Allegris is designed from the ground up to capture more value per seat by offering granularity: travelers can pay more for privacy, more for extra-long beds, more for seating with better views or baby-friendly layouts. This shift mirrors trends in hospitality and streaming services, where tiered offerings outperform one-size-fits-all models. Competitors like British Airways and Air France-KLM are modernizing cabins too, but Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s multi-seat-type strategy positions it to squeeze more revenue out of premium cabins on high-demand routes.

Second, the multi-brand, multi-hub architecture gives Deutsche Lufthansa AG a resilience advantage. When one hub suffers from disruptions or political issues, traffic can be rerouted through others. SWISS can pick up slack when Frankfurt is saturated; Vienna can serve as a nimble connector for eastern Europe; Brussels can deepen Africa links. This redundancy and flexibility are strengths that a single-hub carrier such as British Airways cannot easily match.

Third, the loyalty ecosystem is a powerful moat. Miles & More is deeply embedded with corporate travel programs, co-branded credit cards, and long-time status customers across Europe. In a context where travel buyers are under pressure to justify every euro spent, a rich loyalty ecosystem linked to a dense network matters. Deutsche Lufthansa AG leverages this to lock in repeat customers even when ticket prices are slightly higher than low-cost or Gulf rivals on certain segments.

Fourth, the sustainability narrative is becoming a real differentiator, especially for European corporate clients facing their own ESG disclosures. By investing in newer aircraft like the Airbus A350, Boeing 787, and A320neo families, experimenting with sustainable aviation fuels through corporate SAF agreements, and pushing efficiency initiatives, Deutsche Lufthansa AG can credibly present itself as a partner in emissions reduction — or at least emissions mitigation. While no major airline can claim to be truly green yet, being perceived as more proactive than peers can tilt RFP decisions for corporate contracts.

Finally, the digital layer — from rebooking automation to mobile-first check-in and biometrics — is critical. A full-service product loses its shine if disruption handling is a nightmare. By progressively moving recovery flows (rebookings, vouchers, seat changes) into the app and self-service kiosks, Deutsche Lufthansa AG aims to reduce moments of friction that traditionally sent customer satisfaction scores tumbling.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

From a capital markets perspective, all of this product work is more than cabin aesthetics; it is a thesis about structural profitability. As of the latest available trading session, data from major financial platforms such as Yahoo Finance and another cross-checked source like Reuters show that the Lufthansa Aktie (ISIN DE0008232125) is trading in a range that reflects a normalized, but not euphoric, recovery path after the post-pandemic rebound. The exact live quote can fluctuate intraday, but what matters for investors is the narrative priced into the stock.

In recent quarters, Deutsche Lufthansa AG has reported solid passenger volumes and improving yields, particularly in premium cabins where the new product is gradually entering service. The market is watching how quickly the Allegris rollout scales, how reliably the group can operate its schedule amid ongoing labor and air traffic control constraints, and whether cost inflation (wages, fuel, airport fees) can be offset by higher unit revenues.

The product strategy directly feeds into valuation levers. A more efficient and attractive long-haul fleet supports better margins and lower unit costs over time. Stronger premium demand and granular upselling capability in business and first class can expand revenue per available seat kilometer, a key earnings driver. Digitalization and automation should, in theory, flatten non-fuel cost growth. Sustainability initiatives, while costly upfront, can keep the group inside the acceptable ESG range for large institutional investors and corporate clients.

Investors also weigh Deutsche Lufthansa AG against its peer set. When compared with International Airlines Group or Air France-KLM on valuation metrics like EV/EBITDA or price-to-earnings, the stock tends to trade as a recovery and restructuring story rather than a high-growth tech-style equity. The success or failure of the current product upgrade cycle and network optimization will influence whether Lufthansa Aktie earns a modest legacy-carrier multiple or a premium closer to best-in-class peers.

In this context, Deutsche Lufthansa AG as a product is a primary driver of Deutsche Lufthansa AG as a stock. If the group executes on its promise — delivering a consistently premium experience, monetizing its hubs more effectively, keeping unions reasonably aligned, and proving sustainability investments can coexist with acceptable returns — then the modernized Lufthansa could justify a higher, more stable valuation. If execution falters, investors will see Allegris and fleet renewal as expensive experiments rather than profit engines.

The skies ahead remain volatile: geopolitical tensions, fuel price shocks, and macroeconomic slowdowns could all hit demand. But the direction of travel for Deutsche Lufthansa AG is clear. It is not merely surviving disruption; it is trying to transform disruption into an opportunity to rebuild what a European network carrier can be — and investors in Lufthansa Aktie are effectively betting on that reinvention at scale.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405002_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:56:43.175758

May: Regulatory Reform Amid Conflict

Nigeria Launches Revised Insurance Regulations for Leased Aircraft

On May 12, the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), in collaboration with the Ministry of Aviation and Aerospace Development, unveiled revised regulations for insuring leased and financed aircraft. Launched in Abuja by Minister Festus Keyamo, the policy addresses longstanding barriers: high costs from foreign insurance mandates, limited local insurer participation, and repossession uncertainties. By aligning with the Cape Town Convention — where Nigeria now boasts Africa’s highest compliance score (70.5) — and strengthening IDERA mechanisms, the reforms empower local insurers, slash premiums, and enhance lessor confidence.

December: Challenges and Bold Reforms

EnComm Aviation Faces Shutdown Over BAE ATP Support Withdrawal

Kenyan humanitarian cargo operator EnComm issued a dire warning of potential loan default after BAE Systems withdrew technical support for its BAe ATP fleet — the last of its type in service. Having delivered nearly 19,000 tonnes of aid to conflict zones since 2023, the grounding disrupts vital humanitarian operations and exposes vulnerabilities in supporting legacy aircraft types.

ECOWAS Abolishes Key Aviation Taxes

In a landmark move, ECOWAS adopted reforms abolishing ticket, tourism, solidarity, and foreign travel taxes while slashing passenger service and security charges by 25%, effective January 2026. This policy, backed by a regional oversight mechanism, targets West Africa’s exorbitant airfares — often higher than long-haul routes to Europe — and aligns with ICAO standards to foster affordability, competition, and integration.

2025 was not without setbacks — conflict disruptions in Libya and Sudan, governance scandals, legacy aircraft challenges, and lingering safety gaps reminded the industry of its fragility. Yet the year’s defining theme was forward momentum: record infrastructure financing, pioneering sustainability efforts, technological firsts, a wave of national carrier revivals, and decisive regional tax reforms. As African nations increasingly assert technical and industrial sovereignty — from MROs to SAF production to aerospace manufacturing — the continent is transitioning from a late adopter to an active shaper of global aviation trends.",https://images.airlinegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/11170412/Royal-Air-Maroc-Boeing-787-9-LHR-William-Derrickson.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 10:56:56.801594

“Making California more affordable is how we make families thrive. That is why this year’s budget should be all about giving people more financial breathing room without losing sight of long-term financial stability and prioritizing smart, directed spending.

“The Governor’s budget proposal includes difficult choices responding to the unjustified and vindictive withholding of federal funds by the Trump Administration which are projected to result in $1.4 billion worth of unnecessary costs, driving up health care costs and reducing food assistance to over 3 million families.

“I am particularly pleased to see funds put toward universal access to free transitional kindergarten and a sustainable aviation fuel investment that will improve air quality and protect critical Contra Costa County jobs. I will work to expand this investment to renewable diesel fuel, increasing our climate impact while supporting economic growth.

“However, this proposal has a long way to go when it comes to affordable housing. The Legislature is once again working from zero. As co-chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Housing Finance and Affordability, I am committed to finding solutions that will bring down the rising cost of housing in California and increase the construction of affordable homes.

“Over the next several months, I will work closely with my colleagues to negotiate and pass a state budget that provides the best outcomes for our community and state.”

“We are actively exploring opportunities to expand in the bio and e-SAF market, and Haffner was the ideal partner.
Additionally, excess biogenic CO₂ generated during syngas production can be combined with renewable hydrogen produced by IGNIS P2X to create e-SAF, a synthetic sustainable aviation fuel of non-biological origin.

The partners announced that the project’s first priority is identifying an optimal site for the facility in Spain.

“AeroVerde builds on Haffner Energy’s innovative methods for turning residual biomass into valuable fuel products,” said Gustav Granberg, Director of P2X Business Development & Strategy at IGNIS. “We are actively exploring opportunities to expand in the bio and e-SAF market, and Haffner was the ideal partner. Our immediate focus is to select the most strategic location for the initial project in Spain.”

Haffner Energy’s proprietary technology transforms residual biomass—without competing with food or land use—into hydrogen-rich syngas, which can then be converted into bioSAF through pathways such as Alcohol-to-Jet and Fisher-Tropsch. Additionally, excess biogenic CO₂ generated during syngas production can be combined with renewable hydrogen produced by IGNIS P2X to create e-SAF, a synthetic sustainable aviation fuel of non-biological origin.

The European SAF sector is under mounting pressure to scale up rapidly. Under the ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, airlines will be required to use a 6% SAF blend across the EU by 2030. Yet, according to an October report by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), SAF accounted for only 0.6% of aviation fuel consumption in 2024, with around 55% produced domestically. Most of the EU’s SAF currently comes from used cooking oil and waste animal fats (HEFA), nearly 70% of which is imported from Asia. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that such imports can offset the carbon reduction benefits of SAF mandates.

AeroVerde plans to strategically locate its first facility to ensure efficient access to local residual biomass while minimizing transportation distances to offtakers.

“Our business model is rooted in the circular economy, and partnering with IGNIS P2X allows us to combine our technological expertise with their strong presence in Spain,” said Marcella Franchi, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of SAF at Haffner Energy. “Together, we are well-positioned to bring sustainable aviation fuels to the Iberian Peninsula.”

As Spain’s largest independent energy manager, IGNIS oversees more than 9 GW of power assets for domestic and international clients. The group operates over 30 GW of renewable projects globally, spanning Europe, the U.S., Latin America, and Asia. In 2024, IGNIS launched its P2X platform to develop green hydrogen, ammonia, and other clean energy solutions in Spain and internationally, further strengthening its capabilities in low-carbon technologies.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-18-at-16.46.27_ee8716ab.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 11:57:44.146488

At a share price of $68.65, Corteva has seen a 30 day share price return of 5.45% and a 90 day share price return of 11.03%. Its 1 year total shareholder return of 21.48% and 5 year total shareholder return of 65.84% indicate momentum has been building around the recent Etlas and Hexagon Bio announcements, despite short term volatility and legal headlines.

If this kind of transition toward bio based fuels has your attention, it could be a good moment to scan other that are reshaping how we think about long term resilience and structural demand.

With the stock at $68.65, a value score of 0, an intrinsic value estimate that sits about 8% above today’s price and a roughly 14% gap to analyst targets, is there still upside here, or is future growth already priced in?

Most Popular Narrative: 11.7% Undervalued

With Corteva last closing at $68.65 versus a narrative fair value of about $77.76, the story centers on measured growth, higher margins and a richer earnings profile over time.

Advancements in Corteva's innovation pipeline, including premium trait launches (Vorceed, PowerCore), expansion of biological products, and gene editing, enable premium pricing, secure market share, and improve product mix, translating into higher gross margins and earnings growth. Accelerated adoption of sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural inputs, supported by favorable policy shifts in gene editing and biofuels, positions Corteva for outsized growth as regulatory and consumer preferences move toward biological and reduced-chemical solutions. This can expand both revenue and addressable market over the long term.

Curious how moderate revenue growth, rising margins and a premium P/E all come together to support that higher fair value line? The key assumptions might surprise you. One element hinges on future earnings power, another on what multiple the market could be willing to pay. Want to see exactly how those moving parts stack up?

Result: Fair Value of $77.76 (UNDERVALUED)

However, slower crop protection demand and tougher environmental or regulatory requirements could squeeze margins and challenge the higher earnings and P/E assumptions behind that 11.7% undervaluation story.

Another View: What Earnings Multiples Are Saying

The fair value narrative points to Corteva trading about 11.7% below a US$77.76 estimate, but the earnings multiple tells a more cautious story. At a P/E of 27.6x, the stock sits above both its fair ratio of 25.3x and the US Chemicals industry at 25.2x, as well as above peers at 15.1x.

That gap means you are paying a richer price for each dollar of earnings today, which can limit room for disappointment if growth or margins fall short. So does the premium reflect solid conviction in the earnings path, or does it leave less margin for error at this price?

Global agribusiness leader Bunge has secured the first ever ISCC CORSIA PLUS certification for soybeans processed at its Rondonópolis plant in Mato Grosso. The audit confirms that the crop carries a low risk of indirect land use change, meeting stringent criteria set by the aviation sector for sustainable fuel feedstocks. With one of the largest crushing capacities in South America, the facility can now channel certified oil directly toward sustainable aviation fuel production, opening an immediate path from farm gate to flight deck.

How Low ILUC Soy Benefits Airlines

Airlines governed by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation can count certified low ILUC soy toward their renewable energy targets without penalty factors. This translates into higher blend limits and simpler compliance reporting. Because the beans are sourced from existing farmland, no new land clearing is involved, keeping carbon intensity scores comfortably below the CORSIA threshold. Refiners also benefit; feedstock loads depart from an inland rail hub, reducing marine emissions associated with long distance imports.

Non-Obvious Market Ripple

A quietly powerful effect of this certification is price discovery. By placing a premium on low ILUC soy, the market now offers growers a clear financial signal to adopt precision agriculture, double cropping and satellite monitored land stewardship. Over time, these practices may raise overall yields, freeing up additional acreage for protein rich food crops even as fuel demand grows. Thus the aviation mandate could indirectly enhance food security, an outcome not typically associated with biofuel policy.

Conclusion

Bunge has demonstrated that large scale soybean production can meet the most demanding sustainability checks while supporting farmer prosperity and aviation decarbonisation. As more Brazilian facilities pursue certification, the global supply of high integrity feedstock for sustainable jet fuel is set to rise rapidly.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Copy-of-White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-7.svg,N,,2026-01-10 14:12:18.007192

On MSMEs, Srivastava said green transition must also extend to small enterprises.
On climate risk, Srivastava said infrastructure projects typically span 20 to 25 years, making climate considerations unavoidable.
He said IIFCL is also standardising monitoring, reporting and verification protocols for green finance.","By Kaushal Verma

New Delhi [India], January 10 (ANI): India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) is preparing to dilute up to 25% of its government stake as part of its next phase of evolution, ahead of the proposed Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the Financial year 2027.

Speaking with ANI, Deputy Managing Director Palash Srivastava on Saturday, said that this move is likely part of the government's strategy to raise funds for infrastructure development and to promote private-sector participation.

""There is a lot of preparation to do, and we are on course for this to happen,"" Srivastava told ANI, adding that the timing of the proposed divestment aligns with a period when IIFCL's funding strategy is increasingly integrated with global capital markets.

IIFCL DMD's remarks came in the backdrop of reports that the government is considering selling stakes in IIFCL, its long-term infrastructure lending arm, and that the ministerial panel is expected to finalise the IPO structure, which may combine fresh equity issuance and a partial government stake sale to meet public shareholding norms.

IIFCL is a wholly owned Government of India company that provides long-term financing and advisory services for viable infrastructure projects in India, covering sectors such as energy, transport, water, and digital infrastructure, with the aim of boosting national development.

Talking on how global interest rate cycles affect infrastructure financing, Srivastava said IIFCL is ""very much linked to the global financing system"" and regularly borrows internationally on the strength of its own balance sheet. ""We have found that international market rate cuts also help our rates go down,"" he said.

He said IIFCL's borrowing rates are flexible and benchmark-linked. ""When the benchmark rates are cut, our rates also come down,"" Srivastava said, noting that this improves margins on infrastructure projects and makes IIFCL's participation in direct lending and takeout finance more competitive.

Highlighting the importance of floating-rate structures, he said, ""The floating rate regime is helping us tide over,"" adding that close to 55 per cent of IIFCL's portfolio is currently on a floating-rate basis. He said institutions funded through amortising and floating-rate loans or bonds benefit more from rate cuts, while those relying largely on fixed-rate bonds may see less impact.

On India's green transition, he said development finance institutions are ""actually the main influencers"" in making infrastructure projects green. He said the transition covers multiple dimensions, starting with renewables, where India has already made significant progress.

""About 500 gigawatt of solar and wind capacity is already in place,"" he said, adding that further expansion will not only help meet national targets but also promote manufacturing through green energy.

Srivastava said DFIs are also enabling the transition of hard-to-abate sectors. Referring to sustainable aviation fuel, he said, ""We have actually financed the sustainable aviation fuel export from India into the UK,"" demonstrating how financial institutions can provide enabling finance and effective support mechanisms for green transition.

On MSMEs, Srivastava said green transition must also extend to small enterprises. ""Our MSMEs also have to turn green,"" he said, adding that IIFCL is working with NITI Aayog on a programme to aggregate MSMEs in industrial clusters or estates. ""Aggregation is going to help,"" he said, noting that green energy can be supplied through rooftop solar or open access, while overcoming RESCOs' reluctance to take individual MSME credit exposure.

He said DFIs are also contributing through blended finance and guarantee mechanisms. ""There are certain conversations about green guarantees and green insurance,"" he said, describing them as part of the broader toolkit to help the Indian industry transition to green.

On geopolitical risks, Srivastava said geopolitics is ""a very important contributor"" to long-term infrastructure outcomes, especially in maritime infrastructure. ""Geopolitics affects trade first and foremost,"" he said, adding that trade dynamics shape the infrastructure ecosystem supporting export and import activity.

He said recent disturbances have shown how trade corridors and connectivity plans can be disrupted, underscoring the need for resilience in long-term infrastructure planning.

Turning to global supply chains, Srivastava said diversification trends have accelerated in recent years. ""Most economies don't want to put all their manufacturing in one country,"" he said, adding that manufacturing and secondary economic activities are increasingly shifting from the Global North to the Global South.

He said this presents opportunities for India, particularly in electronics manufacturing. ""We have been in conversations with bilateral partners like JBIC,"" Srivastava said, noting that long-term blended finance can help develop clusters, create value chains and strengthen shipping and logistics linkages.

Srivastava also said IIFCL has been in touch with the Sagarmala Development Finance Corporation and may partner with it under the proposed Maritime Development Fund.

Further on technology, he said artificial intelligence should be seen as ""a smart support system"" rather than a replacement for human judgment. ""I don't see it as anything more than an iteration over the decision support systems we already have,"" he said.

He said IIFCL has begun planning a transition to AI and machine learning to flag regulatory, compliance, international mandate-specific, and technology risks when a case is uploaded. ""This will enable an appraiser to get a broad brush reference immediately,"" he said.

Srivastava also discussed blockchain and smart contracts, noting that IIFCL would like to move toward smart financing. ""This will enable just-in-time financing to flow to projects and bring down the overall cost of financing,"" he said.

On global slowdown concerns, Srivastava said the key challenge to infrastructure growth is perception. ""The risk perception definitely affects investments,"" he said, stressing that policy continuity, consistent stress asset resolution and predictability in awards are critical to sustaining private sector capital expenditure.

On infrastructure demand, he said India's requirements remain structurally strong. ""As a country of 1.45 billion people, we definitely have a lot of infrastructure to build,"" Srivastava said, adding that domestic infrastructure demand is not materially affected by international impulses.

On climate risk, Srivastava said infrastructure projects typically span 20 to 25 years, making climate considerations unavoidable. ""These days, we are designing for climate events,"" he said, citing floods, droughts, cyclones and high-speed winds.

He said design parameters increasingly account for 1.5-degree and 2-degree temperature-rise scenarios, even though this entails additional costs. ""Together with CDRI, we have evolved a framework whereby financing for disaster-resilient infrastructure could be taken up,"" he said.

On funding strategy, he said external commercial borrowings are becoming a structural necessity. ""If I am trying to borrow money for 15 years or 20 years, I am not getting it in the commercial market in India,"" he said.

He added that IIFCL recently raised a 15-year amortising overseas loan at a very competitive cost using structured finance and hedging. ""Hedging is not such an issue,"" he said, noting that international banks can provide all-in hedging solutions.

On currency markets, Srivastava said improved rupee-dollar hedging frameworks could support deeper and more stable derivative markets. ""If DFIs collaborate, we could create economies of scale and get better hedging solutions,"" he said.

Highlighting internal developments, he said IIFCL has constituted 11 task forces to reinvent the institution. ""We are looking at a batch of new product offerings,"" he said, including bridge finance to address the 6 to 18 month delay in financial closure and subordinated debt products to support state governments in projects such as hybrid annuity models.

He said IIFCL is also standardising monitoring, reporting and verification protocols for green finance. ""We want a common MRV protocol,"" he said, so that international green capital does not impose additional conditionalities on Indian institutions.

Srivastava added that IIFCL is strengthening engagement with India-based multilaterals such as the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the Global Bioenergy Alliance as it prepares for the next phase of growth. (ANI)

It also highlights a change in Western strategic thinking, forecasting how multi-polar dynamics are set to evolve globally.
BGN Group, a Swiss-based commodity trader, has secured a series of strategic SAF deals in recent years, designed to decouple aviation fuel supply chains from traditional, often volatile, oil-producing regions.
Growth in Western aviation markets has, likewise, been driven by friendshoring and inter-military cooperation.
Essentially, the expansion of sources for fuel improves strategic autonomy, reduces exposure to hostile supply chains, and ensures stability for future technological development.","The importance of jet fuel to any dynamic military goes without question. Fossil-based jet fuel is a critical commodity of concern for militaries worldwide, yet strategic thinkers, engineers, and leaders in the Royal Air Force (RAF) are exploring alternatives.

Military preparedness does not only require the newest technology; it needs the most advanced sources of energy. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) presents a critical new security asset for defence policies that can reduce dependency on non-renewable sources and fragile fuel supply chains. It also highlights a change in Western strategic thinking, forecasting how multi-polar dynamics are set to evolve globally.

This article is the opinion of the author and not necessarily that of the UK Defence Journal. If you would like to submit your own article on this topic or any other, please see our submission guidelines.

Western air forces face fundamental risks in access to global fossil fuel supply chains, whether from uncertainty in the Middle East, the Caribbean, or unfair trade practices from state-run companies in China or Russia. The RAF is dependent on imported oil, creating higher costs, vulnerable reliance on exporting countries, and inflexibility in military readiness and operational capacity. Using SAF as an alternative fuel actually reduces regular jet fuel use by 50%, with a healthy by-product of reducing carbon emissions by over 80%. SAF works by refining and distilling combustible hydrocarbons derived from fats, oils, wood waste, alcohols, and other organic materials into a fuel that is chemically similar to traditional jet fuel.

The distillation process removes impurities such as sulphur and aromatics, resulting in a cleaner-burning fuel that produces fewer particulates, burns more efficiently, and improves engine performance and longevity. SAF undoubtedly diversifies supply chains, and military demand incentivises chemical engineers to develop new fuels using on-shored production facilities.

The RAF has been flying jets with sustainable aviation fuels since 2021, but recently, Chinese manufacturers have taken the lead in exporting SAF to Europe. Chinese companies are expected to meet state-mandated export quotas, increasing manipulated market competition and raising concerns about the fuel as a strategic security asset. China holds the second-largest aviation market, positioning it to easily overpower Western markets through more streamlined manufacturing and state-run initiatives.

SAF has been costlier than traditional fossil fuels, especially in western markets where production efficiency lacks optimisation, feedstock supplies need expansion, and price differentials remain high. Markets have also lacked crucial intermediaries between innovation and military use. Logistics, aggregation, and cross-border distribution form the connective layer between SAF innovation and military adoption, where firms such as BGN Group operate.

BGN Group, a Swiss-based commodity trader, has secured a series of strategic SAF deals in recent years, designed to decouple aviation fuel supply chains from traditional, often volatile, oil-producing regions. By investing heavily in both infrastructure and supply logistics, the firm sets an example for the private sector to insulate sensitive and overly reliant industries from geopolitical vulnerabilities. These efforts are particularly critical for high-stakes operators like the RAF, where fuel and energy security becomes an issue of national security.

Growth in Western aviation markets has, likewise, been driven by friendshoring and inter-military cooperation. In the United States, for example, alternative fuels are being used to enhance mission flexibility and operational effectiveness, allowing military operations to utilize local or regionally produced fuels even when far from larger bases. SAF technology and information are shared between the US and European states through NATO cooperation, procurement, and shared production contracts. In 2022, the RAF flew a 100% sustainable flight using genetically modified bacteria as a fuel source and flew a drone using a synthetic fuel in collaboration with the US Navy.

In admiration of the success, Defence Procurement Minister Jeremy Quin said, “This is an exciting moment for the RAF and British industry as they continue to develop pioneering solutions to help address climate change. These new approaches will maintain our world-class fighting forces whilst reducing our carbon footprint.” While the US Navy noted that “finding innovative solutions to operational challenges, and the ability to manufacture this fuel without large infrastructure requirements would be ground-breaking for deployed forces.”

Defence industries in both Brussels and Washington are aligning as SAF development improves defensive capabilities and meets carbon emission reduction goals. The Department of Defense has steadily increased funding into the hundreds of millions of dollars for individual grants, research, and SAF procurement pilots. Similarly, offtake agreements across the public and private sectors in Europe and the US are stabilising demand expectations and encouraging long-term market trust and sustainability. In late 2025, three Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) were signed between Houston-based XCF Global (SAFX) and Impact Jets, BGN Group, and FlyORO, each aiming to scale SAF manufacturing, marketing, and supply chain solutions. BGN explicitly builds out supply chains and expands SAF distribution capacity while operating within the Western regulatory environment.

As they note in the MoU, the demand for SAF is expected to grow to 165 billion gallons annually by 2050, requiring the construction of up to 7000 new facilities worldwide. Western-based SAF development will ultimately advance military capacities for the US Air Force and RAF, reinforcing interoperability planning for the alliance and NATO logistics. Early movers in distillation and supply-chain integration will be best positioned to provide essential components and fuels at scale, ensuring allied forces retain operational flexibility in contested environments.

Team Washington refocused its national security strategy in 2025; however, the new emphasis on ‘America First’ military preparedness still shows strong compatibility with Brussels’ interest in climate sustainability, especially in the area of SAF. Western markets remain poised to scale transformative fuel solutions like SAF, innovating in collaboration through mutual understandings, military cooperation, and directed investments. Industrial alignment and technological transfer is increasing as well, with logistics networks from companies like BGN further supporting British and American strategic interests by participating in IATA trade rules, Western aviation standards, and international rule-of-law norms.

SAF acts as a transition technology, advancing sustainability and military competitiveness. It bridges innovative creators with real defensive needs from Western militaries, practically fulfilling security needs in unforeseen ways. Essentially, the expansion of sources for fuel improves strategic autonomy, reduces exposure to hostile supply chains, and ensures stability for future technological development. In the recent past, impetus for change was largely driven by ESG initiatives and climate narratives; now, however, it is clear that SAF is needed for competitive advantage. Competition with Chinese or Russian manufacturing is important globally, but Western militaries should be aware of supply chain dangers as China aims to dominate the market. SAF technology offers a solution to new thinking about energy independence and resilience, especially when advanced through open-market aligned firms. With the proper investment and government direction, SAF will serve to prepare militaries in new, more cost-effective ways while improving geopolitical autonomy in an increasingly multi-polar world.",https://ukdj.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2024/01/83EAG-20240111-RUSHES-VOYAGER-TYPHOON-TAKEOFFS-002.00_02_37_05.Still018-copy.jpg.iCfh04veMWATAA.0i83YNt8pv.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 06:56:12.161269

Shell plc is no longer just an oil company. It is positioning itself as a full-stack energy and chemicals platform that sells molecules, electrons, and infrastructure across the entire value chain. From liquefied natural gas (LNG) and advanced petrochemicals to EV charging networks and renewable power trading, Shell plc is trying to turn a legacy hydrocarbon engine into a diversified energy machine that can survive — and profit — in a decarbonizing world.

This evolution matters because the traditional playbook for integrated oil and gas companies is under existential pressure. Investors want cash returns, regulators want emissions cuts, and customers want energy that is cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable. Shell plc’s core product today is not a single asset or technology, but an ecosystem: a global portfolio of upstream production, LNG, refining, petrochemicals, power trading, and customer-facing businesses, all wrapped in a narrative of ""orderly transition"" rather than abrupt disruption.

Inside the Flagship: Shell plc

When analysts talk about Shell plc as a product, they are increasingly talking about a portfolio architecture rather than a single headline asset. The company has been reshaping that architecture around several flagship pillars.

1. LNG and gas-centric energy

Shell is one of the world’s largest LNG players, and this is arguably its most defensible and differentiated product line. Through projects in Qatar, Australia, the U.S., and West Africa, Shell plc markets LNG as a transition fuel that can backstop intermittent renewables and displace coal. Its LNG trading, shipping, and regasification infrastructure create a global platform that smaller rivals struggle to match.

Beyond production, Shell’s integrated gas unit acts like a high-frequency logistics and arbitrage machine: buying, routing, blending, and selling cargoes into price-sensitive markets in Europe and Asia. That flexibility became a critical product feature when Russian pipeline gas to Europe collapsed; Shell plc’s LNG portfolio effectively became part of Europe’s energy security toolkit.

2. Integrated refining, chemicals, and low-carbon fuels

Shell has been pruning its older, less efficient refineries and retooling some into so-called ""energy and chemicals parks."" These assets are designed to shift from classic fuels into higher-margin and lower-carbon products: biofuels, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), lubricants, and performance chemicals.

At facilities like Shell’s Energy and Chemicals Park in Rotterdam and its operations in Singapore, the company is investing in renewable diesel, advanced biofuels made from waste feedstocks, and technologies to cut emissions intensity via electrification and carbon capture. The pitch is simple: if Shell can turn refineries into multi-output, lower-carbon product hubs, it can keep the infrastructure advantages of being a supermajor while aligning with net-zero policies.

3. Power, renewables, and EV charging

Shell plc’s growth-facing product set sits in its power and renewables portfolio and its global mobility business. Under the Shell Recharge brand, the company operates thousands of EV charge points across Europe, North America, and Asia, often integrated into its existing retail service stations. This allows Shell to use legacy real estate as a bridge from liquid fuels to electrons.

Beyond charging, Shell has been building a position in power generation and trading: offshore and onshore wind, solar farms, grid-scale batteries, and virtual power plants aggregating distributed energy resources. The company is less a pure-play green generator and more a power-market operator, using its trading DNA to balance intermittency and optimize pricing. For large corporates, Shell plc increasingly sells power purchase agreements (PPAs) and bundled decarbonization solutions rather than just diesel or gas.

4. Customer solutions and digitalization

On the customer side, Shell plc is wrapping all of this into more integrated offerings: fleet solutions that combine fuel cards, EV charging, telematics, and route optimization; B2B decarbonization packages blending biofuels, offsets, and consultancy; and digital apps that link retail fuels, charging, and loyalty programs.

The unifying theme is that Shell is trying to move from commodity seller to service provider. While molecules and megawatt-hours are still the revenue engine, the differentiation increasingly comes from integration, optionality, and data.

Market Rivals: Royal Dutch Shell A (alt) -> Shell plc vs. The Competition

Shell plc does not operate in a vacuum. Its closest peers are other European integrated energy majors that are undergoing their own transitions: BP plc and TotalEnergies SE are the most direct competitors, with ExxonMobil and Chevron acting as U.S.-centric hydrocarbon counterpoints.

BP: The ""Reinvented"" Energy Company

Compared directly to BP’s integrated energy portfolio, Shell plc looks more conservative but also more balanced. BP spent the early 2020s branding itself around aggressive renewables growth, from offshore wind auctions to large solar pipelines. It positioned EV charging under the BP Pulse brand and chased early-mover status in green power retail in markets like the UK and Germany.

However, BP backtracked on some of its most ambitious targets under investor pressure to prioritize returns from oil and gas. Shell plc, by contrast, set less extreme renewables volume targets but focused heavily on LNG and cash generation, using those flows to fund both shareholder returns and selective low-carbon bets.

In practical product terms:

Renewables and power: BP has been more aggressive in headline gigawatt-scale wind and solar projects. Shell plc leans more on LNG and power trading, plus targeted renewables plays where it can monetize volatility.

EV charging: BP Pulse vs. Shell Recharge is a tightly contested race. Shell’s advantage is its vast retail footprint and its ability to bundle charging with convenience retail and fleet services.

Hydrocarbon core: Shell’s LNG portfolio is widely viewed as stronger and more global than BP’s, giving Shell plc a more differentiated gas product.

TotalEnergies: The Multi-Energy Challenger

Compared directly to TotalEnergies’ multi-energy platform, Shell plc faces a rival that has arguably been more coherent in its rebranding from oil major to energy major. TotalEnergies has leaned hard into utility-scale solar and onshore renewables, building pipelines that make it look, in certain markets, as much like a power company as an oil company.

Yet Shell maintains several edges:

LNG scale: While TotalEnergies is a serious LNG player, Shell plc’s LNG trading and shipping network remains the industry benchmark. For customers buying flexible gas supply, that matters.

Retail and mobility: Shell operates one of the world’s largest fuel retail networks, and its pivot to EV charging and convenience retail at scale gives it a consumer presence TotalEnergies is still scaling toward.

Power trading: Shell’s capabilities in energy trading — both physical and financial — give it a formidable position as power markets get more volatile.

ExxonMobil and Chevron: Hydrocarbon Maximalists

Compared directly to ExxonMobil’s upstream-heavy portfolio and Chevron’s hydrocarbon-centered strategy, Shell plc looks more diversified and more aligned with European-style climate regulation. The U.S. majors are focusing on oil, gas, and carbon capture & storage (CCS) with far less emphasis on renewables and EV charging.

This divergence creates a clear competitive contrast:

Shell plc offers institutional investors a way to stay exposed to hydrocarbons, LNG, and cash flows while also owning a real — though still minority — stake in renewables, power, and EV infrastructure.

ExxonMobil and Chevron are effectively pure-play bets on a slower energy transition, while Shell positions itself as a hedge on both speed and direction of change.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Shell plc’s core advantage isn’t that it is the greenest, nor that it is the purest hydrocarbon play. Its edge is that it is building an integrated, transition-ready product stack that can flex depending on how policy, technology, and demand actually evolve.

1. LNG as a strategic backbone

LNG is the closest thing Shell plc has to a flagship product. It underpins the company’s narrative that natural gas will remain essential for power generation, industry, and heating for decades, particularly in Asia and Europe. Shell’s scale in LNG production, shipping, and marketing means it can arbitrage regional price differences and respond quickly when crises hit, as Europe’s gas crunch starkly demonstrated.

Where competitors might own impressive individual LNG assets, Shell plc owns a system. That system-level advantage is difficult and slow to replicate, making LNG a durable differentiator.

2. A portfolio built for optionality

Shell’s strategy emphasizes ""disciplined"" capital allocation into low-carbon businesses rather than all-out land-grabs. This has drawn criticism from climate advocates who want faster decarbonization, but from a product perspective it delivers optionality: if certain technologies — say hydrogen or advanced biofuels — scale successfully and profitably, Shell plc is positioned to ramp up; if they stall, it has not overcommitted.

This optionality-based approach differentiates Shell from BP’s earlier high-ambition renewables push and from Exxon’s low-renewables, CCS-heavy path. Shell plc is essentially selling investors a conviction-lite transition product: meaningful exposure to new energy, but not at the expense of short- and medium-term returns.

3. Customer integration and brand

Few energy companies have the consumer-facing footprint of Shell plc. Millions of daily retail transactions at service stations, a rapidly expanding Shell Recharge EV charging network, and deep relationships with commercial fleets give Shell data, loyalty, and cross-selling opportunities that utilities and pure-play renewables developers lack.

When a logistics company wants to decarbonize, Shell can offer a bundled solution: biofuels and lubricants now, EV and hydrogen options later, digital fleet optimization in the background. That integrated offer is a product in its own right, and it is harder for narrower competitors to match.

4. Trading and risk management as a product layer

As grids fill with variable renewables and as LNG and power markets become more volatile, trading and risk management become central to the value proposition. Here, Shell plc’s decades of experience in commodities trading turn into a software-like moat: complex models, algorithms, and human expertise that help customers manage price swings and supply risks.

Where some competitors sell energy units, Shell increasingly sells energy plus optionality, plus risk hedging — a higher-value bundle that leverages its scale.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

On the financial side, Shell plc — listed in London and other exchanges under ISIN NL0000009827 — remains a bellwether for how markets price the energy transition.

Real-time snapshot

As of the latest market data checked via multiple financial sources (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch) on a recent trading day, Shell plc’s stock was trading in line with other European energy majors, with valuation metrics reflecting a blend of classic oil & gas cash generation and cautious growth expectations in low-carbon segments. When markets are closed, investors focus on the last close price and the trailing performance over the preceding months, which has broadly tracked the swings in oil and gas prices as well as macroeconomic sentiment.

Importantly, the stock remains highly correlated with commodity cycles, but the narrative around it is shifting: investors increasingly scrutinize not just how much capital Shell returns via buybacks and dividends, but also where it allocates growth spend — LNG expansions, refinery-to-chemicals conversions, EV charging rollouts, renewables, and power trading capabilities.

Product portfolio as a valuation driver

The success of Shell plc’s product strategy influences its stock in several ways:

Cash engines: Upstream oil, gas, and LNG remain the core cash machines. Strong performance here funds shareholder distributions and underwrites investments in transition businesses. When these segments deliver high margins, markets are more tolerant of moderate spending on low-carbon projects.

Growth options: EV charging, renewables, and power trading are treated as long-dated growth options. Clear evidence of profitability or scalable competitive advantage in these areas can support a higher valuation multiple versus pure hydrocarbon peers.

Risk profile: A credible transition plan with tangible assets — energy and chemicals parks, LNG expansion, grid-scale renewables, and charging networks — helps reduce regulatory and stranded-asset risk in the eyes of ESG-sensitive investors.

Is it a growth driver?

Right now, Shell plc’s low-carbon and power businesses function more as strategic hedge and optionality than as the primary earnings engine. The growth story is that, over time, a larger share of Shell’s EBITDA will come from power, low-carbon fuels, and customer-centric energy solutions, supported by the LNG backbone.

For investors, Shell plc is effectively a transition hybrid: still heavily dependent on fossil-based revenues, but with a visible — if gradual — reallocation of capital toward products and platforms aligned with a lower-carbon future. How well Shell executes on this product roadmap will determine whether its stock continues to trade primarily as a cyclical oil play or earns a re-rating as a diversified, transition-resilient energy platform.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405014_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 08:56:49.425679

The future e-commerce air cargo ecosystem will be less about chasing spikes and more about managing predictable, data-driven flows.
As the global supply chain continues to digitalise, the distinction between e-commerce logistics and traditional airfreight will continue to widen.
The continued rise of e-commerce is not simply a trend; it is the foundation of a new air cargo era.","E-commerce has reshaped the world’s air cargo networks at breathtaking speed, and digitalisation, data, and collaboration are key to maximising the benefits.

What began as a small stream of lightweight ‘parcels’ has evolved into one of the industry’s strongest and most resilient growth engines, with volumes acting as a stabilising base amid cyclical downturns.

Even amid global trade uncertainty, capacity fluctuations, and cost pressures, e-commerce operations have continued to grow and evolve, especially in the last 10 years.

While e-commerce growth stabilised following the pandemic-driven surge, e-commerce sales surpassed $6.3trn in 2024 and are forecast to reach $8trn by 2027, according to eMarketer.

Online retail has continued to expand across emerging markets, with Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East showing some of the world’s fastest growth rates.

While maritime and road transport handle the bulk of total e-commerce tonnage, air remains indispensable for cross-border, time-sensitive, and high-value shipments, particularly in the fast-moving sectors of electronics, fashion and healthcare.

Cross-border e-commerce has become a defining force in international logistics. According to IATA, cross-border shipments now represent up to 25% of global air cargo volumes, driven largely by consumer expectations for rapid fulfilment and visibility.

For airports, airlines, cargo ground handlers, and integrators, this segment oﬀers both promise and pressure. Consistent demand is paired with operational complexity that requires agility, digitalisation, and collaboration.

Harnessing technology is key to ensuring the air cargo industry will adapt to sustain and profit from e-commerce over the long term, while embracing flexibility is crucial to effectively deal with challenges.

One such challenge has been the legislative crackdowns on e-commerce this year.

The end of the de minimis exemption in the US saw volumes shift from China-US to China-Europe, demonstrating that the whole industry needs to be alert to how quickly demand and supply chains can shift, although volumes to the US have recovered and not to the detriment of volumes to Europe.

Meanwhile, European Union (EU) member states have agreed to introduce a €3 customs duty per item on e-commerce parcels valued below €150 from July 2026, to bridge the gap until the setting up of the EU Customs Data Hub in 2028. The UK also plans to end the de minimis exemption by March 2029 at the latest.

Rethinking networks and fleets

Airlines have also been forced to rethink the very structure of their cargo networks to support e-commerce developments.

The traditional long-haul, palletised model is evolving toward higher-frequency, regionalised operations, which emphasise speed, predictability, and often smaller shipment sizes.

Airlines are now actively adjusting fleet strategies to align with this demand. Narrowbody and converted freighters, such as 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighters (BCFs) and Airbus A321 passenger to freighter (P2F) conversions, are increasingly deployed to feed major hubs and connect secondary e-commerce gateways.

These aircraft oﬀer the flexibility and cost-eﬃciency needed for dense, high-frequency routes.

Some airlines are taking it further by developing dedicated e-commerce divisions or product verticals. China Airlines, Lufthansa Cargo, and Emirates SkyCargo, among others, have introduced specialised e-commerce solutions that blend air transport with digital order management and last-mile partnerships.

Meanwhile, integrators like FedEx, UPS, and DHL Express continue to expand regional air networks in Asia-Pacific to shorten delivery cycles and support marketplace-driven fulfilment models.

The smaller, high-turnover shipments typical of this trade generate a strong yield per kilogram compared to traditional freight, despite their operational complexity.

From a revenue perspective, e-commerce is reshaping yield management. The smaller, high-turnover shipments typical of this trade generate a strong yield per kilogram compared to traditional freight, despite their operational complexity.

The challenge lies in achieving density and optimising capacity utilisation, especially when balancing postal, express, and general cargo flows on the same aircraft. Air cargo revenue management requires expertise.

Grounding eﬃciency

If airlines are the lift, ground handlers are the pulse of the e-commerce air cargo chain on the ground.

The volume and velocity of e-commerce shipments demand ground operations that incorporate automation, smart data flows, and precision timing.

This is confirmed by Nikolai Schaﬀener, global head of commercial, Swissport International. He says: “Ultimately, the cargo ground handler’s core business is to serve its airline customers. A mindset change is, however, required.

“Swissport encourages the entire community to look beyond the airline customer and provide a larger contribution to the overall air cargo ecosystem. This leads to increased collaboration where there is mutual willingness to do so. It requires entrepreneurial thinking in how the system works.”

The average e-commerce consignment is smaller, less uniform, and less predictable than traditional air cargo. A single flight can carry thousands of individual parcels, each with its own label and data record. For cargo handlers, this translates to higher handling intensity on a piece level and shorter processing windows.

To meet these challenges, major ground handling companies are investing heavily in digital infrastructure and automation.

Schaﬀner confirms: “Our focus is on a digital toolkit that enables transparency and consistency across our global network. We ensure that our Cargo Management System, Cargospot, is installed at each location globally. This enables standardised messaging and communication with our supply chain stakeholders.”

Many airports, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Liege and Leipzig, are developing e-commerce-dedicated terminals, often in partnership with integrators, airlines or large e-commerce platforms.

This includes Swissport with Schaﬀner confirming that “there is huge potential in first- and second-line warehousing”.

He adds: “This has taken place, for example, in our network in Liege and Amsterdam with ‘tailor-made’ handling solutions which are combined under one operational roof.

”Workforce dynamics are also shifting. Automation works hand in hand with manpower to provide the best and most efficient service to our customers.”

Handlers are trying to upskill their workforce to manage data-driven processes, exception handling, and digital traceability through a variety of change management programmes that include third-party workforce models.

These models often provide a great flexibility in the ‘plug and play’ approach, but ultimately, as Schaﬀner states, “the responsibility of delivery towards the customer is not outsourced”.

The future cargo terminal is as much about systems integration as it is about people, forklifts and mobile workstations.

Data handling capability

If e-commerce is the demand engine, data is the fuel. The modern e-commerce shipment travels first through networks of information before it even reaches the aircraft. Transparency, predictability, and digital compliance are non-negotiable.

The industry’s collective digitalisation push is accelerating. IATA’s ONE Record initiative, due to be implemented by 1 January 2026, is a key component to this evolution as it is designed to replace the legacy patchwork of messaging standards with a single, standardised data-sharing model.

With ONE Record, all stakeholders from airlines and handlers to customs and forwarders can access and update the same set of shipment data in real time.

The actual uptake in the industry, however, remains to be seen. It’s not just about the big players; it’s about the larger number of small- and medium-sized organisations at both ends of the supply chain.

This harmonisation is essential for e-commerce, where speed and visibility are critical diﬀerentiators. The goal is to move from a document-driven process to a data-centric supply chain, enabling faster clearance, pre-alerted handling, and predictive exception management.

Complementary eﬀorts such as Cargo iQ performance standards, electronic Air Waybill (e-AWB) adoption, and the expansion of API-based integrations between logistics tech providers are pushing the industry toward true end-to-end transparency, but there is a long way to go.

Airlines and cargo ground handlers are increasingly deploying machine learning models to forecast eCommerce peaks, predict oﬄoad risks, enable network steering, and dynamically allocate resources.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics are also taking hold. Airlines and cargo ground handlers are increasingly deploying machine learning models to forecast eCommerce peaks, predict oﬄoad risks, enable network steering, and dynamically allocate resources.

Customs authorities in several regions, particularly within the EU and Southeast Asia are exploring pre-clearance models using shared data pipelines — allowing shipments to clear before they even land.

The next phase will be interoperability — creating a unified digital language across diﬀerent cargo management systems, marketplaces, and logistics platforms. This is where the real eﬃciency gains will emerge.

Key challenges and constraints

Despite its momentum, the e-commerce air cargo ecosystem faces structural challenges that must be addressed for long-term sustainability.

1. Infrastructure pressure:

Major airport gateways such as Hong Kong, Incheon, Liege, and Amsterdam are seeing record volumes of small parcels, often stretching terminal capacity and sorting capabilities. Without investment in automation and smarter flow management, bottlenecks risk negating air transport’s speed advantage.

2. Data fragmentation:

While digitalisation is advancing, the global picture remains uneven. Many smaller forwarders and handlers still operate on manual or legacy systems. Without the broad adoption of common standards, the full benefits of ONE Record and similar initiatives cannot be realised.

3. Labour and skill shortages:

Handling e-commerce cargo eﬃciently requires both technology and skilled operators. Shortages in ramp and warehouse labour, combined with the need for digitally proficient staﬀ, continue to challenge throughput consistency — particularly in high-volume hubs.

4. Sustainability and public perception:

The e-commerce consumer’s desire for next-day delivery often clashes with growing scrutiny over the carbon footprint of aviation and logistics. Airlines are accelerating the shift toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and fleet renewal, while logistics providers are investing in electric ground vehicles and optimised routing. But achieving measurable progress requires coordinated industry eﬀort and transparent reporting.

Will e-commerce ever plateau?

In the near to medium term, the answer appears to be no. The rate of e-commerce growth may normalise, but it will remain a key driver of air cargo demand.

Delivery expectations are shifting from pure speed to predictability, visibility, and sustainability. Marketplaces and platforms will continue to consolidate their logistics ecosystems, with air cargo serving as the premium layer for time-definite deliveries and high-value goods.

What’s more, new product categories are entering the air e-commerce pipeline. Pharmaceuticals, temperature-sensitive goods, and direct-to-patient healthcare logistics are increasingly adopting the e-commerce model, further integrating traditional special handling cargo with retail distribution dynamics.

As automation and data maturity improve, we may see capacity planning evolve from reactive to predictive. Airlines could dynamically allocate belly space or freighter capacity based on e-commerce demand forecasts linked directly to online sales data.

The future e-commerce air cargo ecosystem will be less about chasing spikes and more about managing predictable, data-driven flows.

Collaborative future

E-commerce has, perhaps unintentionally, become the catalyst for long-needed transformation in the air cargo industry. It has forced stakeholders to confront fragmentation, data silos, and ineﬃciency head-on, therefore driving a collective shift toward integration.

Standardisation is there; it’s been around for a long time through IATA industry standards. But the old-time pain point of adoption is what’s needed to really embed this.

The most successful players will be those who view e-commerce not as a commodity flow but as a collaborative digital ecosystem. Airlines will need to forge freighter partnerships with cargo handlers, postal operators and platforms.

Handlers will need to invest in transparent systems that connect directly to airline and forwarder platforms. Regulators and customs authorities, too, will need to align on data-driven compliance models to enable true global harmonisation.

In this interconnected future, information becomes as valuable as cargo space. Data visibility, operational agility, and sustainable performance will define competitiveness far more than rate per kilo or transit time.

E-commerce has made the sector faster, smarter, and more customer-centric, but also more complex and data-dependent, which is the acceleration that’s been needed for several years to ensure the supply chain truly adopts the digital era.

As the global supply chain continues to digitalise, the distinction between e-commerce logistics and traditional airfreight will continue to widen.

The goal now is to ensure that the entire air cargo ecosystem, from the shipper to the consignee, moves in digital harmony.

The continued rise of e-commerce is not simply a trend; it is the foundation of a new air cargo era. Those who invest early in digital connectivity, harmonisation, and sustainable innovation will not only meet the challenge but define the standard for what comes next.",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/6/2/12262_jameswyattphotoaeroconcept_776922.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 03:57:02.014253

Multiple industry stakeholders and association leaders have gone on record to say that, as far as U.S. ethanol production and opportunity go, Nebraska is second to none.

With 11 (and counting) confirmed plants either sending CO2 through the pipeline or in various stages of work to do so, producers in the Cornhusker State are playing a major role in the latest chapter of the American ethanol success story, says Ben Rhodes, executive director of the Nebraska Ethanol Board. “There has never been a better time than now to be a Nebraska ethanol producer,” Rhodes says.

Don’t be fooled by any perceived bias Rhodes may have for the state he works for. Shortly after the Tallgrass pipeline was officially placed into operation in fall 2025, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw offered his take.

“For the first time since 2000, Iowa is no longer the best place to produce corn ethanol,” Shaw said. “The plants on the Tallgrass pipeline now have a leg up in many ways.”

Plants on the Pipeline

Although it might be hard to determine which ethanol plant agreed in some fashion to participate in the Trailblazer pipeline first, there is no doubt that the first to ship real CO2 was Mid America Agri Products/Wheatland. The western Nebraska plant is the closest to Wyoming where the CO2 will be sequestered.

On Oct. 3, 2025, the plant in Madrid, Nebraska, about an hour southwest of North Platte, became the first customer to ship, according to Steven Davidson, Tallgrass’ vice president of government affairs. The original Trailblazer line flowed in the opposite direction than it does now and has transitioned from moving natural gas to compressed CO2.

For the MAAPW team, the Trailblazer announcement was the culmination of plant founder Robert “Bob” Lundeen’s last great project before his passing. Tina Lundeen Smith, executive vice president of business development at MAAPW, says her father Bob believed ethanol’s future depended on bold investment.

“Thanks to the vision of Nebraskans like Bob Lundeen, the state is now positioned at the forefront of the biofuel industry,” said Alison Nelson, segment president of CO2 business development and origination for Tallgrass at the time of the MAAPW announcement. “We are incredibly proud to work alongside MAAPW and others across Nebraska to make large-scale carbon capture a reality and demonstrate how rural economies can thrive while setting the standard for global energy innovation.”

MAAPW’s announcement was released on a Friday. By Tuesday the following week, Green Plains Inc. announced that it was successful in its startup of carbon capture and storage equipment at its 50 MMgy York, Nebraska, ethanol plant. The company’s 116 MMgy plant in Central City and 121 MMgy plant in Wood River, both in Nebraska, followed closely behind.

Carbon capture and sequestration via pipeline at York has long been part of Green Plains’ carbon strategy, says Chris Osowski, CEO. The three Green Plains Nebraska plants will contribute CO2 from 287 MMgy of ethanol production.

POET will connect its Fairmont, Nebraska, bioprocessing facility to Trailblazer, as well. The world’s largest producer of biofuels announced an agreement with Tallgrass in February 2025. At press time, no official announcement that POET was operating on Trailblazer has been made yet, but the company said in its initial February statement that once the Trailblazer was up and running in 2025, POET would have connectivity in the “near-term.”

ADM has also begun capturing and shipping CO2 on Trailblazer. With its Columbus, Nebraska, ethanol complex, ADM says it has the world’s largest ethanol carbon capture facility in the world. The 100 MMgy wet mill was connected to the Trailblazer by lateral lines using only voluntary easements by landowners, according to ADM. Like Green Plains, ADM’s team said the CCS project linked to the Trailblazer is a key part of its decarbonization strategy.

“This is an exciting project for the industry and for the future of CCS technology,” says Chris Cuddy, president, North America at ADM.

KAAPA Ethanol Holdings, an ethanol producer now owning and operating multiple plants in areas of close proximity to Trailblazer, also sees the pipeline as an important strategy for its future. Although the company had not yet announced its official operational status on the pipeline at press time, it is committed and has already invested in connecting its ethanol plants in Aurora and Ravenna.

In Lexington and Hastings, Nebraska, Chief Ethanol has connected two plants—fermentation CO2 from a combined 125 MMgy of ethanol production—to the Trailblazer pipeline. In October 2025, the company replaced its old scrubber with a new, larger CO2 scrubber to clean up the CO2 that leaves the fermenters prior to capture. The new unit has dramatically decreased the plant’s water use, according to Brent Jessop, manager at Chief Ethanol.

On the border of Nebraska and Iowa, the team at 140 MMgy Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy is working to connect to Trailblazer by mid-2026. Retired former CEO Mike Jerke has been active in his support of Trailblazer, writing letters to the Iowa Governor to effect legislation that would benefit the pipeline.

Commitment to Community

Advocates like Rhodes cite a unique aspect of the Trailblazer pipeline that was crucial to its ultimate success. Through the Trailblazer Community Benefits Agreement, ethanol producers will support direct funding to landowners who have agreed to site the pipeline on their properties in addition to the communities hosting infrastructure. The agreement also created rigorous landowner rights through the entire lifecycle of the pipeline.

Tallgrass formed the benefits agreement with the input and help of several organizations, including: Renewable Fuels Nebraska, Nebraska State Volunteer Firefighters Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Cattlemen, Nebraska Farmers Union, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Sorghum Producers Association, Nebraska State Dairy Association, Nebraska Pork Producers Association and We Support AG. Bold Alliance, an organization formed to build “unlikely alliances to protect the land and water,” was also a big partner helping to form the agreement.

Monetary funding through the agreement also includes $500,000 commitments to nonprofits in the counties associated with the project. Another $400,000 commitment goes to first responders throughout the development of the pipeline, in addition to ongoing funding for essential equipment once the project is operational. If the pipeline is decommissioned, the easements will be returned to landowners who may elect to have the pipeline abandoned in place or removed from their property.

“Tallgrass is the first pipeline company we have encountered that has been willing to engage proactively, acknowledge the need for the landowner benefits that Bold fights to achieve, and genuinely commit itself to addressing those benefits by written agreement,” says Jane Kleeb, founder of Bold Alliance.

Close But Not Connected

Several more ethanol plants throughout Nebraska are close to the Trailblazer line but have not invested or committed to it. Some of those plants already have plans for alternative CO2 capture options.

Bridgeport Ethanol in far southwest Nebraska is working with Carbon America on a sequestration well and underground pipeline project. Through their agreement, Carbon America will finance, build, own and operate the CCS system utilizing CO2 produced from Bridgeport.

Valero Renewable Fuels - Albion, is on the Northern proximity of the Trailblazer line but the company has already committed to the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions option that would capture CO2 from several states before terminating in North Dakota.

Nebraska Corn Processing LLC in Cambridge, Nebraska, near the Kansas border, has no public plans for CO2 capture to date. Trenton Agri Products LLC, another southwestern Nebraska ethanol plant, has previously explored CO2 capture and sequestration options due to its location within a potential geologic formation capable of storing CO2.

Significance of Success

To Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, Trailblazer is a major step forward in proving what’s possible with CCS. It’s potential lies in more than its link to sustainable aviation fuel, he says.

“The most important point is this: Carbon capture isn’t some someday idea,” he says. “It’s happening right now. States that are embracing this technology are building new markets for ethanol, creating jobs, spurring rural economies and supporting farmers.”

States that are “slow-walking,” as Buis says, or blocking progress, run the risk of falling behind.

Rhodes and his team at NEB worked with Tallgrass to enable Trailblazer’s success, through educating audiences around the state about its benefits. The excitement surrounding the reality of the pipeline has prompted high hopes for 2026. It could be another banner year for the state, Rhodes says, as the team continues to work on forward-thinking research projects and developing new opportunities.

Buis says there is much to learn from the work of Rhodes and the success of the Trailblazer in Nebraska. Carbon capture succeeds when stakeholders stay focused, protect local economies and keep rural industries competitive, he says.

“Another lesson is that carbon capture is the future and long-term play,” he says. “The industry has to be proactive, whether its upgrading technology, building partnerships with farmers or preparing to meet standards.”

The Trailblazer ultimately succeeded, Buis says, because state leaders stepped up and saw the value early. Then, they worked to give energy producers and rural communities a fair, predictable permitting process. They focused on science, safety and what the project meant for Nebraska farmers, ethanol plants and long-term economic growth.

“We are at a tipping point and if America fails to lead, countries like Brazil, China and others will gladly step in to meet the demand for low-carbon fuels,” Buis says. “That means jobs, innovation and revenue leaving the Midwest (and the U.S.) and never coming back.”

Its extensive portfolio encompasses commercial jet engines, aircraft interiors, avionics, landing systems, military propulsion, and initiatives aimed at sustainable aviation. The company’s influence extends across multiple dimensions: enabling airlines to reduce fuel consumption, assisting air forces in modernizing their fleets, and supporting Europe’s strategic pursuit of aerospace autonomy.

Safran confronts a complex array of challenges, including the urgent need for aviation to decarbonize, reduce operating costs, and reinforce supply chains amid geopolitical uncertainties. Concurrently, defense clients demand enhanced range, stealth capabilities, and independence from foreign technologies. Positioned at the nexus of these pressures, Safran leverages its deep expertise in propulsion and avionics to reshape both the economics and capabilities of flight.

Propulsion at the Core

Central to Safran’s integrated portfolio is its propulsion and systems business, which serves both commercial and military aircraft. This ecosystem is anchored by several key pillars.

At the forefront of Safran’s commercial strategy is its 50/50 joint venture with GE Aerospace, CFM International, which produces the CFM LEAP engine family. These engines power prominent aircraft models such as the Airbus A320neo, Boeing 737 MAX, and COMAC C919. Safran supplies critical components including high-pressure turbines and advanced composite materials. The LEAP engine achieves significant fuel-burn reductions compared to its predecessors, driven by innovations such as advanced composite fan blades and cases that reduce weight and enhance efficiency, 3D-woven composite materials that improve hot-section durability, and a high-bypass architecture that enables quieter and more efficient operation. These technological advances directly contribute to lowering airline fuel costs and carbon dioxide emissions, positioning Safran at the forefront of aviation’s decarbonization efforts.

Looking to the future, Safran is co-developing the CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program, which introduces an open-fan propulsion concept designed to deliver up to 20% additional fuel savings. The RISE engine features an unducted open-fan design that achieves ultra-high bypass ratios, hybrid-electric capabilities that anticipate evolving power grids and airframe technologies, and full compatibility with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from the outset.

Navigating a Competitive Landscape

Safran’s leadership in aerospace innovation faces mounting challenges. The civil engine market is expected to become increasingly competitive, with 2026 potentially marking the beginning of a new “engine war” as rivals accelerate their technological advancements. In response, Safran has undertaken strategic initiatives such as divesting its in-flight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) unit to Kingswood and integrating Skyted’s silent call technology into its passenger connectivity systems. These moves reflect the company’s efforts to sharpen its focus and maintain a competitive edge.

At the same time, competitors are advancing rapidly. Saab is developing software-defined fuselage technology, while Gogo’s Galileo system is poised to enter the inflight connectivity market, intensifying the race for technological supremacy.

As the aviation and defense industries confront increasing demands for efficiency, sustainability, and resilience, Safran S.A. remains a pivotal, though often unseen, force shaping the future of flight. Its capacity to innovate across propulsion, systems, and connectivity will influence not only its own trajectory but also the broader evolution of the aerospace sector.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/2e7d79cab3be4cdb8609be55c3bea04e.avif,N,,2026-01-10 00:57:28.757370

On Thursday, Washington leaders launched a nonprofit committed to sustainable aviation fuel, which promises to reduce aviation carbon emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The nonprofit, called the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, secured $20 million from state funding and a private donation to de-risk” the production of sustainable aviation fuel, making it easier for companies, universities and institutions to study, develop and, eventually, produce the alternative fuel source.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been in the works for nearly two decades, but the industry has not taken off. SAF is slow and costly to produce and, though the technology is mature, there are few facilities producing the alternative fuel.

SAF accounted for less than 1% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to a December report from the International Air Transport Association.

On Thursday, Washington’s elected officials and aviation leaders gathered at Boeing’s Future of Flight museum in Mukilteo to celebrate the new initiative. Leaders from Boeing, Alaska, Amazon, Washington State University and the state Department of Commerce pledged again and again that Washington would be at the forefront of sustainable aviation, carrying on a legacy of aviation firsts in the state.

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said.

“You have a partner in the state of Washington,” he told the aviation industry. “For this truly historic opportunity, we have to move our state forward.”

SAF is an alternative to petroleum that makes fuel from so-called “feedstocks. There are several ways to make it, but all capture gases from renewable sources, like used cooking oils or animal waste. After a complicated process, SAF is eventually mixed with traditional jet fuel to lower carbon emissions during flight.

The accelerator introduced Thursday is meant to speed up both research and production, which will enable the state to produce SAF on a large scale. It will put Washington at the forefront of what the state expects will be the next economic boom in the aviation industry, the nonprofit’s leaders said.

Washington already passed legislation to accelerate permitting and environmental review for construction of clean energy plants and introduced a tax credit that provides subsidies for SAF.

At the celebratory event Thursday, Boeing announced that, starting this year, all its flights for operations and deliveries from Renton, Everett and Paine Field will fly on up to 30% SAF.

And SkyNRG, a Dutch company building a sustainable fuel production facility in Walla Walla, said Thursday it had completed state and county environmental reviews that will allow it to move forward with construction.

A ‘catalyst’ for the industry

The aviation industry has been chasing SAF for decades. Boeing conducted the world’s first test flight powered by biofuels with Virgin Atlantic in 2008.

Yet SAF production accounted for just 0.6% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to the December report from the International Air Transport Association.

SAF production doubled from 2024 to 2025, IATA found, totaling about 634 million gallons last year. For comparison, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport alone uses about 600 million gallons of jet fuel annually, according to the Port of Seattle.

The alternative fuel is also still pricey, IATA found. In 2025, the extra costs associated with SAF added $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the aviation industry.

On Thursday, Washington’s aviation industry nonetheless projected optimism. The accelerator it introduced is meant to tackle those problems, its supporters repeated over the course of the event.

Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell told the group “it’s probably late to the game to begin solving it at this scale, but it’s not too little. It’s exactly what’s needed.”

The accelerator’s list of partners is extensive: Alaska Airlines, Amazon, Boeing, the Port of Seattle, Snohomish County, the state Department of Commerce and Washington State University.

The group received $10 million in state appropriations last year and another $10 million from a philanthropic gift, said Sen. Marko Liias, a Democrat representing Edmonds. “We are now sitting on $20 million to catalyze this industry,” he said.

It’s not clear how far that funding will go, though.

SkyNRG, the Dutch company, originally estimated it would need $600 million to $800 million to get its facility up and running.

SkyNRG plant moves forward

John Plaza, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, acknowledged at Thursday’s event that the industry has more demand for SAF than supply, but urged attendees to consider how far the initiative has come in the last 20 years.

“Lots of people like to say ‘there’s not enough SAF, we haven’t made enough progress,’” Plaza said. “Today, we’re past the theory. We’re into the implementation.”

SkyNRG set out to develop its Washington site in 2023, calling it Project Wigeon. The facility will sit on a 165-acre site at Wallula Gap and, once up and running, will produce 50 million gallons of SAF a year.

SkyNRG said Thursday the company secured approval from the state Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County to begin construction.

The company will start construction in 2028 and begin producing SAF in 2030.

Plaza declined to share how much private funding the company has for the Walla Walla facility. In 2025, the state Department of Commerce awarded a $1.5 million grant to the Port of Walla Walla to support SkyNRG’s construction of the facility.

Andy Billig, a former Washington state senator and now senior adviser for SkyNRG, said passing those environmental reviews was the hardest part of the process. The technology SkyNRG will use to make SAF is already in use elsewhere, Billig said, so he isn’t worried about putting it into practice.

“Now it feels like not easy sailing, but easier sailing,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2026-01-09 19:57:45.027416

Corteva and bp have announced the launch of Etlas, a new joint venture focused on producing oilseed crops for biofuel production. Etlas will grow crops such as canola, mustard, and sunflower to create feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

The venture brings together Corteva’s expertise in seed technology and bp’s experience in fuel refining and marketing. The goal is to build a strong and reliable supply of plant-based feedstock to meet the fast-growing global demand for cleaner fuels.

Etlas plans to produce one million metric tonnes of feedstock each year by the mid-2030s. This amount could support the production of more than 800,000 tonnes of biofuel annually. Initial supplies are expected to begin in 2027 and will be used at existing refineries and dedicated biofuel plants.

“By helping found Etlas, Corteva continues to deliver on two critical parts of our mission: to help fuel the world and to support farmers. Agriculture is part of the solution, and we are excited to see Etlas come to life,” said Judd O’Connor, executive vice president of Corteva’s seed business.

Global demand for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel is rising quickly. Industry estimates show that demand for SAF could reach 10 million tonnes by 2030, while renewable diesel demand could grow to 35 million tonnes. Etlas aims to help meet this growing need with a dependable and scalable supply.

The crops used by Etlas will be grown on existing farmland between main food crop seasons. These crops can improve soil health and provide farmers with an extra source of income without requiring additional land.

Etlas will be led by Ignacio Conti as Chief Executive Officer, with Gaurav Sonar serving as Chair of the Board. The company plans to work closely with farmers around the world to expand production and support clean energy goals.

Through Etlas, agriculture will play an important role in supporting cleaner fuel solutions for transportation while offering farmers new opportunities for revenue and sustainability.

“As the aviation industry looks for reliable, sustainable and cost-competitive sources of SAF, it is clear farmers have a critical role to play,” said Etlas CEO, Ignacio Conti. “Etlas brings together global leaders in agriculture innovation and energy production to harness this demand by leveraging technological expertise and trusted relationships with farmers around the world to help scale production and boost supply while offering farmers new revenue streams.”",,N,,2026-01-10 03:58:31.231651

This achievement underscores the robustness of biological gas fermentation compared with more rigid chemical conversion pathways.","LanzaTech Global, Inc. has reported the successful achievement of guaranteed operational performance at a municipal solid waste (MSW)–to–ethanol pilot facility in Japan, marking an important milestone in the commercialization of industrial carbon recycling technologies. The facility, located in Kuji City in Iwate Prefecture, is owned and operated by SEKISUI CHEMICAL CO., LTD., a long-term partner of LanzaTech, and represents a one-tenth commercial-scale demonstration of waste-to-ethanol production.

With an annual production capacity of approximately 400 metric tons of ethanol, the pilot plant began operations following mechanical completion in April 2022 and remained in operation for nearly four years. During this period, the facility consistently demonstrated the ability of LanzaTech’s proprietary gas fermentation technology to process highly heterogeneous and unsorted non-recyclable municipal waste streams. These materials would otherwise be disposed of through landfilling or incineration, both of which carry significant environmental burdens. The successful handling of such variable feedstocks highlights the adaptability of the technology to regional differences in waste composition, a key requirement for enabling a truly global circular carbon economy.

The Kuji waste-to-ethanol project was supported through investment by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, which operates under the oversight of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Additional financial backing was provided by the Ministry of the Environment Japan, reflecting strong governmental support for innovative low-carbon and waste-reduction technologies.

A major highlight of the project was the plant’s ability to meet and exceed its guaranteed performance criteria. After achieving steady-state operations, the facility maintained ethanol yields above the guaranteed threshold for more than 14 consecutive days. This represented the most productive fermentation campaign recorded at the site to date. Importantly, this level of performance was sustained even while operating under particularly challenging conditions, including difficult and variable gas compositions.

The plant processed synthesis gas containing a combined carbon monoxide and hydrogen concentration ranging between 40% and 55%, with hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratios fluctuating from 1.1 to 1.4. Such gas compositions can pose significant challenges for many conventional catalytic conversion technologies. LanzaTech’s process, however, demonstrated exceptional resilience and flexibility, maintaining high ethanol productivity despite these demanding parameters. This achievement underscores the robustness of biological gas fermentation compared with more rigid chemical conversion pathways.

Gasification itself is a well-established method for converting solid waste into syngas, and LanzaTech has previously integrated its fermentation platform with several conventional gasifier systems. The Kuji project also served as a testing ground for collaboration around a novel gasifier design. Despite variability in feed gas quality, the fermentation system remained stable and consistently met performance targets, further validating the reliability of the technology.

Commenting on the achievement, Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaTech, expressed pride in the collaborative success of the project and acknowledged the contributions of Sekisui Chemical, the local authorities in Kuji City and Iwate Prefecture, and the Government of Japan. She emphasized that the results reaffirm the scalability and technical soundness of LanzaTech’s platform and signaled optimism for expanding sustainable fuel and chemical production in Japan and other markets.

Looking ahead, LanzaTech continues to advance waste-to-energy and waste-to-fuels solutions that support circular economy principles. By converting problematic waste streams into valuable ethanol and other chemical feedstocks—potentially including inputs for sustainable aviation fuel—the company aims to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition toward low-carbon industrial systems worldwide.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-10 03:58:35.809948

On Wednesday, the FCC loosened the ban, exempting UAS and critical components on the Pentagon’s Blue List of cleared UAS aircraft.
More than 43 percent of them said their business could shutter if the DJI ban remains, including more than half of agriculture, public safety, and utility operators.
And 97 percent said they use at least one DJI drone.
Overall, about 58 percent of operators said they are “extremely concerned” about the direction of U.S. policies on foreign UAS.","Correction: A previous version of this article mischaracterized the Commercial Drone Alliance’s stance on UAS manufactured in China. This story has been updated to reflect the group’s neutral position.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday partially reversed a sweeping ban on the sale of foreign drones and components. But to the chagrin of American uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) operators, the ban still covers China’s DJI, which produces some of the world’s most widely used drones.

The FCC in December added all UAS and components produced in foreign countries to its covered list at the direction of the White House, which determined they pose “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.”

The ban does not affect equipment previously authorized by the FCC or already in the hands of American consumers. But it effectively prohibits the sale of any new foreign models in the U.S. It also impacts new components such as cameras and batteries, which could make it more difficult to maintain or upgrade approved drones.

On Wednesday, the FCC loosened the ban, exempting UAS and critical components on the Pentagon’s Blue List of cleared UAS aircraft. That means drones produced by Parrot, Aerovironment, Teledyne FLIR, AgEagle Aerial Systems, Wingtra, Auterion, and others on the list will remain available. So too will components produced by Sony, Nvidia, Panasonic, and others.

“UAS and UAS components included on the Blue UAS list have met the highest security standards so they are able to operate in sensitive environments, protect sensitive information, and prevent cyber vulnerabilities,” an FCC notice announcing the move reads. “Given the extensive testing of the Blue listed UAS and UAS critical components, the [Pentagon] has determined that UAS and UAS components included on the Blue UAS list, do not pose unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States.”

The exemption will expire in 2027 and be reassessed to determine if foreign equipment is “hampering the resiliency of our domestic drone industrial base,” the notice adds.

Also exempted are UAS and components that are manufactured in the U.S., so long as domestic components account for 65 percent of the cost of the finished product. That provision will also sunset in 2027. The FCC said the industry should view the 65 percent requirement as a “baseline” that will be raised in the future.

The agency further clarified that the ban does not impact drones made exclusively for use by the U.S. government.

DJI Ban Persists

Federal officials and industry groups such as the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) have long clamored for restrictions on foreign drones, citing them as a national security concern and a hindrance to American UAS manufacturing.

In 2020, for example, DJI’s market share among U.S. hobbyists and public safety operators was estimated as high as 77 and 90 percent, respectively. Officials and industry stakeholders worry about the potential of the manufacturer’s drones to surveil American citizens and infrastructure. The Pentagon went as far as labelling DJI a “Chinese military company”—a designation the company sought but failed to reverse in September.

However, some in the industry felt the FCC’s initial ban went too far.

“We were surprised by the expansion of the FCC’s action to add UAS and UAS critical components produced in any foreign country, rather than just certain foreign adversary produced drones, to the covered list,” the Commercial Drone Alliance, which has adopted a neutral stance toward Chinese UAS, said in a statement Monday. “The scope of this action will create unnecessary challenges for American innovators without thoughtful implementation.”

The majority of American drone operators surveyed by The Pilot Institute, which offers online drone and airplane training, share that sentiment.

In a white paper published Wednesday, the company said it surveyed 8,056 stakeholders, most of whom identified as commercial or professional drone operators. More than 43 percent of them said their business could shutter if the DJI ban remains, including more than half of agriculture, public safety, and utility operators. About 47 percent said they support targeted restrictions on foreign drones—in line with the FCC’s Wednesday update—but only for sensitive government or critical infrastructure uses.

Strikingly, 70 percent of respondents said they operate drone fleets that are fully DJI. Eighty-five percent said DJI drones make up at least three-quarters of their fleet. And 97 percent said they use at least one DJI drone.

By contrast, only 5 percent of respondents said their drones come from Skydio, one of the leading American manufacturers. Nearly 30 percent said there is no FCC-approved alternative to DJI that meets their needs, citing higher costs and lower performance and reliability.

Overall, about 58 percent of operators said they are “extremely concerned” about the direction of U.S. policies on foreign UAS.

“More than 80 percent of the nation’s 1,800-plus state and local law enforcement and emergency response agencies that operate drone programs use DJI technology; these programs will be at immediate risk if they no longer have access to the most cost effective and efficient drone technology available,” DJI wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in December.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/DJI-2-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 00:57:44.896444

The Sustainable Markets Initiative has appointed Paul Griffiths, chief executive of Dubai Airports, as CEO Champion of its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Pathfinder Initiative, the organisation said on Thursday. According to the original source, the initiative, founded by UK's King Charles III in 2020 when he was Prince of Wales, aims to accelerate the production and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is widely seen as the most viable near-term option for cutting aviation emissions.

SAF can reduce flight emissions by up to 80 per cent, but currently accounts for less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel supply. The SAF Pathfinder Initiative focuses on mobilising investment and demand signals to unlock production, advocating for harmonised global policies and incentives, enabling critical infrastructure upgrades, and driving collaboration across the aviation supply chain to address production and cost barriers.

Griffiths appointment comes as pressure mounts on the aviation industry to meet its long-term climate targets, including a sector-wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050. ""Im honoured to take on this role at such a critical time for our industry,"" Griffiths said in a statement. ""Sustainable aviation fuel is one of the most important levers we have to decarbonise flight, and Im committed to accelerating its availability and adoption across the sector.""

Griffiths said the work would align with the oneDXB Sustainability Alliance, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by Dubai Airports, which aims to drive decarbonisation, innovation, and resilience across Dubai International Airport and Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International. Under Griffiths leadership, Dubai Airports has achieved Level 4 ""Transformation"" accreditation from Airports Council International, placing it among the top 5 per cent of airports globally.

The accreditation reflects measures including collaboration with partners, the use of biodiesel-powered ground fleets, and the rollout of green infrastructure projects at Dubai International Airport. Jennifer Jordan-Saifi, chief executive of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, said SAF could play a central role beyond aviation. ""We view Sustainable Aviation Fuel as a powerful catalyst, not only for decarbonising aviation, but also for driving the global expansion of sustainable technologies and investment,"" she said.
