In the European energy sector, 2022–2025 became a period of rethinking. Just yesterday, the world was trying to find a balance between cheap gas, the growth of green energy, and the logic of the electricity market. But today, Europe is already building new networks, introducing digital rules for trade transparency, and preparing space for industries that are sharply increasing demand for electricity, starting with data centres and ending with electric transport.

During this same time, Ukraine has lived several “energy lives”. It lost energy infrastructure facilities after missile strikes and simultaneously synchronised with the European network, put into operation the largest energy storage systems in the region, and reshaped the investment optics of business. It is painful, but productive: the war forced us to move from the “theory of transition” to the “practice of sustainability”.

The World and the EU in 2022-2025: New Rules, New Networks, New Consumers

The European Union responded to the energy shock with packages of new rules and investments. The electricity market reform consolidated stable long-term instruments and reduced the impact of gas price fluctuations on the price of electricity. In parallel, the modernisation of energy trade supervision increased transparency and responsibility of players. At the infrastructure level, a plan for the rapid completion of networks and interstate connections appeared. And, finally, a new major consumer entered the European agenda – artificial intelligence with its data centres, which in a few years will add dozens of terawatt-hours of demand and force the acceleration of investments in networks, flexibility and demand management.

A separate trend for 2022-2025 is the return of hydrogen from the plane of slogans to the plane of rules and investments. The EU has launched the European Hydrogen Bank with production support auctions, defined green criteria for electrolyser hydrogen (RFNBO) and low-carbon hydrogen, and enabled the phased development of hydrogen infrastructure within the framework of projects of common interest. This loop is connected to transport: at sea, requirements to reduce the carbon intensity of fuel on ships have come into force, in aviation, minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), opening the door to e-methanol and “green” ammonia as energy carriers in these areas.

Europe’s hydrogen ambitions are no longer an abstraction. In 2025, the world’s first commercial e-methanol plant, powered by renewable electricity and captured CO₂, opened in Denmark. The maritime industry has also accelerated contracts for the new fuel. This does not yet solve all the cost problems, but it is already shaping a market with forecasted demand.

Ukraine in 2025: Networks, Imports and Internal Flexibility

After emergency synchronisation with the European network in March 2022, Ukraine not only kept its power system operational, but also opened commercial trade. For the autumn-winter period of 2024-2025, European operators increased the limit on electricity imports to Ukraine to 2.1 gigawatts (GW). This volume was agreed not within the framework of a preferential regime, but determined by the technical capabilities of the system, which has been tested by war and, in this regime, fulfils the conditions of a stabilisation nature.

Ukraine’s response to the electricity shortage and the destruction and decommissioning of energy infrastructure due to Russian shelling was the need to create internal flexibility. In 2025, private investors introduced a portfolio of energy storage systems with a total capacity of 200 megawatts and a capacity of 400 MWh. These are six sites optimised for balancing and emergency modes, which are already undergoing commercial testing and will operate under contracts with the transmission system operator. To put it simply, two hours of reserve for hundreds of thousands of households, exactly when it is needed most.

This did not arise in a vacuum. Back in 2023–2024, the business was massively diversifying towards gas-piston plants and small-scale cogeneration. Cities were buying mini-CHPs based on Jenbacher engines, international partners were importing modular gas turbines, and state-owned companies were launching peak decentralised production programs. All this is a forced pragmatic reaction to blackouts and shortages of energy resources.

In parallel, the regulator adjusted the rules to the new reality. Separate procedures for ancillary services auctions appeared, where storage systems and fast generation can compete for long-term contracts. For wartime, this is a conservative, but timely and reliable innovation, according to which the market receives a clear signal, the operator receives a resource for system control, and the consumer can count on a stable energy supply and a decrease in the number of outages.

Hydrogen, ammonia and methanol: European logic – Ukrainian opportunities

The EU has laid the basic conditions for a large hydrogen market. Support for production through auctions, unified methods for confirming the origin of “green” hydrogen and recognition of low-carbon hydrogen are the market rules that were missing yesterday. Further, regulation covers transport: shipping receives an obligation to reduce carbon fuel intensity, aviation – minimal shares of sustainable fuels. At this stage, hydrogen derivatives – e-methanol and “green” ammonia – come into play.

E-methanol is synthesised from hydrogen and carbon dioxide using renewable electricity, while ammonia is produced from hydrogen and nitrogen from the air. These are liquid energy carriers that are easier to store and transport using the existing bulk infrastructure, so in the transitional years, they become a practical bridge between hydrogen producers and consumers, starting from the chemical industry and the agricultural sector and ending with shipping and aviation.

Ukraine can integrate into this chain from two sides. The first is infrastructure: we have port and chemical assets on the Black Sea, including the Odessa Port Plant, which traditionally worked with ammonia. Its privatisation track in 2025 creates a platform for a restart for “green” products after the war, and not only for classic fertilisers. The second is hydrogen derivative production projects in the logic of future export flows. Investors should make decisions about this, and the regulatory background is already clear, thanks to European rules and Ukrainian policies in the field of hydrogen energy.

For general clarity, it should be noted that we are not ahead of events. Even in Europe, e-methanol projects are only moving from pilots to industrial scales this year. But right now, a “demand funnel” is forming – from ports and logistics to shipping and aviation. Entering it with the right timing means getting a solvent buyer and financing for the export logistics.

Investment instruments in war: what works in practice

Classical investment instruments continue to operate, but with a risk adjustment. Project financing with guarantees from international financial institutions, political risk insurance, blending grants and loans, long-term power purchase agreements and system services are what drive new projects even under fire. When it comes to critical infrastructure, banks and donors are becoming co-investors in resilience, not just lenders. For example, package financing for peak generation and storage systems, which international development banks approved in 2025, was precisely a response to the lack of flexibility and winter risks.

An important nuance remains the networks. The development of data centres and electrification in Europe has already raised the bar for connection requirements and demand management. Demand is growing, and the window for connections is narrowing. For Ukraine, this is also a signal that every new megawatt of wind or solar must immediately receive a place in the network and a contract for flexibility. Otherwise, investors will not pay for generation, but for downtime.

Corruption scandals: not verdicts, but risk premiums

Recent months have given the market several high-profile stories with the arrests of top officials in the energy sector. Together with our lawyer colleagues, we do not give legal assessments and do not substitute for the court. We look at this as a risk factor. For international partners, this adds a premium to the cost of capital, complicates the structure of deals and increases the role of prior conditions: audits, compliance, and transparency of procurement. If a country shows that investigations are going to the top and are being completed procedurally correctly, investors take this into account and return to the project figures. If the turbulence is systemic, the share of grant components increases, and debt resources become more expensive. This is the logic of investment and the mathematics of risk in wartime.

Lessons from the Balkans: What the experience of Croatia and its neighbours says

After the wars of the 1990s, the countries of the former Yugoslavia went through a very similar cycle. First, stabilisation and large-scale intergovernmental initiatives like the Stability Pact, which, under pressure from the EU and international banks, opened up financing specifically for infrastructure. Then came privatisation and the long, sometimes painful modernisation of utility and energy assets, which attracted private capital only after the emergence of clear rules and regulatory safeguards. Croatia came to this through institutional reforms and European integration requirements, and investments in networks and generation were a consequence, not a cause. This is not idealisation, but a useful road map for us, focused on a different paradigm, based on the principle of “first rules and networks, then large-scale investments”.

Forecast for 2026: more networks, more flexibility, more hydrogen

A realistic scenario for Ukraine for 2026 consists of three mandatory elements.

The first is networks and connections. Europe is doubling down on interconnectors and internal lines because, without them, it will not be able to sustain either renewables or data centres. We need our own accelerated grid reconstruction plan with a priority for the rapid connection of new generation and storage facilities, like the Energy Infrastructure Plan for Europe. In the long term, this is cheaper than chronic outages.

The second is flexibility as a business. Portfolio storage systems, fast peaking stations, demand management and new ancillary services markets are not a temporary solution for wartime, but a new reality. Transmission system operator contracts, a clear auction schedule and seamless integration with European regulations, that’s where the difference between projects on paper and commissioned capacities lies.

Third – hydrogen derivatives, ammonia, e-methanol, as an export strategy. We should not compete for the “greenest hydrogen in the world” tomorrow. It is worth laying the foundation for the export of products that are easier to export and for which buyers are already appearing, namely e-methanol and “green” ammonia. This requires solutions that ensure transparent privatisation and reprofiling of port and chemical assets, transparent access to networks, and contractual bridges with European consumers. The rules in the EU already exist, and our strategies are currently under open discussion. Time is pressing, but it does not punish those who act systematically and consistently.

What this means for business and politics

For investors, the signal is simple. Ukrainian energy after 2025 is about networks and flexibility in connection with long-term contracts, plus niche industries based on hydrogen derivatives, where the region can become the production arm of the EU. The cost of capital will depend on the quality of risk management, not just on the scale of assets. The key for politicians will be to quickly create a regulatory framework between national and European legislation, protect competition in auctions and make export logistics predictable.

For citizens, the most important thing is the availability of energy resources and the ease of commissioning energy-efficient solutions. Everything else is just a way to achieve this. Ukraine enters 2026 with the experience of survival and a set of working solutions. Europe is shaping the demand for green electricity, diversifying its sources of natural gas and oil, and developing new markets for hydrogen and its derivatives. At the intersection of these two trajectories lies what we call an opportunity, which Ukraine has a chance to seize.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wind-renewables.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 03:56:29.612760

The two dominant pathways are methanol to gasoline (MTG) and ethanol to jet (ETJ), which is also known as ethanol to kerosene (ETK), writes Stephen B. Harrison, Managing Director at sbh4 consulting, Germany.

.The smaller methanol molecule is ideal to produce the lighter gasoline fraction for cars. The larger ethanol molecule yields the heavier kerosene fraction that is required for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Plant-based bio-ethanol

Traditionally, bioethanol has been produced from fermentation of sugary broths at industrial scale. The process is essentially the same as making beer from grain and then distilling the beer to make whisky.

In Asia and the Americas, the most widely used crops for bio-ethanol production are maize and sugar cane. Rice, sorghum and cassava are also used in secondary quantities. In Europe, these crops are generally replaced by wheat and sugar-beet.

Considering these crops, it is evident that agricultural land and food crops are being diverted to the production of biofuels as affordable energy vectors. At a global level, the price of these nutritional commodities is being driven up by their competing use as a fuel. For the rich, a few cents more for a kilo of wheat or rice will not drive a family into starvation. For impoverished nations, the same is not true.

The need for alternative non-food sources of sustainable ethanol is a global imperative. And, if it can also be produced from industrial emissions, this will surely be a win-win scenario.

Industrial ethanol from recycled carbon

The US company LanzaTech utilises anaerobic acetobacter bacteria in a fermenter to convert carbon monoxide (CO) rich feed gases, such as syngas, to ethanol and a range of biochemicals. The term CCT or ‘Carbon Capture and Transformation’ has been used to describe the LanzaTech fermentation process.

The ideal feedstocks for the LanzaTech fermenter are CO-rich. Syngas derived from biomass gasification is CO-rich and is an ideal feedstock for the LanzaTech process.

Iron and steel making also yields CO-rich flue gases. Blast furnace gas (BFG) contains 20% CO and converter gas (also known as basic oxygen furnace gas or BOFG) contains 60% CO.

At present, the energy rich BOFG (LHV 3 kWh/Nm3) is often utilised on the iron and steel making facility for heat or power generation on a gas engine. Alternatively, it is flared. BFG has a lower energy value because it contains less CO (LHV 0.9 kWh/Nm3). It can also be utilised for heat and power generation, or is sent to the flare.

As an alternative to power generation or flaring, utilisation of the BFG and BOFG in the LanzaTech process can generate ethanol. Subsequently, the complimentary LanzaJet process can be used to convert the ethanol to SAF in their proprietary ETJ process.

Lifecycle analysis

The LanzaTech bioreactor utilises CO from syngas to grow bacterial biomass in the fermenter. Some gases are emitted from the fermenter. This biomass from the fermenter is subsequently converted to biomethane in a separate anaerobic sludge digester. This energy-rich biomethane which is used to fully combust the main fermenter off gases to CO2. This CO2 can either then be emitted to the air or captured.

Life cycle analysis (LCA) of the LanzaTech process shows that CO2 emissions reduction is primarily due to the substitution of fossil fuels or crude-oil derived plastics with biomaterials produced from ethanol or other co-products recovered from the fermentation broth.

Also integral to the LanzaTech LCA is consideration of whether the feedstock, such as iron and steel making flue gases are flared, or utilised. If they are flared, their recovery and conversion to ethanol is a significant environmental benefit. However, if they are utilised to make heat and power, they already avoid the use of fossil fuels and the overall CO2 reduction in the LCA is reduced.

Scaling up successfully

LanzaTech’s process was demonstrated at pilot-scale in 2008 using flue gases from the BlueScope Steel mill in Glenbrook, NZ. Since then, LanzaTech has successfully deployed its technology at two 300 tonne per annum demonstration facilities at Baosteel Shanghai and Shougang Steel Caofeidian in China. These LanzaTech fermenters are fed with a range of iron and steel making off gases including BOFG, BFG, and coke oven gas (COG).

LanzaTech also operates the Freedom Pines Biorefinery in Soperton, Georgia which uses bio fermenters to generate ethanol and other chemicals. The LanzaJet ETJ SAF production process has also been implemented at that location.

Dehydration of ethanol on the way to produce kerosene

Ethanol is an alcohol based on two carbon atoms. As an alcohol, it contains an oxygen atom. Kerosene, on the other hand, is a long paraffinic hydrocarbon with between 10 and 14 carbon atoms that contains no oxygen.

Conversion of ethanol to kerosene takes place in two separate stages. The first is dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, or ethene. This effectively removes the oxygen atom and builds a highly reactive double bond linkage between the two carbon atoms.

The dehydration reaction is effected using a zeolite type catalyst such as H-ZSM-5 at between 250 and 300 °C. Low pressure operation is preferred to enable the production of gaseous ethylene. The reaction requires a very high heat input. This is a parasitic load on the process that consumes some of the energy of the feedstock to enable the conversion to kerosene.

Ethylene oligomerisation

The ethylene produced by the dehydration of ethanol is like a mouse trap, waiting to spring open. As the double bond between the two carbon atoms bond snaps open, it reaches out for another ethylene molecule to build butene a longer hydrocarbon containing four carbon atoms.

The conversion of ethylene to butene takes place over a nickel-based catalyst and releases a significant amount of heat, which can support the dehydration reaction.

Butene also contains a highly reactive carbon double bond. When several butene molecules are combined, very long hydrocarbons are created in a polymerisation reaction. If this reaction were left to proceed, the product would be polyethylene, a plastic polymer. To produce kerosene, the reaction must be initiated and then curtailed. This partial polymerisation is known as oligomerisation.

The oligomerisation proceeds using another zeolite catalyst such as ZSM-5. If it is conducted at high temperature, branched isomers of kerosene can be produced. These are desirable because they allow the fuel to be used at low temperatures (such as those at altitude) without freezing.

Hydrotreating and fractionation

The synthetic crude (syncrude) produced by oligomerisation may still contain some residual oxygen atoms from the ethanol feedstock. These must be removed to prevent corrosion of materials handling and storing the kerosene, and to prevent polymerisation of the fuel.

Hydrogen is reacted with the syncrude to remove oxygen and convert it into water. The deoxygenated syncrude is then distilled into fractions such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene for SAF.

The economics can be optimised by tailoring the process conditions to produce the most valuable fuel, which is SAF.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SAF-refuelling-768x512.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 02:56:14.951099

This translates to a significant increase in supply compared to the previous year's substandard 16.77 million tonnes.

With the rapeseed processing volume expected to reach around 24.68 million tonnes, it also makes the EU less dependent on imports.

Cumulative imports into the EU-27 in the first half of the crop year 2025/26 amounted to approximately 1.85 million tonnes, representing a nearly 43 per cent decline from the previous year's level of 3.23 million tonnes.

Ukraine remains the leading supplier country with just over 1.06 million tonnes to date and a 57 per cent share of imports. Nevertheless, the country's shipments remain clearly below the previous year's volume of 2.02 million tonnes.

The second wave of imports from Australia will increasingly come into focus later on in the season. By January, Australia had placed 249,869 tonnes of rapeseed on the EU market, ranking second among the major countries of origin with a share of just under 14 per cent, but trailing well behind Ukraine. According to investigations conducted by Agrarmarkt Informations-Gesellschaft (mbH), deliveries remained approximately 71 per cent below the level recorded in the reference period.

Canada continued to lose market share.

The country delivered 140,915 tonnes of rapeseed to date, which compares to 161,347 tonnes the previous year.

Because Canadian farmers grow genetically modified varieties, the use of rapeseed oil derived from Canadian rapeseed is restricted in the EU. As a result, imports from Canada are primarily used for biofuel production.

The event was open to the public and included six presentations by researchers and market experts.

Doors opened at 8:30, and after a welcome from KDIX Radio’s Mike Renner, Chris Augustin, director of the Dickinson Research Extension Center, took the floor for his presentation, “Acid Soil Management in North Dakota No-till Soils.”

During his talk, Augustin gave a rundown on the basics of soil acidity and pH, mainly differentiating soil salinity or solidicity from soil acidity, which has to do with the concentration of hydrogen. Augustin explained that as soil pH decreases, that means that soil acidity increases. One of Augustin’s main points was that when soil pH measures as low as 5.5, that should register immediate concern. According to his research, incorporating lime into acidic soils helps to neutralize it.

Following Augustin was Chandler Mazour, who is a Nebraska native and product manager for GEVO and Verity Tracking. Mazour’s talk was titled “Carbon Intensity Counts: Monetizing Farm-Level Data.”

Mazour’s company acquired the Red Trail Energy facility in Richardton last year, and part of his presentation updated the crowd on that project, including the “carbon capture and sequestration efforts,” Mazour said. In the long term, it is GEVO’s goal to produce sustainable aviation fuel at their Richardton location. Mazour also said that his company is building out a grower program, working directly with farmers who want to track the carbon intensity of their own grain.

For the last presentation of the morning session, the forum welcomed Tommy Grisafi as its keynote speaker. Grisafi is a Risk Advisor and Commodity Broker for Advance Trading Inc., and is the owner of Ag Bull Media, which produces a popular agricultural podcast by the same name. Grisafi’s presentation was geared toward the risk management side of farming.

In addition to his own musings on stocks and market prices, Grisafi shared some observations he has made over the years of successful grain marketers and offered some practical advice for emulating their tactics, such as not second guessing one’s decisions, and not being afraid to invest in new technologies or equipment.

Following lunch, Frayne Olson, Crops Economist for NDSU, opened the afternoon session with his talk, “Buckle Up! 2026 Crop Market and Trade Outlook.” Olson shared several tables and graphs with the crowd, specifically focusing on the outlook for corn, soybean and wheat growers, comparing projections for the US market. He also covered US exports, with major buyers of US grains found in China, Mexico, Japan and Egypt.

The final two presentations were given by Joe Ikley, NDSU Extension Weed Specialist and Kevin Sedivec, who presented his talk entitled, “Is Virtual Fence the Future of Grazing Management: Pros and Cons.” Ikley went through the weed guide for this year during his presentation, “Herbicide Resistant Weeds and Best Practice Strategies for Control.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/41796eb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4272x2848+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc4%2F2c%2F9084ece54a5995aece1173efff86%2Fdsc-2040.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 00:56:31.980928

“The Soil Management Summit is a great opportunity for farmers, ag professionals and scientists to get together and talk about sustainability and protecting our soils,” said Cabello Leiva, who joined MSR&PC in spring 2025.
The MN Organic Conference was unique in that it spearheaded conversations and interactions with a different group of soybean producers who share similar production concerns, such as weed management.
“We have a lot of tools for weed control from the conventional side that apply to organic soybean producers,” Cabello-Leiva said.
–Minnesota Soybean Research & Promotion Council","MANKATO, Minn. — The Minnesota Soybean Research & Promotion Council (MSR&PC) has been on the road in the northern half of the state to begin 2026, interacting with farmers and sharing information on the latest checkoff research, including stops at the Soil Management Summit and DIRT Conference, MN Organics Conference and Small Grains Update Meetings.

For MSR&PC Director of Research Sergio Cabello Leiva, the northern Minnesota ramble was a return to his research roots.

“It’s a very exciting time of year because it’s an opportunity for us at Minnesota Soybean to deliver information to our audience of farmers and ag professionals all throughout the state,” said Cabello Leiva. “I love the northern part of the state as I spent several years working in North Dakota and northern Minnesota, so it’s good to be back.”

The Soil Management Summit and DIRT conference, a combined effort of the University of Minnesota and North Dakota State University, puts an emphasis on farmer experience and applied science on the topic of soil health and sustainability. The conference, which was held Jan. 14-15 in Fargo, N.D. on Jan. 14-15, featured presentations, Q&As with researchers, farmers and ag professionals, trade show and ample learning and networking opportunities.

“The Soil Management Summit is a great opportunity for farmers, ag professionals and scientists to get together and talk about sustainability and protecting our soils,” said Cabello Leiva, who joined MSR&PC in spring 2025. “The way I see things is that if we have a healthy soil, we have high organic matter; basically we are saving money for our future. We are giving more nutrients to our crops, more healthy crops, more healthy balance. It’s a win-win situation.”

As a sponsor of the event, MSR&PC hosted a table talk at the conference, providing a chance for producers and researchers to have an informal, roundtable discussion about research and agronomic practices.

“The presenter at the table doesn’t have a PowerPoint, maybe a small handout, but it’s meant to be informal, meant to stimulate discussion, and it’s meant for researchers and farmers to learn from one another,” said Dr. Angie Peltier, U of M Extension Educator who hosted the table talk on behalf of MRS&PC. “Everyone at the table has an equal voice and can share their own experiences. The learning that happens during those interactions is tremendous.”

Peltier spoke at her table talk about some of the latest checkoff=supported research projects and how that research can drive yield and long-term profitability for Minnesota farms.

“We chatted a lot about soybean cyst nematode and knowing that risk, because a lot of producers still have no idea that their field could be infested and that is our No. 1 yield impactor in soybean fields,” said Peltier. “We also discussed one of the newest pathogens found in the state called Red Crown Rot, so it’s important that farmers keep an eye out for that and other emerging threats and that we collaborate to come up with workable management practices to address those threats.”

In addition to the Soil Management Summit, MSR&PC also sponsored and participated in the MN Organic Conference Jan. 8-9 in St. Cloud, followed by Small Grains Update meetings throughout northwest Minnesota. The MN Organic Conference was unique in that it spearheaded conversations and interactions with a different group of soybean producers who share similar production concerns, such as weed management.

“We have a lot of tools for weed control from the conventional side that apply to organic soybean producers,” Cabello-Leiva said. “It’s a good partnership and there are a lot of mutual benefits for our food-grade soybean producers, of which we are developing new varieties for right here in the state with the University and Minnesota Soybean together.”

The Small Grains Update meetings made stops all throughout the Red River Valley, including Dilworth, Halstad, Crookston, Lancaster, Roseau and St. Hilaire. In a time where market prices are low and inputs are high, Cabella Leiva spoke to producers on how they can get the best bang for their buck through utilizing available research, applying only what farmers need and staying on top of agronomic issues that impact yield.

“A good variety, a good seed treatment, good fertility in our soils and just apply the absolute necessary to obtain the biggest yield and best quality,” he said. “There’s an opportunity to improve by just applying what we need. We have a lot of research about that, and we invite people to take a look at our research book for those solutions.”

Throughout the slate of conference and meetings, farmers had the opportunity to pick up MSR&PC’s latest research report, From Seed to Solutions. The publication can be viewed online here. Cabello Leiva and checkoff researchers will also be in attendance to visit with producers Jan. 20-21 at MN Ag Expo in Mankato.

Julie Bushell of Global Sustainability Developers, LLC (GSD) and DG Fuels CEO Mike Darcy were on site to also address any concerns from Phelps County residents. The Phelps County Development Corporation (PCDC) hosted the town hall meeting at the Phelps County Ag Center on Wednesday, January 14.

A lot of those concerns addressed the use of corn stover and how the facility may affect resources in the area. On more than one occasion, Darcy and Bushell assured the audience that great care is being taken to ensure the SAF facility would not cause many difficulties for Phelps County residents. Darcy made it clear that a SAF facility runs cleaner than a conventional petroleum refinery, while producing an environmentally friendly product.

Following the wave of disapproval from local residents regarding the initial plans to bring fresh water in by train, Bushell announced that an environmental study was being conducted on the state’s surface water sources and the Ogallala Aquifer. The study is expected to be completed and made available to the public by the end of March.

Members of local public power districts were also in attendance. Courtney Dentlinger of NPPD and Chad Waldo of Southern PPD assured residents that they were behind the project, noting that the facility would not be a drain on the area’s electrical resources.

Bushell confirmed that a location in Phelps County has been chosen but will not be made public out of respect to the landowner’s privacy.

PCDC executive director Jeff Hofaker recognized that while there a few things that still need to be worked on, he remains enthusiastic about the project. The news of the pellet facility was especially welcome to Hofaker. He said it was exciting to know that local farmers would now have the opportunity to benefit from the project before the Phelps County SAF plant is complete.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/1352-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:56:54.038716

The Challenge will invest a total of $1.75 million in selected companies and is supported by twelve leading U.S. corn grower organizations: Colorado Corn Promotion Council, Corn Marketing Program of Michigan, Illinois Corn Marketing Board, Iowa Corn Promotion Board, Kansas Corn Commission, Kentucky Corn Promotion Council, Missouri Corn Merchandising Council, National Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Corn Board, Ohio Corn Marketing Program, South Dakota Corn Utilization Council and Tennessee Corn Promotion Board.

The Radicle Corn Challenge is designed to support startups that are building new uses for corn by helping discover additional sources of demand across industrial, material, chemical and fuel applications. In addition to capital, selected companies will benefit from Radicle’s commercialization expertise, scientific and technical diligence, and connections across the corn and broader bioeconomy ecosystem.

“Corn has long been a foundational feedstock for food, feed and fuel,” said Kirk Haney, managing partner at Radicle Growth. “The next opportunity is expanding how corn is used across new products and markets. Through the Radicle Corn Challenge, we’re looking to support companies that can translate innovation into real-world demand.”

The Challenge seeks applications from startups and growth companies worldwide that are working on technologies converting corn and corn-derived streams, such as sugar (glucose), ethanol and other byproducts, into higher-value products. Areas of interest include bioplastics and materials, corn- and ethanol-derived chemicals, valorization of corn byproducts and emerging fuel pathways, including marine fuels and sustainable aviation fuel.

“Advances in chemistry, catalysis, and biological conversion are opening up new, practical pathways for corn-based products,” said Neal Gutterson, partner and chief technology officer at Radicle Growth. “What’s particularly compelling today is how many of these technologies are becoming technically and commercially viable at scale.”

Historically, corn growers have played an active role in building and growing new markets, including the early development of the ethanol industry. The Challenge explores how similar alignment between innovators, investors and growers can help scale the next generation of corn-based technologies.

“As corn production continues to expand, we must develop new and diverse uses for our crop beyond Nebraska’s renowned Golden Triangle, the interconnected system of corn, livestock and ethanol that powers our state’s economy and helps fuel the world,” said Brandon Hunnicutt, Nebraska Corn Board chair and farmer from Giltner, Nebraska. “The Radicle Corn Challenge represents a vital opportunity to uncover innovative, breakthrough solutions that benefit farmers and consumers alike. In 2025, we witnessed exciting advancements in corn utilization, and we look forward to supporting forward-thinking companies that will continue driving new demand for Nebraska and U.S. grown corn.”

“I’ve always tried to reframe climate change to be more personal and to recognize it is literally the biggest health challenge of our lives,” the former official said.
Are you in transportation, logistics, manufacturing?” “You're in a business,” they added, “there is no climate business.” Not everyone hated “climate” quite as much — but others mentioned a phrase including the word.
But perhaps the most distinctive ban suggestion came from Todd Stern, the former chief U.S. climate diplomat, who negotiated the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.
Among our “innovator” respondents — venture capitalists, founders, and executives working at climate tech startups — the overwhelming majority said that AI and data centers are not slowing down decarbonization.","You can see whether insiders think data centers are slowing down decarbonization and what folks have learned (or, at least, say they’ve learned) from the repeal of clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.

But from many different respondents, a mood emerged: a kind of exhaustion with “climate” as the right frame through which to understand the fractious mixture of electrification, pollution reduction, clean energy development, and other goals that people who care about climate change actually pursue. When we asked what piece of climate jargon people would most like to ban, we expected most answers to dwell on the various colors of hydrogen (green, blue, orange, chartreuse), perhaps, or the alphabet soup of acronyms around carbon removal (CDR, DAC, CCS, CCUS, MRV). Instead, we got:

“‘Climate.’ Literally the word climate, I would just get rid of it completely,” one venture capitalist told us. “I would love to see people not use 'climate change' as a predominant way to talk to people about a global challenge like this,” seconded a former Washington official. “And who knows what a ‘greenhouse gas emission’ is in the real world?” A lobbyist agreed: “Climate change, unfortunately, has become too politicized … I’d rather talk about decarbonization than climate change.”

Not everyone was as willing to shift to decarbonization, but most welcomed some form of specificity. “I’ve always tried to reframe climate change to be more personal and to recognize it is literally the biggest health challenge of our lives,” the former official said. The VC said we should “get back to the basics of, are you in the energy business? Are you in the agriculture business? Are you in transportation, logistics, manufacturing?”

“You're in a business,” they added, “there is no climate business.”

Not everyone hated “climate” quite as much — but others mentioned a phrase including the word. One think tanker wanted to nix “climate emergency.” Another scholar said: “I think the ‘climate justice’ term — not the idea — but I think the term got spread so widely that it became kind of difficult to understand what it was even referring to.” And one climate scientist didn’t have a problem with climate change, per se, but did say that people should pare back how they discuss it and back off “the notion that climate change will result in human extinction, or the sudden and imminent end to human civilization.”

There were other points of agreement. Four people wanted to ban “net zero” or “carbon neutrality.” One scientist said activists should back off fossil gas — “I know we’re always trying to try convince people of something, but, like, the entire world calls it ’natural gas’” — and another scientist said that they wished people would stop “micromanaging” language: “People continually changing jargon to try and find the magic words that make something different than it is — that annoys me.”

Two more academics added they wish to banish discussion of “overshoot”: “It’s not clear if it's referring to temperatures or emissions — I just don't think it's a helpful frame for thinking about the problem.”

“Unit economics,” “greenwashing,” and — yes — the whole spectrum of hydrogen colors came in for a lashing. But perhaps the most distinctive ban suggestion came from Todd Stern, the former chief U.S. climate diplomat, who negotiated the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.

“I hate it when people say ’are you going to COP?’” he told me, referring to the United Nations’ annual climate summit, officially known as the Conference of the Parties. His issue wasn’t calling it “COP,” he clarified. It was dropping the definite article.

“The way I see it, no one has the right to suddenly become such intimate pals with ‘COP.’ You go to the ball game or the conference or what have you. And you go to ‘the COP,’” he said. “I am clearly losing this battle, but no one will ever hear me drop the ‘the.’”

Now, since I talked to Stern, the United States has moved to drop the COP entirely — with or without the “the” — because Trump took us out of the climate treaty under whose aegis the COP is held. But precision still counts, even in unfriendly times. And throughout the rest of this package, you’ll find insiders trying to find a path forward in thoughtful, insightful, and precise ways.

You’ll also find them remaining surprisingly upbeat — and even more optimistic, in some ways, than they were last year. Twelve months ago, 30% of our insider panel thought China would peak its emissions in the 2020s; this year, a plurality said the peak would come this decade. Roughly the same share of respondents this year as last year thought the U.S. would hit net zero in the 2060s. Trump might be setting back American climate action in the near term. But some of the most important long-term trends remain unchanged.

The Heatmap Insiders Survey of 55 invited expert respondents was conducted by Heatmap News reporters during November and December 2025. Responses were collected via phone interviews. All participants were given the opportunity to record responses anonymously. Not all respondents answered all questions.

Hyperscalers with sustainability goals are already reporting higher emissions, and technology companies are telling investors that they plan to invest hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars, into new data centers, increasingly at gigawatt scale.

And yet when we asked our Heatmap survey participants “Do you think AI and data centers’ energy needs are significantly slowing down decarbonization?” only about 34% said they would, compared to 66% who said they wouldn’t.

There were some intriguing differences between different types of respondents. Among our “innovator” respondents — venture capitalists, founders, and executives working at climate tech startups — the overwhelming majority said that AI and data centers are not slowing down decarbonization. “I think it’s the inverse — I think we want to launch the next generation of technologies when there’s demand growth and opportunity to sell into a slightly higher priced, non-commoditized market,” Joe Goodman co-founder and managing partner at VoLo Earth Ventures, told us.

Not everyone in Silicon Valley is so optimistic, however. “I think in a different political environment, it may have been a true accelerant,” one VC told us. “But in this political environment, it’s a true albatross because it’s creating so many more emissions. It’s creating so much stress on the grid. We’re not deploying the kinds of solutions that would be effective.""

Scientists were least in agreement on the question. While only 47% of scientists thought the growth of data centers would significantly slow down decarbonization, most of the pessimistic camp was in the social sciences. In total, over 62% of the physical scientists we surveyed thought data centers weren’t slowing down decarbonization, compared to a third of social scientists.

Michael Greenstone, a University of Chicago economist, told us he didn’t see data centers and artificial intelligence as any different from any other use of energy. “I also think air conditioning and lighting, computing, and 57,000 other uses of electricity are slowing down decarbonization,” he said. The real answer is the world is not trying to minimize climate change.”

Mijin Cha, an assistant professor of environment studies at the University of California Santa Cruz, was even more gloomy, telling us, “Not only do I think it’s slowing down decarbonization, I think it is permanently extending the life of fossil fuels, especially as it is now unmitigated growth.”

Some took issue with the premise of the question, expressing skepticism of the entire AI industry. “I’m actually of the opinion that most of the AI and data center plans are a massive bubble,” a scientist told us. “And so, are there plans that would be disruptive to emissions? Yes. Are they actually doing anything to emissions yet? Not obvious.”

We also asked respondents to name the “best” and “worst” hyperscalers, large technology companies pursuing the data center buildout. Many of these companies have some kind of renewables or sustainability goal, but there are meaningful differences among them. Google and Microsoft look to match their emissions with non-carbon-power generation in the same geographic area and at the same time. The approach used by Meta and Amazon, on the other hand, is to develop renewable projects that have the biggest “bang for the buck” on global emissions by siting them in areas with high emissions that the renewable generation can be said to displace.

Among our respondents, the 24/7 “time and place” approach is the clear winner.

Google was the “best” pick for 19 respondents, including six who said “Google and Microsoft.” By contrast, Amazon and Meta had just three votes combined.

As for the “worst,” there was no clear consensus, although two respondents from the social sciences picked “everyone besides Microsoft and Google” and “everyone but Google and Microsoft.” Another one told us, “The best is a tie between Microsoft and Google. Everyone else is in the bottom category.”

A third social scientist summed it up even more pungently. “Google is the best, Meta is the worst. Evil corporation” — though with more expletives than that.

Francisco Brown (FB): With Autodesk’s rapid growth in cloud computing and AI, how do you reconcile the increased energy demands of data centers that power these technologies with the company’s commitment to environmental impact?

Joe Speicher (JS): We’ve been investing in what would now be considered AI capabilities for over a decade, and we feel well prepared to deal with both the opportunities and challenges this presents.

We procure cloud service providers and AI capabilities upstream from our vendors. We subsequently provide those same vendors with Autodesk technology and tools to design, build, and manage their cloud infrastructure . We are aware of the energy and emissions associated with the rise of AI, and we are leveraging all of our capabilities to help reduce that overall, by using some of our tools for energy modeling, materials optimization, and data management in these same servers .

The Role of Data in Sustainable Design

FB: You released Autodesk Forma, which features embodied carbon analysis and materials insights. What have you heard from your customers about these new options, and is it changing sustainability practices?

JS: It’s a broad spectrum. We have some customers who are incredibly advanced in their thinking about sustainability and others who are beginning to get their heads around these issues and are starting to address them .

As you mentioned, we created Forma, a platform that connects all phases of project delivery . At the moment, what is designed is not necessarily what gets built . We know this just from change orders alone, right? Now, with this integrated approach—from the architect’s original model, to construction, to the owner, to the [building] operator—they get a live digital twin of the project model to validate performance against the original design and specifications .

As we transition to this data-driven, end-to-end offering, we’re also becoming a platform company, which, by definition, means interoperability of data across the markets we serve, particularly in the built environment, because, for us, sustainability is a data problem . But, yes, we’re getting positive feedback from our customers overall, and interestingly, I will say, over the last few years, our customers are pushing us to do more .

Corporate Sustainability Targets

FB: What are the biggest challenges that Autodesk faces in meeting its own sustainability targets on time?

JS: We have three goals that we focus on from a sustainability perspective. The first: Reduce emissions associated with running our own business.

We have an SBTI [Science Based Targets initiative]-validated goal across scopes 1, 2, and 3 by this decade. Second: We subsequently commit to powering our business with 100 percent renewable energy. And thirdly, we address the residual emissions associated with our operations.

We are a technology company, so we don’t own much of anything, and we essentially ship only code . We have a relatively light footprint. We meet all our commitments with our customers in mind . What are the things that the industry needs that our customers need overall?

For instance, thinking about reducing carbon emissions, one of the really challenging things is business travel.

Aviation is a hard sector to abate. Therefore, we invest in a couple of sustainable aviation fuel companies and procure sustainable aviation fuel because we think the best thing we can do as a business is to drive the cost curve down so others can participate in this market.

Instead of buying a renewable energy credit, we invest in something called virtual power purchase agreements, which enable us to underwrite the development of renewables on the grid . Bringing more renewables onto the grid helps our industry overall by decarbonizing the grid itself and, lastly, by addressing residual carbon emissions . We invest in a rigorous carbon offsetting program because, again, if we can bring down the cost curve, others—including our customers—can participate in this market .

Workplace Strategy as Inspiration

FB: What are some internal design and workplace strategies that you have implemented that architects and designers might find inspiring in their own offices?

JS: Having an attachment to a workplace and wanting to be in the office are productivity enhancers for us as a business. One of the best ways we do that is by looking to lease office space that is LEED certified, meets the WELL standard, or meets the BREEAM standard.

We know that employees prefer working in office spaces when there’s a sustainability certification . For instance, in our Platinum LEED-certified San Francisco headquarters, we ensured our employees had the best possible experience .

For us, it’s all about the opportunity to move toward outcomes-based thinking, or as we call it, outcome-based BIM [building information modeling] . Rather than just square footage, architecture firms can start thinking about [spatial] utilization and the number of folks in the building in order to improve people’s lives in the future .

The Future of Creative Automation

FB: That is a fantastic lead to my last question, which is about the future. When we think about the future of design tools, what excites you most about the role Autodesk plays in making sustainable design easier, faster, and more creative?

JS: I’m excited about how AI can let designers focus more on the creative side of their work . We’re using AI to automate repetitive tasks and simplify workflows—the parts no one enjoys doing .

Some worry AI might be threatening, but the reality is there’s far more work than there are people or tools to handle it . Technology like ours helps bridge that gap. I often get asked how much carbon Autodesk has offset with our tools . The truth is, the process has traditionally been very siloed—architects design, builders construct, and data gets lost in between .

As we connect those stages through platforms like Autodesk Construction Cloud and Forma, we’ll be able to track a building’s lifecycle, validate its performance, and see measurable carbon reductions . That’s what really excites me—proving that sustainable design isn’t just an ideal but a quantifiable outcome .",https://metropolismag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gallery-SanFrancisco-6445-30-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 15:57:08.324051

Clean fuel projects are moving from pilots to industrial scale, proving that innovation and collaboration can deliver real impact, yet progress remains too slow.

A World Economic Forum white paper shows how business, finance and policy can turn ambition into investable projects and scale the market.

Clean fuels play a vital role in addressing the energy trilemma by providing secure, affordable and cleaner sources of energy. They offer pathways to make hard-to-abate sectors such as transport, industry and parts of power and heat generation cleaner, while simultaneously enabling competitiveness and driving innovation across the energy system.

Building on the momentum of the Belém 4x pledge, clean fuels are poised to scale and deliver tangible economic and social benefits. They can create two to three times more jobs than conventional fuels (particularly in rural areas) while reducing fossil fuel import dependence by 5-15% through domestic biofuels production. With fuels expected to meet 40-55% of global energy demand by 2050, scaling clean-fuel supply is essential to secure affordable energy and industrial competitiveness. Mobilizing the $100 billion in annual investment needed by 2030 can unlock this potential.

As the World Economic Forum's Future of Clean Fuels initiative marks its one-year milestone with the release of its white paper and digital playbook, members of the initiative’s steering committee share below how collaboration between business, policy and finance is already turning ambition into action – and what lessons can guide the next phase of scale-up.

1. Industrial innovation is proving that different clean fuels can scale

J.J.Imaz, Chief Executive Officer, Repsol

Industrial innovation is proving that clean fuels can scale and deliver real impact. Across Europe, companies are investing in technologies that turn ambition into reality, creating new value chains, reducing emissions and strengthening energy security. From biofuels to e-fuels, these initiatives show that clean fuels are not just a future promise, but a present solution. Repsol is at the forefront of this transformation, driving projects that demonstrate how low-carbon fuels can be produced at an industrial scale while supporting competitiveness and quality jobs.

""At Repsol, we believe clean fuels are indispensable for the energy transition. They not only reduce emissions, but also strengthen Europe’s energy security, industrial competitiveness and quality jobs. This is why we are investing across all pathways. Biofuels are already a reality and we are producing 250,000 tons per year in our Cartagena plant. We have approved the Final Investment decision of Ecoplanta, which will convert municipal solid waste into 240,000 tons of renewable methanol, cutting millions of tons of CO₂ emissions. We are building a demo-plant with a production capacity of 8,000 litres per day of synthetic fuels that will be located in the port of Bilbao.

Clean fuels are a real alternative for road transport, maritime, aviation and industry and they can scale using existing assets while creating new value chains. There is no single solution: biofuels, e-fuels and other low-carbon fuels all have a role to play.

Technological neutrality is key: let science and competitiveness decide the winners, not policy. For example, cars running exclusively on sustainable fuels can reduce emissions beyond 2035 and should be recognized in EU framework. By building the market, technology and infrastructure today, we ensure that Europe remains competitive and that the transition is both sustainable and realistic.""

2. Clean fuels can help reduce emissions using existing infrastructure and established value chains

Hans Olav Raen, Chief Executive Officer, Yara Clean Ammonia

Clean fuels can be integrated to today’s industrial and energy infrastructure, rather than replacing it entirely, which reduces costs and accelerates adoption.

""To scale clean fuels, we need real projects delivering real molecules, and we are proving that it can be done. In Porsgrunn (Norway), we now operate one of Europe’s largest renewable-hydrogen-based ammonia facilities, showing how industry, policy and technology can work together to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. At the same time, we are building a major carbon capture and storage facility at our Sluiskil plant in the Netherlands, which will be operational in 2026 and further reduce emissions from one of Europe’s largest fertilizer and ammonia hubs. But a single plant, or even two, is not enough. What we need next is coordinated global demand, clear certification frameworks, and accelerated investments in logistics and bunkering so clean fuels can move from pilot to global market. We can build this system together.""

3. Scaling clean fuels can only be done through more collaboration and investment

Hans Kobler, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Energy Impact Partners

Investments into clean fuels projects face a unique set of challenges and market risks, given that the value chains are complex, interdependent and often spanning multiple feedstocks. Global clean fuel ambitions require annual investments in production to quadruple from $25 billion per year today to $100 billion per year by 2030. Unlocking that scale depends on aligning investors, industry and policy-makers to share risk and build confidence in new value chains.

“At Energy Impact Partners, we are advancing the future of energy by bringing together incumbents, innovators and capital to find and scale innovative energy solutions. Clean fuels have a critical role to play in decarbonizing the global economy. Together with our partners, we invested in companies such as Electric Hydrogen, constructing one of the largest electrolyzers in the US or Metafuels, new sustainable aviation fuel pathways.""

Cate Hight, Partner Energy & Sustainability, Bain & Company

“At Bain & Company, we work with leading companies and investors to advance their clean-fuels ambitions. Our experience shows that those who succeed in clean fuels are often disruptive thinkers, exploring new business models and investment strategies to balance risk and reward. Because these markets and projects differ from conventional commodities, we work with clients to develop resilient commercial plans, build strategic partnerships, manage capital and risk with discipline and shape flexible operating models. These elements are essential to navigating the uncertainty and unlocking viable project economics in clean fuels.”

4. Accelerating innovation in first-of-a-kind projects will be critical

Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer, Occidental

Scaling low carbon fuels will rely on investing in scalable feedstock pathways today. In the US, Occidental’s first commercial Direct Air Capture (DAC) project – named STRATOS – is designed to capture up to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, once fully operational. The captured carbon can create value in several ways, including combing the atmospheric CO2 with clean hydrogen to produce synthetic low carbon transportation fuels, like Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Occidental can also leverage 50+ years of experience safely and securely using carbon dioxide (CO₂) in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) operations, which injects CO₂ into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs to encourage flow, unlocking previously inaccessible hydrocarbons. When paired with CO₂ from carbon capture solutions, like Direct Air Capture (DAC), CCS-EOR can enable low-carbon fuels while using existing sites more efficiently.

“When we think about addressing emissions, we need to be firm in low-carbon performance and flexible in approach so we can achieve reductions at an accelerated pace and meaningful scale. Our team has used CO₂ for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years, which can store more CO2 underground than what is emitted during the product’s lifecycle. It's low-carbon fuel technology that works and is compatible with today’s infrastructure and value chain.

Moreover, we believe that innovative technologies, like DAC, will be instrumental in shaping the future energy landscape. STRATOS is a major first-of-a-kind energy infrastructure project, offering a valuable example of how industry can turn excess carbon into value and fuel a lower-carbon future. Our teams at Carbon Engineering continue to innovate the process so that advancements that drive costs down and make the technology more accessible can be introduced at scale.”

5. Policy is a catalyst for developing the clean fuels market

Policy will be a critical lever in developing the clean fuels market, particularly given the current cost premium compared with conventional fuels. As illustrated in our Playbook of Solutions, Brazil has shown how integrated measures ranging from blending mandates to carbon credit trading – under its RenovaBio programme – can stimulate private investment, create jobs and strengthen energy security. By advancing the Belém 4x pledge, Brazil is taking a leading role in promoting clean fuels globally and demonstrating how coherent national strategies can turn ambition into tangible market growth.

The way forward

From Europe to Brazil, these case studies show that scaling clean fuels is already underway, but progress must accelerate. The next step is to extend this momentum through coordinated investment, supportive policy and cross-sector collaboration. The Future of Clean Fuels initiative aims to accelerate this transition – explore our white paper and digital playbook to see how leading projects are already turning ambition into action.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_xxYRBo0Jit1Qpf7u6dLOchREYuVlyjBhggEx7DpIbtA.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 13:56:54.370929

Solving the Scope 3 challenge As is the case for most larger businesses, the bulk of eBay’s total climate impact is indirect.
We have sessions dedicated to sustainability reporting, compliance with key standards and climate target-setting – including Scope 3 (indirect) emissions.","The 37-page document sets out the steps eBay will take to decarbonise its own operations and energy, as well as its downstream transport and logistics. It additionally details plans for policy engagement and external partnerships.

The Climate Transition Plan provides more details on eBay’s 2045 net-zero target and interim 2030 climate goals, which have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (eBay).

By 2030, the business is aiming for a 90% reduction in absolute Scope 1 (operational) and Scope 2 (energy-related) emissions by 2030, against a 2019 baseline.

Within the same timeframe, it also wants to deliver a 27.5% reduction in absolute Scope 3 (indirect) emissions from downstream transportation.

These goals support a 2045 net-zero ambition under the SBTi’s Net Zero Standard for corporates. This standard mandates a 90% reduction in absolute emissions across all scopes. High-quality carbon offsetting should be used to address residual emissions.

eBay’s chief sustainability officer Renee Morin said the new Climate Transition Plan “reflects eBay’s long-standing commitment to climate resiliency, creating enduring value for our customers and community”.

Strategic priorities

The new Climate Transition Plan document states that eBay’s emissions would be likely to increase by 11% by 2030 with no interventions, due to growth. But this can be more than offset by the measures set out to improve energy efficiency, integrate renewable energy, adopt circular economy processes and collaborate with the downstream transport industry.

The document elaborates that the business’s low-carbon transition should be “inclusive and equitable”, creating new opportunities for SMEs, social enterprises and nonprofits.

It also emphasises the importance of engaging staff with the plan and “embedding sustainability into how we work and connect”.

It commits eBay to working with external partners to improve carbon data accuracy and industry standards for carbon accounting and carbon offsetting.

Solving the Scope 3 challenge

As is the case for most larger businesses, the bulk of eBay’s total climate impact is indirect. The business will have a different approach of managing Scope 3 emissions than traditional retailers which procure and sell new goods.

The Transition Plan document elaborates: “eBay does not own fleets, warehouses, or delivery networks, so our progress depends on influencing carriers and partners to invest in and adopt cleaner practices and technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which are currently limited in availability.

“The global parcel delivery system is, by the nature of our business model, highly fragmented with public and private carriers operating across diverse infrastructures, regions, and incentives. We are achieving meaningful progress through collaboration, data transparency, and shared accountability across every link in this chain.”

Stated priorities for measuring and reducing Scope 3 emissions include enhancing data completeness and quality; aligning with evolving best-practice standards and methodologies; re-evaluating assumptions based on changes in policy, technology and consumer behaviour; supporting the uptake of low-carbon technologies; collaborating with external partners and incentivising sellers to use low-carbon logistics options.

eBay’s plans for engaging with policymakers to decarbonise the systems in which it operates, while fostering business growth, are also set out.

The firm will continue to back the EU in producing the Circular Economy Act and the US in running the Congressional Recommerce Caucus. It will also advocate for regulations that reduce barriers to recommerce for small businesses; that promote the scaling of low-carbon logistics solutions; and that enhance the affordability and accessibility of renewable energy.

Following the announcement, BP’s share price rose 4.25% to $35.82 per barrel from $34.36.

Combining Corteva’s expertise in seed technology and agricultural innovation with BP’s refining and fuel marketing capabilities, Etlas aims to scale the production of vegetable oils from crops like canola, mustard and sunflower for the production of low-carbon fuels and meet the rising global demand for SAF and RD.

The strategy involves cultivating crops for the production of low-carbon fuels on existing farmland between food crop cycles and improving soil health while creating additional income opportunities for farmers without the need for additional land.

The new JV expects supply to commence in 2027, serving both refinery co-processing operations and dedicated biofuel facilities, and targets production of 1 million metric tons of feedstock annually by the mid-2030s — enough to generate more than 800,000 tons of biofuel.

Investors should note that this project has enabled BP and CTVA to align their business models with the current global shift toward cleaner fuel while generating additional future cash flow.

BP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present while CTVA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Industry scenarios for reaching the aviation sector’s long-term aspirational goals show wide variation, but they have a few things in common: reliance on lower carbon fuels (SAF or LCAF) and that regardless of which scenario is selected, there are hundreds of millions of tonnes of emissions left over that need to be counterbalanced by durable carbon removals. - Select GGRs, like DAC, can grow SAF feedstock. - DAC is here to complement.

Missing any of those, scaling up sustainable aviation fuel probably won’t go far soon.","Cathay Pacific Supports Study on SAF Expansion Opportunities in China

A report catches Cathay Pacific's attention, showing China might grow its green jet fuel output more than expected. Not just policies alone, but better teamwork across companies, funding shifts, and joined-up planning could push cleaner fuels into wider use there. What stands out is how much room remains unused in today’s flight energy mix. Progress hinges on steady moves from regulators and businesses alike, not isolated efforts.

China stands out in the report as central to future use of cleaner jet fuels. Because its airlines cover vast distances, more people fly each year, while pressure grows to cut carbon output. Progress here might quietly shape global efforts to lower pollution from planes. How fast these new fuels spread will likely influence emission trends well beyond 2050.

Large Scale SAF Opportunity Identified

China shows solid groundwork for making plenty of sustainable aviation fuel. Diverse materials sit ready for use across its vast landscape. Refineries already hum in many regions. Air travel grows faster each year than before elsewhere. Together these pieces build momentum. A push through smart policies could turn potential into real output soon after.

Research shows SAF might play a bigger role in China’s plane fuel as carriers look for real ways to cut total carbon output. Early progress seems possible with today’s tech if rules become clearer and investors feel more secure.

Policy and Regulatory Alignment Highlighted

Better policy direction could open up funding for SAF. Clear rules over time - like required fuel mixes or rewards - might lower money risks, says the analysis. Producers and carriers both stand to gain stability if decisions are firm.

Few signs point further than general promises when it comes to China's green plans shaping cleaner fuel progress. Still, rules tailored for air travel lag behind those in similar large economies, holding back how fast new fuels take off so far.

A major news outlet says better federal rules plus teamwork across industries might speed up the use of sustainable aviation fuel while helping local suppliers grow.

Role of Airlines in Scaling Demand

Planes need fuel, so airlines play a big role in pushing for cleaner options. One key move? Signing deals that last years - these give makers steady income, making it easier to fund new plants. Stability here means progress down the road.

What Cathay Pacific says about the report shows airlines here are paying closer attention to cleaner fuels. Not long ago, they said these alternative fuels would play a big role in cutting emissions over time. Other steps include flying smarter and upgrading planes.

Beyond just numbers, progress hinges on how well airlines work with fuel makers, airport teams, one policy shift at a time. What matters most shows up when these groups align before prices spike or supplies shrink.

Feedstocks and Production Pathways

Now here comes the part about what we can use to make things. How it gets turned into something useful matters too.

Fuel made from trash might play a role in China's push for cleaner aviation options. One path being studied uses leftovers instead of raw resources. Another idea builds fuel molecule by molecule through chemical processes. Shifting to homegrown sources may ease pressure on foreign oil supplies. Progress here lines up with broader efforts to change how the country powers itself.

Out of China’s current know-how in refining and chemicals comes a chance to grow sustainable aviation fuel output. Shifting focus through smart funding might turn present facilities toward cleaner jet fuels - no need to build everything from scratch.

Right from the start, getting things moving fast can grow hands-on skills. Experience adds up, which slowly brings prices down. Momentum builds quietly, setting the stage for what comes next.

What This Means for Cutting Emissions in Air Travel

Planes still struggle to go green, especially on long trips - options are thin. Instead of waiting for new tech, many look to sustainable fuels; they fit today's jets while cutting down emissions over time.

A look at the data shows China's growing use of sustainable aviation fuel might shift things worldwide, simply because so many flights start or pass through there. As more airlines turn to cleaner fuel, the ripple effect on carbon output across continents may slowly add up.

Future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in China

Though the research points to real promise, gains hinge on steady policies, drawing in funds, one hand, teamwork across sectors the other. Missing any of those, scaling up sustainable aviation fuel probably won’t go far soon.

Right away matters more than most realize when cutting future pollution spikes. Starting today on sustainable fuel research lets Chinese airlines help shape worldwide climate progress without losing edge down the road.",https://responsibleus.com/uploads/images/202601/image_750x415_69689e4388c28.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 13:57:13.934179
,,2026-01-15 15:37:09+00:00,Nebraska Public Media,Auditor flags possible Pillen 'favoritism' in $2.5M no-bid bioeconomy contract with lobbyist,Not Available,,,,,https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/auditor-flags-possible-pillen-favoritism-in-25m-no-bid-bioeconomy-contract-with-lobbyist/,"The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.
Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.
The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.
Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended.
“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said.","Gov. Jim Pillen, while pressing the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in 2024 to tighten its belt, steered the state agency to award a $2.5 million no-bid emergency contract to a bioeconomy consultant and lobbyist he knew and had traveled with as part of state delegations.

State Auditor Mike Foley alleges the Economic Development Department, in carrying out that Pillen-picked contract, broke state law by not specifying in writing what emergency justified skipping the required step of bidding out contracts worth more than $50,000, a step meant to save taxpayers money.

In a Jan. 6 audit letter Foley shared with the Governor’s Office, which was obtained by the Examiner and authenticated by the auditor, Foley dinged the department for leaving blank a required section for explaining the emergency on the state’s “Procurement Exception/Deviation” form.

That’s where department personnel must explain the circumstances justifying seeking no bids. Foley criticized the agency for leaving the second page of the May 2024 form blank, writing that it “contained questions regarding the reasons for designating the contract as an emergency.”

Foley’s letter alleges that omitting this information meant the contract did not comply with “the legal requirement to specify the nature of the supposed exigency” under the Nebraska State Procurement Act in Nebraska Revised Statutes 73-815.

That section of state law requires the agency to provide the “justification of the emergency” and requires the state to “retain a copy of the justification with the contract in the state agency files.” Violating that law carries no criminal or civil penalty.

According to Foley, the designation of the contract “as an ‘emergency’ is unsupportable.” The absence of a bidding process, Foley alleged in the letter, resulted in a $2.5 million contract for Global Sustainability Developers LLC, “a company handpicked rather than selected through the ‘time-honored’ and legally required open, competitive process.”

“I think it’s critically important, because competitive bidding is a bedrock, foundational tenet of government operation,” Foley told the Examiner of his findings. “When you sidestep a foundational tenet, it’s just waving a huge red flag for any public auditor. It smacks of favoritism.”

Contracting with GSD

Nebraska awarded the $208,333-a-month, remote work contract in May 2024 to GSD, a Lincoln firm that at the time had a single employee — owner Julie Bushell, a lobbyist with agricultural and telecommunications connections who also leads Ethos Connected, an agribusiness firm using sensors to wirelessly connect farm and ranch infrastructure, including water.

The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.

Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.

It was far larger than a typical emergency no-bid contract, with some notable exceptions during the pandemic, based on a recent legislative performance audit of state handling of emergency contracts. The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.

The auditor’s report, as well as Examiner reporting, make plain that Pillen’s office recommended the contractor on behalf of the governor. Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, was among staffers involved in the process, based on records and messages obtained by the Examiner. Chiefs of staff often communicate with state agency leaders.

DED leaders did not know firm

State correspondence indicates that top Economic Development Department leaders did not know the firm they were contracting with when the contract was awarded, based on the Auditor’s Office letter and backed by months of interviews, public records and reporting by the Examiner that started before learning of the auditor’s probe.

But Pillen knew Bushell’s work. She had joined Pillen on state trips to South Korea and Japan, records indicate. She also joined some state delegations when Pillen visited Washington, D.C. Both attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. A photo obtained by the Examiner shows Pillen and Bushell together at the 2024 Ak-sar-ben ball, held by a charitable foundation of business leaders.

To the Examiner, the Governor’s Office denied playing favorites.

Foley said Pillen told him when they talked during the audit that he himself had recommended Bushell.

The auditor said the governor, in the same conversation, described the decision as a joint one between Pillen and the DED director at the time, K.C. Belitz.

Emails between then-DED leaders, including Belitz, show the Governor’s Office’s involvement in the contracting process. Belitz did not return calls or messages seeking comment, but his correspondence says the language of the contract was “vetted thru Julie [Bushell] and the Governor.”

Governors hire and fire the leaders of many state agency departments, including the Department of Economic Development.

Belitz resigned in June 2025. Pillen replaced him with his general counsel for the Governor’s Office, Maureen Larsen, who also previously served as deputy director of Pillen’s Policy Research Office.

“I’ve been in the [Capitol] building 25 years, 11 years as an auditor, and I can’t recall anything that had the direct involvement of the governor,” Foley said.

Contract facts

Of about 4,200 contracts entered by the state in each of the past two calendar years, 22 in each year were emergency contracts for which the state sought no competitive bid, according to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, the state’s clearinghouse for such contracts.

Under the Nebraska Procurement Act, DAS is “the sole and final authority on contracts for personal property by a state agency,” including for no-bid emergency contracts.

Including the GSD contract, only five of the state’s 44 emergency no-bid contracts over the past two years left the justification blank, DAS says. Three of the five were DED contracts, officials said. Two were on behalf of DAS itself.

From mid-2020 through 2025, the Department of Economic Development signed a total of four emergency no-bid contracts, officials said. Two paid six figures. One was for five. GSD’s was for $2.5 million.

Pillen’s team blamed a former DED attorney for not adding the legal justification to the GSD contract and the others. But Pillen-led DAS signed off on the GSD contract without the justification, copies of the contract indicate.

Lee Will, director of the Department of Administrative Services, said last week that the state contracting office, after Foley’s audit, had revised its Deviation Form to make clearer that the justification section must be filled out and added a step to its processes to make sure the required box is completed.

Foley said he would like his office to join the process. State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County introduced Legislative Bill 997 Tuesday on Foley’s behalf that would require an additional copy of state no-bid contracts, including emergency no-bid contracts, to be filed with the State Auditor’s Office, in addition to the agency and DAS.

The Governor’s Office, over several days last week, told the Examiner Pillen recommended contracting with Bushell because of her business connections, leads on potential development projects and experience in maximizing how much federal money Nebraska could secure at the end of the Biden administration.

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the Governor’s Office has supported two emergency no-bid contracts “when the Legislature passed requirements to engage vendors in a certain timeframe, and the cumbersome procurement process would not have met the deadline.”

Both have helped taxpayers, she argued, and “delivered overwhelming value to Nebraska.” One was the DED contract with GSD. Another was a $10 million, four-year state contract with Utah-based Epiphany Associates and the Department of Administrative Services to help DAS use technology to find potential “systemic cost savings across state government.”

“The bioeconomy contract delivered hundreds of millions to Nebraska, and the DAS cost-reduction effort continues to produce lasting reforms in cost-cutting efforts for the state,” Strimple said.

The Epiphany contract drew legislative scrutiny during the 2024 session, including questions from state senators about whether leadership of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services should have disclosed previous ties to the company.

Governor’s Office: Bushell helped state get funds

Team Pillen says Bushell’s business, GSD, helped Nebraska secure $550 million in federal funds — about $200 million of which have yet to arrive. Among the funds mentioned, the administration says Bushell helped the state secure $33 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds for Affordable Clean Energy Loans to Sandhills Energy and Bluestem Energy Solutions and $10.3 million in Rural Energy for America grants and loans.

The $200 million USDA New Era grant to Nebraska Electric G&T is the part that had not yet been disbursed, Foley’s letter says.

Pillen’s staff also credits Bushell with a pledged investment of at least $5.5 billion to build a cornstalk converting biofuels plant in Phelps County, in the Holdrege area.

Former Phelps County Development Corporation director Ron Tillery called Bushell’s help vital.

Tillery said Pillen suggested during a visit to Phelps County in July 2024 that local economic development officials should meet with Bushell if they were serious about pursuing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which locals wanted as a means to carve out a market niche in a world of ethanol and biodiesel plants.

Kenny Zoeller, who leads the Governor’s Policy Research Office and spoke for Pillen’s team, said Bushell came recommended by Nebraska business leaders and “Aksarben,” which is often shorthand in political circles for a group of statewide business leaders sometimes loosely tied to the Omaha-based Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben organization.

Three people with ties to the group questioned whether its leaders would recommend a contractor for a state bioeconomy consultant, and more than one said Pillen had introduced members of the group to Bushell. Bushell joined the group’s board in mid-2024, archives of the foundation’s website show.

Bushell, in a sit-down interview last week, echoed the Governor’s Office in saying the economic benefit to Nebraskans of her work helped the state obtain more federal money than it might have otherwise. She said her contacts in the bioeconomy space helped land planned projects like Phelps County’s DG Fuels plant.

The Pillen administration, through Zoeller and Will, argued that Bushell’s work helped Nebraska secure nearly $290 million more in federal funds than a per-capita projection of what the state should expect to receive.

“I think the deliverables of this contract speak for themselves,” Bushell said. “I am incredibly proud that the world knows that Nebraska is the leader in bioeconomy, and in an economic position that the state’s in now. I think it’s really important that we continue to grow and invest in these projects.”

Foley argued that the administration’s per-capita number ignores that most such federal projects run through more complex formulas that consider much more than population. He noted in his audit letter that “other states received comparable amounts of the same grant and loan monies, presumably without any involvement by GSD.”

Questions about DG Fuels

Foley’s audit letter also questions whether Nebraska and Phelps County economic development officials are banking on a $5.5 billion DG Fuels project that might not be built.

The audit team dug into 11 announced DG Fuels projects in 10 states since 2001, seven of which pledged investments of more than $1 billion. The Foley letter indicates that none of the DG Fuels projects his team reviewed has yet been built to completion, although the audit shows several of the projects have made progress.

Among them: a sustainable aviation fuel plant planned for the former Loring Air Force Base in Maine, where the audit said ground was expected to be broken in 2026, and a 2024 announced project in St. James Parish, Louisiana, which expects to start producing fuel in 2028.

Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels, a biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel developer, did not return multiple Examiner attempts over several days to reach the company by phone and email.

Michael Darcy, the owner of DG Fuels, originally agreed to sit down with Foley’s team, the auditor said. But Foley said Darcy and his company cut off communication before the two met, after Foley communicated that he planned to question the progress of projects in other states.

Bushell said Nebraska needs to be careful not to create an environment that costs the DG Fuels project. She and Tillery say the project is making more progress through the state and local permitting process. Bushell said DG Fuels told her the Nebraska project is among its top priorities.

Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended. She did not respond to the Examiner’s follow-up questions about that push via text or email.

DED, with the Governor’s Office’s knowledge, approved the contract change. Will, in a statement to the Examiner, said the department “felt the revised terms would not lead to a conflict of interest.”

“In short, there was no risk for a conflict of interest, because there was no funding to create a conflict while under state contract,” Will said.

Foley said such conflict of interest language is meant to protect taxpayers and that he had unanswered questions about Bushell’s push to negotiate with a private company she had been working with on the state’s behalf.

“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said. “There were a number of federal grant awards that they say came because of GSD. … When our auditors looked into it, other states were able to get similar amounts.”

Too little time?

Foley, in his letter, wrote that DED had enough time “to search for a qualified service provider in compliance with statutory competitive bidding requirements” for the $2.5 million bioeconomy contract that went to GSD.

But Zoeller and Will pushed back, arguing that Legislative Bill 1412, the mid-biennium budget bill, left the state too little time to act when it took effect in early April 2024.

The bioeconomy provision in the budget bill required DED to coordinate work aimed at bioeconomy development, seek federal grants, and it gave the agency 15 months to report back on its progress. The law did not require immediate spending or entering into a contract.

The Governor’s Office pointed to the law’s requirement for a status report on the new bioeconomy initiative to the Legislature by June 30, 2025. According to Zoeller and Will, issuing and evaluating requests for proposals takes up to 60 days, followed by an RFP protest period of up to 50 days, which meant completion without the emergency approach could have taken up to 110 days.

But Foley said because the Governor’s Office sought that section of LB 1412, the Department of Economic Development had early warning and could have started its processes sooner to be ready to go out for bids and could have sought requests for information to gauge interest sooner from potential bidders.

Contract obligations questioned

Foley’s questions about the contract stretched into how little it required of GSD in terms of reporting how the firm spent state money. It did not require itemized receipts of expenses or time sheets. It required only the submission of monthly invoices summarizing the work done and dollar amounts, he said.

Those invoices largely say Bushell’s firm helped introduce state and local leaders to bioeconomy developers, scheduled and attended meetings, lobbied federal agencies and contacts, reviewed and discussed grant applications and communicated with project planners.

Will said that, while Foley was right that many state contracts are stricter with reporting requirements for the spending of state funds, some state contracts with consultants, including many in economic development, leave more flexibility to let consultants spend the funds more nimbly.

The State of Nebraska pushed to end Bushell’s contract two months early, at the end of February 2025. Zoeller told the Examiner the change in presidential administrations meant that Nebraska and Pillen had a more direct relationship with the Trump administration and no longer needed GSD’s connections. Foley said he started requesting information about the state contract in mid-January 2025.

In the end, the state paid Bushell’s firm $2.08 million. What Nebraska got for that money, Foley said, remains unclear. Pillen’s team says the state got a more than reasonable return on its investment.",https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/assets/images/pillen_ZJW_122723-04-1536x1024.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:56:46.731455

,,2026-01-15 15:33:48+00:00,biodieselmagazine.com,Moeve supplies SAF to Condor flights from Tenerife South Airport to several German cities,Not Available,,,,,https://biodieselmagazine.com/articles/moeve-supplies-saf-to-condor-flights-from-tenerife-south-airport-to-several-german-cities,"Moeve has completed the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Condor for flights departing from Tenerife South Airport on the Canary Islands, a location not yet legally subject to ReFuelEU Aviation requirements, underscoring both companies’ strong commitment to advancing the decarbonization of air travel.
The SAF was used on routes connecting Tenerife with major German cities including Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, and Düsseldorf.
According to airport operator Aena, more than 450,000 passengers a year choose Condor for flights to and from Tenerife South Airport.
Working alongside Condor to accelerate this effort clearly shows both companies’ dedication to sustainability beyond what is mandatory regulation,” said Ángel Martínez Campos, sustainable aviation business development at Moeve.
“Since last year, Condor guests have had the opportunity to voluntarily round up their flight booking price or make direct contributions to advance sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and certified climate protection projects.","Moeve has completed the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Condor for flights departing from Tenerife South Airport on the Canary Islands, a location not yet legally subject to ReFuelEU Aviation requirements, underscoring both companies’ strong commitment to advancing the decarbonization of air travel.

The agreement covered more than 515 metric tons of SAF, produced from used cooking oils and agricultural waste, a supply expected to reduce 1,700 tons of lifecycle CO2 emissions when compared with conventional jet fuel. The SAF was used on routes connecting Tenerife with major German cities including Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, and Düsseldorf. According to airport operator Aena, more than 450,000 passengers a year choose Condor for flights to and from Tenerife South Airport.

“This agreement reinforces Moeve’s commitment to lowering emissions in aviation and in an industry as vital to Spain and Tenerife as tourism. Working alongside Condor to accelerate this effort clearly shows both companies’ dedication to sustainability beyond what is mandatory regulation,” said Ángel Martínez Campos, sustainable aviation business development at Moeve.

“Since last year, Condor guests have had the opportunity to voluntarily round up their flight booking price or make direct contributions to advance sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and certified climate protection projects. These funds are exclusively allocated to procure and deploy additional SAF beyond regulatory mandates”, said Sina Rathgeber, director airport relations, government affairs and sustainability at Condor. “Our guests' strong commitment has enabled this significant step forward, including partnerships like Moeve for the procurement of additional SAF.""

The SAF supplied to Condor was produced at Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva, where it is currently building a new second-generation biofuels plant with a flexible annual production capacity of 500,000 tons of SAF and renewable diesel. Construction on the new facility, one of the three largest industrial projects being built in Spain, is more than 50% complete and is slated to begin production at the end of 2026. Once operational, it will make Moeve’s second-generation biofuels complex the largest in southern Europe. Expanding production and supply of second-generation biofuels such as SAF is a key pillar of Moeve’s Positive Motion strategy, which aims to position the company as a European leader in the energy transition by 2030.

This is related to a wider question about how energy costs are distributed and paid for (see the Energy Markets section).
£17.8 billion of this initial spending will go towards gas networks, with £10.3 billion supporting high-voltage electricity infrastructure.
We also expect further work in relation to the proposed Hydrogen Storage and Hydrogen Transport Business Models.
The Clean Energy Jobs Plan commits to expanding the Energy Skills Passport beyond offshore wind into sectors including nuclear and electricity networks.","2025 was a turbulent year for renewable energy, with supply chain constraints and high interest rates continuing to impact delivery of projects. The sector also experienced unprecedented geopolitical uncertainty, particularly in the wake of the USA federal administration’s actions to revoke permits for offshore wind projects already under construction. Given the international nature of renewable energy investments, the impacts were, and continue to be, felt globally. Despite these challenges, the UK government has remained committed to its Clean Power 2030 Action Plan (CP30) and ambitious decarbonisation targets, driving the continued acceleration of renewable energy development.

In 2025, this support helped the UK reach 16GW of offshore wind installed capacity, providing more than 17% of the UK’s electricity needs. However, with only 1.2GW of new capacity added last year, the pace of development will have to increase significantly to meet the CP30 ambition of 43-50GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030. On 14 January 2026, Contract for Difference (CfD) allocation round 7 (AR7) awarded support to 8.4GW of offshore wind capacity, an outcome that exceeded industry’s initial expectations and is intended to keep the UK on track to achieve its CP30 ambitions. AR7 originally allocated a budget for fixed-bottom offshore wind of £900 million and set an administrative strike price (ASP) of £113/MWh (2024 prices), with a separate price for projects in Scotland reflecting differences in grid network charges between the regions. However, the Secretary of State exercised his powers to double the fixed-bottom offshore wind budget for AR7 to £1.79 billion, awarding strike prices of £91.20/MWh for projects in England and Wales and £89.49/MWh in Scotland (each in 2024 prices), an increase compared to AR6. AR7 also saw two floating offshore wind (FLOW) projects receive support, with a strike price of £216.49/MWh (in 2024 prices) in a pot 4 auction, 20% lower than the ASP of £271/MWh. We expect to see a lot of activity in the offshore wind sector in 2026 and this will be a space to watch as industry digests the results. AR7 is also the first split auction, with the established (pot 1) and less established (pot 2) renewable technology auctions concluding in February (discussed below).

For FLOW, which is arguably facing similar but heightened challenges as compared to fixed-bottom offshore wind, the Crown Estate’s announcements in June and November 2025 of the awards under its 5th Celtic Sea leasing round were broadly welcomed. Three sites with potential for 4.5GW of capacity were awarded to Equinor and Gwynt Gas (two sites) and Ocean Winds (one site). In addition, public capital has been deployed to support the sector, with investment in the Pentland FLOW project (which also received support in AR7) by Great British Energy (GBE) and the National Wealth Fund (NWF). Industry will now be awaiting financial close of the Green Volt FLOW project.

AR7 implements important reforms to the CfD mechanism, including allowing repowering projects within the onshore wind category and extending the CfD term from 15 to 20 years for wind and solar projects, reducing exposure to merchant tail risk and market price volatility. Fixed-bottom offshore wind projects were also able to apply for CfD support without full planning consent, allowing projects at earlier stages of development to participate in AR7, increasing competition. In 2026, we will see further updates to the CfD terms ahead of AR8 following the outcome of an ongoing consultation, including decisions on a permanent restriction on previously surrendered capacity bidding into future ARs and introducing a new technology category for “Other Deepwater Offshore Wind” as a subset of the existing Offshore Wind category.

Aligned to the government’s growth mission, 2025 also saw the first Clean Industry Bonus (CIB) process for fixed-bottom and FLOW held ahead of AR7. The CIB provides financial rewards for projects on the condition they prioritise investment in regions of the UK that need it most or in cleaner supply chains, including traditional oil and gas communities. The government increased support to £544 million in the CIB round ahead of AR7 and anticipates that this will help leverage up to £9.3 billion in private sector investment over the next four years. In 2026, we expect to see the government response to a consultation on the CIB for AR8, including the potential expansion of the scheme to onshore wind projects.

The coming year is likely to see further deployment of funding from GBE and NWF to support CP30’s goals. Following the operationalisation and £8.3 billion capitalisation of GBE and its sister organisation GBE Nuclear in 2025, we expect GBE to drive clean energy development across the UK and seek opportunities to deploy capital as a developer, investor, and owner of clean energy projects. GBE’s strategic plan commits, by 2030, to deliver at least 15GW of clean energy generation and storage, and more than 10,000 jobs directly supported through GBE-backed and funded projects, including in areas historically dependent on oil and gas. GBE has already launched a £300 million Supply Chain Fund for Offshore Wind and Networks, aimed at building UK manufacturing capacity for key constrained components in the offshore wind and electricity network sectors such as wind turbine blades and transmission cables. Building on the Chancellor’s Statement of Strategic Priorities for the NWF in March last year, the fund will publish its strategic plan in early 2026. NWF chief executive Oliver Holbourne has indicated that it is likely to favour direct investments or co-investments (over funding via externally managed funds).

For solar, reforms to the CfD terms are expected to encourage deployment, with target commissioning windows for solar projects now extended from 3 to 12 months in AR7 to facilitate larger developments, supporting the CP30 ambition of 45-47GW of installed capacity by 2030. Up to £295 million is allocated to solar PV projects for AR7, a significant real terms increase on the maximum amount allocated to the sector in AR6. Solar projects may bid up to an ASP of £75/MWh in the AR, with results expected in late February. The government’s Solar Roadmap also includes initiatives in respect of the deployment of rooftop solar on domestic and non-domestic buildings. The sector is also expected to receive a further boost from the publication of the long-awaited Future Homes Standard and Future Buildings Standard which are expected to be published early this year.

Planning reforms to facilitate faster consenting of renewables projects are expected to be implemented in 2026. The Planning and Infrastructure Act (PIA) received Royal Assent on 18 December 2025 and will assist by streamlining the nationally significant infrastructure project (NSIP) regime. Under related secondary legislation, from 31 December 2025, onshore wind projects (subject to a de facto ban under the Conservative government) will be reintroduced into the NSIP regime, and the capacity threshold in England and Wales at which onshore wind and ground-mounted solar projects are NSIPs will be lifted to more than 100MW – allowing smaller projects to be approved at local authority level. Beyond planning, the PIA also increases the statutory deadline for the divestment of offshore transmission assets from 18 to 27 months, a timeframe more reflective of the practical realities of testing, commissioning, and divesting these assets. Separately, the government has also committed to fast-track renewables and other planning decisions on major infrastructure by the end of this Parliament as part of its pro-growth agenda.

Finally, developers of existing renewable generation projects currently supported under the Renewables Obligation (RO) will be considering their options for when government support for a swathe of early projects comes to an end in 2027. Whilst onshore wind developers now have the option to secure CfD support for repowering for projects which meet the eligibility criteria, many will be considering what other revenue streams might be available in the market, including Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (currently the subject of a government consultation, closing on 6 March 2026).

In July 2025, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator (NESO) unveiled the Clean Flexibility Roadmap building on CP30. The roadmap sets out a vision for a dynamic, consumer-focussed electricity system where flexibility is integral to cost reduction, resilience and decarbonisation. The roadmap identifies actions to unlock short duration flexibility—such as consumer-led demand response (see the Energy Markets section) and grid-scale batteries—and long duration solutions such as low carbon dispatchable power and long duration electricity storage (LDES). It also establishes a governance framework to track delivery and hold stakeholders accountable.

In relation to electricity storage, 2026 will be a significant year for the implementation of the cap and floor scheme for LDES projects. Designed to overcome investment barriers, the scheme guarantees a minimum revenue floor to provide investor confidence while capping excessive returns to safeguard consumers. The first application window for the scheme opened in April 2025, with 77 projects shortlisted to proceed to the project assessment stage in September. The shortlisted projects represent a combined discharge capacity of 28.7GW and cover a range of technology types including battery storage technologies and pumped storage hydro. Ofgem aims to publish an “Initial Decision List” of projects offered a cap and floor in Q1 2026, with the final list of successful projects to be announced in summer 2026. In spring 2026, Ofgem also aims to publish the expected timing for opening the second application window, based on advice from NESO.

In relation to low carbon dispatchable power, towards the end of 2025, Drax Power Limited signed a new low carbon dispatchable contract-for-difference (LCD CfD) with the Low Carbon Contracts Company. The LCD CfD, which runs from April 2027 to March 2031, supports the continued operation of the four biomass units at Drax’s Yorkshire power station, with flexible operation to support high and low demand periods. This innovative arrangement complements intermittent renewable generation and helps maintain security of supply. For more information on the LCD CfD, please see our post here.

The Clean Flexibility Roadmap envisages that hydrogen to power (H2P) and gas-fired power plants using carbon, capture and storage (CCS) will also be required to support system flexibility. The government intends to launch the new H2P business model, using a dispatchable power agreement-style mechanism to support the deployment of H2P (for detailed information, please see the Hydrogen section). The government’s response to a consultation on how to categorise participation of H2P in the Capacity Market is still awaited. Trials are also underway to test co-firing of hydrogen with natural gas, as a decision on hydrogen blending into the gas networks approaches, with Centrica and HiiROC doing so successfully at Centrica’s Brigg Energy Park.

Following the final investment decision for Net Zero Teesside in December 2024, support for other gas-fired power plants using CCS technology is also under consideration by government to meet system flexibility requirements (also see the CCUS section).

In relation to the CM, we expect a range of reforms to take shape in 2026. Notably, early this year the government will publish its response to a consultation ahead of the auction prequalification round commencing in July. Proposals include measures to address the interaction between the LDES cap and floor scheme and the CM, managing the transition of generating units into the CfD regime, increasing termination fees and credit-cover requirements and the introduction of a Multiple Price Capacity Market that could, if needed, support investment in new build dispatchable enduring capacity so that these units can access a higher price cap, while other participants can continue to secure agreements up to the existing £75/kW/year cap. This builds on an earlier consultation in October 2025. The government also continues to consider how better integrate low-carbon and flexible technologies into the CM. The government’s response to its annual call for views on new generating technologies which could contribute to security of supply highlighted several forms of capacity including H2P, consumer-led flexibility and flexible compute capacity which might play a role in the CM in future. With the government’s Reformed National Pricing package expected to include changes to the CM and initiatives underway to consider engaging the demand-side in energy system balancing (see the Energy Markets section), we expect further changes to the CM in 2026.

After a busy year, the GB nuclear energy industry is looking ahead to 2026 with a renewed sense of optimism. Whilst all but one of the UK’s operational nuclear power stations are due to be retired in the early 2030s (subject to any lifetime extensions that may potentially be implemented – see below), two large-scale new nuclear plants are under construction and Secretary of State Ed Miliband has promised a new “golden age” for the sector.

New large-scale nuclear projects remain central to the UK’s future energy mix and ambition for sovereign capability in affordable, clean, homegrown power. The UK government’s final investment decision on Sizewell C in July 2025, followed by financial close in November 2025, marked a milestone for the 3.2GW plant and the first deployment of the Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model in nuclear financing. Industry observers suggest the RAB model’s success for Sizewell C could prove crucial to unlocking further private investment in new nuclear projects. Meanwhile, Great British Energy - Nuclear has been tasked with identifying suitable sites across the UK (including in Scotland) for another large-scale nuclear project, with findings due in autumn 2026. In addition, the UK government is consulting on amendments to CfD legislation to enable existing nuclear assets to qualify for CfDs, with a view to incentivising investment in reactor lifetime extensions (such as Sizewell B).

At the other end of the spectrum, modular reactors are gaining momentum. In June 2025, Rolls-Royce was announced as the selected bidder in the UK government’s small modular reactor (SMR) competition, becoming the UK government’s technology design partner for the SMR design. In November 2025, the UK government confirmed it had designated Wylfa as the first site for deployment of that SMR technology and, in December 2025, it further confirmed that work was expected to begin onsite during 2026. 2025 also saw the announcement of several private sector partnerships: X-Energy and Centrica have teamed up to develop a project for the potential deployment of up to 12 advanced modular reactors (AMRs) in Hartlepool, whilst Holtec, EDF and Tritax are collaborating on developing data centres powered by SMRs at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire. The Cottam project spotlights the potential for co-located nuclear assets to meet energy demand driven by the AI boom, with a 1GW data centre project targeted for the end of the decade. These developments underscore the significant role to be played by the private sector in the nuclear industry’s future. The UK government intends to publish imminently a framework to enable privately funded advanced nuclear projects in order to mobilise capital.

However, challenges remain before the UK government’s vision for a “nuclear renaissance for Britain” materialises. The Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce (established by the Prime Minister in February 2025) published its review in November 2025 and confirmed that the UK remains “the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear projects”. Industry participants have warned that regulatory requirements, particularly regarding permitting and siting, represent material barriers to accelerated deployment. The Taskforce’s recommendations seek to remedy fragmentation in regulatory oversight, and to streamline environmental and permitting processes, advocating for a “radical reset” through establishing a single, unified decision-making body—a Commission on Nuclear Regulation—to act as final arbiter on all major nuclear regulatory decisions. The UK government has accepted the Taskforce’s recommendations, and is expected to produce a full implementation plan in early 2026, marking a critical juncture for whether regulatory reform can deliver the cost reductions and acceleration necessary to realise the UK’s nuclear ambitions.

We expect the future shape of the GB energy market to become clearer in 2026 as the government crystallises its thinking to electricity markets and reviews gas security of supply (as described further below). In addition, we expect the consultation on the role of Ofgem to be on the agenda in 2026, following a call for evidence in December 2024. As highlighted in the Treasury’s Regulation Action Plan Update, published in October 2025, the review is nearly complete and “recommendations for streamlining Ofgem’s duties and strengthening its mandate on growth” are imminent. Ofgem’s current remit includes regulating gas and electricity markets, heat networks, the regulated asset base model for nuclear power and carbon dioxide transport and storage networks, as well as overseeing NESO. As we have noted previously, the outcome of the review may therefore have wide-ranging consequences across the GB energy regulatory landscape.

Electricity

2025 saw significant scrutiny of the wholesale market driven by the ongoing Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA) programme. In the REMA Update, published in July 2025, the government announced its decision to commit to a single national wholesale electricity market price, ruling out zonal pricing. DESNZ has, however, been clear that business-as-usual is not sustainable and indicated its intention to use a range of levers to incentivise both optimal locations for new assets and efficient system operation. For further details, please see our article here. 2026 is expected to see the publication of the Reformed National Pricing (RNP) delivery plan. Originally expected in autumn 2025, this will set out key activities for implementing RNP and an overview of the legislation required to deliver the package. The RNP deliver plan will be supported by broader market changes, including to electricity system planning, to the Balancing Mechanism, to Transmission Network Use of System charges and to the Capacity Market (see the Energy Networks and the Electricity Storage and Flexible power sections).

These market changes and interventions will need to factor in a possible future re-integration of the GB power market into the EU internal electricity market. Both the UK government and the European Commission (EC) have highlighted the benefits of reintegration, including lower consumer prices, investment in the North Sea and strengthening energy security. On 22 December 2025, they confirmed plans to begin negotiations for a European Union-United Kingdom Electricity Agreement to provide the framework for the UK’s renewed participation. It is intended that this agreement will cover wholesale and retail markets, aligning UK and EC rules for the promotion of renewables, environmental protections and State aid.

Gas

In relation to gas, 2026 is likely to see an open debate on the role of gas in the UK’s future energy mix following a consultation in November 2025 on the priorities for gas security of supply during the energy transition, and the associated challenges facing the sector. The consultation highlights that the pattern of gas supply and consumption is changing and that measures may need to be taken to ensure that security of supply is assured in rarer scenarios (e.g unprecedented failures or rare cold weather events). Whilst levers to manage this include gas storage facilities, LNG infrastructure and gas interconnectors, DESNZ highlights it would also like to explore the concept of a strategic gas storage reserve or longer-term gas contracting models. In addition, to ensure that the commercial model of gas supply works for asset owners and investors, the government is considering whether there could be a case for revenue support mechanisms for certain types of infrastructure and whether there is scope to reduce regulatory barriers to flexibility in the gas market. A response is expected in spring 2026 with further consultations to refine the detailed proposals.

Retail and supply

In relation to the retail market, following Ofgem’s publication of its Markets Regulatory Vision and Strategy in November 2025, in 2026 we expect to see continued focus on consumer energy bills and engaging consumers in the transition to net zero for example through developing skills and incentives to increase consumer engagement in electricity-system flexibility (following a consultation in 2025). Development of consumer-led flexibility will be supported by technical decisions on the sharing of customer smart data and to ensure greater visibility of distributed energy assets, as well as the migration to market-wide half-hourly settlement (currently underway and scheduled for completion in May 2027).

2026 will also see implementation of the government’s Autumn Budget and Industrial Strategy priorities to lower bills for domestic and non-domestic consumers. In particular, following the announcement of the removal of some social and environmental levies funding a range of schemes (see our briefing here), Ofgem and DESNZ will be looking to ensure the savings are fully passed on by suppliers. 2026 is also likely to see a decision (following a consultation in September 2025) on a new licence requirement on energy suppliers to offer customers at least one tariff with lower standing charges (i.e. charges designed to recover the fixed costs of the system). This is related to a wider question about how energy costs are distributed and paid for (see the Energy Markets section). Separately, following publication of its Debt Strategy, Ofgem is also consulting on a Debt Relief Scheme for customers in arrears on their energy bills for implementation this year.

Energy networks look set to continue their transition in 2026. Some analysts suggest that electricity demand is at a tipping point, predicting this is set to grow in 2026 for the first time in several years, driven by the rapid adoption of AI and the electrification of transport. Ofgem has approved an initial £28 billion investment in gas and electricity networks (with potential for this to rise to £90 billion over the five years to 2031) as part of the next price control period beginning in April 2026. £17.8 billion of this initial spending will go towards gas networks, with £10.3 billion supporting high-voltage electricity infrastructure. We are already seeing increased activity to deliver this level of new investment. Coupled with the launch of a new regulatory regime for heat networks and proposals to build the UK’s first hydrogen transport network (see the Hydrogen section), 2026 promises to be a significant year for energy network development.

The cost of increased energy network investment, as well as other costs (such as operating and policy costs), are currently collected through charges. In this context, Ofgem held a consultation in 2025 to consider whether there are more efficient ways to allocate and recover energy system costs. Following review of over 300 responses, Ofgem expects to consult on policy options in spring 2026.

2026 will also be a crucial year for network planning and the development of NESO’s centralised planning of the transmission and distribution networks with development of the first Strategic Spatial Energy Plan (SSEP) underway, following publication of the SSEP methodology in 2025. The SSEP is a long-term blueprint identifying where, and what types of, electricity and hydrogen generation and storage are needed for net zero. Originally planned for publication in the summer, final publication of the SSEP has shifted to 2027 to incorporate updated cost data into its modelling for accuracy and transparency. The SSEP will inform and complement NESO’s Centralised Strategic Network Plan (CSNP), a 25-year network blueprint for onshore and offshore transmission network requirements for electricity, hydrogen and gas, and eleven Regional Energy Strategic Plans (RESPs), comprising regional whole system energy plans across different energy types and including spatial models of future supply and demand. 2026 will see the publication of the RESPs methodology following a consultation.

Electricity networks

Increased electrification, coupled with accelerated renewable energy deployment, has exposed grid constraints as a critical bottleneck in the electricity market in Great Britain. Connection queues (for entry capacity and demand connections) now far exceed available capacity, highlighting the urgent need for substantial upgrades to the networks. Recognising that timely and efficient grid connections are essential, not only to deliver CP30 ambitions, but also to stimulate economic growth and reduce consumer costs, the government, NESO and Ofgem tackled management of the grid connection queue in 2025. Looking ahead, 2026 will see further implementation of these policies.

At the forefront is the continuation of Ofgem’s Connections Reform programme, which aims to clear speculative projects from the queue and prioritise those ready and critical to CP30 delivery. Ofgem’s approval of NESO’s “First Ready, First Needed” approach (TM04+) in April 2025 marked a decisive shift from the historic “first come, first served” model of managing grid connections. Under the new framework, Gate 2 readiness criteria were applied to determine revised queue positions and connection dates based on technology type, location, strategic alignment, and project readiness, enabling NESO to decide which projects advance in Phase 1 by 2030 and which will follow in Phase 2 by 2035. At the heart of reforms is the prioritisation of projects “where needed”, a key element of the government’s Reformed National Pricing package (see the Energy Markets section). In this regard, the development of the SSEP, CSNP and RESPs (mentioned above) will be key. Following the publication of the Connection Reform results on 8 December, the first batch of developers with connection dates in 2026/27 are now being issued with updated connection offers, with Gate 2 final customer notifications expected to be issued no later than Q3 2026. Projects failing Gate 2 criteria will receive Gate 1 offers—indicative, non-committed terms—allowing developers to terminate applications by the end of 2026. With the timeline still under review and some projects inevitably being de-prioritised, it remains to be seen whether these decisions will be challenged. Associated with this, Ofgem is currently consulting on changes to network company licence conditions and the broader regulatory framework for grid connections, to align this with the Connections Reform package.

The government, NESO and Ofgem are also looking to address the surge in demand connection applications, particularly from data centres, which has brought the total demand queue to 125GW as of June 2025. Targeted interventions are being considered to curate a viable demand queue, improve data quality and transparency, and prioritise strategically aligned demand connections. Proposed reforms include changes to grid securities, progression fees, and enabling greater participation in high-voltage asset ownership, all aimed at accelerating connection timeframes and supporting market-driven solutions. The government has also asked, Lucy Yu, the DESNZ-appointed AI Champion for Clean Energy, to carry out a review of the potential benefits and challenges of AI deployment to electricity networks, with a final report including recommendations to governments, regulators and industry, expected to be published by the summer.

Gas networks

On 30 June 2025 DESNZ published its Midstream gas system: Update to Market, setting out the government’s view on upcoming changes to the gas system in Great Britain and the measures being taken to ensure a secure, affordable and fair transition away from gas. As part of its public engagement plan, DESNZ launched a consultation in November 2025 (closing 18 February 2026) on its assessment of the priorities for security of supply. This includes consideration of the role of gas storage facilities, LNG infrastructure and gas interconnectors, and exploration of whether additional policy intervention is needed to ensure the commercial model supports the required capacity in the context of shrinking demand. In 2026, the government is expected to issue calls for evidence on network investment and affordability, and the transition of the gas system.

Heat networks

From 27 January 2026, Ofgem begins regulating heat networks in Great Britain, introducing a new authorisation regime for regulated heat network activities, strengthening consumer protections, and imposing technical standards requirements. The Heat Network Technical Assurance Scheme (HNTAS) provides the mechanism through which operators, which must register with Ofgem by 26 January 2026, evidence compliance. In parallel, the government is progressing heat network zoning, which will designate areas where heat networks offer the lowest-cost pathway to decarbonising heat. Authorities expect designations to commence in 2026 as the implementing framework takes shape.

The ambition to grow heat networks, from around 3% of heat supply today to 20% by 2050 carries an estimated investment opportunity of £60-£80 billion by mid-century. Capital grant funding—including the Green Heat Network Fund—supports this expansion. Heat pump installations have also accelerated, reaching 35,387 in the first nine months of 2025, whilst the Clean Heat Market Mechanism sets manufacturers’ Year 2 obligation at 8% of relevant boiler sales from 1 April 2026 (rising from 6%). Yet familiar constraints continue to shape delivery: the electricity-to-gas price differential blunts the household business case, grid capacity and connection timelines increasingly bite, and the supply chain—spanning manufacturing, installation, and skills—remains under pressure.

The UK CCUS sector has reached a key moment in its development with significant developments in 2025. Notably, Eni’s Liverpool Bay CO2 T&S network reached FID in April, becoming the UK’s second carbon dioxide (CO2) transport and storage (T&S) network to achieve FID (following the East Coast Cluster, developed by the Northern Endurance Partnership, in December 2024). Key emitter carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects connecting to HyNet, Padeswood cement works (Heidleberg Materials) and Protos Energy Recovery Facility (Encyclis), subsequently took FID in the autumn. £9.4 billion of additional devex funding for the sector was announced in the 2025 Spending Review, providing capital for these Track 1 projects along with devex funding for the next wave of projects in Track 2. Rounding off a busy year for the sector, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) also launched its second carbon storage licensing round, offering 14 sites in English and Scottish waters to developers for exploration and appraisal, with applications due by 24 March 2026.

2026 will see the government focus on using existing capacity in these two CO2 T&S networks. We expect continued negotiations in relation to the emitter projects shortlisted for negotiation as part of the HyNet expansion exercise. The government has also indicated it will launch a further selection process in early 2026 for connections for Teesside-based projects to the East Coast Cluster. This is likely to be a high priority given bp’s decision in December to withdraw plans to develop the H2 Teesside hydrogen with CCS project (amidst competing demands for a data centre at the site). Industry bodies such as the Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA) are also pressing government for progress in 2026 on negotiations with the Track 2 CO2 T&S networks: Acorn and Viking. In parallel, the market will be keen to gauge investor appetite in the proposed sale of Storegga’s stake in Acorn.

In this context, DESNZ is continuing its programme to deliver the CCUS regulatory framework. In 2026, government will consult on its view of future CCUS networks and the evolution of economic regulation for CO2 storage, following two Calls for Evidence in 2025. It will also seek stakeholder input on revisions to the framework for third party access to CCS infrastructure, and is expected to publish a long-awaited consultation on non-pipeline CO2 transportation which will be important for dispersed emitters.

The government took steps in 2025 to advance Greenhouse Gas Removals (GGR) and power with bioenergy and CCS (BECCS) to encourage private investment in large-scale GGR projects, including a £60 million Direct Air Capture and GGR Innovation Program to lower capture technology costs. In August 2025, details of the GGR business model terms for projects in the HyNet Track-1 expansion negotiation list were published. A UK GGR Standard is also under development, with interim methodologies for BECCS and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) released by British Standards Institution in July 2025. The October 2025 Whitehead Review also recommended specific measures to accelerate GGR deployment, including establishment of an Office for Greenhouse Gas Removals.

In its Delivery Plan Update, published in December 2025, the CCSA highlighted the scale of development in the UK, which now has more than 100 CCUS initiatives under way with potential to capture and store roughly 77 million tonnes of CO2 annually. Despite this growth, the CCSA found that “policy uncertainty is slowing progress, stalling projects and risking investment”, noting that since 2023, 27 projects have been paused or delayed, with most experiencing average delays of around two years. As a result, industry is calling for the government to provide greater visibility of timelines for Track 2 and beyond in 2026, to increase confidence for investors in the development project pipeline.

On the international stage, the UK government used the COP30 summit to highlight its significant progress in CCUS, and leadership in emerging removal technologies. The UK and EU’s decision to link their respective Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) is also expected to be an area of focus in 2026, as this will facilitate cross-border CO2 storage and enhance the competitiveness of UK CO2 storage projects. Industry will be hoping for further details on arrangements as part of the government’s wider negotiations with the EU (also see the Carbon Markets section).

Whilst 2025 saw steady progress in the UK’s low carbon hydrogen sector with a range of positive announcements from both the public and private sectors (outlined below), the pace of development has slowed. Projects faced delays, raising concerns about project costs, demand for low carbon hydrogen and government funding constraints. With the publication of the Hydrogen Strategy Refresh delayed from 2025, industry will be looking for government to provide fresh impetus into the market in 2026. Looking back on 2025, DESNZ made several significant hydrogen-related announcements.

In relation to the Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HARs), under which DESNZ allocates revenue support to electrolytic hydrogen projects, DESNZ published its HAR2 shortlist in April, advancing 27 electrolytic projects to the next stage of the process. Each of the shortlisted projects will now need to pass a rigorous due diligence process (with strong emphasis placed on value for money) in order to progress further. DESNZ expects to announce the successful projects in early 2026.

The HAR2 announcement was followed in July 2025 by DESNZ’s ‘Hydrogen Update to the Market’ (the Hydrogen Update) in which DESNZ confirmed continued cross-government backing for hydrogen across key end-uses, notably in aviation where the newly introduced Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate (and the associated SAF revenue certainty mechanism which is designed to support SAF producers) provides opportunities for hydrogen-derived fuels (for further details on SAF, see the Alternative Fuels section). At the same time, DESNZ also confirmed the signing of ten HAR1 commercial scale green hydrogen projects. These projects, which include Hygen’s Bradford Low Carbon Hydrogen project and MorGen’s West Wales Hydrogen project, can now begin construction. DESNZ also confirmed it is currently aiming to launch HAR3 by 2026 and HAR4 from 2028.

From a regulatory perspective, green hydrogen producers also received a welcome boost when, in the November 2025 Budget, the government confirmed that it will make electricity used as part of hydrogen production via electrolysis exempt from Climate Change Levy costs, thus improving the operating cost profile of these projects. Separately, in relation to the funding of the Hydrogen Business Models, industry stakeholders are still awaiting the government’s response to the January 2025 consultation on the Gas Shipper Obligation.

Progress in relation to CCS-enabled hydrogen production was rather more limited in 2025 (for further details on CCUS, see the CCUS section). At present, no ‘blue hydrogen’ project in the UK has yet reached financial close and, in December 2025, bp decided against building a hydrogen plant in a site on Teesside, which will now be used to host a data centre instead (see the Digital & Telecoms Infrastructure section).

The government’s focus is turning to hydrogen networks and storage. The Hydrogen Update reaffirmed the ambition to develop the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, to be operational in 2031. This was accompanied by development funding. The Spending Review in June 2025 allocated £500m for the development of hydrogen infrastructure and Ofgem announced a total of £164m of funding for Project Union in October, which seeks to repurpose existing natural gas pipelines and build new pipelines as required to create a new 1500 mile core hydrogen network for Britain, laying the groundwork for connecting regional hydrogen industrial clusters across the North of England and Scotland.

We expect activity in 2026 will be focused on the delivery of the first network, building on a consultation response on the economic regulatory framework underpinning hydrogen pipeline networks in December. This confirmed the government’s intention to establish an effective economic regulatory framework for hydrogen pipeline networks through legislation, licences, and a new hydrogen network code. We also expect further work in relation to the proposed Hydrogen Storage and Hydrogen Transport Business Models. In addition, work is underway on system planning. In October 2025, DESNZ published a policy statement setting out its view on how NESO will carry out strategic planning for hydrogen infrastructure, whilst noting that DESNZ will remain the decision maker regarding the Hydrogen Business Models. The policy statement stressed the importance of NESO taking a ‘whole system’ approach and ensuring that hydrogen infrastructure is integrated into broader energy system planning.

In relation to H2P, the government confirmed in December 2024 that it will introduce a market intervention to de-risk investment in hydrogen to power by a Hydrogen to Power Business Model based on elements of the Dispatchable Power Agreement for CCS-enabled gas-fired generation. In March 2025 DESNZ launched a consultation seeking technical evidence on innovative H2P projects which can be delivered by 2030 ahead of large-scale enabling hydrogen infrastructure. We expect to receive more details of the Hydrogen to Power Business Model during the course of 2026. Please also see the Electricity Storage and Flexible Power section.

In 2025, the UK government’s commitment to a “phased and responsible transition” in the North Sea remained an organising principle, but fiscal and operational pressures have intensified. In her 2025 Autumn Budget speech, the Chancellor emphasised that the UK must “build the industry of the future”, whilst retaining the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) until 2030. While Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) described this as a “bitter blow” to investment confidence, the Budget at least brought some welcome clarity on the policy direction.

The Budget coincided with publication of the government’s North Sea Future Plan, which, whilst reaffirming Labour’s manifesto commitment not to issue new oil and gas licences for new fields, introduces limited flexibility through a Transitional Energy Certificates (TECs) mechanism. TECs will permit limited production from areas tied to, or adjacent to, existing fields, provided this involves no new exploration and is necessary for a managed, prosperous, and orderly transition.

The EPL remains scheduled to conclude on 31 March 2030 but could end earlier if the EPL’s price floor—the “Energy Security Investment Mechanism” (ESIM)—is triggered. The ESIM will terminate the EPL if six-month average prices for both oil and gas fall to, or below, $74.21 per barrel and 57p per therm. The Chancellor also confirmed plans for a new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) to take effect when the EPL concludes. Like the EPL, the OGPM is intended to operate as a windfall tax on upstream oil and gas companies operating in the UK, but will impose an additional 35% tax rate on oil profits only where oil exceeds $90 per barrel, or on gas profits where gas exceeds 90p per therm, well above the ESIM price floor.

Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts point to a prolonged “gap” scenario through 2030, during which oil and gas prices are expected to remain above the ESIM floor, preventing early termination of the EPL, while remaining below the substantially higher price thresholds required to activate the OGPM successor tax. The result is a misalignment between the termination conditions for the existing levy, and the commencement conditions for its replacement. During this period, the EPL would continue to apply to producers at relatively moderate oil and gas prices, while the successor windfall tax remains inactive. This arguably extends windfall-style taxation beyond genuine windfall conditions, reinforcing industry concerns that the UK fiscal regime risks remaining internationally uncompetitive throughout this intervening period.

Regulatory risk has also tightened. Following the Supreme Court’s Finch ruling in June 2024, the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) issued guidance in June 2025 on environmental impact assessments for offshore projects. OPRED applies a rebuttable presumption that all hydrocarbons produced over a project’s lifetime will ultimately be combusted when assessing scope 3 emissions, while setting out the evidentiary route to rebuttal.

The EPL, together with the UK government’s policy on exploration, and recent regulatory and other legal challenges to new developments, have dampened exploration and development activity in the North Sea, a trend which we expect to continue through 2026. Conversely, these factors contributed to an increase in oil and gas M&A activity in 2025, as producers sought to replenish reserves and to generate returns from operational and financial synergies.

On emissions performance, operators’ abatement efforts contributed to a 34% drop in UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) oil and gas production emissions between 2018 and 2024, exceeding the North Sea Transition Deal’s 25% target for 2027. Yet, the NSTA’s September 2025 report warned that, without sustained focus on electrification and the elimination of routine flaring, emissions intensity could worsen, leaving UK production “less clean and less competitive compared with imports over time”. The NSTA has therefore signalled stronger impetus for electrification projects, including through primary legislation to amend its statutory objectives.

Finally, the integrated energy opportunity has expanded, with offshore wind, CCUS, and low-carbon hydrogen sharpening the case for repurposing infrastructure and supply chains. The Clean Energy Jobs Plan commits to expanding the Energy Skills Passport beyond offshore wind into sectors including nuclear and electricity networks. A new North Sea Jobs Service—launching in 2026—will also provide end-to-end transition support for oil and gas workers moving into clean energy, defence, and advanced manufacturing roles. Overall, 2025 brought consolidation rather than wholesale change, but 2026 may test the credibility of the “phased and responsible transition” framework.

Digital infrastructure will remain a priority area for UK policymakers in 2026, as government focus shifts from recognising the sector’s strategic importance to actively shaping how it develops. Demand for data, connectivity and compute capacity continues to grow rapidly; the policy and regulatory steps taken over the past year make clear that the question for the next phase is not whether the sector will grow, but how that growth can be enabled at pace within increasingly visible system constraints.

The most significant regulatory development in the sector is the emergence of AI Growth Zones. Building on earlier announcements, the government confirmed additional Zone sites in 2025 and published a policy framework focused on accelerating delivery of AI‑driven data centre infrastructure. The approach explicitly prioritises strategically important digital infrastructure rather than reliance on a purely market‑led model. For developers and investors, AI Growth Zones will influence site selection, programme sequencing and financing structures. The framework also raises regulatory questions about transparency, competition and how prioritised projects interact with wider network planning and regional development objectives.

Less visible, yet highly determinative, are the power availability, connection costs, and delivery timelines. These factors now drive site selection and investment viability, as data centres compete for constrained grid capacity alongside broader electrification demands (see the Electricity Networks section). Developers respond through more integrated power strategies such as private wire arrangements, on-site generation, battery storage, and demand-flexibility solutions, blurring the traditional boundary between digital and energy infrastructure. These constraints reshape financing structures directly by heightening pre-FID risk, extending development horizons, and potentially sharpening focus on balance-sheet strength, phased deployment, and power-linked risk allocation. Simultaneously, environmental considerations, particularly water use, heat reuse, and emissions reporting, are evolving from secondary ESG matters into licence-to-operate imperatives, whilst shortages in specialist construction capacity and long-lead electrical equipment threaten programme certainty.

Planning reform to accelerate digital infrastructure deployment will be another key government priority for the year ahead. In December 2025, the government launched a call for evidence on reforming planning rules to accelerate roll‑out, targeting areas where low‑impact digital infrastructure upgrades face avoidable delay and cost. This process signals a clear intention to reduce friction at local planning level, and to move more digital infrastructure into a permitted development regime. These reforms could materially shorten delivery times for network densification and upgrades, supporting nationwide connectivity objectives, and providing greater certainty for developers and operators.

The designation of data centres as part of the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure reinforces their role as foundational assets for the economy and public services, supporting continued investment in the sector. The Cyber Security and Resilience Bill, first read in Parliament on 12 November 2025, will extend baseline security standards and accelerated incident‑reporting requirements to data centre operators, increasing regulatory scrutiny of governance and operational resilience.

These developments point to continued expansion for digital infrastructure in 2026. Growth remains strongly supported, but increasingly shaped through planning reform, strategic prioritisation, and national security regulation. Success will depend on effective coordination between policymakers, regulators, and industry participants as digital infrastructure becomes ever more integral to the UK’s economic and security framework.

The coming year will be transformational for the UK water sector, heralding a range of major regulatory and institutional reforms that could reshape how water companies operate, invest, and engage with customers and the environment. The challenge for government will be to strike the right balance between regulatory rigor and consumer confidence and maintaining the sector’s attractiveness to private capital.

Fundamental regulatory changes are likely to be implemented following the Independent Water Commission’s Final Report in July 2025 (for further details see our article here). The Final Report recommended significant changes to the regulation of the water industry in England and Wales, including: (i) abolition of Ofwat and establishment of new integrated water regulators; (ii) significant re-orientation of the Price Review process towards a ‘supervisory’ approach; (iii) establishment of a new water Ombudsman in England; (iv) establishment of nine new regional water system planning authorities to oversee translation of national priorities into local plans; (v) development of new National Water Strategies and Ministerial Statements of Water Industry Priorities to provide clear, strategic direction to the sector; (vi) significant reforms to Operator Self-Monitoring to assure public health outcomes; (vii) greater alignment of public and private sector interests, including a new public benefit clause in water company licenses. The government rapidly confirmed its intention to abolish Ofwat and to introduce a single regulator for the water system in England. Full details on this and the response to other recommendations is expected imminently, followed by a public consultation on reform proposals and the transition pathway, with a new Water Reform Bill to follow. With the 2029 Price Review 2029 already coming into view, industry will be keen to achieve greater clarity on the recommendations that will be taken forward and the potential implications of these on water company businesses.

Public trust in the industry is set to remain a significant priority for industry and government. The Water (Special Measures) Act—now in effect— has strengthened regulators’ powers to ban bonuses for executives who fail to meet specific environmental and financial standards, and to bring criminal charges for persistent lawbreakers. Ofwat has also consulted on new rules to ensure senior executives meet standards of fitness and propriety to carry out their responsibilities and for involving consumers in water company decision making. Industry stakeholders will continue to monitor how these, and a raft of other new powers, are applied. In 2025, six water companies triggered the bonus ban rule under the Act for a variety of performance failures, mostly involving pollution incidents. Taken together with new minimum service standards and associated customer compensation levels, stricter enforcement and an emphasis on accountability are expected.

Final clarity on most PR24 spending plans is expected in March, when the CMA publishes its final re-determinations for the five companies that appealed Ofwat’s original determinations. The CMA has provisionally indicated that it may permit 21% - an additional £556 million in revenue – of the headline £2.7 billion the appellants collectively requested and a slightly higher average rate of return (4.29% up from 4.03%). However, it also cautioned that it would “largely reject” funding requests for new activities and projects “beyond the significant increases already allowed by Ofwat”. These headline results also belie an uneven distribution among the appellants.

Along with sector level reforms, the financial sustainability of individual water companies looks set to be tested further in 2026 with Thames Water’s long-awaiting recapitalisation plans still unresolved, its PR24 determination reference deferred indefinitely by Ofwat, and the government so far resisting temporary renationalisation under the special administration regime.",https://www.slaughterandmay.com/media/gjlnjqob/crst2510-dt003_hs26-og-share-images-energy-trans.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:57:00.121941

Despite this strong feedstock base, Mexico lacks pilot plants, industrial-scale projects and refineries adapted for SAF production, as well as intersectoral consortia.
Meanwhile, Chile has promoted green hydrogen as a key energy vector and set a target to begin SAF production by 2030, with projections extending to 2050.
Current SAF production relies primarily on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from used cooking oil.
Mexico, despite being Latin America’s second-largest aviation fuel consumer, is expected to supply only about 3% of SAF demand by 2050.","Latin America must develop a clearer understanding of its potential to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and implement public policies that enable industrial development, according to Daniel Chereau, Head Fuel, International Air Transport Association (IATA), in an interview with A21.

Chereau said global adoption of SAF will advance at different speeds depending on regional conditions and regulatory frameworks. “What is missing in Latin America is understanding the potential as producers and that governments establish public policies that deliver incentives” he said.

He noted that Brazil is among the most advanced markets in the region, largely due to ethanol policies that have been in place for more than 50 years. “From that perspective, it is natural to expect Brazil to have a more developed SAF industry,” Chereau said.

In Mexico, discussions are underway with sugar producers amid declining demand for sugar and growing interest in biofuels as an alternative outlet. Chereau recalled that Mexico’s airport and fuel services agency, Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA), previously developed a “flight plan” aimed at integrating stakeholders across the aviation value chain. Despite long-standing interest, he said the initiative lacked the incentive policies needed for implementation.

ASA, Mexico’s main jet fuel supplier, serves 52 airports and supplies more than 90% of the domestic market. The agency aims to promote clean energy use and support the aviation sector’s sustainable transition through the development and deployment of SAF. Infrastructure, Communications and Transportation Minister Jesús Esteva said at ASA’s 60th anniversary event that SAF implementation is “one of the biggest challenges” facing the aviation sector and that ASA must lead efforts to expand supply.

ASA Director Carlos Merino said the agency has launched a pilot project to blend imported SAF with conventional jet fuel, with a long-term goal of producing SAF domestically by 2030. In the near term, imports—likely from the United States—will remain necessary. Mexico also participates in ICAO’s CORSIA scheme, which includes a voluntary phase from 2024 to 2026 and mandatory targets from 2027 to 2035.

According to Guillermo Gómez, CEO, Consultoría Sustentable G2H, Mexico’s primary SAF advantage lies in its biomass resources, including agricultural, forestry and urban waste, used cooking oils and potential power-to-liquid pathways. Sugarcane and sorghum stand out due to their scale and integration potential. Sugarcane alone covers more than 800,000 hectares across at least 15 states and supports the production of sugar, bagasse, bioelectricity and ethanol.

Despite this strong feedstock base, Mexico lacks pilot plants, industrial-scale projects and refineries adapted for SAF production, as well as intersectoral consortia. Gómez said this gap represents an opportunity to build capacity through research, financing and innovation, but would require coordinated efforts among government, industry and rural producers.

In Colombia, palm oil producers have expressed interest in entering the SAF market, a process Chereau described as similar to Mexico’s engagement with the sugar industry. Meanwhile, Chile has promoted green hydrogen as a key energy vector and set a target to begin SAF production by 2030, with projections extending to 2050. “Latin America is a vast region with regulatory fragmentation and differing sustainability policies, but there are emerging signals in certain countries,” Chereau said.

He emphasized that technology will be critical to lowering costs. Current SAF production relies primarily on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from used cooking oil. “Once we have the appropriate technology for each feedstock, costs will come down and prices will become more accessible,” he said.

Chereau added that incentive mechanisms should support technological development while leveraging the region’s role as a major producer of raw materials. “We are talking about incentives that favor technology development and take advantage of our position as feedstock producers,” he said.

According to the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), the region’s lack of SAF production and active projects could increase aviation costs by up to US$318 billion. Mexico, despite being Latin America’s second-largest aviation fuel consumer, is expected to supply only about 3% of SAF demand by 2050.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202026-01-15%20091026.png?h=353d28b9&itok=cPGhDXvM,N,,2026-01-15 10:57:31.018859

eBay unveils first climate plan, targets net-zero by 2045

eBay has released its first climate transition plan, aiming to achieve net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2045. The corporation has already achieved 100% renewable electricity for its facilities by 2024 and reduced operational emissions by 92% from 2019 levels, while transportation emissions are down 21%, with a 27.5% reduction objective by 2030.

Chief Sustainability Officer Renee Morin called shipping, which accounts for 84% of eBay’s Scope 3 footprint, the “toughest challenge,” stressing that “we have to be creative to achieve our goals,” including collaborating with carriers on local pickup and shifting from air to truck transport.

The plan includes boosting renewable energy deployment, scaling low-carbon shipping solutions, and promoting resale and reuse. This puts eBay in line with Amazon and Alibaba, who have already committed to long-term carbon neutrality.

Salesforce signs deals to purchase carbon removal from 19 early-stage suppliers

Salesforce, via Milkywire, has signed $5 million in carbon removal pre-purchase deals with 19 early-stage suppliers across biochar, BioCCS, next-gen DAC (Direct Air Capture), enhanced rock weathering, biomass storage, and mineralisation, backing “first-of-a-kind and research-intensive projects” not yet served by mainstream buyers. The agreements contribute to Salesforce’s First Movers Coalition pledge to contract $100 million of CO₂ removal solutions by 2030 to help scale CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal).

Jamila Yamani, Salesforce Director of Climate and Energy, said companies must “invest in solutions before they are fully proven at scale” and that the partnership helps move “durable carbon removal from concept toward commercial reality,” including the use of AI tools for monitoring and scalability. Projects include Kairos Carbon’s wet organic-waste BioCCS pathway, DAC firms Norma and Arbon, and Flux’s mineral feedstock that doubles as a fertilizer, improving soil health and harvests. Milkywire’s Robert Höglund framed the strategy as “enabling technologies and the ecosystem that we need tomorrow.”

(NASDAQ: GEVO), a company focused on renewable fuels, sustainable chemicals, and carbon management solutions, has secured a new U.S. patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The newly issued U.S. Patent No. 12,486,207 B2 strengthens Gevo’s intellectual property coverage by extending protection across a range of catalyst configurations and formally covering the application of Ethanol-to-Olefins (ETO) technology for fuel production.

The ETO platform is being advanced through multiple collaborations. Gevo is working with LG Chem, Ltd. to apply its next-generation ETO process to renewable chemical manufacturing, while fuel-related applications are being developed alongside Axens and IFP Energies nouvelles (IFPEN). The patented method converts ethanol into light olefins, which can then be upgraded into transportation fuels using established Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technologies. These olefins also serve as key inputs for producing competitively priced renewable chemicals, including bio-based propylene. As development progresses, the ETO approach is projected to reduce both capital and operating expenses by as much as 35% compared with existing alternatives.

According to Gevo President Dr. Paul Bloom, the patent represents a meaningful step forward in the company’s strategy to streamline the conversion of ethanol into fuels and chemicals. He noted that expanding Gevo’s proprietary technology base supports a more economical route to sustainable aviation fuel and reinforces the company’s long-term ambition to achieve cost leadership in ATJ solutions.

Looking ahead, Gevo plans to lead the initial rollout of its ETO technology in North America, a move expected to stimulate rural economic growth and job creation.

Copper demand continued to grow in 2025, driven by energy-transition requirements originating in the transportation sector, as well as emerging demand from data centers. The market enters into a deficit in 2026. Copper supply faces acute long-term pressure, as a boom in copper-intensive data centers coincides with mine disruptions and slow permitting.

A tight copper market in 2026 signals higher price risk and potential supply-chain constraints for electrification projects. The proliferation of EVs, the expansion of grids and the manufacturing of batteries could face cost inflation or delays.

Japan power – Average baseload power price for 2026 will fall to ¥11.4 per kilowatt-hour

Japan’s power prices are set to trend downward over the next five years as flat demand meets supply growth. BNEF expects Japan’s power prices to average ¥11.4 per kilowatt-hour in the coming year, a 5.1% drop from 2025. Japan’s declining average power prices may relieve industrial cost pressures but will challenge merchant generators.

However, structural shifts – such as aging fossil fuel generators being displaced by nuclear and renewable generation, along with hotter, prolonged summers – could still create sharp peaks and stress the power system.

EU carbon – Carbon price hits €87 per ton

Prices in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System will rise 16% in 2026 to €87 per ton. This is primarily due to a 21% drop in allowance supply – the result of a downward revision on free allocation benchmarks, the phase-in of the levy for the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and shipping allowance cancellations. A tighter allowance market will raise compliance costs for heavy industry and power producers, increasing the incentive for fuel switching, efficiency measures and early decarbonization.

LNG supply – 29 million metric tons of new capacity to come online in 2026

The global LNG market is headed for a glut in supply, with new production capacity slated to commission from the US, Qatar, Australia, Mexico and Africa in 2026. About 8 million tons of export capacity is expected online from the major Qatari North Field Expansion project, and the Golden Pass LNG project in Texas adds two out of three production trains in 2026 – at 5.2 million tons capacity each.

The level of supply entering the market will depend on the commissioning timelines and ramp-up schedules set by the operators. Much of this new capacity is not directly tied to long-term LNG contracts and could find its way into the spot market, putting downward pressure on prices –already reflected in the forward curves for the European gas benchmark price and the Asian spot LNG price marker in coming years.

Renewable fuels – 1.07 billion gallons per year of new renewable fuels production capacity announced for China

China’s 15th five-year plan, to be announced in March, is widely expected to introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending target. As the market evolves from pilot programs to mandated consumption levels, the volume of announced production capacity targeted to come online in 2026 has hit a high over 1 billion gallons per year, almost half of all global additions announced in the year ahead.

China’s move toward a national SAF mandate positions it to dominate global renewable-fuel manufacturing capacity. This could shift supply chains, lower SAF costs globally, and intensify competitive pressure on Western producers.

Petrochemicals – 15.6 million metric tons per year of new ethylene production nameplate capacity

China’s rapid capacity expansion has cut into its imports, redirecting them to Europe and squeezing the region’s older and smaller assets that were already struggling with high costs and thin margins. The strain has triggered a wave of closures, the latest being Exxon Mobil Corp.’s 800,000 metric tons per year ethylene plant in Fife, Scotland. A massive wave of new Chinese-led ethylene supply will deepen global oversupply, pressure margins and accelerate closures in Europe. Petrochemical producers outside China face heightened competitiveness challenges.

Weather – +0.5°C temperature anomaly in summer

The US National Center for Environmental Prediction’s Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CSFv2) forecast puts the Niño 3.4 temperature anomaly at +0.5°C for June–August 2026. That suggests that La Niña may linger into early next year before easing toward neutral or even El Niño territory.

If this shift happens earlier than forecast, expectations for a cold La Niña winter could fade. That would reduce US heating degree days and leave natural gas supplies more comfortable by the end of winter.

US power – Power demand from data centers to reach 48.3GW

The rapid expansion of the US data center fleet will lead to a 7.7GW jump in average power demand from the sector in 2026.

Analysis of key power market regions like PJM Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot) indicates that grid tipping points are already emerging, as planned power supply fails to keep pace with accelerating data-center growth.

Data centers are now a system-wide driver of grid stress. Major markets may face capacity shortfalls unless generation and transmission expansions accelerate, increasing reliability and pricing risk.

US gas – $3.90/MMBtu marginal supply cost for Haynesville, Texas, dry gas

The US needs to unlock more gas supply to feed a growing number of LNG export terminals along the Gulf Coast and support data centers’ rising power demand. The Haynesville shale basin is expected to be a key driver of US natural gas supply growth in the medium term, given its proximity to LNG terminals and pipeline constraints limiting growth in other regions. BNEF’s latest breakeven cost estimates place the Texas-side of Haynesville as the marginal gas producing region. US Henry Hub gas price futures for 2026, as of Dec. 15, were trading at an average of $3.86/MMBtu – just below BNEF’s marginal gas production cost estimate. Maintaining supply growth to meet rising demand may require higher US gas prices or further improvements in well productivity, drilling and completion costs.

Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.
The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.
Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended.
“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said.","LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen, while pressing the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in 2024 to tighten its belt, steered the state agency to award a $2.5 million no-bid emergency contract to a bioeconomy consultant and lobbyist he knew and had traveled with as part of state delegations.

State Auditor Mike Foley alleges the Economic Development Department, in carrying out that Pillen-picked contract, broke state law by not specifying in writing what emergency justified skipping the required step of bidding out contracts worth more than $50,000, a step meant to save taxpayers money.

In a Jan. 6 audit letter Foley shared with the Governor’s Office, which was obtained by the Examiner and authenticated by the auditor, Foley dinged the department for leaving blank a required section for explaining the emergency on the state’s “Procurement Exception/Deviation” form.

That’s where department personnel must explain the circumstances justifying seeking no bids. Foley criticized the agency for leaving the second page of the May 2024 form blank, writing that it “contained questions regarding the reasons for designating the contract as an emergency.”

Foley’s letter alleges that omitting this information meant the contract did not comply with “the legal requirement to specify the nature of the supposed exigency” under the Nebraska State Procurement Act in Nebraska Revised Statutes 73-815.

That section of state law requires the agency to provide the “justification of the emergency” and requires the state to “retain a copy of the justification with the contract in the state agency files.” Violating that law carries no criminal or civil penalty.

According to Foley, the designation of the contract “as an ‘emergency’ is unsupportable.” The absence of a bidding process, Foley alleged in the letter, resulted in a $2.5 million contract for Global Sustainability Developers LLC, “a company handpicked rather than selected through the ‘time-honored’ and legally required open, competitive process.”

“I think it’s critically important, because competitive bidding is a bedrock, foundational tenet of government operation,” Foley told the Examiner of his findings. “When you sidestep a foundational tenet, it’s just waving a huge red flag for any public auditor. It smacks of favoritism.”

Contracting with GSD

Nebraska awarded the $208,333-a-month, remote work contract in May 2024 to GSD, a Lincoln firm that at the time had a single employee — owner Julie Bushell, a lobbyist with agricultural and telecommunications connections who also leads Ethos Connected, an agribusiness firm using sensors to wirelessly connect farm and ranch infrastructure, including water.

The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.

Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.

It was far larger than a typical emergency no-bid contract, with some notable exceptions during the pandemic, based on a recent legislative performance audit of state handling of emergency contracts. The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.

The auditor’s report, as well as Examiner reporting, make plain that Pillen’s office recommended the contractor on behalf of the governor. Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, was among staffers involved in the process, based on records and messages obtained by the Examiner. Chiefs of staff often communicate with state agency leaders.

DED leaders did not know firm

State correspondence indicates that top Economic Development Department leaders did not know the firm they were contracting with when the contract was awarded, based on the Auditor’s Office letter and backed by months of interviews, public records and reporting by the Examiner that started before learning of the auditor’s probe.

But Pillen knew Bushell’s work. She had joined Pillen on state trips to South Korea and Japan, records indicate. She also joined some state delegations when Pillen visited Washington, D.C. Both attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. A photo obtained by the Examiner shows Pillen and Bushell together at the 2024 Ak-sar-ben ball, held by a charitable foundation of business leaders.

To the Examiner, the Governor’s Office denied playing favorites.

Foley said Pillen told him when they talked during the audit that he himself had recommended Bushell.

The auditor said the governor, in the same conversation, described the decision as a joint one between Pillen and the DED director at the time, K.C. Belitz.

Emails between then-DED leaders, including Belitz, show the Governor’s Office’s involvement in the contracting process. Belitz did not return calls or messages seeking comment, but his correspondence says the language of the contract was “vetted thru Julie [Bushell] and the Governor.”

Governors hire and fire the leaders of many state agency departments, including the Department of Economic Development.

Belitz resigned in June 2025. Pillen replaced him with his general counsel for the Governor’s Office, Maureen Larsen, who also previously served as deputy director of Pillen’s Policy Research Office.

“I’ve been in the [Capitol] building 25 years, 11 years as an auditor, and I can’t recall anything that had the direct involvement of the governor,” Foley said.

Contract facts

Of about 4,200 contracts entered by the state in each of the past two calendar years, 22 in each year were emergency contracts for which the state sought no competitive bid, according to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, the state’s clearinghouse for such contracts.

Under the Nebraska Procurement Act, DAS is “the sole and final authority on contracts for personal property by a state agency,” including for no-bid emergency contracts.

Including the GSD contract, only five of the state’s 44 emergency no-bid contracts over the past two years left the justification blank, DAS says. Three of the five were DED contracts, officials said. Two were on behalf of DAS itself.

From mid-2020 through 2025, the Department of Economic Development signed a total of four emergency no-bid contracts, officials said. Two paid six figures. One was for five. GSD’s was for $2.5 million.

Pillen’s team blamed a former DED attorney for not adding the legal justification to the GSD contract and the others. But Pillen-led DAS signed off on the GSD contract without the justification, copies of the contract indicate.

Lee Will, director of the Department of Administrative Services, said last week that the state contracting office, after Foley’s audit, had revised its Deviation Form to make clearer that the justification section must be filled out and added a step to its processes to make sure the required box is completed.

Foley said he would like his office to join the process. State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County introduced Legislative Bill 997 Tuesday on Foley’s behalf that would require an additional copy of state no-bid contracts, including emergency no-bid contracts, to be filed with the State Auditor’s Office, in addition to the agency and DAS.

The Governor’s Office, over several days last week, told the Examiner Pillen recommended contracting with Bushell because of her business connections, leads on potential development projects and experience in maximizing how much federal money Nebraska could secure at the end of the Biden administration.

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the Governor’s Office has supported two emergency no-bid contracts “when the Legislature passed requirements to engage vendors in a certain timeframe, and the cumbersome procurement process would not have met the deadline.”

Both have helped taxpayers, she argued, and “delivered overwhelming value to Nebraska.” One was the DED contract with GSD. Another was a $10 million, four-year state contract with Utah-based Epiphany Associates and the Department of Administrative Services to help DAS use technology to find potential “systemic cost savings across state government.”

“The bioeconomy contract delivered hundreds of millions to Nebraska, and the DAS cost-reduction effort continues to produce lasting reforms in cost-cutting efforts for the state,” Strimple said.

The Epiphany contract drew legislative scrutiny during the 2024 session, including questions from state senators about whether leadership of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services should have disclosed previous ties to the company.

Governor’s Office: Bushell helped state get funds

Team Pillen says Bushell’s business, GSD, helped Nebraska secure $550 million in federal funds — about $200 million of which have yet to arrive. Among the funds mentioned, the administration says Bushell helped the state secure $33 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds for Affordable Clean Energy Loans to Sandhills Energy and Bluestem Energy Solutions and $10.3 million in Rural Energy for America grants and loans.

The $200 million USDA New Era grant to Nebraska Electric G&T is the part that had not yet been disbursed, Foley’s letter says.

Pillen’s staff also credits Bushell with a pledged investment of at least $5.5 billion to build a cornstalk converting biofuels plant in Phelps County, in the Holdrege area.

Former Phelps County Development Corporation director Ron Tillery called Bushell’s help vital.

Tillery said Pillen suggested during a visit to Phelps County in July 2024 that local economic development officials should meet with Bushell if they were serious about pursuing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which locals wanted as a means to carve out a market niche in a world of ethanol and biodiesel plants.

Kenny Zoeller, who leads the Governor’s Policy Research Office and spoke for Pillen’s team, said Bushell came recommended by Nebraska business leaders and “Aksarben,” which is often shorthand in political circles for a group of statewide business leaders sometimes loosely tied to the Omaha-based Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben organization.

Three people with ties to the group questioned whether its leaders would recommend a contractor for a state bioeconomy consultant, and more than one said Pillen had introduced members of the group to Bushell. Bushell joined the group’s board in mid-2024, archives of the foundation’s website show.

Bushell, in a sit-down interview last week, echoed the Governor’s Office in saying the economic benefit to Nebraskans of her work helped the state obtain more federal money than it might have otherwise. She said her contacts in the bioeconomy space helped land planned projects like Phelps County’s DG Fuels plant.

The Pillen administration, through Zoeller and Will, argued that Bushell’s work helped Nebraska secure nearly $290 million more in federal funds than a per-capita projection of what the state should expect to receive.

“I think the deliverables of this contract speak for themselves,” Bushell said. “I am incredibly proud that the world knows that Nebraska is the leader in bioeconomy, and in an economic position that the state’s in now. I think it’s really important that we continue to grow and invest in these projects.”

Foley argued that the administration’s per-capita number ignores that most such federal projects run through more complex formulas that consider much more than population. He noted in his audit letter that “other states received comparable amounts of the same grant and loan monies, presumably without any involvement by GSD.”

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

Questions about DG Fuels

Foley’s audit letter also questions whether Nebraska and Phelps County economic development officials are banking on a $5.5 billion DG Fuels project that might not be built.

The audit team dug into 11 announced DG Fuels projects in 10 states since 2001, seven of which pledged investments of more than $1 billion. The Foley letter indicates that none of the DG Fuels projects his team reviewed has yet been built to completion, although the audit shows several of the projects have made progress.

Among them: a sustainable aviation fuel plant planned for the former Loring Air Force Base in Maine, where the audit said ground was expected to be broken in 2026, and a 2024 announced project in St. James Parish, Louisiana, which expects to start producing fuel in 2028.

Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels, a biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel developer, did not return multiple Examiner attempts over several days to reach the company by phone and email.

Michael Darcy, the owner of DG Fuels, originally agreed to sit down with Foley’s team, the auditor said. But Foley said Darcy and his company cut off communication before the two met, after Foley communicated that he planned to question the progress of projects in other states.

Bushell said Nebraska needs to be careful not to create an environment that costs the DG Fuels project. She and Tillery say the project is making more progress through the state and local permitting process. Bushell said DG Fuels told her the Nebraska project is among its top priorities.

Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended. She did not respond to the Examiner’s follow-up questions about that push via text or email.

DED, with the Governor’s Office’s knowledge, approved the contract change. Will, in a statement to the Examiner, said the department “felt the revised terms would not lead to a conflict of interest.”

“In short, there was no risk for a conflict of interest, because there was no funding to create a conflict while under state contract,” Will said.

Foley said such conflict of interest language is meant to protect taxpayers and that he had unanswered questions about Bushell’s push to negotiate with a private company she had been working with on the state’s behalf.

“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said. “There were a number of federal grant awards that they say came because of GSD. … When our auditors looked into it, other states were able to get similar amounts.”

Too little time?

Foley, in his letter, wrote that DED had enough time “to search for a qualified service provider in compliance with statutory competitive bidding requirements” for the $2.5 million bioeconomy contract that went to GSD.

But Zoeller and Will pushed back, arguing that Legislative Bill 1412, the mid-biennium budget bill, left the state too little time to act when it took effect in early April 2024.

The bioeconomy provision in the budget bill required DED to coordinate work aimed at bioeconomy development, seek federal grants, and it gave the agency 15 months to report back on its progress. The law did not require immediate spending or entering into a contract.

The Governor’s Office pointed to the law’s requirement for a status report on the new bioeconomy initiative to the Legislature by June 30, 2025. According to Zoeller and Will, issuing and evaluating requests for proposals takes up to 60 days, followed by an RFP protest period of up to 50 days, which meant completion without the emergency approach could have taken up to 110 days.

But Foley said because the Governor’s Office sought that section of LB 1412, the Department of Economic Development had early warning and could have started its processes sooner to be ready to go out for bids and could have sought requests for information to gauge interest sooner from potential bidders.

Contract obligations questioned

Foley’s questions about the contract stretched into how little it required of GSD in terms of reporting how the firm spent state money. It did not require itemized receipts of expenses or time sheets. It required only the submission of monthly invoices summarizing the work done and dollar amounts, he said.

Those invoices largely say Bushell’s firm helped introduce state and local leaders to bioeconomy developers, scheduled and attended meetings, lobbied federal agencies and contacts, reviewed and discussed grant applications and communicated with project planners.

Will said that, while Foley was right that many state contracts are stricter with reporting requirements for the spending of state funds, some state contracts with consultants, including many in economic development, leave more flexibility to let consultants spend the funds more nimbly.

The State of Nebraska pushed to end Bushell’s contract two months early, at the end of February 2025. Zoeller told the Examiner the change in presidential administrations meant that Nebraska and Pillen had a more direct relationship with the Trump administration and no longer needed GSD’s connections. Foley said he started requesting information about the state contract in mid-January 2025.

In the end, the state paid Bushell’s firm $2.08 million. What Nebraska got for that money, Foley said, remains unclear. Pillen’s team says the state got a more than reasonable return on its investment.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pillen_ZJW_122723-04.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 09:58:22.574136

The projects span several key sectors, including bauxite and aluminum processing, sustainable aviation fuel development, oil refining, and poultry farming, Danantara Chief Executive Officer Rosan Roeslani said on Wednesday.

Rosan said the investment pipeline is expected to make a significant contribution to Indonesia’s economic growth by strengthening downstream industries and increasing domestic value creation.

“The projects include bauxite and aluminum processing in Balikpapan, bioavtur, refinery projects, and poultry farming operations in five locations,” Rosan said. Bioavtur is the government’s term for aviation fuel blended with plant-based oils.

Beyond these sectors, Rosan signaled that gasification projects producing dimethyl ether (DME) from coal could also move forward, although further studies are still needed to determine the most suitable technology for implementation.

According to Rosan, the strategic projects are designed to enhance the value added of Indonesia’s natural resources, generate large-scale employment, and reinforce the country’s industrial base.

“Five downstream project sites are being prepared to enter the groundbreaking phase early next month, with a total investment of around $6 billion as the foundation for strengthening national industrial value creation,” he said.

Under the agreement, Moeve supplied more than 515 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel to Condor.
Ángel Martínez Campos, who oversees sustainable aviation business development at Moeve, said the collaboration reflects the company’s long-term focus on reducing emissions from air travel.
These funds, she said, are used only to buy additional sustainable fuel beyond what regulations require, helping make initiatives like the Moeve partnership possible.

The airport is not yet covered by the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation rules, making the initiative an early step beyond regulatory requirements, reports Chemanalyst.

Under the agreement, Moeve supplied more than 515 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel to Condor. The fuel was produced from waste-based materials such as used cooking oil and agricultural residues. Over its full life cycle, the fuel is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 1,700 tons compared with conventional jet fuel.

The fuel was used on several busy routes connecting Tenerife with German cities including Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and Düsseldorf. Airport operator Aena estimates that more than 450,000 passengers travel each year on Condor flights to and from Tenerife South Airport, highlighting the potential impact of using cleaner fuel on these services.

Ángel Martínez Campos, who oversees sustainable aviation business development at Moeve, said the collaboration reflects the company’s long-term focus on reducing emissions from air travel. He noted that tourism plays a key role in the economy of Spain and Tenerife, making lower-emission flights an important priority. He added that working with Condor on a voluntary basis shows a shared commitment to sustainability that goes beyond minimum requirements.

From Condor’s side, the airline pointed to strong passenger involvement in supporting the use of cleaner fuel. Sina Rathgeber, Director of Airport Relations, Government Affairs and Sustainability at Condor, said customers have been able to voluntarily add small amounts to their ticket price or make direct contributions to support sustainable aviation fuel and certified climate projects. These funds, she said, are used only to buy additional sustainable fuel beyond what regulations require, helping make initiatives like the Moeve partnership possible.

The fuel supplied under the agreement was produced at Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva, southern Spain. Moeve is currently building a new second-generation biofuels facility at the site, with a planned annual capacity of up to 500,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. The project is more than halfway complete and is expected to begin operations by the end of 2026. Once operational, it will be the largest second-generation biofuels complex in southern Europe.

The supply agreement forms part of Moeve’s wider strategy to expand advanced biofuel production and availability. The company aims to play a leading role in Europe’s energy transition by 2030, while supporting the aviation sector’s efforts to reduce its environmental footprint.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2026-01-15 09:58:34.054361

While the core experience of flying remains familiar, the digital and operational layers surrounding your journey are being completely rebuilt. For the modern traveler, these changes may prove to be the difference between a high-stress trip and a seamless, cost-effective adventure across the globe.

This list includes seven ways air travel will change this year, evaluated by their impact on the passenger experience and the scale of their rollout across major carriers. The focus will be on trends with active 2026 implementation dates, ranging from behind-the-scenes financial shifts to radical changes in how you move through the airport. From the rise of AI to the fall of the traditional boarding pass, here is what to expect in aviation this year.

Hyper-Dynamic AI Offers

The Move To Digital, Real-Time Retailing

In 2026, the airline industry is officially shifting its focus from orders to offers. Using modern airline retailing frameworks, carriers like the Lufthansa Group and American Airlines are now leveraging generative AI to assemble custom travel bundles in real-time. This digital retail approach means the price you see is no longer just for a seat, but a tailored package that includes your specific WiFi, baggage, and meal preferences.

This shift is enabled by the widespread adoption of new distribution capability standards, which allow airlines to bypass old, static fare ladders. Instead of generating a price weeks in advance, AI-driven systems now adjust the offer based on search intent, macro-economic events, and even real-time load factors. For passengers, this means the end of universal baseline pricing in favor of highly personalized, dynamic quotes.

While it fundamentally changes the economics of your ticket, it remains a non-visible evolution. It alters how you pay and what you receive in your digital wallet, but it doesn't physically change the boarding process or the aircraft itself. However, as it becomes the industry standard this year, the old methods of trying to outsmart the booking system are effectively obsolete.

Universal Free High-Speed Inflight WiFi

Connectivity Becomes a Basic Amenity, Not a Luxury

The WiFi paywall has finally crumbled for the majority of global travelers. What was once a $20 luxury is now a standard amenity, with major carriers treating high-speed internet as a basic infrastructure requirement rather than a premium upsell. This shift allows passengers to stream, game, and video call with the same ease they experience at home or out and about on the ground.

The primary catalyst has been the rapid rollout of low-earth orbit satellite constellations like Starlink. United Airlines is currently outfitting its fleet at a rate of 40 planes per month, while American Airlines officially launched free, AT&T-sponsored WiFi for all AAdvantage members on January 6, 2026, covering over 90% of its domestic fleet.

The greatest benefit is that eliminates a significant stressor for modern travelers, staying connected to work and family. While it is a massive quality-of-life win, it is primarily an evolutionary change. It makes the time spent on a plane more productive, but it does not physically alter the core logistics of the airport journey like the items appearing higher on this list.

No More Physical Passport?

Biometric Face-ID Becomes the Global Standard

The era of fumbling for paper passports at border control is officially ending across Europe and major Asian hubs. The European Union’s Entry-Exit System is in full swing, replacing manual passport stamps with a centralized biometric database. Travelers now use their faces and fingerprints as their primary identity tokens, but queues have been even longer than usual, with some lasting up to three hours because the process requires various scans.

This ""frictionless"" shift allows passengers to move from the curb to the gate without having to show a physical document more than once. Airports in Singapore and the United States are following suit, integrating facial recognition into every touchpoint, including bag drop, security, and boarding gates, to shave an average of 15 minutes off the departure process.

Introducing this kind of technology is a massive logistical leap that fundamentally changes the physical chore of travel for many. It doesn't rank as high as other changes due to the delays as passengers register their biometrics for the first time, but the long-term result is a significantly faster airport experience that rewards digital-first travelers.

AI Travel Assistants

From Simple Chatbots to Digital Cabin Crew

Once again returning to an ever-present theme, AI tools have evolved from simple search engines into assistants capable of making decisions on your behalf. Recently, Qatar Airways unveiled Sama, the world’s first integrated digital cabin crew member. Unlike basic chatbots, these agents can help with a wide range of requirements in real-time.

This technology is powered by the new partnership between the Lufthansa Group and Amadeus, which uses an AI-native retailing platform known as Nevio. This allows the airline to manage your Order ID as a single, fluid record. If a flight is delayed, the AI proactively suggests a new itinerary and automatically updates your hotel and ground transport bookings.

The use of AI for customer facing services solves the biggest pain point in aviation: disruption management. By giving travelers an actual concierge in their pocket, airlines can finally provide personalized service at scale. As these digital assistants learn your habits when traveling, the stress of managing travel logistics is becoming a thing of the past.

The Point-to-Point Long-Haul Revolution

Narrow-Body Jets Are Ready To Take Over

The Airbus A321XLR has officially arrived, fundamentally breaking the hub-and-spoke model that has dominated aviation for decades. Starting in January 2026, IndiGo is launching the first nonstop service between India and Athens, while American Airlines is set to debut its JFK-to-Edinburgh route in March 2026. This allows airlines to fly thin, long and skinny routes that were previously unprofitable for giant widebody planes.

For travelers, this means more direct flights from secondary airports to international hubs, bypassing the need for a stressful connection at a major hub such as London Heathrow or New York JFK. The trade-off is the physical experience of the flight, as you are now flying eight to nine hours on a single-aisle aircraft. To compensate, 2026 aircraft are being delivered with flagship suites featuring lie-flat beds and direct aisle access, bringing widebody luxury to the narrowbody cabin.

The widespread adoption of far more versatile, smaller aircraft represents a permanent shift in how global geography is connected. It saves the average passenger three to five hours of travel time by eliminating layovers. As nearly 10% of Iberia's long-haul fleet now consists of these high-efficiency narrow-bodies, the once-laborious single-aisle flight has become the new industry standard this year as more airlines follow suit.

Mandatory Green Levies and SAF Surcharges

The Real Cost of Sustainability Hits the Receipt

This is the year environmental costs became a line item that can't be ignored. In April 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will implement its sustainable aviation fuel levy, which applies to all tickets sold for travel departing from October 2026. Simultaneously, the EU's ReFuelEU mandate has tightened, requiring 2% of all jet fuel to be sustainable, leading to a visible green surcharge on most transatlantic flights.

While the surcharges are currently modest, ranging from $1 for short-haul economy to $25 for long-haul premium cabins, they represent a major psychological shift. Airlines are no longer absorbing the 3x to 5x higher cost of SAF; they are passing it directly to consumers. This transparency is designed to fund the massive infrastructure needed to reach net-zero by 2050, making 2026 the true starting line for the green travel economy.

With SAF becoming far more relevant to airline economics, it demonstrates how, now, there is a global policy shift that affects the pricing of every single ticket. It is the first time in history that the environmental externality of flying has been standardized into a mandatory fee, marking the end of the era of artificially cheap, high-carbon air travel.

The 2026 World Cup Infrastructure Pivot

The Debut of Air Taxis and the Smart Border

To round out this list, the single biggest change in 2026 isn't a specific plane or a fee; it's actually not part of aviation at all. It is the unprecedented pressure of the 2026 FIFA World Cup across the US, Canada, and Mexico, specifically how this will bring changes and significantly affect global air travel. With millions of extra visitors expected this summer, security is evolving significantly for how people travel to the US. This has forced airports in host cities like Los Angeles and Miami to implement mass-scale biometric ""walk-through"" security and digital customs apps just to keep the gates from collapsing under the weight of the crowd.

Most importantly, 2026 marks the first public demonstration phase for electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. While full commercial service for the general public is slated for 2028, companies like Archer and Joby are using the World Cup as a global launchpad, showcasing in key host cities like Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. For the first time, travelers will see piloted air taxis ferrying VIPs and athletes over gridlocked city traffic, signaling the dawn of the urban air mobility era.

The World Cup is the stress test that has forced every other technology on this list to mature. From AI-driven crowd management to the first real-world flights of electric air taxis, the innovations deployed for this tournament will become the permanent blueprint for global air travel for the next decade.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/airtravel.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-15 10:57:56.518304

This study proposes an innovative supply chain producing SAF according to the REFuelEU Aviation’s progressive targets for 2050, the international ICAO-CORSIA mandates and the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive for greening the transport sector. The study focuses on camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) grown in Southern European regions on marginal land affected by severe soil degradation. In this case, according to the most recent policy requirements, “severely degraded lands” suitable for advanced biofuels production are currently defined as those under erosion with poor soil organic matter content or with high salinity. Unlike other common oilseeds, camelina can successfully grow in degraded and eroded soils making it particularly well-suited to produce low indirect land-use change (iLUC) risk feedstocks for SAF. The challenges of achieving profitable yields under marginal conditions are examined and discussed. The results show a potential of 116 thousand km2 of available lands that can produce 3.2 Mtoe per year of SAF, corresponding to 175 % of bio-SAF mandates in 2030. The calculated carbon intensity of SAF ranges between 10.5 and 30.8 gCO2eq MJ 1 depending on the carbon accumulation performances achieved in the cultivated soil and green energy used in the supply chain. By combining economics and greenhouse gas emission savings, the study explores the current gaps between conventional and innovative SAF production.

Sustainable aviation fuel is developed from biological products like agricultural and forestry waste. Improving SAF technology, affordability and availability can reduce the carbon footprint of flying. This would not only improve air quality and climate outcomes, it also creates new jobs and economic opportunities.

The Puget Sound region has been at the forefront of the new sustainable fuel industry since the development of a research and development center for SAF at Paine Field that built on the area’s long history of innovation in aviation.Learn more about the SAF Center.

The CSAA is made possible by a 2025 State of Washington appropriation and private philanthropic donation of an additional $10 million. It will function as a nonprofit in partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce.

The global aviation industry currently generates $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, but accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions. SAF could reduce those emissions by 80% compared to fossil-based fuels.

The new center was announced at an event held at the Boeing Future of Flight facility in Mukilteo last week. Support for the aerospace industry and sustainable aviation fuel are a primary focus of the Regional Economic Strategy and annually adopted focus areas.",https://www.psrc.org/sites/default/files/favicon-196x196.png,N,,2026-01-15 03:58:07.449013

Overall, the previous decade marked a decisive shift in which renewable energy evolved into a cost-competitive, scalable and indispensable component of global energy supply.
“Any-and-All” Energy to Power the Next Decade: 2026-2035 Looking ahead, meeting the enormous power needs of the future will require maximizing energy options.
From Innovation to Speed and Scale Undoubtedly, the next decade will be defined by unprecedented energy growth—future global productivity, competitiveness and economic expansion will depend directly on scaling energy supply at speed.
Those who can deliver scale at low cost and high speed will shape not only the next decade of energy, but the next decade of global growth.","In a remarkably short time, electricity has shifted from a stable, assumed resource to the defining bottleneck for economic and productivity growth across the world’s governments and corporations. Energy is one of the most significant gating requirements for nearly every economic development opportunity, from manufacturing to artificial intelligence (AI).

And right now, supply is struggling to keep up with growing demand. Global electricity demand—driven by electrification, industrialization and the rapid expansion of AI—is accelerating faster than at any time in modern history (see Figure 1). At the end of 2020, forecasts predicted that it would take 10 years for global energy demand to increase by 25%. It took only four.2

Governments and corporations are driving this transformation, shaped by three powerful forces: deglobalization, as nations pursue energy independence; digitalization, as AI and data consumption accelerate demand for reliable power; and decarbonization, as industries electrify and invest for sustainable growth. Each is accelerating the same outcome: delivering cheap, fast and scalable energy—power, in every form, faster than ever before.

No single form of energy will be sufficient to meet this unprecedented level of demand. It will take “any-and-all” power solutions: Clean, conventional and hybrid systems alike have distinct and complementary roles to play. Renewable energy will be at the center of this mix, providing the scalable, low-cost foundation for the future grid.

Savvy investors will find tremendous opportunities for long-term value creation in developing diverse power solutions. Capitalizing on this moment requires a deep understanding of the past, present and future of energy technologies and markets.

A Decade of Falling Costs and Rising Opportunities: 2015–2025

The renewable energy market that powers today’s global economy was largely built over the past 10 years. While government support was an important driver in the first half of that decade, renewable energy quickly proved it could stand on its own over the second half, thanks to supportive market dynamics, dramatic improvements in technology and reductions in cost.

The rise of gas in the U.S.

After the global financial crisis, flattened energy demand led utilities to shift their capital and focus toward grid maintenance and upgrades. New generation favored gas plants, driven by the shale boom’s low prices, lower capital costs and faster build times, as well as facilities’ inherent operational flexibility. This shaped the energy sector’s trajectory.

A government push for sustainability and security

Governments around the world led the charge toward emissions reductions, passing stronger policies and regulations and joining together to sign the 2015 Paris Agreement, ushering in historic political and market signals for decarbonization. By COP26 in 2021, over 90% of global GDP was covered by some form of net-zero national commitment3 —with corporates following suit, unleashing capital into renewables at unprecedented scale.

Government policy also prioritized energy independence and security. Investments in domestic natural gas, which was replacing coal as a source of baseload power, offered countries relative stability to manage any geopolitical challenges. For countries that do not have a natural gas supply, renewables have proved to be a powerful method to ensure energy security and self-reliance.

The emergence of renewables

As energy demand started growing again, renewables soon became an attractive choice to corporates, thanks to their low cost and scalability. Renewable energy technologies went from development to deployment at a breakneck pace to meet new demand. Battery costs also began to fall. Regional power markets in the U.S. further spurred the growth of renewables, proving that renewables could be cost-competitive without relying on subsidies. By 2019, solar and wind, a small but growing component of the energy mix, had generally achieved cost parity with conventional sources of energy (see Figure 2).4

Corporates seeking the lowest-cost scalable resources started going directly to renewable suppliers to meet their power needs and decarbonization goals through power purchase agreements (PPAs) that increasingly offered stability over longer terms. Since 2015, the PPA market has grown by an average of 33% annually.5 These PPAs proved vital during periods of geopolitical instability and price volatility.

Byzantine bureaucracy and other limitations

This decade was not without its challenges, as clean energy buildout was constrained by limited transmission capacity and complex permitting; transmission buildout for all forms of energy slowed sharply starting in 2014 until 2023.6 Around the globe, projections for energy demand significantly underestimated the need for energy—well before the AI demand soared. Less than 20% of projects in the U.S. transmission queues between 2000 and 2018 were built by the end of 2023.7 The effects of slower growth will require sustained focus and managed solutions for decades to come.

Specific forms of energy faced specific challenges. Offshore wind, for example, contended with escalating capital expenditure costs and regulatory delays. Nuclear power saw early growth but soon faced stop orders and major losses.

Developers with strong supply chain relationships, deep operational and power market expertise, and a disciplined development approach could weather these challenges and capitalize on the growing demand. They were able to avoid the significant supply chain crunches usually associated with rapid scaling, steer clear of risks associated with very early-stage pipeline projects, and align construction costs with long-term contracted revenues from well-positioned counterparties.

Growing demands for energy capacity increased prices and have impacted the ability of utilities to keep the lights on. Clean power had surpassed 40% of global electricity generation by 2024, reflecting its emergence as both an affordable and stable option for power (see Figure 3).8 The expansion was driven primarily by solar and wind, supported by steady output from hydro and nuclear. Overall, the previous decade marked a decisive shift in which renewable energy evolved into a cost-competitive, scalable and indispensable component of global energy supply.

Current Market Dynamics

We are now in an era defined by soaring power demand, compounded by a shortfall in supply from the past decade’s limited growth. The largest demand driver is the explosive growth of data centers—reshaping energy consumption, while still needing to supply basic energy needs. Total data center capacity is expected to reach roughly 82 gigawatts by 2034—more than a tenfold increase in a decade (see Figure 4).

The growth in power demand has catalyzed a 12x surge in PPAs since 2016, tilting decisively toward clean energy suppliers.9 Corporations worldwide are seeking cheap, reliable, clean power that can scale quickly. For example, in 2024, Brookfield signed a landmark renewable energy framework agreement to develop more than 10.5 gigawatts of renewable capacity globally for Microsoft. And in June 2025, Brookfield announced the world's largest framework agreement for hydroelectricity with Google. These relationships provide unique insight into corporate power demand and evolving needs, enabling asset developers and operators such as Brookfield to build bespoke solutions and secure additional landmark agreements.

In parallel, energy independence remains a defining policy priority for many governments. The recent decade underscored the vulnerability of nations overly reliant on imported fossil fuels and exposed to the volatility of international natural gas prices. Governments are accelerating domestic investment in renewable generation, nuclear power and other low-carbon sources to strengthen energy security and stabilize long-term costs.

As governments pursue this new era of energy self-sufficiency, technological progress is reinforcing the shift— bringing greater reliability and consistency to power systems. Nuclear power is uniquely positioned to deliver that stability, supported by improved public sentiment, but also from better capital market access and supportive regulatory frameworks. There is no credible net-zero pathway without a substantial and expanding role for nuclear power.

As nuclear power shows great promise for providing the baseload capacity needed to meet demand, advancements in battery technology are unlocking the potential of solar and wind. Batteries are fast to install and scalable, and pairing them with renewables is increasingly effective at tackling intermittency and spot pricing challenges—moving us closer to delivering around-the-clock clean power. Large-scale lithium-ion batteries are more effective at storing excess energy and discharging it when needed. The price of these batteries has fallen by 92% since 2010, including a 50% drop in the past two years alone—one of the fastest price declines of any energy technology in history.10

Finally, with intermittent renewables expanding and coal in decline, natural gas will remain a vital component of the energy mix. It plays a dual role: meeting immediate surges in demand while acting as a flexible, dispatchable source to ensure stability during peak periods and balance grids as renewables scale. This dynamic is especially pronounced in emerging markets, where continued demand growth heightens the need for reliability.

More opportunities will arise as the U.S. and many other governments seek to onshore their energy production through protectionist policies like tariffs, as well as through incentives for domestic development. Doing so not only strengthens energy security and independence, but also expands domestic power supply—the foundational input to compute capacity, which is increasingly treated as a national strategic resource. As compute and AI infrastructure become primary drivers of productivity of future economies, governments are acutely focused on ensuring that sufficient power generation is available to support and scale these capabilities. Governments are increasingly prioritizing the reshoring of supply chains for critical technologies—from domestic mining of rare earth minerals to manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear reactors and batteries. This shift confirms that national energy strategies are also about independence and security, alongside resilience, affordability and decarbonization.

Still, renewable energy faces significant bottlenecks and permitting challenges. Transmission issues continue to hamper clean energy penetration, with many renewable energy projects held up in interconnection queues—long waiting lists that are created because the existing grid lacks the capacity to absorb new generation. Moreover, large parts of the electricity grids in advanced economies are over 20 years old—and require significant modernization and investment to keep up with demand or absorb energy from new sources.

In sum, both corporate-driven demand for scaled power and decarbonization, as well as government-driven demand for energy independence, are significant and persistent. As long as there is a supply and demand imbalance, buyers will be willing to pay a premium for dispatchable baseload power. These dynamics create opportunity for large clean energy developers and operators with access to capital, understanding of the market, and strong corporate partnerships to develop assets for value.

This past decade proved that policy can catalyze markets, but technology and capital ultimately sustain them. It is clear that the most successful operators are not those who chase subsidies, but those who are disciplined and build diversified portfolios, balancing exposure across geographies, technologies and counterparties to capture enduring value.

“Any-and-All” Energy to Power the Next Decade: 2026-2035

Looking ahead, meeting the enormous power needs of the future will require maximizing energy options. Future productivity gains from AI will be governed by the speed of the energy buildout. Global electricity demand is expected to grow by 4% each year through 2027,11 with 85% of that growth driven by emerging markets.12 Only with a diverse energy landscape—“any-and-all” forms of energy scaled with the focused investment of private capital—will it be possible to power the global economy into the years ahead.

While industrialization and electrification of sectors like transportation and heating will remain the largest use of power, data centers are expected to represent the single fastest incremental source of electricity growth, potentially reaching 9% of total U.S. electricity generation by 2030.13 Global electricity needs from data centers alone are expected to nearly triple by 2030, to a level that is slightly higher than the entire electricity demand of Japan today (see Figure 5).14 15

Hyperscalers are likely to prioritize contracted capacity with a flat generation profile, reflecting a focus on operational risk mitigation over marginal cost optimization. Specifically, hyperscalers need energy now, so they will increasingly seek out partners that can quickly deploy guaranteed reliable power at scale to prevent any disruption in business functions.

With technological advancements, some energy sources can offer benefits beyond simply meeting energy demand: Batteries and hydro, for example, can help stabilize the grid and increase project revenue. In turn, they improve the economics of those projects, compared with other power sources that have exposure to curtailment, weather-event and intermittency volatility.

In emerging markets, the surge in power demand is being driven first and foremost by rapid population growth and the expansion of the middle class—reinforced by strong macroeconomic trends such as rising GDP per capita. Urbanization and industrialization are further accelerating this demand, with data centers increasingly becoming part of that industrial landscape—Malaysia, in particular, is rapidly emerging as a key hub for data centers and semiconductors. Renewable energy has become a mainstay in these markets, especially after it became difficult to import natural gas due to war in Ukraine. Together, these forces are creating an urgent need for large-scale infrastructure investment, not only in energy generation but also in the transmission and distribution networks required to support sustained economic growth. To capture these opportunities, local operating teams with deep knowledge of regulatory environments and market dynamics are essential.

In the next decade, governments’ commitment to energy independence and security will continue to accelerate decarbonization trends. With greater domestic energy resources, nations are less vulnerable to volatile global energy markets and supply chain disruptions. An increasingly electrified global economy can mitigate threats of energy manipulation as nations gain the ability to generate more power from resources within their own borders. The need to strengthen energy security provides powerful motivation for expanding clean energy capacity while decreasing fossil fuel dependence. This requires investment in comprehensive energy systems and supply chain approaches that will be critical for ensuring future security.

As demand accelerates, the commitment to an “any-and-all” energy strategy will only grow. Private investors will play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between technological innovation and the large-scale deployment required to power the next decade.

Nuclear power

The role for nuclear power is growing as it becomes a critical technology for providing low-carbon baseload power and as developers continue to advance its commercial viability.

Nuclear continues to benefit from strong policy support and renewed prioritization, highlighted by the U.S. commitment to build 10 new reactors by 2030 with up to $80 billion in investment using Westinghouse technology, a company owned by Brookfield. This initiative will cement nuclear’s role as a key element of U.S. energy and AI growth, providing a reliable, carbon-free source of baseload power to meet rising demand.

This transformational commitment is set to catalyze a large-scale buildout of the domestic nuclear supply chain—from component manufacturing to workforce development and engineering capacity—while creating meaningful opportunities for Westinghouse, whose AP1000 remains the only new reactor design to be deployed in the U.S.

Batteries

Battery technology is advancing rapidly, and costs are falling, setting the stage for accelerated large-scale deployment worldwide. Batteries have become a cornerstone in power systems, with forecasts more than tripling in the past five years—representing a significant investment opportunity (see Figure 6).

Governments and corporations are increasingly prioritizing renewable sources that co-locate batteries next to solar and wind projects and share a grid connection. Efficient and cost-effective, these co-located systems create a major opportunity to turn intermittent wind and solar generation into a more reliable and consistent power source. They are also increasingly able to provide storage over longer time periods: The average duration for utility-scale storage today is around four hours and is expected to continue to lengthen in the years ahead as the need for longer-duration storage grows.

The applications for batteries are wide-ranging and global. In the Middle East, they can help meet surging peak demand, while in markets with rapid data center growth, they can firm up quick-to-market renewable projects and provide the reliability customers require. As penetration of renewables into power grids increases, demand for storage solutions will only intensify.

Natural gas and carbon capture and storage

As renewables scale and coal usage declines, natural gas will play a key role in keeping the grid balanced and easing the intermittency of renewables. This reliability is especially critical in emerging markets, where rapid growth requires stable power to support industrialization, urbanization and data center development.

When paired with CCS, natural gas becomes one of the few technically and commercially viable options for low-carbon baseload power production, reducing emissions intensity by more than 80% when compared to unabated plants.16 In this way, natural gas is a critical link in the global transition to a more diversified, lower-carbon energy system.

CCS can be deployed in new greenfield gas power projects and in brownfield retrofits of existing sites that have suitable technical characteristics. In addition, CCS technology is flexible enough to be utilized across the full range of commercially available gas power generation facilities, including reciprocating engines, simple cycle turbines and combined cycle turbines.

Energy for AI, and AI for energy

Finally, it is notable that AI is not simply driving up demand for energy but making important contributions to transforming and modernizing grid operations. For instance, some grid operators in the U.S. have been piloting AI-driven platforms to forecast solar and wind generation more accurately, allowing them to balance supply and demand more efficiently.

AI is increasingly embedded in battery dispatch and optimization platforms, enabling owners and grid operators to maximize real-time battery performance. These battery storage systems help power grids balance fluctuating demand and intermittent supply with sub-second response times. With grid operators increasingly requiring new load to be paired or to come with a firm dispatchable power solution at relevant locations, batteries are seen as the technology of choice to help new load obtain interconnections from grids. As grids worldwide are already strained, these new applications of AI can help ease the additional strain from future data centers.

From Innovation to Speed and Scale

Undoubtedly, the next decade will be defined by unprecedented energy growth—future global productivity, competitiveness and economic expansion will depend directly on scaling energy supply at speed. Vast amounts of incremental power will be required to support economic growth never before seen in our lifetimes.

Nations and corporations will take the lead in the trends of deglobalization, digitalization and decarbonization, demanding energy independence and fast, but sustainable, growth. The main drivers for this unparalleled demand will come from growth in data centers, industrialization and electrification. Offtakers will rationally seek the lowest-cost, most readily available electrons first, making renewables the first-choice alternative for new generation. But renewables alone cannot meet the challenge.

Renewables deliver cost-effective and low-carbon power; storage provides consistency; nuclear adds reliable baseload; and natural gas remains a critical backstop. All will be required to balance availability, cost, reliability and decarbonization. And all need to scale as quickly as possible.

The stakes for striking this balance are significant. The imbalance between rapidly growing demand and constrained supply could drive energy prices higher if new capacity fails to keep pace. Worse, it could limit global growth and productivity. Such an outcome would trigger a cascade across the economy, raising production costs and ultimately the cost of living. International macroeconomic conflicts can also add to the volatility in energy prices, mostly from fossil fuel sources. To avoid these risks, governments will continue to pursue energy independence and will remain central in catalyzing investment and accelerating the growth of all forms of power—and especially the most cost-effective sources, such as renewables and storage. While such technologies can stand alone economically, supportive regulatory frameworks and targeted policies will be helpful both to attract the scale of private capital required and to maintain affordability and stability in the broader economy.

With unprecedented energy demand comes compelling investment opportunities. But capitalizing on these opportunities requires more than capital. The best outcomes will come from applying a disciplined investment philosophy: maintaining a long-term horizon, exercising rigorous due diligence, recognizing complexity at every stage, hedging project costs against revenues, locking long-term contracts with strong counterparties, and protecting against other development risks. Equally, if not more critical, are the operational capabilities behind the capital. A global procurement team that can negotiate in different regions—and with scale—will be better positioned to protect against supply chain disruptions. Deep local expertise and strong operating teams are also essential to navigate regulatory frameworks, supply chain challenges and geopolitical uncertainty—and drive value, wherever the winds may shift.

Meeting this moment demands an “any-and-all” strategy with disciplined capital, operational excellence and long-term vision to galvanize today’s constrained supply to meet tomorrow’s massive demand. Those who can deliver scale at low cost and high speed will shape not only the next decade of energy, but the next decade of global growth.

Zurich Airport braces for WEF 2026 surge with 1,000 extra flights

Zurich Airport officials confirmed on 13 January that they expect roughly 1,000 additional flight movements in the week surrounding the World Economic Forum (WEF), which takes place in Davos from 19 to 23 January. The influx will be dominated by business jets, state aircraft, and helicopter shuttles supporting heads-of-state, Fortune 500 executives and security teams. Although the airport handled a similar volume during WEF 2025, operations managers say the compression of arrivals into an even tighter window—combined with stricter slot-allocation rules—will test apron capacity and air-traffic-control staffing.

To cope, Zurich will extend ground-handling shifts, reserve auxiliary stands at the military airfield in Dübendorf, and keep Observation Deck B open from 08:00 to 20:00 between 17 and 23 January so that public viewing does not interfere with secure zones. Jet Aviation will again supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel, allowing corporate flight departments to lower carbon footprints by up to 80 percent compared with conventional Jet A1—an increasingly important selling point for image-conscious multinationals.

As corporate travel planners juggle these operational details, they also have to secure the correct travel documentation for each delegate. VisaHQ can streamline the process of obtaining Swiss business or tourist visas with an online platform that handles application preparation, embassy appointments, and status tracking. Especially in the run-up to the WEF, the company’s Switzerland page (https://www.visahq.com/switzerland/) offers a quick way to confirm requirements and avoid last-minute complications at the border.

Temporary security measures may close popular spotting mounds and pedestrian paths at short notice, but passenger flows in the terminal should remain unaffected. Advance passenger-information sharing between airlines and border-police units has been tightened; carriers that miss data-transmission deadlines risk losing scarce slots. Customs officials also warn that ad-hoc charter arrivals after 23:30 will face hefty noise-abatement penalties unless flights are medically or diplomatically exempt.

For mobility managers, the practical takeaway is to lock in slots, parking space, and ground transport as soon as delegate lists firm up. Hotels within two hours of Davos are reporting occupancy above 90 percent, and last-minute crew rooms near the airport now exceed CHF 400 per night. Companies sending multiple executives are advised to consider helicopter shuttles from Zurich or St. Gallen-Altenrhein to avoid four-hour road journeys through likely snow.

Despite the operational squeeze, Flughafen Zürich AG stresses that the event remains a showcase for Switzerland’s capacity to host high-level dialogue with minimal disruption. The airport’s decision to keep all commercial passenger facilities fully open underscores its commitment to balancing security, sustainability, and everyday connectivity.

Duckworth met with a variety of renewable energy leaders today, including Illinois-based companies such as Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) of Chicago and John Deere of Moline.

In the Senate, Duckworth has been a leader in advancing biofuels. As a founding co-chair of the Senate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Caucus, she has been a strong advocate for expansion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by utilizing the domestic biofuels and agricultural sectors. To help increase the availability of E15 biofuels, Duckworth helped introduce the bipartisan Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025 and the bipartisan Next Generations Fuel Act to allow the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10 percent. Duckworth additionally helped introduce the bipartisan Home Front Energy Independence Act to ban Russian oil and expand use and production of biofuel that’s grown in the American heartland, while providing American families with a less expensive option to fuel their vehicles. Earlier this year she helped introduced the Farm to Fly Act to help accelerate the production and development of SAF.

While the Trump Administration continues to do everything in its power to decimate the international trade and domestic agricultural sector, Duckworth, as a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, remains an outspoken advocate for increased trade of Illinois pork, biofuels and agricultural goods across the globe and helped secure significant wins for Illinois and American agriculture. After Duckworth’s visit in 2023, Japan announced a regulatory change that will lead to an increase in imports from U.S. biofuel producers, supporting our farmers and growing Illinois’s economy, and following a prior trip to Taiwan in 2022, she helped secure a commitment from Taiwan to purchase an estimated $2.6 billion of our Illinois’s corn and soybeans.

Is nuclear power back on the energy agenda?

Authors: Andrew McDougall, Ximena Vasquez-Maignan, Peter Berg, Julien Bocobza, Martin Menski, Michael Yates

Nuclear power's comeback is being driven by ambitious climate goals, the need for energy security and the rise of artificial intelligence, which has led to skyrocketing demand for data centers. The advantages of nuclear power include reliability and efficient land use, making it a practical complement to renewable energy sources. But before nuclear is fully embraced, challenges related to its past safety issues, financing and regulation must be addressed.

Can sustainable aviation fuel get off the ground?

Authors: Kamran Ahmad, Peter Berg, Ryan Gawrych

As governments chase net zero targets, some are implementing regulations meant to boost the aviation industry's use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is made from renewable and waste-derived sources, like cooking oil. But SAF has yet to become commercially viable for airlines. It costs far more than conventional jet fuel, presents challenges for investors and is plagued by supply chain and output issues. Still, momentum behind SAF is building as more countries deploy mandates aimed at reducing aviation industry emissions.

Will sustainable data centres power the future?

Authors: James Johnson, Tim Fourteau, Stephen Shergold, Victoria Delacey, Lis Blunsdon

Amid dramatic global growth in the number and size of power-hungry data centers, concerns about their environmental impact have become a priority. Governments, policymakers and data center operators themselves are focused on making this critical infrastructure sustainable and ensuring that data centers do not detract from efforts to reach net zero. In addition to offering environmental benefits, sustainable data centers may be a boon to investors, who could benefit from the centers' short construction cycle and ability to quickly generate cash.

Sustainable aviation fuel is rising up the industry's agenda. But can governments and industry overcome the commercial drawbacks?

""A complete momentum shift"" is how Ryan Gawrych, Local Partner at law firm White & Case, describes what is happening in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market. Between 2022 and 2030, global production of SAF is expected to grow by 30 times to 18.2 billion litres1 because of demand for the aviation industry to reduce its emissions.

The forces behind the rise of SAF

As governments pursue net zero targets, some are regulating aviation in ways that favour SAF. In Europe, for instance, ReFuelEU2 promotes greater use of SAF at EU airports as part of efforts to reduce CO2 emissions by 55 per cent by 2030. Similar rules have come into force in South Korea, where the government mandates that international flights departing from the country in 2027 will have to use fuel with a 1 per cent SAF blend, rising to 3–5 per cent in 2030 and 7–10 per cent in 2035.3

Meanwhile some governments are taxing jet fuel, which has historically been exempted from many taxes. In the UK, campaigners estimate that taxing jet fuel could raise £6bn.4 Phasing out these tax exemptions is also improving the case for SAF, according to Gawrych. ""A heavy price is being placed on the carbon output of jet fuel in Europe,"" he says. ""This is driving a lot of the airlines, fuel traders and producers to look at developing and creating more SAF for the market.""

Closing the gap to commercial viability

There is an appetite to shift towards SAF, but it has to be commercially viable. That is not yet the case, for a number of reasons.

""There is an obvious cost gap issue,"" says Gawrych. ""Conventional jet fuel is currently about €700 a tonne; HEFA, which is the most available SAF product in the market right now, is about €2,500.""

This creates significant extra costs for airlines. The European Regions Airline Association warns that ReFuelEU risks penalising regional airlines and cutting off remote communities. Some airlines, it says, could be bankrupted by the regulation.5

Getting investors on board to fund the switch to SAF is also difficult. ""Airlines don't have the best credit rating, and they also have a very unique procurement cycle for their jet fuel,"" says Gawrych. ""They don't sign up for 10–15-year contracts for the procurement of their fuel, which would ordinarily be necessary to underpin financing for the development of a SAF facility. So over the past couple of years a lot of the SAF producers have been trying to structure projects around airline offtake, and those projects have not really been able to get to FID.""

Another barrier to SAF's mainstream adoption is producing it at consistent and reliable levels. Waste cooking oils and feedstock are used as the raw materials for HEFA-SAF, but because these inputs are inconsistent and finite, supply chains cannot yet guarantee steady or scalable output. ""There is only so much you can produce,"" says Gawrych.

The road ahead for SAF

Despite these challenges, momentum behind SAF is growing. And it will only increase as more countries create SAF mandates and regulations.

""The reality is that more and more countries are starting to deploy SAF mandates,"" concludes Gawrych. ""And if China introduces blending mandates in the next year or so, then it will be transformational.""

If policy, investment and innovation start to align, SAF could become a viable option for airlines. However, governments will need to pay close attention to the unintended consequences of the rise of SAF, such as the impact on smaller airlines and communities.

Meanwhile, Hawaii positions itself as an energy laboratory for sustainable aviation.","Hawaii has begun charting a new energy course by bringing together airlines, fuel producers, and local farmers in a pioneering sustainable aviation fuel project. Thus, the archipelago seeks to concretely reduce air transport emissions, one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize, with companies already set to use locally produced biofuel.

In this context, Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines have partnered with Par Hawaii to develop locally produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In this way, the energy transition ceases to be an abstract concept and becomes a productive chain anchored in the territory.

Furthermore, the initiative aims to strengthen the energy resilience of the islands. By reducing dependence on imported fuels, the project combines climate action with economic and environmental security.

Agriculture and energy: a locally rooted alliance

To advance this transformation, the airlines and Par Hawaii are working with Pono Pacific, through its subsidiary Pono Energy. Consequently, the focus is on camelina, a fast-growing oilseed crop with a low environmental impact.

This crop can be rotated with food crops, matures in a few weeks, and requires fewer inputs. Therefore, it presents itself as a viable alternative to produce energy without displacing food production.

At the same time, camelina allows for the utilization of every stage of the process. While the oil is destined for SAF, the by-products are transformed into feed for cattle and poultry, closing a more efficient production cycle.

Local production and 2026 horizon

The project already has a defined schedule. The airlines will be the first to use SAF manufactured in Hawaii, with deliveries expected in the first quarter of 2026. Thus, the sustainable fuel will move from the laboratory to the runways.

In parallel, Par Hawaii is advancing in adapting its industrial infrastructure. The modernization of the refinery will allow for the processing of vegetable and used oils, expanding the renewable production capacity.

This process is supported by strategic investments and international alliances. However, the central focus remains local: land, agricultural knowledge, and employment on the islands.

The biofuel and its multiple advantages for the industry and the environment

The use of SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle. Therefore, its adoption represents one of the most effective tools to decarbonize aviation without modifying aircraft or airport infrastructures.

From an industrial perspective, the measure drives innovation, generates employment, and creates a new energy sector. Additionally, it diversifies the Hawaiian economy and offers additional income to rural producers.

In environmental terms, the impact goes beyond CO₂. Less fossil fuel means less air pollution and less pressure on ecosystems affected by oil extraction and transportation.

Challenges and long-term cooperation

Even so, the path is not without obstacles. SAF remains more expensive than conventional fuel and its global supply is limited. Therefore, collaboration between companies, investors, and governments is essential.

Public policies, incentives, and long-term planning will be crucial to scaling this solution. Meanwhile, Hawaii positions itself as an energy laboratory for sustainable aviation.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2026/01/emisiones-aereas.jpg.webp,N,,2026-01-14 15:57:28.274151

Announced at the Boeing Future of Flight, the initiative is the most comprehensive and well-funded across the region of its kind to accelerate the production, deployment and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Funded through a 2025 state of Washington appropriation and private philanthropic donation of an additional $10 million, the CSAA positions the Pacific Northwest as a global leader in an accelerated transition to SAF while capitalizing on the once-in-a-generation economic opportunity of scaling local SAF production.

In partnership with the state’s commerce department, CSAA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable fuels industry in the Pacific Northwest.

Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is formulated from sustainable feedstocks, like crop seed oil, agricultural and forestry waste.

Advancements in SAF technology and greater availability of affordable SAF will reduce the carbon footprint of air transportation, improve air quality and contribute to a more sustainable future while creating new industries, jobs and economic opportunities.

“Sustainable aviation fuel puts the Cascadia region at the forefront of the next major chapter of the clean-energy transition that will shape how the world is powered,” said Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson. “This is the opportunity to do for clean fuels what this region did for the technology economy, creating lasting economic growth and leading the global effort to cut aviation emissions.”

The Cascadia region has been a trailblazer in aerospace innovation for over a century, and today it is uniquely positioned as a global center of aviation innovation, with an opportunity to unlock the next generation of sustainable fuel.

With access to local, low-carbon feedstocks, affordable clean energy, established infrastructure and a skilled workforce, the region has all the elements necessary to support production of up to 1 billion gallons of SAF by 2035.

Scaling production at this level would drive economic prosperity and development, strengthen regional energy security and independence, support state and regional climate initiatives and build on Cascadia’s long legacy as an aviation innovator.

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2 percent to 3 percent of global carbon-dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts.

SAF is a safe, effective drop-in solution projected to be used for the next 70-plus years that can reduce emissions by 80 percent compared to fossil-based fuels and the transition to a thriving circular economy through locally produced SAF.

“This initiative will be successful because it is grounded here, in the communities where aviation, manufacturing and clean energy intersect,” said Dave Somers, Snohomish County executive and chair of the CSAA board of directors. “CSAA builds on the infrastructure, workforce and partnerships we have already put in place, and this is just the beginning. Coalition partners like Washington State University are eager to partner in the establishment of a world class research and development facility adjacent to Paine Field. Combined with our region’s aviation industry cluster, these developments ensure we will be a leader in global aviation sustainability and investment well into the future.”

The region’s strength is built on advanced science, technology and aviation expertise, supported by leaders like Washington State University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Boeing.

This research foundation provides the technical backbone needed to move SAF from small-scale production to commercial scale.

“For the last six decades in Snohomish County, Boeing has relied on strong community partnerships to turn ambitious ideas into reality,” said Bill McSherry, Boeing’s vice president of government operations. “Cascadia is a concrete example of that collaboration toward meaningful progress on a sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem right here at home.”

Local aviation and technology leaders recognize that scaling SAF research and production will require coordinated action across the entire aviation ecosystem.

Manufacturers like Boeing bring the technical expertise to integrate SAF into aircraft and operations, while operators including Alaska Airlines and Amazon provide the operational expertise and market demand for cost-competitive SAF.

Lawmakers, like Washington State Sen. Marko Liias, have championed these partnerships at the state level by advancing legislation that supports SAF development and unlocks long-term investment.

“Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are committed to this journey to reduce carbon emissions for a more sustainable future for aviation, and while we are proud to be the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. carrier, SAF remains the biggest lever for us to meaningfully lower our emissions and reach our decarbonization goal,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. “We’re thrilled to be a founding partner of CSAA because regional, cross-sector efforts like this are critical to align policy, public and private investment, to identify and invest in the right technologies and to incent and scale local production.”

Combined with existing infrastructure, affordable clean energy and access to feedstocks, research institutions are advancing the science that makes SAF viable, and policymakers are ensuring sustainability and airport community impacts remain central as the industry transitions to cleaner fuels.

“Washington has led the world in aerospace innovation for generations, and now we face a defining moment for the next generation of aviation,” said State Sen. Liias. “Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it. This is the moment to act, and CSAA gives us the vehicle to lead.”

This has the potential to improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.
Scaling sustainable aviation fuel Delta’s biggest energy milestone came from its investment in SAF, an area where global supply remains tight.","For an airline celebrating 100 years since its founding in Macon, Georgia, Delta’s 2025 was anything but nostalgic. From operational energy gains to novel aircraft technologies, its progress over the past 12 months speaks to how aviation’s big players are now acting as energy companies in their own right.

In the first quarter alone, Delta surpassed its short-term fuel efficiency goal, saving more than 55 million gallons of jet fuel through operational improvements.

These savings equated to over US$125m and made a meaningful dent in its carbon footprint.

Energy performance and smarter operations

At the heart of these gains lies Delta’s cross-enterprise Carbon Council, a team tasked with driving energy efficiency through precision measures. These included weight reduction across the fleet, enhanced APU tracking, optimised flight routing, new landing procedures and aerodynamic refinements such as 'winglets’.

Individually modest, these projects collectively delivered significant energy savings across Delta’s network. The company also launched its ‘Green Station of the Year’ initiative, designed to embed energy-conscious practices among ground and flight crews.

Through friendly competition, staff have been encouraged to rethink their own energy habits, which is proof that behaviour change remains a cornerstone of any meaningful energy transition.

Delta's new wave aircraft partnerships

Technology partnerships were another energy milestone for Delta this year. In March, it joined forces with aerospace start-up JetZero to support the development of a blended wing-body (BWB) design.

The futuristic aircraft is predicted to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than current models, with Delta offering operational expertise through its Sustainable Skies Lab to help bring the project to market.

Later in the year, Delta entered a separate collaboration with Maeve Aerospace aimed at accelerating hybrid-electric aircraft for regional routes. Maeve’s aircraft could cut fuel emissions by up to 40% when using conventional jet fuel, and potentially even more when operating on SAF.

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the bold, forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design, enhance operational efficiency, elevate employee and customer experiences, and cut emissions,” says Kristen Bojko, Vice President of Fleet at Delta Air Lines.

The airline also added Australian start-up MicroTau to its Sustainable Skies Lab, which has created shark-skin-like coatings for aircraft to reduce drag. This has the potential to improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.

Alongside this, new component upgrades such as finlets and split-scimitar winglets have been introduced to reshape airflow and reduce drag across older fleets.

While these energy savings are not particularly large when taken individually, combined they can really turn the dial. This is the story of the energy transition in the notoriously hard-to-abate aviation sector: small, marginal gains in pursuit of net zero.

Scaling sustainable aviation fuel

Delta’s biggest energy milestone came from its investment in SAF, an area where global supply remains tight. In 2025, the airline partnered with Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland to facilitate the first commercial-scale SAF delivery to Portland International Airport.

According to Airbus, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% and may even achieve net negative impacts when produced from advanced feedstocks. Delta’s commitment to scale its SAF use by 50% year-on-year demonstrates the growing role of low-carbon fuels in reshaping aviation’s energy mix.

Fast Company recognised Delta among the world’s Most Innovative Companies for its SAF leadership, underscoring how energy transformation and business innovation increasingly go hand in hand.

What do energy-efficient aircraft look like?

Delta aims to introduce more than 35 next-generation aircraft by early 2026, each delivering an average energy efficiency improvement of over 25% per seat mile compared with the aircraft retired since 2019.

Given that around 90% of the airline’s carbon output stems from jet fuel, these gains mark a critical lever in cutting aviation’s energy intensity while newer propulsion technologies continue to mature.

Rethinking energy on the ground

Sustainability on the ground received attention too. In 2025, Delta transitioned entirely from plastic to paper cups across all flights, a move supported by new energy-aware logistics systems.

At its Seattle facilities, Delta opened the Delta One Lounge and a new Sky Club – both running on all-electric energy, incorporating smart windows and motion-sensing lighting to reduce consumption.

The airline also deepened its partnership with Green Taxi Aerospace to explore electric taxiing technology—an innovation expected to cut energy use and carbon emissions during ground operations.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0d81763d45282644be3a5f17d971b2fe:fc82e7cfb181b012f01a056740026e43/delta-s-partnership-with-airbus-deepened-this-year.jpeg.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 13:58:36.720650

Meet GIV Gowns: Why Patient Dignity Starts with What You Wear

In this spotlight interview, we speak with Shawn Gibbs, founder of GIV Gowns, a healthcare apparel company rethinking what patients wear during treatment.

After 15 years in clinical practice, he repeatedly heard the same story from patients. People delayed or avoided care because they felt exposed, embarrassed, or powerless the moment they were handed a standard medical gown.

Over time, that pattern became impossible to ignore. What started as individual patient conversations turned into a clear systemic failure.

,,2026-01-14 17:04:05+00:00,BioEnergy Times,"UK SAF use near 2% mandate level, final compliance to be confirmed in 2026",BioEnergyTimes,,,,,https://bioenergytimes.com/uk-saf-use-near-2-mandate-level-final-compliance-to-be-confirmed-in-2026/,"During the period, 163 million litres of SAF were supplied out of a total 10 billion litres of aviation fuel, reports GreenAir.
According to the data, all SAF supplied during the period was produced from used cooking oil.
The data also shows how much of the SAF supplied has already been certified.
Under the SAF Mandate, fuel volumes must be fully validated before they can be counted toward suppliers’ compliance obligations.
The UK SAF Mandate increases each year to reach a 10% requirement by 2030.","Data released by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) shows that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) accounted for 1.63% of total jet fuel supplied between January and late October 2025, raising questions over whether the UK will meet the first-year target under its SAF Mandate. During the period, 163 million litres of SAF were supplied out of a total 10 billion litres of aviation fuel, reports GreenAir.

Some industry observers say the figures suggest the UK may fall short of the 2% requirement for 2025. However, the DfT has said the data is provisional, as not all fuel suppliers have submitted final returns. The department has indicated that confirmed figures will not be published until November 2026. Industry group Sustainable Aviation has said it remains confident that the mandate target for 2025 will be achieved.

According to the data, all SAF supplied during the period was produced from used cooking oil. China accounted for 72% of the feedstock, with the remaining volumes sourced from Japan and Taiwan. At the same time, legislation aimed at supporting SAF producers through a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) is progressing through Parliament, and the DfT has opened a new consultation on how contracts under the scheme would be awarded.

The DfT statistics cover all aviation fuel reported as supplied up to October 27, including volumes that have not yet been verified. This includes SAF that has not been formally certified as sustainable or issued with certificates. The data also shows how much of the SAF supplied has already been certified.

Under the SAF Mandate, fuel volumes must be fully validated before they can be counted toward suppliers’ compliance obligations. This requirement creates a delay between the physical delivery of SAF and its formal recognition for mandate purposes.

Commenting on the figures, Sustainable Aviation Chief Executive Duncan McCourt said the data shows that SAF use in the UK is already significant and that the industry expects the mandate to be met, with SAF use increasing steadily in the coming years.

Even if the 2% target is narrowly missed, the UK’s SAF use in 2025 is expected to exceed global progress. The International Air Transport Association has estimated that SAF will account for only 0.6% of global jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8% in 2026.

The UK SAF Mandate increases each year to reach a 10% requirement by 2030. From 2027, limits will be introduced on fuels made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids, including those derived from used cooking oil. By comparison, the EU’s SAF mandate also sets a 2% requirement for 2025 but has a lower target of 6% by 2030, which includes a 0.7% requirement for synthetic fuels.

The UK government is advancing legislation to introduce the RCM, which it expects to have in place by the end of 2026. The mechanism is designed to support investment in new SAF projects by providing predictable revenues and is to be funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The DfT has held several public consultations on the scheme and has now launched another covering two key areas: proposed contract terms for RCM agreements and the process for allocating contracts to projects. The consultation is open until April 3.

Explaining the mechanism, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the contracts would set a fixed reference price for SAF. If market prices fall below that level, producers would receive payments to cover the difference, while higher prices would require producers to pay the excess back. She said the approach is intended to remove a major barrier to investment and demonstrate that the UK is a serious location for SAF development.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-4.png,N,,2026-01-14 12:57:43.613679

Decarbonization of the aviation and maritime sectors will require large amounts of low-carbon fuels to reach global net-zero targets. For SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), 2025 was undoubtedly a pivotal year. In both the UK and EU, regulation such as ReFuelEU Aviation meant binding blending targets for SAF came into effect, creating unprecedented large-scale mandatory demand for SAF.

Based on current projections, IDTechEx forecasts in the “Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts” report that the global SAF market may reach US$50 billion in 2036.

There are several different ways to produce SAF, with the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway being a major contributor to early SAF growth. HEFA feedstocks can include used cooking oils and animal fats. This is the lowest cost production pathway for SAF, with a selling price not too far from conventional jet fuel.

However, these HEFA feedstocks are limited, and beyond 2030 the global SAF market will be faced with the “HEFA tipping point”. This is when demand for SAF will keep growing due to increased global decarbonization regulation, but HEFA SAF supply will become insufficient. This will trigger a pivot to emerging SAF pathways such as alcohol-to-jet, gasification+Fischer Tropsch, and e-SAF. These technologies are less mature, but scaling up has already begun. For example, LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels alcohol-to-jet facility came online in 2025, producing 9 million gallons of SAF and 1 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. However, for many emerging SAF pathways, high costs remain a significant barrier that technology development and regulation need to address.

Aviation is not the only promising market for sustainable fuels. Renewable diesel production is also expected to grow. The US will remain a leader in renewable diesel, with stackable policy support available, including the Renewable Fuel Standard, the 45Z tax credit, and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Globally, the sustainable fuel market is expected to grow significantly over the next decade with IDTechEx forecasting the global renewable diesel and SAF production capacity will exceed 67 million tonnes annually by 2036, growing at a CAGR of 8.1% between 2026 and 2036. This impressive growth trajectory underscores the increasing importance of sustainable fuels in the global energy mix.

Renewable methanol production is also rapidly increasing, with several ~100,000 tonnes per annum facilities already under construction. China will soon emerge as the leading region given its dominant position in existing methanol markets, its low CAPEX construction, and its plentiful biomass and green hydrogen resources for emerging biomass gasification and e-methanol technologies. Demand for low-carbon methanol is being driven by the need for clean marine fuels, decarbonization of the chemical sector, and as a feedstock for the SAF (via the methanol-to-jet pathway).

The major drivers for sustainable fuel market growth are policy developments, such as SAF fuel mandates in the EU and UK or the US' 45Z tax credit, as well as a push from vehicle fleet operators and airlines to reduce carbon emissions. However, the sector also faces significant challenges associated with overall energy efficiency (especially when comparing e-fuels to EVs for road transport), feedstock availability, project development issues (long development timelines and significant funding needed) and achieving cost parity with conventional fossil fuels. Together, these drivers and challenges are shaping this rapidly developing market.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQEnS_PS8q1IzA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B4EZu8ykmXHkAI-/0/1768398934184?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=G9JnI9MBMnv5Xwc7QtkSSA8E14sw_zM5EGjkvlzVwcQ,N,,2026-01-14 14:57:25.168004

The budget push comes at a time when the sugar industry is navigating what Ballani described as a challenging phase despite strong production.
“The sugar industry is going through very challenging times,” he said, noting that the current crushing and harvesting season is progressing well.
ISMA has also sought a revision in ethanol prices.
“These policy measures are essential to stabilise the sugar industry, protect farmer incomes and support India’s clean energy transition,” Ballani said.","New Delhi [India], January 14 (ANI): The Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) has sought a budgetary outlay of Rs 15,000-20,000 crore to support advanced biofuel projects, including second-generation ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as the sugar industry grapples with surplus production, weak prices and constraints in ethanol diversion, said Deepak Ballani, Director General, ISMA.

“We have requested around Rs 10,000 crore for second-generation ethanol and about Rs 1,500 crore for SAF capacity, and overall an outlay of Rs 15,000-20,000 crore to support pilot projects and new technologies for the advanced biofuels,” he told ANI in an exclusive interview.

ISMA has sought budgetary support funds for second-generation ethanol, green hydrogen and SAF to enable pilot projects, new technologies, equipment innovation, along with GST rationalisation this budget, he said.

“We want the government to rationalize GST on Flexi and strong hybrids. We want them to give some support fund, because sugar industry, sugar cane is a major feed stock for our advance for biofuel,” he said.

The budget push comes at a time when the sugar industry is navigating what Ballani described as a challenging phase despite strong production. “The sugar industry is going through very challenging times,” he said, noting that the current crushing and harvesting season is progressing well.

“As per ISMA estimates, we are heading for a very high production of sugar, almost 34.3 million tonnes, which is much better than last year,” Ballani said. However, he added that higher production has intensified pressure on ex-mill prices, affecting mill viability.

Ethanol diversion, a key stabilising mechanism for the sector, has fallen short this year. “Ethanol diversion is very critical because it balances sugar stocks and helps ensure timely payment to farmers,” Ballani said. “But this year, in cycle one tender, diversion has been limited to only 34 lakh tonnes, which is far below what was anticipated.”

In volume terms, ethanol allocation this year stands at around 290 crore litres, compared with industry expectations of nearly 450 crore litres, Ballani said. “This creates an imbalance in sugar stocks and puts downward pressure on ex-mill prices,” he said.

ISMA has also raised concerns over pricing. Ballani said ex-mill prices have started falling below the cost of production. “Prices at the level of cost of production are extremely important to maintain the economic viability of the industry,” he said.

He pointed out that the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugarcane has increased from Rs 275 per quintal in 2018-19 to Rs 355 per quintal currently, nearly a 30% increase, while the minimum support price (MSP) of sugar has not been revised since 2018-19. “Based on today’s cost of production, MSP needs to be increased to around Rs 40-41 per kg,” Ballani said.

ISMA has also sought a revision in ethanol prices. “Around 70-75% of ethanol cost is raw material cost,” Ballani said. “FRP has gone up by 16-17% over the last three years, but ethanol prices have not been revised, which is affecting distillery viability.”

India has already achieved 20% ethanol blending (E20) five years ahead of the original 2030 target, Ballani said. However, surplus capacity remains a concern. “Total ethanol capacity today, across sugar and grain, is close to 2,000 crore litres, while E20 requires only about 1,100 crore litres,” he said.

ISMA has called for a roadmap beyond E20, including higher blending levels, flex-fuel vehicles, ethanol-diesel blending and SAF. “We have submitted a roadmap prepared with Deloitte, and we are waiting for the government to come out with a comprehensive plan, especially for SAF,” Ballani said, citing international mandates under CORSIA.

On exports, the government has permitted sugar exports of 15 lakh tonnes this season. Ballani said export contracts for 2-2.5 lakh tonnes have been signed so far, though shipments remain slow due to weak global price parity.

Domestic demand has also softened. “Last year consumption was around 281 lakh tonnes, and this year we expect around 285 lakh tonnes, which is a concern,” Ballani said, adding that ISMA studies show demand growth of only 1-1.5% annually going forward.

To boost ethanol usage, ISMA has sought GST cuts for flex-fuel and strong hybrid vehicles. “GST on flex-fuel vehicles should be reduced from 18% to 5%, similar to EVs,” Ballani said, adding that GST on E100 and E85, currently 18%, should also be cut to 5%.

“These policy measures are essential to stabilise the sugar industry, protect farmer incomes and support India’s clean energy transition,” Ballani said.

• Water conservation: The facility will use water from the Port of Walla Walla water system and will maximize recycling to reduce overall water demand.","SkyNRG announced a key milestone for Project Wigeon, a planned sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility in Eastern Washington, after securing environmental approvals from the Washington State Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County.

These approvals confirm that the project meets state and local environmental standards, including requirements related to land use, water protection, and fuel transportation. Project Wigeon will be among North America’s first commercial-scale SAF projects producing jet fuel from renewable natural gas (RNG).

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to reduce harmful emissions, which is why SkyNRG is building SAF facilities such as Project Wigeon around the world,” said John Plaza, Chief Executive Officer of SkyNRG Americas. “The Department of Ecology’s environmental review and Walla Walla County’s approval demonstrate our commitment to building this facility the right way— using industry-leading technology and conducting robust analysis of environmental impacts. This milestone allows SkyNRG to continue delivering clean fuel to major airports, building economic opportunity in Eastern Washington, and protecting natural resources and community health for years to come.”

“For several years, Boeing has supported SkyNRG’s efforts to develop SAF in the Pacific Northwest to enable our industry’s long-term growth, innovation, and efficiency,” said Allison Melia, Vice President of Sustainability at Boeing. “We look forward to leveraging SAF supply from SkyNRG and others for our operations as we increase airplane production to meet strong demand for our products.”

SkyNRG’s new facility supports a fast-emerging SAF global market as the aviation industry looks to develop new, domestically produced fuel options to meet rising demand and reduce emissions. Demand for SAF is accelerating, with global demand projected to reach five billion gallons by 2030 and more than 12 billion gallons by 2035.

Environmental permitting progress

In December 2025, Walla Walla County issued Project Wigeon its Critical Areas Permit, which documents the facility’s compliance with local environmental regulations.

The Critical Areas Permit was preceded by the Washington State Department of Ecology’s Mitigated Determination of Nonsignificance (MDNS) pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) in September 2025. The MDNS reflects the state’s conclusion that there are no significant adverse outcomes resulting from the project that are not mitigated.

The facility’s mitigation measures address local air emissions, clean fuel transportation, use of local water supplies, and groundwater impacts. This includes energy-efficient technologies built into the facility’s design and operations, creating a durable foundation for both environmental protection and long-term economic growth in the region.

Key aspects of the project include:

• Closed-loop industrial water system (Zero Liquid Discharge): All industrial and process water produced at Project Wigeon will be treated and reused on site, avoiding discharge, storage in ponds, or dispersal into groundwater.

• Water conservation: The facility will use water from the Port of Walla Walla water system and will maximize recycling to reduce overall water demand.

• Energy Production: Project Wigeon will utilize by-products of SAF production and excess steam to produce electricity on-site to offset impacts on the state’s electricity grid and reduce the overall lifecycle emissions of SAF.

• Air quality protections: The facility will be designed to operate under stringent air permit conditions set by state regulators, with ongoing monitoring and reporting.

• Stormwater management: Engineered containment systems will manage and control stormwater to protect surrounding land and water resources to limit impacts to local groundwater.

• Transportation safety and coordination: The transportation plan for SAF deliveries prioritizes safe, reliable methods for rail and trucks, purpose-built loading and containment areas that are aligned with federal and state requirements. Coordination with local partners and emergency services will be factored into project development and regular operations.

These measures, and the secured state and county approvals, are the result of more than three years of analysis and studies provided to state regulators, local officials, technical experts, and community leaders. This collaboration ensures the facility meets Washington’s highest environmental and community standards.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sky_NRG_Logo_New_eb6b13b8ce.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:58:22.217410

This reduction highlights the tangible climate benefits that can be achieved through early adoption of sustainable fuels in commercial aviation.
Commenting on the collaboration, Ángel Martínez Campos, responsible for Sustainable Aviation business development at Moeve, emphasised that the agreement reinforces Moeve’s long-term commitment to cutting emissions in aviation.
According to Rathgeber, the high level of participation by Condor’s guests has been instrumental in enabling meaningful progress, including partnerships such as the one with Moeve to secure additional volumes of sustainable fuel.","Moeve has successfully completed a major delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to support Condor-operated flights departing from Tenerife South Airport in Spain’s Canary Islands, marking a significant voluntary step toward reducing aviation emissions. Notably, Tenerife South Airport is not yet covered by the mandatory requirements of the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, making this initiative a clear demonstration of both companies’ proactive commitment to decarbonising air travel beyond regulatory obligations.

Under the agreement, Moeve supplied more than 515 metric tons of SAF to Condor. The fuel was produced using waste-based feedstocks, including used cooking oils and agricultural residues, aligning with the principles of circular economy and advanced biofuel production. When assessed across its full lifecycle, the supplied SAF is expected to deliver an estimated reduction of around 1,700 tons of carbon dioxide emissions compared with conventional fossil-based jet fuel. This reduction highlights the tangible climate benefits that can be achieved through early adoption of sustainable fuels in commercial aviation.

The SAF was used on multiple high-demand routes linking Tenerife with major German cities such as Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, and Düsseldorf. According to airport operator Aena, more than 450,000 passengers travel each year with Condor to and from Tenerife South Airport, underlining the scale and potential impact of introducing SAF on these connections. By integrating SAF into these popular leisure and tourism routes, the initiative sends a strong signal about the role sustainable fuels can play in reducing emissions in one of Europe’s most travel-intensive regions.

Commenting on the collaboration, Ángel Martínez Campos, responsible for Sustainable Aviation business development at Moeve, emphasised that the agreement reinforces Moeve’s long-term commitment to cutting emissions in aviation. He highlighted that tourism is a cornerstone of the economy in Spain and particularly in Tenerife, making it essential to decarbonise air transport linked to the sector. Working jointly with Condor on a voluntary basis, he noted, demonstrates a shared dedication to sustainability that goes beyond minimum compliance with existing regulations.

From Condor’s perspective, the initiative also reflects strong passenger engagement. Sina Rathgeber, Director of Airport Relations, Government Affairs and Sustainability at Condor, explained that since last year the airline has offered customers the option to voluntarily round up their ticket price or make direct contributions toward SAF and certified climate protection projects. These contributions are ring-fenced exclusively for the purchase and deployment of additional SAF above regulatory mandates. According to Rathgeber, the high level of participation by Condor’s guests has been instrumental in enabling meaningful progress, including partnerships such as the one with Moeve to secure additional volumes of sustainable fuel.

The SAF supplied under this agreement was produced at Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva, southern Spain. At this site, Moeve is currently constructing a new second-generation biofuels facility with a flexible annual production capacity of up to 500,000 tons of SAF and renewable diesel. The project, one of the three largest industrial developments currently underway in Spain, is already more than 50% complete and is expected to begin operations by the end of 2026. Once commissioned, it will form the largest second-generation biofuels complex in southern Europe.

Expanding the production and availability of advanced biofuels such as SAF is a central element of Moeve’s Positive Motion strategy. Through initiatives like this supply agreement with Condor, Moeve aims to position itself as a leading European player in the energy transition by 2030, while helping the aviation sector make measurable progress toward lower-carbon operations.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-14 10:57:07.581454

SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Market to Reach US$50 billion in 2036

Decarbonization of the aviation and maritime sectors will require large amounts of low-carbon fuels to reach global net-zero targets. IDTechEx forecasts that the global sustainable aviation fuel market may reach US$50 billion in 2036.

Globally, transportation accounts for ~20% of all CO2 emissions. Decarbonization of the aviation and maritime sectors will require large amounts of low-carbon fuels to reach global net-zero targets. For SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), 2025 was undoubtedly a pivotal year. In both the UK and EU, regulation such as ReFuelEU Aviation meant binding blending targets for SAF came into effect, creating unprecedented large-scale mandatory demand for SAF. This demand will continue to grow as decarbonization regulation ramps up. Based on current projections, IDTechEx forecasts in the new ""Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"" report that the global SAF market may reach US$50 billion in 2036.

How is SAF made?

There are several different ways to produce SAF, with the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway being a major contributor to early SAF growth. HEFA feedstocks can include used cooking oils and animal fats. This is the lowest cost production pathway for SAF, with a selling price not too far from conventional jet fuel.

SAF production pathways covered in IDTechEx's ""Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"" report. Source: IDTechEx

However, these HEFA feedstocks are limited, and beyond 2030 the global SAF market will be faced with the ""HEFA tipping point"". This is when demand for SAF will keep growing due to increased global decarbonization regulation, but HEFA SAF supply will become insufficient. This will trigger a pivot to emerging SAF pathways such as alcohol-to-jet, gasification+Fischer Tropsch, and e-SAF. These technologies are less mature, but scaling up has already begun. For example, LanzaJet's Freedom Pines Fuels alcohol-to-jet facility came online in 2025, producing 9 million gallons of SAF and 1 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. However, for many emerging SAF pathways, high costs remain a significant barrier that technology development and regulation need to address.

Renewable diesel market continues to grow

Aviation is not the only promising market for sustainable fuels. Renewable diesel production is also expected to grow. The US will remain a leader in renewable diesel, with stackable policy support available, including the Renewable Fuel Standard, the 45Z tax credit, and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Globally, the sustainable fuel market is expected to grow significantly over the next decade with IDTechEx forecasting the global renewable diesel and SAF production capacity will exceed 67 million tonnes annually by 2036, growing at a CAGR of 8.1% between 2026 and 2036. This impressive growth trajectory underscores the increasing importance of sustainable fuels in the global energy mix.

Increased demand for renewable methanol

Renewable methanol production is also rapidly increasing, with several ~100,000 tonnes per annum facilities already under construction. China will soon emerge as the leading region given its dominant position in existing methanol markets, its low CAPEX construction, and its plentiful biomass and green hydrogen resources for emerging biomass gasification and e-methanol technologies. Demand for low-carbon methanol is being driven by the need for clean marine fuels, decarbonization of the chemical sector, and as a feedstock for the SAF (via the methanol-to-jet pathway).

IDTechEx's ""Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"" report offers an in-depth analysis of the renewable methanol market, covering technology suppliers, key project developers, and announced project capacities, providing a detailed outlook on the future of renewable methanol.

Outlook

The major drivers for sustainable fuel market growth are policy developments, such as SAF fuel mandates in the EU and UK or the US' 45Z tax credit, as well as a push from vehicle fleet operators and airlines to reduce carbon emissions. However, the sector also faces significant challenges associated with overall energy efficiency (especially when comparing e-fuels to EVs for road transport), feedstock availability, project development issues (long development timelines and significant funding needed) and achieving cost parity with conventional fossil fuels. Together, these drivers and challenges are shaping this rapidly developing market.

SAF production has still risen, though it is running far short of current capacity.
Unlike biomass-based diesel, SAF is especially vulnerable to such perceptions because it’s a market still in its infancy.
Since aviation isn’t easily electrified, growth of SAF is seen as critical for U.S. ethanol and corn, the biggest U.S. crop.","Bigger-than-expected corn and soybean supplies are the latest challenge facing financially strained U.S. farmers.

Crop price pressures, high farming costs and demand woes are intensifying pressure on Congress and policymakers to advance pro-biofuel policies.

Sustainable aviation fuel is especially vulnerable to policy uncertainty after Congress lowered the value of a key tax credit.

America’s crop farmers got hit with a fresh wave of market woes this week, ramping up pressure on the Trump administration and Congress to move faster on biofuel policy the industry says is crucial to its future.

Domestic supplies of corn and soybeans are bigger than previously estimated, with the current corn crop at a record, the the Department of Agriculture said in its closely watched monthly crop report on Monday. Grain and soy prices fell.

The full bins collide with murky demand outlook and a surge in farm production costs. Ag and biofuel groups are doubling down on calls for Washington to take action. The wish list includes passing congressional legislation to allow year-round, nationwide sales of higher blends of corn-based ethanol, known as E15, and for the Environmental Protection Agency to finalize overdue 2026 biofuel-blending regulations.

The administration took power last January “very supportive of the biofuel program,"" said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for StoneX Group. ""But then that momentum got lost in the bogged down process of writing policy.""

The National Corn Growers Association warns that surplus supply will keep corn prices low amid higher input costs.

“We need long-term market solutions, and we need them quickly, or this is going to deepen the economic crisis in the countryside,” Ohio farmer and NCGA President Jed Bower said following release of the USDA’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report. “The urgency for Congress and the president to open new markets abroad and expand consumer access to ethanol just increased exponentially.”

Renewable Fuels Association Chief Executive Officer Geoff Cooper said pollution-related concerns about summertime ethanol sales are outdated by decades and that marketplace restrictions ""are literally choking off demand and shortchanging America’s farmers.”

The administration has already set aside $12 billion to help farmers hurt by higher costs, lower crop prices and soft demand. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson, R-Pa., said last month that at least $10 billion more in federal aid will be needed.

Green jet fuel stalled

Another bearish note in this week’s WASDE was a pullback in the estimate for U.S. sales of soybeans to other countries. USDA said the trim was due to higher Brazilian production and exports, amplifying broader concern about the future of American competitiveness. Many analysts said the agency didn't cut enough.

Just a few years ago, a flurry of announced plans to make more sustainable aviation fuel in the U.S. boosted investment in the fuel and triggered talk of massive amounts of new crop acreage. That came amid a boom in renewable diesel production. Both fuels can be made with a wide array of raw materials, including corn-based ethanol and soybean oil.

More recently, biomass-based diesel output stumbled due to policy uncertainty, including EPA's pending biofuel-blending rules and the Treasury Department's guidance on the new 45Z clean fuel production tax credit. SAF production has still risen, though it is running far short of current capacity.

The slowdown in investor interest, at least for now, is yet another headache for U.S. farmers, especially soybean growers struggling after China stopped buying their crops for a big chunk of last year due to President Donald Trump's tariff wars.

Montana Renewables CEO Bruce Fleming says the lack of policy clarity means there's not funding for new U.S. biofuel projects.

“Investors can’t make any money available because of uncertainty, which means we are going to run into a supply shortage probably sooner than people think, particularly in SAF,” he says.

Meanwhile, Montana Renewables, which makes both renewable diesel and SAF, has plans to sell as many as 150 million gallons of SAF a year, up substantially from current capacity, according to Fleming. The company is one of three leading green jet fuel producers in the U.S.

The lower-emitting fuel was a top priority of the Biden administration, though has drawn scant attention from Trump. The president's disdain for climate change-related policy also has caused some companies to ease off sustainability plans.

After World Energy temporarily halted SAF production last year due to its operating partner, Air Products, cutting its partnership with the company, founder and CEO Gene Gebolys told Fastmarkets that the Trump administration’s stance on environmentally friendly energy was partly to blame.

Unlike biomass-based diesel, SAF is especially vulnerable to such perceptions because it’s a market still in its infancy. Since aviation isn’t easily electrified, growth of SAF is seen as critical for U.S. ethanol and corn, the biggest U.S. crop.

More than a third of America’s corn harvest each year goes to making the gasoline additive. Ethanol, facing an existential crisis with the rise of electric vehicles, is among pathways to make SAF.

In November, LanzaJet Inc. said it started commercial operations at its demonstration-sized SAF plant in Georgia after a string of delays, marking the world’s first production of jet fuel using ethanol. Still, a slew of plans to build full-size ethanol-to-jet plants by various companies have yet to materialize.

Soy-heavy green diesel is also viewed as crucial for U.S. agriculture, but it’s further along as an industry. The fuel used to power trucks and other heavy machinery is currently favored by many fuel producers over SAF, after federal lawmakers last summer cut the base value of the 45Z credit for SAF from $1.75 to $1 a gallon. That put it at the same level as green diesel, which is less costly to make.

There's bipartisan legislation in Congress to restore the value of the credit.

In a November report, BloombergNEF analyst Jade Patterson said U.S. SAF capacity could increase to 760 million gallons by the end of 2027, up from roughly 400 million now, as more capacity comes online. But demand at the moment is in question, in part due to the reduction in 45Z.

Overall, StoneX's Suderman said the policy question is coming at a big cost.

The agency has kept its estimate that renewable diesel production will average 250,000 barrels per day in 2026. Output is now projected to rise to 290,000 barrels per day in 2027. Renewable diesel production stood at an average of 190,000 barrels per day last year.

Net imports of renewable diesel are expected to average minus 20,000 barrels per day, revised from the minus 30,000 barrels per day projected in the December outlook. The EIA expects net imports to remain at minus 20,000 barrels per day in 2027. Net imports of biodiesel averaged minus 30,000 barrels per day in 2025.

The EIA has lowered its forecast for renewable diesel consumption in 2026 to 220,000 barrels per day, compared to 230,000 barrels per day projected earlier. Consumption is expected to increase to 260,000 barrels per day in 2027. Renewable diesel consumption averaged 160,000 barrels per day in 2025.

Biodiesel production is expected to average 100,000 barrels per day in 2026, with output projected to remain at the same level in 2027. Biodiesel production averaged 80,000 barrels per day in 2025.

Net imports of biodiesel are forecast to remain at zero in both 2026 and 2027, unchanged from the December outlook and the levels reported for 2025.

Biodiesel consumption is projected to average 90,000 barrels per day in 2026 and rise to 100,000 barrels per day in 2027. Consumption stood at 70,000 barrels per day in 2025.

The EIA also maintained its forecast for the production of other biofuels, which include renewable heating oil, renewable jet fuel such as SAF, renewable naphtha, renewable gasoline, and other emerging fuels. Production of these fuels is expected to average 40,000 barrels per day in 2026, the same level reported for 2025, before rising to 50,000 barrels per day in 2027.

Cathay said the study provides practical analysis and recommendations to help scale SAF adoption in the Chinese Mainland by addressing both supply and demand through market-based measures.

The study reviews the challenges and growth potential for SAF in the Chinese Mainland, drawing comparisons with global best practices and China’s solar photovoltaic industry. It highlights China’s advantages in feedstock and manufacturing and examines long-term cost trends across different production pathways. The study notes that the Power-to-Liquid pathway, which produces electro-sustainable aviation fuel, has the strongest potential for long-term cost reduction and could reach price parity with conventional jet fuel, including China’s projected 2030 carbon price, once cumulative output reaches 1.6 million tonnes, with appropriate policy support.

It also recommends a combined approach to developing the national SAF industry, including policy integration, stimulating market demand, expanding international market access and setting up procurement mechanisms to ensure stable supply and demand.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said the development of a domestic SAF industry in the Chinese Mainland would support national carbon targets and improve the availability and affordability of SAF for global airlines. She added that the study highlights the potential for SAF to achieve long-term cost parity with conventional jet fuel, provided there is sufficient support for new technologies, large-scale production and policies that encourage SAF deployment on both the supply and demand sides.

Cathay said it has supported SAF development in the Chinese Mainland for many years and was among the early airlines to uplift Chinese-made SAF at Hong Kong International Airport, Amsterdam Schiphol and London Heathrow.

Decarbonizing the aviation sector requires low-carbon sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to fossil jet fuel while preserving compatibility with existing fuel distribution infrastructure and conventional aircraft engines. This study assesses a novel sustainable fuels production pathway based on highly wet and difficult-to-handle biomass, with the objective of maximizing SAF yield. The process integrates hydrothermal carbonization with sorbent-enhanced conversion, where three scenarios are evaluated: biomass-to-liquid (BtL) with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), power-biomass-to-liquid with CCS and PEM electrolyzer (PBtL), and a Benchmark configuration embedding PEM with no CCS. The BtL scenario achieves the highest energy efficiency (51.16%) and the highest carbon-negative potential (−115.89 g-CO2/MJ), driven by limited electricity consumption, minimal grid dependence, and a high capture and sequestration rate. The PBtL scenario shows lower efficiency (39.44%) but remains carbon-negative (−41.96 g-CO2/MJ). Its performance is constrained mainly by high electricity demand and suboptimal use of electrolytic hydrogen, which is largely combusted for process heat and power. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the strong resilience of BtL to variations in grid carbon intensity, whereas the PBtL and Benchmark scenarios exhibit high vulnerability. Economic analysis reveals relatively high production costs (0.155–0.271 €/MJ), approximately 10-17 times higher than current fossil jet fuel, due to substantial capital expenditure and high operating costs. Pairing revenue from voluntary carbon markets with SAF mandate-linked incentives while preventing double-counting income substantially improves economic viability. Recognizing and rewarding carbon-negative performance in policy frameworks at carbon credit prices exceeding ~200 €/t-CO2 sequestered would strengthen SAF competitiveness from these pathways with fossil kerosene, particularly under existing fuel taxation incentives.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2026-01-14 06:58:19.644695

Revenue from commercial grade drop-in fuels and chemicals anticipated in 2029

HOUSTON, TX, Jan. 13, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abundia Global Impact Group, Inc. (NYSE American: AGIG) (“Abundia” or the “Company”), announces it has issued its first letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer Ed Gillespie, which highlights the Company’s 2025 transformation to the public markets to accelerate its strategic direction and outlines priorities and milestones expected in 2026.

Dear Valued Shareholders,

As we embark on the early days of 2026, and on behalf of the Abundia team, I would like to begin by thanking our shareholders for the ongoing support of Abundia’s long-term strategy. Our team remains committed to driving shareholder value through our strategy of producing high value renewable fuels and chemicals from waste streams that are destined for landfill or incineration by deploying already commercially proven technology solutions that can power the renewables economy.

In December 2025, Abundia debuted as a NYSE American listed company. Our public transition was the result of the July 2025 merger between Houston Energy Corp. (HUSA), formerly a publicly listed upstream oil & gas company, and Abundia Global Impact Group, a private company offering a technology platform that converts waste plastics and biomass into renewable fuels and chemicals. As the CEO of the prevailing Abundia business, this unique opportunity to utilize the HUSA public company vehicle was an attractive proposition to accelerate Abundia’s strategic direction.

Abundia’s vision has been to create a vertically integrated, commercially proven, technology stack to provide a commercially viable solution for the waste to value industry. With clear and growing secular demand, and regulatory tailwinds in Europe and the US, we initiated our capital deployment strategy in 2025 with the acquisition of the Cedar Port site in Texas to develop our centralized innovation hub.

Abundia’s Pathways to Product and Long-term Value

As an integrated renewables company and producer of low carbon fuel alternatives, our business strategy is rooted in our technology partnerships which are the pathways or processes that combine with upgrading technology to produce our drop-in low carbon fuels and chemical products that deliver our differentiated waste to value strategy. In terms of identifying technology partners, our key criteria sourced a narrow lens of proven, validated, commercially viable technology that de-risked this pivotal component of our business.

In 2021, we secured our licensing agreement with Alterra Technology, which provided Abundia with access to its advanced continuous pyrolysis processes. This is our plastics waste-to-fuel segment, which will ultimately produce high value renewable fuels and chemicals such as diesel, naphtha, and jet fuel.

Our second pathway supports our biomass waste-to-fuel strategy and was secured through our agreement with BTG Bioliquids for its fast pyrolysis technology, with which we intend to specialize in the production of renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Both base technologies are commercially proven and operational at full scale, at various locations in the US and Europe. After the additional upgrading steps that bolt on to these base technologies, our output will be commercial ready fuel and chemical products that can be used directly or blended into existing distribution infrastructure. We are confident that our market and technology readiness provides a solid platform to build and accelerate a path to revenue generation and scalable opportunities for Abundia.

Accomplishments in 2025

Asset Acquisition: In July, we completed the site acquisition at Cedar Port in Baytown, TX, a 25-acre industrial site which will serve as Abundia’s Innovation Center, the hub for the end-to-end lifecycle of producing renewable fuels and chemicals, and our operational headquarters.

Project Partners Appointed: In August, we confirmed Nexus PMG as engineering and services lead for the plastics recycling facility and innovation center development at Cedar Port.

Solidified Strategic Technology Agreement: In October, Abundia locked in a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) agreement with BTG Bioliquids to collaborate on SAF projects through the use of BTG’s pyrolysis technology to convert biomass to produce Fast Pyrolysis Bio-Oil (FPBO).

Operations Project Launch: We officially broke ground at the Cedar Port site in October, which initiated Phase 1 of the development project with design, permitting and construction of the innovation center including an on-premises R&D facility.

Optimized Balance Sheet: In November, the Company reduced our debt by restructuring a senior secured convertible note with lead strategic investor Bower Family Holdings, providing financial flexibility for capital expenditures related to construction and development of the Cedar Port site.

Successfully Completed a Capital Raise: In November, the Company announced the completion of an $8 million capital raise with institutional investors, allowing the company to accelerate its strategy for commercial deployment and develop the Cedar Port site.

Official Transition to a Pure Play Renewables Company: On December 8th, we officially began trading on the NYSE American as Abundia.

Activation of the Alterra License Agreement: On December 9th, we delivered formal site notification to Alterra Energy for the first recycling facility at our Cedar Port site. Subsequently, on December 15th, we announced the expansion of rights to operate two additional sites in the US, providing an additional revenue opportunity.

Our judicious execution in 2025 represents significant milestones and opportunities for the company’s long-term value generation.

Aligning components of a vertical integration strategy

The leadership team at Abundia is comprised of a diverse team that bring proven abilities in management, finance, project development and operations. The combined depth and knowledge of this team and their ability to develop, build, execute, and scale commercial projects is a core competency and quite frankly, a competitive advantage driving our vertical integration strategy.

Our leadership’s strategic approach to securing technology partners that were essentially plug and play contributors due to their validated and proven product, combined with an upgrading strategy to produce high quality and high value renewable fuels and chemicals has been executed with a similar approach to solidifying our infrastructure of partners. When I reference infrastructure, this extends beyond the current innovation hub development at Cedar Port. Abundia’s infrastructure includes deploying a full scale of operations, and is the component that is under our control, to accelerate our time to market with commercial grade low carbon fuels. To this end, we have employed our network of market readiness partners with a robust history of delivering, strengthening and ensuring successful project outcomes. We are focused on execution and have appointed reliable, at scale, partners for each segment of the project. This began with our Phase 1 construction of the innovation center at Cedar Port by securing Corvus Construction as a general contractor and the appointment of Nexus PMG as its lead engineering and project advisor to oversee the technical, engineering and design aspects of the projects.

2026 Plan

2025 was the transformational year for Abundia, and with the acquisition of Cedar Port completed as the critical infrastructure to build the Abundia Innovation Center, along with our market integration partners, we have entered 2026 on a firm foundation. Our strategy in 2026 is driven by our achievements to date, operational excellence derived from management to our strategic partners who remain committed to disciplined actions that position the company for long-term growth.

Project and Operational Roadmap:

Q1 2026 Strategic Catalyst: Finalization of the RPD Acquisition, an R&D company offering a combination of intelligence and hard technology assets that will augment Abundia’s operations to deliver rigorous analysis and trials for refining, petrochemical, gasification and renewable energy technologies. Merging RPD into Abundia’s operations provides a force multiplier to accelerate our commercial readiness plan, sustainable growth and future expansion opportunities.

2Q 2026 Infrastructure Milestone: Targeted completion of Phase 1 at the Cedar Port Innovation Center, establishing our operational headquarters, technology hub, and an R&D facility. This will essentially serve as Abundia’s “command center” for end-to-end deployment of processes towards commercialization of our final renewable products.

Disciplined Capital Allocation: With the support of our long-term strategic investors and their confidence in our products, technology, and management team, we’ve made meaningful progress toward positioning Abundia’s vertically integrated infrastructure prior to entering the capital markets. Importantly, capital investments from our lead investors during the early stages of our site project reinforces our business transformation and the strategy that we’ve assembled to deliver long-term value and anticipated growth of this invested capital. We will continue to make efficient use of our balance sheet and optimize capital expenditures through our vertical integration structure.

These strategic priorities, combined with our strengthened balance sheet, have positioned Abundia for completion of Phase 1, the Renewable Energy Complex development, on an accelerated timeline by 2Q 2026. Furthermore, based on our current targets and assumptions, the Phase 2 Waste Plastic to Renewable Fuels and Chemicals Plant, is expected to be completed in 2029. Upon completion, we expect the production and commercialization of high yield, high quality renewable fuel and chemical products to generate revenue in the same year. The sale of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is subject to completion of the accreditation and certification process.

Transparency and communications to the market relative to our 2025 execution is a priority for our management team, and we are committed to continued – and perhaps even increased - transparency to our shareholders regarding 2026 milestones and achievements. We believe the Abundia ecosystem as established in 2025 provides the structural drivers that set a trajectory to seeing the results unfold in 2026 and maintains progression towards commercialization by 2029. With a focused strategy, differentiated technology, and a lean operating model, we are committed to maximizing Abundia’s long-term value for our shareholders.

On behalf of the Abundia team, I’d like to once again express our deepest appreciation to our shareholders and other stakeholders for your continued confidence and support. We look forward to providing the market with regular updates on our progress in the year ahead.

What sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is doing today may shape the future, but right now it asks passengers to fund an idea that has yet to prove itself at scale.","Airlines have found a new way to make you pause at checkout. Just after seat selection and before you hand over your card details, a neat little box appears inviting you to chip in towards the climate impact of your flight. The wording feels worthy, the price feels tolerable, and the implication is obvious. If you care, you’ll pay. If you don’t, well, that’s on you. This is the moment most people first ask what sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is, and why it has suddenly become their personal responsibility – a small, optional guilt tax slipped in just before payment.

The idea sounds simple enough. SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from waste oils or synthetic processes rather than crude oil. It can be blended with existing fuel and used in today’s aircraft without modification. On paper, it promises lower lifecycle carbon emissions than standard jet fuel. That all sounds reassuring, until you look at how it actually shows up in the real world.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Explained – what airlines don’t make clear

The first thing to understand is that ticking that box does not change what powers your aircraft. Your flight still burns regular jet fuel from pushback to touchdown. The money you contribute goes into a central pot that allows the airline to buy a small amount of SAF somewhere else in its network, at another time, on another aircraft. The benefit exists on a spreadsheet, not in the wing of the plane you are sitting on.

This book-and-claim approach is rarely spelled out. Passengers are nudged into believing they are cleaning up their own journey, when in reality they are funding a marginal system-level adjustment with no measurable impact on their individual flight. Once you grasp that, the whole proposition starts to wobble.

Why passengers are being asked to fund it

The uncomfortable truth is that SAF is expensive and scarce. It costs several times more than conventional jet fuel and makes up a tiny fraction of global supply. Airlines face growing pressure from governments to use it, but few are willing to absorb the cost or reprice fares accordingly. The easier option is to pass the hat around.

By positioning SAF as a voluntary add-on, airlines can talk loudly about climate action while keeping base fares competitive. The financial risk shifts quietly to passengers, wrapped in language that suggests personal agency rather than corporate obligation. It is a clever move, but not an especially honest one.

Why this doesn’t change the climate maths

SAF itself is not imaginary. It exists, it flies, and it may well play a role in aviation’s long-term decarbonisation. The issue is scale. Today’s production volumes are nowhere near high enough to deliver meaningful reductions, and feedstocks remain limited. Synthetic fuels promise more supply in theory, but at eye-watering cost and energy demand.

At this point you start thinking, what is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) actually achieving here, beyond a bit of corporate signalling? Even generous passenger contributions cover only a sliver of the fuel burn of a long-haul flight. Any genuine climate benefit only appears when SAF is adopted at scale across entire fleets, driven by mandates and supply-side investment, not optional checkout donations.

That is why accusations of greenwashing are hard to dismiss. If SAF genuinely mattered in the way it is marketed, airlines would treat it as a non-negotiable cost of operating in a carbon-constrained world. Instead, it sits alongside extra legroom and lounge access, sold as a feel-good add-on rather than a structural shift.

So where does that leave us? Curious, informed, and unconvinced. What sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is doing today may shape the future, but right now it asks passengers to fund an idea that has yet to prove itself at scale. Until that changes, we’ll keep scrolling past the box and keeping our money firmly in our pocket.",https://media.boardinggroup.one/2026/01/13-210116/image.png,N,,2026-01-14 01:12:10.247424

California-based JetZero—which has ditched the conventional tube-and-wing for a blended-wing body (BWB) or “all-wing” configuration—said Tuesday that it raised $175 million in a Series B round led by B Capital, a new investor.

The round also included participation from United Airlines Ventures, RTX Ventures, and Northrop Grumman, all of which have existing ties to JetZero.

United Airlines Ventures in April made an undisclosed investment and signed a purchase agreement for up to 100 aircraft and 100 options, contingent upon the flight of a full-scale demonstrator in 2027, among other conditions. JetZero in 2023 won a $235 million Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) contract to build and fly an early version of its flagship Z4 that is expected to deliver fuel efficiency gains of 30 percent, with added lift and improved mobility.

Northrop’s Scaled Composites division is working with JetZero toward that demonstration.

“A fleet of these could save the U.S. Department of the Air Force up to $1 billion in fuel costs per year,” Ravi Chaudhary, former assistant secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations, and Environment—and an adviser for JetZero for six months in 2025, per his LinkedIn—told The American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 2023.

RTX is tied to JetZero through its Pratt and Whitney and Collins Aerospace units. The former is supplying its PW2040 turbofan engine and auxiliary power units for the Z4, while the latter will provide nacelles, fairings, and engine support structures.

JetZero in 2025 also secured a formal partnership with Delta Air Lines and is part of the carrier’s Sustainable Skies Lab, which it said will provide maintenance, operational footprints, and other resources to validate the Z4’s technology. The two had been working together informally since 2021. Delta will also consult on the Z4’s interior design.

Alaska Star Ventures, the investment arm of Alaska Airlines, participated in JetZero’s 2023 Series A round and has options for future aircraft orders.

“If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,” said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, in April.

JetZero said the fresh funding will accelerate development of the full-scale demonstrator, reiterating its target for first flight in 2027. With Tuesday’s raise, the company added, it has secured more than $1 billion in funding and commitments.

The Path to JetZero

Despite the novelty of BWB aircraft, airlines such as United and Delta view the technology as a tool to drive down costs and meet commitments to achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2050.

Few BWBs have advanced beyond the prototype phase, and none have been certified to carry passengers. The concept was first studied in earnest in the 1990s, after NASA challenged the industry to develop revolutionary gains in fuel efficiency compared to airframes like the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas MD-11, or Airbus A320.

McDonnell Douglas accepted the challenge. It devised a 450-passenger concept that was used to develop two 8.5-percent dynamically scaled test vehicles, the X-48B and X-48C. Combined, the two aircraft flew 122 times between 2007 and 2013.

All-wing designs like the Z4 integrate the wings and fuselage into a single shape, eliminating the traditional tail section. The result is a smooth airframe that reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wing, lowering fuel consumption.

For example, JetZero estimates that a 3,400 nm flight from New York to Palma de Mallorca, Spain, would use up to 45 percent less fuel versus twin-aisle aircraft that fly that route today. The Z4’s 45,000-foot service ceiling and top-mounted engines—akin to NASA and Lockheed Martin’s X-59 supersonic demonstrator—are further expected to reduce noise.

The model is designed for up to 250 passengers, similar to existing widebodies. But JetZero bills it as a “mid-market” aircraft due to its projected range of 5,000 nm. It is designed to fly on conventional jet fuel but in the future could use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends or, potentially, liquid hydrogen.

Per JetZero, the Z4 will fit into existing airport infrastructure, with no new jet bridges, runways, or taxiways required. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) air taxis, by contrast, will eventually require vertiports and charging infrastructure. The company plans to certify the model under FAA Part 25, with planned passenger transport, commercial freighter, and military tanker and refueling variants.

Beyond fuel efficiency, the Z4’s other standout feature is its spaciousness. Its vertical interior walls offer increased cabin space to accommodate larger doors and 18-inch-wide seats, with dedicated overhead bin space for each. It will be configurable as a 2-by-3 or without middle seats.

JetZero in June announced plans to pour $4.7 billion into a Z4 production facility at Piedmont Triad International Airport (KGSO) in North Carolina.

Competing with JetZero for airline customers is another California-based developer, Natilus.

Natilus is developing two BWB models, the Kona for cargo and Horizon for passenger. Kona has a projected maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 19,000 pounds, speed of 250 knots, and range of 200 to 300 miles. Horizon is predicted to have a 160,000-pound MTOW and cruise at Mach 0.8. The latter is billed as a replacement for single-aisle narrowbodies such as the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 10 and Airbus A320neo.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/JetZero-Z4-United-livery-1-portrait-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 00:56:49.789695

Walsh highlighted “worrying developments” and said: “I’m disappointed at the pace of progress. We’re not seeing SAF produced in the volumes we hoped or expected.”

He noted: “We said when we committed to net zero by 2050 that it would be extremely challenging and expensive. It will be more challenging now. The regulation has not been helpful. Mandates have led to huge increases in price [of SAF].”

Walsh accused fuel suppliers of “price gouging and ripping us off ”, saying: “If you mandate a product that is in short supply, it will increase in price. Airlines that need to comply with the mandates can’t get the supply. Governments will have to review these mandates.”

He suggested the UK mandate target of 10% SAF use by 2030, which some airlines have committed to across their operations, is “now impossible to achieve” and said: “The EU’s 6% SAF target will be challenging, [but] 10% SAF use by 2030 is beyond the reach of most airlines. SAF is not available. A lot of airlines will have to reassess their commitments.

“About 70% of airlines have made commitments on SAF use by 2030. There is just no way those commitments can all be met. We’re not seeing the supply stimulated.”

Walsh noted fuel suppliers pay the costs of compliance with the mandates but “just pass them on”, saying: “They’re in a position to adjust the price to protect themselves.

“This is a wake-up call. SAF is just not available. The regulators need to look urgently at what is happening versus what they thought would happen.”

Walsh said Iata had not set a 2030 target for SAF use “because what we thought achievable wouldn’t look ambitious”.

Global SAF production is forecast to reach 2.4 million tonnes (MTs) in 2026, up from 1.9 MTs in 2025. That was almost double the 1 MTs produced in 2024 but represented only 0.6% of global jet fuel consumption while adding $3.6 billion to airline fuel bills.

From global trade to personal travel, air transport plays a vital role in modern life. At the center of this system is aviation fuel an essential component that enables flight but also represents one of the industry’s greatest challenges as sustainability becomes a global priority.

Traditional aviation fuel, commonly known as jet fuel or Jet A-1, has long been valued for its reliability, energy density, and safety performance. These qualities are critical in an industry where operational margins are tight and safety standards are uncompromising. However, conventional aviation fuels are derived from fossil sources and contribute significantly to carbon emissions, placing aviation under increasing scrutiny as countries work toward climate goals.

Unlike other transport sectors, aviation faces unique limitations when it comes to electrification. Long-haul flights require high energy density that current battery technologies cannot yet provide at scale. As a result, fuel innovation—not replacement of aircraft is the most immediate and realistic pathway to reducing aviation’s environmental impact.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are emerging as a key solution. Produced from renewable sources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, or synthetic processes using captured carbon, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Importantly, SAF is designed to be compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure, allowing airlines to adopt cleaner fuels without overhauling fleets.

Despite this promise, widespread adoption remains a challenge. Production volumes are still limited, costs are higher than traditional fuels, and supply chains are uneven across regions. Airlines, fuel producers, and governments are therefore working together to scale production, introduce incentives, and create long-term demand certainty.

Alongside SAF, research is advancing into synthetic e-fuels and hydrogen-based aviation fuels. E-fuels, created using renewable electricity, water, and captured carbon, offer a potential route to near-carbon-neutral flying. Hydrogen, while still at an early stage for commercial aviation, is being explored for short-haul routes and future aircraft designs. These innovations signal long-term change, even if they are not yet ready for widespread deployment.

Regulation and policy are shaping the pace of progress. Blending mandates, carbon pricing, and international frameworks are pushing the industry to move faster while maintaining safety and economic stability. At the same time, passengers are becoming

more aware of aviation’s environmental footprint, influencing airline strategies and brand positioning.

The future of aviation fuels will not hinge on a single breakthrough. Instead, it will be built through gradual transition, steady investment, and collaboration across the aviation ecosystem. Cleaner fuels are becoming an essential part of aviation’s license to grow in a carbon-constrained world.

Takeaway Point

Aviation fuels are evolving from a purely operational necessity into a strategic tool for sustainability, with sustainable and synthetic fuels offering the most practical path toward lower-emission air travel in the years ahead.

,,2026-01-13 22:22:25+00:00,www.spa.gov.sa,KAUST and Arabian Petroleum Supply Company Partner to Advance Sustainable Aviation ...,Not Available,,,,,https://www.spa.gov.sa/N2455611,"Jeddah, November 30, 2025, SPA -- King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) has signed a new material transfer agreement (MTA) with the Arabian Petroleum Supply Company (Apsco), under which Apsco will supply KAUST with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for research on next-generation low-emission fuels.
    According to a KAUST press release, the collaboration comes at a critical time for the aviation industry. Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, airlines are required to use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050—targets that remain out of reach with today’s fuel technologies. Meanwhile, global SAF demand is expected to surge from 2 million metric tons in 2025 to 10 million in 2030 and 75 million by 2040.
    Professors Mani Sarathy, Thibault Guiberti, Aamir Farooq, and Hong Im will lead the research, which will focus on the chemical properties, reaction pathways, and combustion behavior of the provided fuels. The new data on fuel behavior, emissions characteristics, and performance metrics will build a comprehensive database that will develop models for the creation of future SAF formulations of higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.
    “This partnership allows us to combine world-class experimental facilities with advanced artificial intelligence to fundamentally reimagine how sustainable aviation fuels are designed,” said Sarathy. “Using the new data generated, our models will help identify efficient, cleaner, and more scalable fuel formulations that can support the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals.”
    The release also highlighted that globally, the aviation industry is increasingly turning to create predictive models for fuel behavior from partial datasets, reducing development cycles from years to months. Beyond fuel design, the project will help bridge critical knowledge gaps that currently slow SAF adoption worldwide, from understanding emissions behavior to assessing how fuels perform across a range of operating environments. By answering these fundamental questions, the partnership will enable industry and regulators to make faster, more informed decisions about future SAF deployment.
    Apsco CEO Dr. Azzam Qari stated, “This collaboration with KAUST marks an important milestone for Apsco and for the future of sustainable aviation in the Kingdom. As the global aviation sector moves rapidly toward lower-carbon solutions, investing in local research and national capabilities in SAF is no longer optional; it is strategic. Through this agreement, our role goes beyond supplying fuel for testing; we are helping build the scientific and technical foundation that can enable Saudi-developed SAF technologies in the years ahead.”
    Moreover, as Saudi Arabia expands its aviation network and explores domestic SAF production opportunities, the ability to test and validate fuel properties within the Kingdom scientifically becomes increasingly essential. Building local research infrastructure accelerates certification, supports national sustainability targets, and strengthens the country’s position in the future global aviation fuel market. With research facilities already in place, KAUST will provide the scientific foundation needed to accelerate domestic SAF research in the Kingdom, supporting the goals of the Saudi Aviation Strategy to advance low-carbon, next generation energy technologies.

Located on a new site in the industrial area of Seal Sands, the £2bn LGF project will convert 1.5m tonnes of sustainably-sourced biomass into more than 180m litres of SAF, offsetting the equivalent carbon emissions of 4,500 transatlantic flights from London to New York.

SAF is a safe, proven fuel already in use today. More will be needed to meet the UK Government’s targets for net zero domestic flights by 2040, and for all flights to achieve net zero by 2050.

The government’s SAF Mandate requires at least 10% of the UK aviation fuel mix to come from sustainable sources by 2030. Lighthouse Green Fuels is the most advanced SAF project of its kind in the UK and is projected to deliver 11% of the SAF Mandate’s requirement.

Following an earlier public consultation in May 2024, LGF has been updated to reflect technical advancements and strategic improvement:

Site relocation: A new, enhanced site in Seal Sands, 500m from the previously-proposed Billingham site. The proposed facility offers closer access to critical infrastructure, including rail and shipping links, and enables the entire conversion process to take place on one site, from feedstock pre-treatment to storage.

Change in feedstock: The project will now use sustainably-sourced biomass, including forestry and agricultural residues, as its primary feedstock to achieve greater carbon savings. This replaces the previous proposal which intended to use municipal solid waste derived feedstock

It is also located even closer to Teesside’s carbon capture and storage infrastructure, providing the opportunity for seamless integration into the network in future. This could mean CO2 savings from the SAF produced will more than double from 350,000 to 750,000 tonnes of per year.

LGF is expected to be the UK’s first commercial scale, second-generation SAF production facility.

Unlike first generation fuels, second-generation SAF uses non-edible, waste or residue-based feedstock, which avoids competition with food crops and supports environmental and ethical best practices.

This transformative project represents a £2 billion investment in the region and will:

Create over 3,400 full-time equivalent jobs across the UK during operations, including up to 600 local jobs on Teesside

Support £3.8 billion in UK-wide GVA and £750 million in Teesside GVA over 25 years

Drive apprenticeships and skills development to upskill the local workforce and support long-term economic growth

Noaman Al Adhami, UK Country Head for Alfanar Projects, said:

“Launching this consultation marks an important milestone in accelerating our world-leading SAF investment, positioning Teesside at the centre of the UK’s fast-growing synthetic fuels sector”.

“Delivering for the local area is a central to LGF’s mission. Our project will generate significant economic benefits, creating up to 2,000 jobs during construction, 300 permanent roles once operations, and 3,400 supply chain positions nationwide.

We’re committed to reindustrialising Teesside and ensuring that local workers can transition from fossil fuel-based industries to work in future-facing facilities like ours”.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2026-01-13 19:11:39.980754

The nonprofit, called the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, secured $20 million from state funding and a private donation to “de-risk” the production of sustainable aviation fuel, making it easier for companies, universities and institutions to study, develop and, eventually, produce the alternative fuel source.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been in the works for nearly two decades, but the industry has not taken off. SAF is slow and costly to produce and, though the technology is mature, there are few facilities producing the alternative fuel.

SAF accounted for less than 1% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to a December report from the International Air Transport Association.

On Thursday, Washington’s elected officials and aviation leaders gathered at Boeing’s Future of Flight museum in Mukilteo to celebrate the new initiative. Leaders from Boeing, Alaska Airlines, Amazon, Washington State University and the Washington State Department of Commerce pledged again and again that Washington would be at the forefront of sustainable aviation, carrying on a legacy of aviation firsts in the state.

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said.

SAF is an alternative to petroleum that makes fuel from so-called feedstocks. There are several ways to make it, but all capture gases from renewable sources, like used cooking oils or animal waste. After a complicated process, SAF is eventually mixed with traditional jet fuel to lower carbon emissions during flight.

The accelerator introduced Thursday is meant to speed up both research and production, which will enable the state to produce SAF on a large scale. It will put Washington at the forefront of what the state expects will be the next economic boom in the aviation industry, the nonprofit’s leaders said.

Washington already passed legislation to accelerate permitting and environmental review for construction of clean energy plants and introduced a tax credit that provides subsidies for SAF.

At the celebratory event Thursday, Boeing announced that, starting this year, all its flights for operations and deliveries from Renton, Everett and Paine Field will fly on up to 30% SAF.

And SkyNRG, a Dutch company building a sustainable fuel production facility in Walla Walla, said Thursday it had completed state and county environmental reviews that will allow it to move forward with construction.

A ‘Catalyst’ For the Industry

The aviation industry has been chasing SAF for decades. Boeing conducted the world’s first test flight powered by biofuels with Virgin Atlantic in 2008.

Yet SAF production accounted for just 0.6% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to the December report from the International Air Transport Association.

SAF production doubled from 2024 to 2025, IATA found, totaling about 634 million gallons last year. For comparison, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport alone uses about 600 million gallons of jet fuel annually, according to the Port of Seattle.

The alternative fuel is also still pricey, IATA found. In 2025, the extra costs associated with SAF added $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the aviation industry.

Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell told the group “it’s probably late to the game to begin solving it at this scale, but it’s not too little. It’s exactly what’s needed.”

The accelerator’s list of partners is extensive: Alaska Airlines, Amazon, Boeing, the Port of Seattle, Snohomish County, the Washington State Department of Commerce and Washington State University.

SkyNRG Plant Moves Forward

John Plaza, CEO of SkyNRG Americas, acknowledged at Thursday’s event that the industry has more demand for SAF than supply, but urged attendees to consider how far the initiative has come in the last 20 years.

SkyNRG set out to develop its Washington site in 2023, calling it Project Wigeon. The facility will sit on a 165-acre site at Wallula Gap and, once up and running, will produce 50 million gallons of SAF a year.

The interactive dashboard compiles and visualizes data gathered by Matisoff, along with Program and Operations Manager Michael Morley, offering a comprehensive view of SAF production, feedstock availability, and policy trends.

EPIcenter Research Associate Yang You has designed the dashboard to translate complex datasets into policy-relevant insights for decision-makers. By organizing key metrics into interactive visuals, the dashboard helps stakeholders assess market readiness and identify regulatory actions that could accelerate SAF adoption.

Emphasizing the importance of data-driven insights, Matisoff said, “The Department of Energy has a Grand Challenge to produce 3 billion gallons a year of Sustainable Aviation Fuel by 2030, and 35 billion gallons a year by 2050. By compiling and visualizing SAF data, we can help policymakers and researchers understand progress towards these goals, where the key opportunities and bottlenecks are – and how to move forward effectively”.

Why SAF Matters

While aviation only accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it is a rapidly growing share, and decarbonizing this sector is considered one of the most challenging aspects of the energy transition. Produced from renewable feedstocks, sustainable aviation fuel offers a pathway to reduce lifecycle emissions from air travel without requiring major changes to aircraft or infrastructure. However, SAF production and deployment face hurdles related to cost, supply chain development, and policy support.

EPIcenter’s Director Laura Taylor highlighted the dashboard’s role in addressing these challenges:

“Sustainable aviation fuel is a cornerstone of decarbonizing air travel, but the market is complex and rapidly evolving. The dashboard provides clarity by organizing the relevant data in a way that’s accessible and actionable for decision-makers.”

“This tool is meant to bridge analysis and action,” said You. “By visualizing SAF production, capacity, and offtake dynamics, the dashboard allows policymakers and stakeholders to see where the market is moving, where gaps remain, and how targeted infrastructure investments or supportive policies could unlock scale.”

Sabbaticals can change that - SmartBrief,Candace Chellew,,,,,https://www.smartbrief.com/original/workplace-burnout-has-a-cost-sabbaticals-can-change-that,"In our first Sabbatical Impact Report, we found that organizations offering formal sabbatical programs report significant returns across three levels: Individual impact.

Organizational burnout is not a reflection of individual challenges; rather, it is a collective phenomenon.","Take a minute to think about your best employees. Now ask yourself: How many of them are running on empty? How many are one stressful month away from updating their LinkedIn profiles?

Leaders are carrying the weight of big decisions. Rising stars are pushing hard on ambitious projects. Teams are delivering, even as the pressure builds.

Here is the reality: those same leaders need more space to think strategically between decisions. Rising stars are excelling, but often under intense pressure. And many teams, while productive, may be ready to unlock greater innovation with the right support.

The data tells the same story. Gallup reports that 41% of employees experience daily stress, resulting in a global economic loss of nearly $9 trillion in lost productivity. Deloitte research shows nearly half of younger professionals are considering leaving their jobs due to burnout.

Burnout, however, is not just a personal problem. It is an organizational one. Too often, burnout is perceived as an individual challenge or a lack of resilience when in reality, it is a systemic issue.

Organizations that act now can address burnout at its source and create the conditions for people to thrive, stay engaged and perform at a high level.

A powerful solution

Intentional, well-designed sabbatical programs offer a powerful organizational tool to counter burnout and disengagement.

At my company, DFA, we recently studied these outcomes in depth. In our first Sabbatical Impact Report, we found that organizations offering formal sabbatical programs report significant returns across three levels:

Individual impact. Stepping away provides the space to rest, reflect and return with sharper focus and renewed creativity. The perspective gained often sparks fresh ideas and leads to lasting breakthroughs.

Team impact. When one person steps away, others step in to take their place. The transition creates natural opportunities for cross-training, spreads knowledge across the team, and builds leadership capacity. Over time, these experiences strengthen succession pipelines without the need for costly programs.

Organizational impact. Well-designed sabbaticals also pay off at the organizational level. Retention improves, cultures become healthier and top talent is drawn to workplaces that invest in renewal and growth.

This work reminds us that productivity can be found as much in the pause as in the push. Boundaries serve as bridges to greater productivity, creativity and sustainability, enabling people to work with focus and purpose.

The ripple effect of sabbaticals is powerful: it renews the individual, strengthens the team and secures the organization’s future.

What a strong sabbatical program looks like

Through our research and conversations with leading organizations, we’ve identified the elements that make sabbaticals successful. A sabbatical is one tool in a broader organizational toolbox. It’s part of a larger strategy to address burnout and enhance performance.

Here’s a practical framework to guide design and implementation:

Begin by defining why sabbaticals matter for your organization. Are you aiming to reduce burnout, strengthen retention, foster leadership development or build succession depth? Connecting the program to clear business goals builds support and ensures measurable impact.

Look at what already exists. Do you offer any form of extended leave? Review attrition data, engagement scores or market trends to understand the gap and set a baseline.

Bring key stakeholders together from HR, finance, legal and leadership. Designate one or two champions to advocate for the program and guide implementation. Highlight employees who have benefited from extended leave to build momentum.

Make equity a central design principle. Avoid limiting sabbaticals to a narrow tier of executives or senior staff. Explore tiered or role-specific options that include business professionals and rising stars. Fair access reinforces culture and strengthens retention.

Put the program in writing. A clear policy should outline eligibility, length, compensation, recurrence and reintegration support. Transparency builds trust and sets expectations across the organization.

Communicate consistently. Add sabbatical details to onboarding, handbooks and performance conversations. Share stories and encourage leaders to model participation, making the program feel both accessible and safe.

Start with a pilot if needed. Test the program with a small group, establish metrics such as retention, engagement or mobility, and track outcomes before scaling. Create systems to measure usage and impact across teams and demographics.

Build a culture that supports time away. Encourage cross-training, create transition plans and celebrate sabbaticals as milestones that benefit both employees and the organization.

Pay close attention to reintegration. Provide debrief sessions, mentoring or stretch assignments so employees can apply renewed perspective and energy. Capture stories and feedback to amplify the benefits across the organization.

Revisit the program regularly. Gather feedback, assess outcomes and adapt as your organization evolves. A strong sabbatical program evolves with the business and stays relevant over time.

Building your business case

If you’re weighing whether sabbaticals are a smart investment, start by examining the costs of burnout and turnover that you’re already incurring. When top performers leave or disengage, the impact ripples across teams, slows progress and drains momentum.

Organizational burnout is not a reflection of individual challenges; rather, it is a collective phenomenon. It’s a signal that systems, expectations and workloads need to evolve.

Sabbaticals offer one way forward, a strategic pause that strengthens both people and performance. They give employees time to recharge, reflect and return with renewed energy and creativity, while signaling to current and future team members that your organization values people as much as performance. When designed with intention, these programs help keep employees motivated, engaged and committed for the long haul.

The agreement covered more than 515 metric tons of SAF, produced from used cooking oils and agricultural waste, a supply expected to reduce 1,700 tons of lifecycle CO₂ emissions when compared with conventional jet fuel.

The SAF was used on routes connecting Tenerife with major German cities including Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, and Düsseldorf. According to airport operator Aena, more than 450,000 passengers a year choose Condor for flights to and from Tenerife South Airport.

Ángel Martínez Campos, sustainable aviation business development at Moeve, said: “This agreement reinforces Moeve’s commitment to lowering emissions in aviation and in an industry as vital to Spain and Tenerife as tourism.

“Working alongside Condor to accelerate this effort clearly shows both companies’ dedication to sustainability beyond what is mandatory regulation.”

“Since last year, Condor guests have had the opportunity to voluntarily round up their flight booking price or make direct contributions to advance Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and certified climate protection projects.

“These funds are exclusively allocated to procure and deploy additional SAF beyond regulatory mandates,” said Sina Rathgeber, director airport relations, government affairs and sustainability at Condor.

The Government has specific targets to ensure sustainable aviation fuels form part of the UK jet fuel mix, reaching 22% in 2040.

Aviation experts, though, have questioned whether this will be achieved.

In reply to the Commons environmental audit committee’s (EAC) report entitled Airport Expansion and Climate and Nature Targets, ministers have now accepted that the eco-fuel goal may be flunked.

“The Government recognises there are risks to scaling up SAF production both domestically and globally to the level required to meet the targets set out in the SAF mandate,” they said.

But they argued: “Setting ambitious targets in the SAF mandate is itself a way to promote the supply of SAF from a diverse range of feedstocks.”

Heathrow airport’s expansion has moved a step closer after the Government launched a review into how it will consider plans for a third runway

PA Archive

The Government has backed expansion at several airports including Heathrow, a new second runway at Gatwick, as well as more capacity at Luton and City airports.

It told the EAC: “Airport expansion will help to unlock the growth benefits that a world class aviation sector can provide.

“The Government is committed to ensuring that these economic benefits of airport expansions are delivered in a way that considers and addresses its environmental and social responsibilities.”

On the west London airport, it added: “Heathrow Airport, as the UK’s busiest and only hub airport, plays a critical role in enabling international connectivity for both passengers and freight.

“Its expansion has the potential to boost the UK economy and could support over 100,000 jobs in the local area.”

The Government has chosen Heathrow’s £33 billion scheme to expand the airport which will increase capacity by more than 50% to 756,000 flights a year, and involve moving the M25 which could create years of disruption for motorists.

Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband had stressed that the expansion plans have to be consistent with the Government’s legally-binding commitment on net zero by 2050.

The Government is now reviewing the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which provides the primary basis for decisions on a Development Consent Order application for a third runway at Heathrow, which is essentially planning consent.

Part of the ANPS work is to ensure that a bigger Heathrow meets the Government’s four tests on economic growth, air quality, noise and climate change.

However, the Government has already backed a third runway even before deciding what the tests should be to ensure that these economic and environmental aims are achieved.

In the reply to the EAC, it said: “As part of the ANPS review, DfT (Department for Transport) is considering how the Government’s four tests for Heathrow expansion, including air quality, should be set.

“The review will consider changes in legislation, policy and data since the ANPS was designated in 2018 and will consider all key air quality pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter.”

The Government added: “The mitigations for air quality impacts will be determined as part of the review process, and if any amends are made to the existing ANPS, they will be subject to consultation in summer 2026.”

Ruling questions Trump administration’s national security rationale for pausing five offshore wind leases

Outcome carries implications for US clean power buildout, investor certainty and supply chain planning

A federal judge has cleared Danish developer Orsted to restart work on its nearly completed Revolution Wind project after the Trump administration suspended construction last month. The decision injects legal momentum into a sector facing political headwinds as the White House reassesses national security implications of offshore wind in federal waters.

Revolution Wind is a $5 billion development co-owned by Orsted that aims to deliver renewable power to Rhode Island and Connecticut. It is the first of five offshore wind projects paused by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in late December over what officials described as radar interference risks identified by the Department of Defense.

Legal Setback for Trump and a Litmus Test for the Pause

US District Judge Royce Lamberth issued a temporary order blocking the stop-work directive, concluding that the project would suffer irreparable economic harm if forced to remain idle. The court also questioned whether the administration’s national security justification satisfied procedural requirements.

Lamberth pressed government attorneys during the hearing, asking: “You want to stop everything in place, costing them one-and-a-half million a day, while you decide what you want to do?” He also noted discomfort with the Interior Secretary’s public criticism of offshore wind on grounds unrelated to defense. In recent interviews, Burgum called offshore wind expensive, unreliable, reliant on foreign equipment and harmful to marine life.

The Interior Department did not comment following the ruling.

Revolution Wind’s injunction request is one of several challenges filed by developers and state governments since the suspension. Hearings later this week will address Equinor’s Empire Wind project off New York and Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind facility. Together, the paused projects sit at the intersection of clean power targets, federal leasing policy and US industrial planning for a sector racing to compete with Europe and China.

Stakeholders Seek Predictability for Capital and Supply Chains

Orsted said it intends to resume work quickly while the litigation advances. “Revolution Wind will determine how best it may be possible to work with the US Administration to achieve an expeditious and durable resolution,” the company said in a statement.

Government lawyers maintained the pause was warranted due to newly classified information shared by the Pentagon in November. Developers argued the move violated administrative law and due process by withholding the assessment from affected parties. Janice Schneider, attorney for Revolution Wind, told the court: “This Court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here.”

For investors and utilities, the case highlights the extent of regulatory and political risk tied to US offshore wind buildout. Cancellations and renegotiated power purchase agreements in 2023 and 2024 reshaped financial expectations for the sector, while the latest federal pause introduced uncertainty around project timelines, procurement and local content commitments.

Governance and Climate Stakes for the US Power System

The US has set multi-gigawatt offshore wind ambitions in pursuit of climate targets, regional manufacturing and grid diversification. The Trump administration has taken a more adversarial stance toward offshore wind, with President Trump frequently criticizing turbines as unaesthetic and inefficient. State governments in the Northeast continue to drive demand through solicitations and procurement mandates, leveraging offshore wind to meet climate laws and stimulate port, vessel and cable investments.

National security concerns related to radar and maritime surveillance have been longstanding in the sector, though typically addressed through project-specific mitigation. Classified assessments complicate conventional stakeholder processes and raise governance questions over how federal agencies balance defense prerogatives against climate and industrial policy.

Global Ramifications

The outcome of the litigation will be watched by European and Asian utilities that have invested heavily in the early US market. The United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark and Taiwan have used regulatory stability and pipelines to nurture domestic manufacturing and finance structures for offshore wind. The US market’s trajectory now depends on how the administration reconciles defense priorities with state-level climate goals and investor demands for predictability.

For climate planners, the case matters beyond the coast of Rhode Island. Offshore wind is one of the few scalable zero carbon technologies that can deliver large volumes of power to densely populated load centers. A prolonged federal pause could slow emissions progress across multiple states and challenge the credibility of US clean energy commitments at a time when Europe and China are accelerating deployment.

As Revolution Wind restarts, the hearings for Empire Wind and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind will reveal whether the courts provide a broader pathway for stalled projects. The sector’s immediate question is not only whether construction proceeds, but whether the United States can establish consistent governance for a technology central to its climate and industrial strategy.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/US-Judge-Allows-Orsted-to-Resume-5-Billion-Rhode-Island-Offshore-Wind-Project-Halted-by-Trump.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 17:57:26.590971

Attached to the agenda for the Monday, Jan. 12 council meeting was a letter from Tidewater Renewables vice-president of business development Amber New.

She wrote that the company is looking to develop the aviation fuel project adjacent to its existing refinery, which began operating in 2023.

In late 2024, when company CEO Jeremy Baines told The Citizen that its refinery was in danger of closing due to an unequal playing field caused by American competitors getting subsidies on both sides of the border, he added that its planned aviation fuel expansion for the site was in jeopardy.

In late February 2025, the provincial government expanded the required made-in-Canada and renewable components of diesel sold in the province to address the issue.

New’s letter said the aviation project has completed a front-end engineering and design study, which includes a Class 3 capital estimate and project schedule. The company is now waiting a final investment decision in the second quarter of 2026.

If built, the facility would have the capacity to produce 6,500 barrels per day of fuel that new described as “a low carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel with an annual reduction of ~800,000 tonnes of C02/year.”

As part of the process, New said the company is looking to secure capital support from the provincial government from the British Columbia Low Carbon Fuel Standard (BC-LCFS) program — the same program that helped fund the diesel refinery.

The aviation facility is expected to create 60 permanent full-time jobs and the construction is expected to require 400 to 500 workers over a three-year period.

Currently, construction is expected to begin in mid-2027.

New said Prince George “has demonstrated a strong, industry-friendly culture that supports responsible industrial development” that has allowed companies like Tidewater to set up shop.

To continue its partnership with the city, Tidewater requested a letter of support for its BC-LCFS program.

Coun. Ron Polillo pointed out the employment and economic benefits touted by the letter and said it was worthy of the city’s support.

Mayor Simon Yu said the project would mean a lot to both the city and the region.

In this note, we outline the key themes and anticipated developments from a UK focus that we expect will shape the sector in the year ahead.

Consumer protection and passenger rights

EU261: Reform of EU261 remains a priority. In October 2025, the European Parliament’s Transport Committee adopted its negotiating guidelines on EU261 reform, including:

Maintaining the right to compensation after a three-hour delay (per Sturgeon).

Guaranteeing free cabin luggage, consisting of a personal item and a small trolley bag.

Banning fees for check-in, child seating and booking corrections.

Requiring airlines to send a standard compensation form or activate alternative automatic communication channels within 48 hours of disruption (passengers would have one year to claim the compensation).

Creating a defined list of “extraordinary circumstances” based on existing CJEU EU261 case law (e.g. natural disasters, war, weather conditions or unforeseen labour disputes – but excluding airline staff strikes).

These guidelines conflict with the European Council’s June 2025 agreement to raise the delay threshold to four or six hours, whilst also contradicting existing EU law on cabin baggage.

Despite intensive trilogue talks between the Council, European Parliament, and Commission, no final agreement was reached by the end of the Danish Presidency term. The file has now rolled over into Cyprus’s Presidency term, which started on 1 January, with further negotiations scheduled for February. Whether such negotiations will be productive is doubtful given that, to the disappointment of important industry groups including IATA, the European Regional Airlines Association and Airlines for Europe (A4E), the Transport Committee doubled down on its guidelines during a vote on 12 January. All airlines operating into the EU should watch closely for developments in 2026.

UK261: Airlines based in or operating into the UK will be interested in EU261 reform as this may influence how the UK's own passenger protection regime – UK261 – might develop in the future.

In October 2025, the UK CAA opened a compliance programme to assess industry compliance with its obligations to passengers under UK261. The programme is expected to run for at least 18 months, with the CAA indicating that it will publish progress updates during that period.

Greenwashing, green claims and consumer protection: The implementation of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCCA) and associated guidance will continue to shape enforcement of unfair commercial practices, with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) alongside the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) expected to scrutinise claims in airline and travel company marketing relating to aircraft emissions and sustainability pledges. The CMA has also been involved in a recent clampdown on online pricing practices at a number of travel companies concerning price transparency and the use of drip pricing. This scrutiny is likely to increase following the implementation of the DMCCA's new rules on subscription services, which is anticipated to take place in Autumn 2026.

Accessibility and inclusion: We expect any regulatory updates on accessibility in 2026 to be informed by the Aviation Accessibility Implementation Group following the publication of the Aviation Accessibility Task and Finish Group’s independent report in July 2025. We also await the CAA’s publication of a summary of responses and decision document following the consultation on the requirement to publish information on mishandled mobility aids (CAP 3088) that took place in Autumn 2025. The Aviation (Accessibility) Bill is due to have its second reading in the House of Commons on 23 January 2026.

Sustainability

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): The UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill continues to work its way through the parliamentary process, with the Bill currently at the Report stage in the House of Lords. With a third reading in the House of Lords to take place before consideration of the amendments can occur, we consider that it is likely the SAF Bill will receive Royal Assent in 2026 as previously envisaged by the Government.

We also expect the Government’s response to the recent consultation seeking views on the design of the proposed levy on fossil aviation fuel suppliers that will be used to fund the SAF revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) – see our blog post for further detail – along with further consultations relating to the design of the RCM.

Airspace and infrastructure

Airspace modernisation: Following the publication in August 2025 by the CAA of a revised deployment plan for its Airspace Modernisation Strategy (AMS), we expect there will be progress in 2026 in UK airspace modernisation. This may include guidance and requirements further to consultations launched in late 2025 on:

UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) – draft guidance to streamline complex airspace changes.

UK Airspace Coordination Service (UKACS) – the final proposals to modify NATS (En‑Route) plc’s air traffic services licence to give formal effect to UKADS – including governance, transparency, engagement, and provision of information duties – plus the creation and operation of an Airspace Design Support Fund, with cost recovery via user charges (the details of which are set out in CAP 3164).

Updates to the air navigation directions (AND) and air navigation guidance (ANG) to provide clear priorities for the design of airspace, including the altitude at which noise and carbon are prioritised.

We also expect further integration measures for drones and eVTOLs under AMS, linked to the Law Commission’s review of the law around autonomous flight (as to which, see the ‘Technology and autonomy’ section below).

Airport rules: In late 2025, the European Commission opened an EU-wide public consultation on various rules affecting airports, namely the Slot Regulation, the Groundhandling Directive and the Airport Charges Directive. This consultation is part of a fitness check launched by the European Commission of the legislation concerning airports and airport capacity and may lead to reform in these areas. Such reform may include revising the Slot Regulation.

The UK will be watching such developments closely. Despite the DfT’s consultation on slot reform in 2023/24 proposing time-limiting historic rights, tightening or revisiting the 80/20 usage rule, restricting long‑term slot leasing, strengthening the transparency and powers of the UK coordinator and, in certain circumstances, introducing auctions for newly created capacity, amendments at a UK level have been minimal and limited to the Airports Slot Allocation (Alleviation of Usage Requirements etc.) Regulations 2025. The 2025 Regulations introduced changes expanding the definition of a “new entrant” (from five to seven daily slots), streamlining elements of the allocation process and introducing a permanent statutory mechanism for justified non‑utilisation during public health emergencies.

Airport development: 2026 is set to be a pivotal year for UK airport development as government policy, planning decisions and economic regulation begin to converge. The UK Government’s October 2025 announcement of a review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS) has placed Heathrow expansion back on the political agenda. A revised draft ANPS is expected for consultation in summer 2026, updating the framework in light of the UK’s strengthened climate, noise and air quality commitments. Gatwick enters 2026 with a Development Consent Order (DCO) already secured to bring its Northern Runway into routine use. Following the Transport Secretary’s approval of Luton’s DCO in April 2025, 2026 will see the early stages of delivery of the £2.5bn expansion, including a new terminal complex and associated taxiways, stands and access improvements.

Technology and autonomy

Aviation autonomy: The Law Commission and CAA are advancing work on legal frameworks for highly automated and autonomous systems in aviation and aviation infrastructure. A final report on liability models for drones, VTOL aircraft and air traffic management for uncrewed aircraft is expected in early 2026.

We also anticipate the CAA will continue its work on VTOL policy and regulatory frameworks, following the publication of its Advanced Air Mobility: eVTOL Delivery Model last year.

New drone rules: New rules in the UK now apply for recreational and commercial operators. Effective from 1 January 2026:

A Flyer ID is required for flying drones weighing 100g or more outdoors in the UK. This requires successful completion of the CAA’s basic competence test.

An Operator ID must be labelled on drones weighing 100g or more with a camera, or weighing 250g or more regardless of camera.

A classification system for drones has been introduced, from UK0 to UK6. These classes define operational limits, safety features, and compliance requirements and are similar to EU classes but tailored for UK regulation.

All UK1, UK2 and UK3 class-marked drones must broadcast a Remote ID signal during flight, which includes the drone’s unique ID, location, and operator details, enabling authorities to identify and track drones in real time. Legacy drones have until 1 January 2028 to comply with this requirement.

Drone operators must follow updated airspace restrictions, including geofencing and altitude limits.

There are enhanced requirements for risk assessments and insurance for commercial drone operations.

These rules are summarised in The Drone and Model Aircraft Code and align with the CAA’s AMS, supporting safe integration of drones with manned aircraft and future urban air mobility.","https://www.burges-salmon.com/articles/102m1jm/ https:/images.passle.net/fit-in/860x860/filters:crop(0,176,2121,1187)/Passle/5d9604688cb6230bac62c2d0/SearchServiceImages/2026-01-10-14-01-50-258-69625bce1e42b4e6137976ba.jpg",N,,2026-01-13 11:11:48.806270

Industrial sector emissions rose modestly due to higher industrial activity, and oil and gas emissions ticked up slightly with increased production.
We estimate that US GHG emissions grew faster than the economy, breaking a three-year trend of economic growth outpacing emissions growth.
Power sector emissions also increased in 2024; this stretch marks the first consecutive two-year period of power sector emissions growth since 2012-2013.
Industrial power demand, which accounts for a smaller share of total power demand, increased by 1.9% due to increased output in electricity-intensive subindustries.","Based on preliminary economic and energy activity data, we estimate that in 2025, US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased by 2.4%, marking a change from the prior two years of decreases in emissions. Emissions also grew faster than the economy in 2025, with real GDP expanding by a projected 1.9%—reversing the decoupling of emissions and economic activity of the prior two years. Emissions in 2025 were 6% below pre-pandemic levels in 2019 and 18% below 2005 levels.

The increase in emissions was driven primarily by the buildings and power sectors. Colder winter temperatures drove higher space heating demand in buildings, pushing up direct emissions from fuel use in buildings by 6.8%. Higher natural gas prices and growing power demand boosted coal electricity generation, resulting in a 3.8% rise in power sector emissions. Elsewhere, changes in emissions were more subdued. Industrial sector emissions rose modestly due to higher industrial activity, and oil and gas emissions ticked up slightly with increased production. Despite record travel activity, transportation emissions were essentially flat due to the growing adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles. US emissions in 2025 were not meaningfully impacted by policies enacted by the 119th Congress and the Trump administration, but we project that those policy changes could have increasing effects in the years to come.

Economic growth and rising emissions

Economic growth is a major determinant of GHG emissions, and in 2025, the US inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (real GDP) expanded at a projected rate of 1.9%. This marks about a 30% decline from the growth rates recorded in each of the prior three years. The economy grew despite significant economic turbulence and uncertainty introduced by federal government changes to trade, tariff, tax, and energy policies, as well as the longest government shutdown in US history. Consumer spending, the core driver of US GDP, has so far remained resilient to these shocks and an inflation rate of nearly 3%, while continued investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure were another major source of economic growth.

We estimate that US GHG emissions grew faster than the economy, breaking a three-year trend of economic growth outpacing emissions growth. Using preliminary economic and energy activity data, we project that economy-wide emissions grew by 2.4% in 2025 (Figure 1). This puts US emissions 6% below pre-pandemic levels in 2019 and 18% below 2005 levels.

Higher space heating demand and a growing power sector

Increased demand for space heating currently correlates directly with increased emissions, as the majority of homes in the regions with the coldest temperatures rely on natural gas and other fossil fuels for heat. Colder 2025 winter temperatures led to increased direct combustion of these fuels in buildings, driving up emissions by 56 million metric tons (MMT), or 6.8%, compared to 2024.

In the power sector, a 2.4% increase in total electricity generation and a 13% increase in coal generation relative to 2024 pushed emissions from electricity generation up by 55 MMT (3.8%). This marks only the second year in the last 10 years that coal generation has increased—a notable departure from its general downward trajectory, in which coal generation has shrunk by 64% since its peak in 2007. Power sector emissions also increased in 2024; this stretch marks the first consecutive two-year period of power sector emissions growth since 2012-2013.

Based on historic and forecasted sectoral consumption data, the largest source of increased electricity use was commercial buildings, where data centers, cryptocurrency mining operations, and other large load customers drove electricity demand up by 2.4%. This growth was concentrated in Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Ohio Valley regions. Residential buildings saw the next largest increase, with electricity demand up by 2.2%. This was primarily due to space heating demand from colder winter weather, but electric vehicle consumption is increasingly a significant contributor. Industrial power demand, which accounts for a smaller share of total power demand, increased by 1.9% due to increased output in electricity-intensive subindustries.

The main driver of higher coal use was higher natural gas prices, up 58% at Henry Hub in 2025 compared to very low levels seen in 2024, as a result of high space heating demand from colder temperatures and rising LNG exports (Figure 4). Generation from coal and natural gas together made up 57% of total generation, down slightly from 58% in 2024, illustrating how these resources compete with each other.

The pace of coal plant retirements also slowed, as utilities delayed planned retirements to help meet rising power demand and in response to orders from the Department of Energy. Through November, only 2.5 GW of conventional steam coal capacity had retired, compared with 4.5 GW in 2024 and an average of nearly 9 GW a year since 2020.

At the same time, the fastest growing power generation source in 2025 was solar, which surged by 34%—its highest growth rate since 2017. This pushed the grid share of zero-emitting sources up by one percentage point to 42%, despite only a modest increase in wind and flat nuclear and hydroelectric generation. Natural gas remained the single largest source of electricity, though it fell by nearly three percentage points to 40% of the grid mix.

Higher industrial output and fossil fuel production

Industrial emissions grew by 15 MMT (1.3%) relative to 2024, reflecting modest growth in total industrial output. The overall increase in output was driven by emissions-intensive subindustries such as chemicals, primary metals, and nonmetallic mineral production. However, that growth was moderated by broad declines in the manufacture of other consumer and commercial goods, including food and beverages, paper products, and motor vehicles.

Oil and gas production emissions were essentially flat—up by only 1 MMT (0.5%) relative to 2024—despite natural gas and petroleum production increasing by 4.4% and 2.8%, respectively. Over the past decade, state and federal regulations combined with a trend toward cleaner production practices, especially reductions in methane venting, have steadily reduced methane emissions per barrel of oil and per cubic foot of natural gas. We estimate that the methane intensity of gas and oil systems declined by 44% and 62%, respectively, between 2015 and 2025. The extent to which this trend will continue remains to be seen as EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has targeted the federal regulations for oil and gas production methane emissions for repeal.

Flat transportation emissions

In transportation—the highest-emitting sector—emissions were virtually flat relative to 2024, increasing by only 2 MMT (0.1%). This was the result of increases in diesel and jet fuel emissions slightly outweighing gasoline emissions reductions (Figure 5). The US is on track for a fifth straight year of record-high road activity, with a 1% increase in road traffic volumes through October 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. And available seat miles—a measure of passenger flight capacity—are on track to set their own record in 2025, based on available data through September showing the metric up 2% year-on-year. Despite an increase in miles driven, gasoline consumption declined due to an increasingly fuel-efficient vehicle fleet. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) made up nearly 10% of all passenger car and light truck sales in 2025, and traditional hybrids (HEVs) were another 12% of sales, based on data through November 2025. BEV sales growth was effectively flat, and PHEV sales declined by 14% compared to last year, while HEV sales showed continued, strong growth of 25% compared to 2024. BEV and PHEV sales dropped sharply in the fourth quarter after the expiration of clean vehicle federal tax credits for consumers and businesses.

Something unusual happened with diesel this year: consumption went down but emissions went up. Biomass-based diesel consumption was down 34% relative to 2024, reversing a steady growth trend and boosting consumption of petroleum-based diesel by 2%. Biomass-based diesel imports fell steeply because of their loss of eligibility for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit this year. Domestic biomass-based diesel production also fell due to uncertainty about how Renewable Fuel Standard blending requirements would be updated by the EPA. Around a quarter of diesel consumption is in the industrial and buildings sectors, where higher industrial output and space heating demand also increased petroleum-based diesel use.

Looking ahead

US GHG emissions have been trending downward since peaking in 2007, averaging about a 1% decline each year, even with the last few years of increasing emissions (Figure 6). Our longer-term outlook for US GHG emissions changed sharply this past year. In our 2025 edition of Taking Stock, our annually updated outlook for US emissions under current policy, we project US emissions will decline by 26-35% below 2005 levels in 2035. In the highest emission scenario, this reflects an even slower rate of decarbonization progress over the next decade than we’ve seen over the past 15 years. This year’s projections represent a substantial slowdown in emissions reductions compared to our outlook in 2024, which projected a decline of 38-56% by 2035 relative to 2005. This slowdown is largely due to changes to energy tax credits made by the 119th Congress in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill and the repeal of climate regulations by the Trump administration. Apart from some modest contributions to increased coal generation from Department of Energy orders to keep a few plants running, we aren’t yet seeing the direct effects of these policy changes in US emissions. That could change in the coming year or two, particularly if data center electricity demand continues to surge and the grid responds with more output from existing fossil generators instead of new, clean resources. The growth in electric vehicles, which has in part helped keep a lid on transportation sector emissions, may also stall in the absence of federal tax credits and regulatory policies.

Beyond policy changes that will result in higher emissions, the Trump administration has also moved to stop collecting and reporting a multitude of data on GHG emissions and climate change. Two of these data products in particular—the EPA’s annual GHG inventory and its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) for major emitting facilities—are integral inputs to our work. Typically, we would expect EPA to give the US its final GHG report card for 2025 in spring 2027. However, EPA only released the 2023 inventory earlier this year when compelled by a Freedom of Information Act request, and most of the work had already been completed under the Biden administration. Given the Trump administration’s hostility to collecting and reporting data related to climate change, we may not receive any further inventories under this administration.

The loss of this data means we are heading into murkier waters when it comes to understanding the second-largest emitter of GHGs in the world. While US emissions rose, 2025 was the second- or third-hottest year on record across the globe. Because emissions and their impacts persist even when the government does not count them, we will continue to adapt to this new landscape in order to inform critical US energy and climate policy debates.",https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/US-emissions-2025-1024x683.webp,N,,2026-01-13 14:58:37.521222

How OXCCU stands out in the sustainability space:

The UK startup is tackling the need to find alternative means of maintaining our standard of living without relying on fossil fuels, by using cutting-edge technology to make waste carbon usable.

OXCCU’s OX1 demonstration facility at London Oxford Airport has already logged 1,000 hours producing liquid fuel, with high conversion rates and excellent selectivity for SAF.

Following this success, the business secured £20.75m in Series B funding at the end of last year, to further scale its sustainable fuels and technologies.

Why is OXCCU’s technology revolutionary?

The team has developed a breakthrough single-step process that combines captured CO₂ with green hydrogen to create jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons.

Its patented iron catalyst converts CO₂ and CO directly into liquid hydrocarbons in a single reaction, avoiding intermediate steps and minimising byproducts. This translates into lower capital costs, lower operating costs, and more competitive prices for SAF.

What are OXCCU’s future goals?

OXCCU aims to produce 10,000 tonnes of SAF per year before 2030 (for context, a Boeing 787 transatlantic flight uses around 50 tonnes) while exploring applications beyond aviation in chemicals and plastics.

This could lower the environmental impact of fuel-guzzling industries.

From lab breakthroughs to commercial demonstrations, OXCCU is proving that waste carbon doesn’t have to be a problem; it can also be the solution.

OXCCU’s co-founder and CEO, Andrew Symes, says: “Being recognised in the Startups 100 Index reflects the momentum we’ve built this year.

Securing our 21M Series B funding, starting the build of our second demonstration plant OX2, and growing the team has given us strong foundations to move forward.

With strong investors alongside us, the focus now is on proving the technology at a larger scale and building the foundations for a pathway that can make a meaningful difference to future aviation fuel production.”

About DataM Intelligence DataM Intelligence is a renowned provider of market research, delivering deep insights through pricing analysis, market share breakdowns, and competitive intelligence.","AUSTIN, Texas and TOKYO, Jan. 13, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- According to DataM Intelligence, the global Algae-Based Biofuel Market reached USD 9,230.5 million in 2024 and is projected to grow to USD 19,161.1 million by 2032, expanding at a CAGR of 9.5% during the forecast period 2025–2032.

This sustained growth reflects a structural recalibration of global energy systems. As governments, airlines, and industrial sectors intensify decarbonization commitments, algae-based biofuels are emerging as one of the few scalable, non-food, high-yield renewable fuel pathways capable of supporting long-term energy transition goals.

By 2030, algae-derived fuels will no longer be positioned as experimental alternatives. They will be increasingly viewed as strategic fuels for aviation, marine transport, and hard-to-abate industrial segments, where electrification alone is insufficient.

Why Algae-Based Biofuels Are Gaining Strategic Relevance

The expansion of the algae-based biofuel market is driven by interlinked forces shaping global energy policy.

Energy security has re-emerged as a national priority. Volatility in fossil fuel supply chains and pricing has intensified interest in domestically producible renewable fuels. Algae can be cultivated on non-arable land using saline or wastewater, reducing dependence on imported energy resources.

Decarbonization pressure is accelerating in aviation and marine sectors. These industries face limited alternatives to liquid fuels. Algae-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel offer drop-in compatibility with existing engines and infrastructure, making them commercially viable transition fuels.

Advances in biotechnology and cultivation efficiency are improving economics. Progress in photobioreactor design, strain optimization, and downstream processing is steadily narrowing the cost gap between algae-based fuels and conventional biofuels.

Together, these dynamics position algae-based biofuels as a long-term pillar of renewable energy portfolios, rather than a niche bioenergy solution.

,,2026-01-13 15:02:56+00:00,Fastmarkets,"Europe faces rising SAF demand, slow supply growth after first mandate year: 2026 preview",Misha Simonovska,,,,,https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/europe-faces-rising-saf-demand-slow-supply-growth-after-first-mandate-year-2026-preview/,"With the first compliance year nearly complete, attention is turning to what 2026 may look like when obligations rise and if supply growth remains slow.
“With supply still limited and prices rising, at the end of 2024, we decided to secure SAF at a fixed-unit price,” the spokesperson said.
“The sharp increase in market prices between April and October 2025 proved that we made the right decision.” Spot prices mirrored the tight physical picture.
Feedstock constraints remain a bottleneck in 2026 However, feedstock constraints remain the most significant structural bottleneck heading into 2026, sources said.
“We expect SAF prices to continue to rise in 2026.","The year exposed a clear paradox: while physical availability remained limited for much of the second half of the year, keeping the CIF Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) prices high; the cost of production swung sharply, affected by the price of Dutch HBE (renewable fuel) credits, and at times moved into negative territory.

With the first compliance year nearly complete, attention is turning to what 2026 may look like when obligations rise and if supply growth remains slow.

The compliance picture for 2025 suggests the mandate was manageable but not without challenges. Supply was concentrated and was heavily reliant on a small number of producers, with limited prompt liquidity throughout the fourth quarter.

The UK’s second provisional dataset for 2025, covering supplies up to October 27, reported aviation fuel deliveries of 10 billion liters under the mandate, with SAF volumes reaching 163 million liters, or just under 1.63% of total supplies. All reported volumes were from conventional bio-based pathways, with no power-to-liquid production recorded.

The data broadly reflects what market participants said throughout the year – that Europe had enough material to meet the 2% requirement, but the market operated with very little flexibility.

Airlines also pointed to a system that worked, but required careful planning. A spokesperson for Wizz Air told Fastmarkets that compliance with the 2% mandate was met smoothly through fuel suppliers, although not all EU airports currently receive SAF.

“With supply still limited and prices rising, at the end of 2024, we decided to secure SAF at a fixed-unit price,” the spokesperson said. “The sharp increase in market prices between April and October 2025 proved that we made the right decision.”

Spot prices mirrored the tight physical picture. CIF ARA values were firmly supported through October and November, often heard at around $2,700-2,900 per tonne on the back of tight prompt supplies, limited feedstock availability and compliance-driven demand.

One producer told Fastmarkets that SPK was “very strong” throughout the fourth quarter. And a Chinese producer said it had no spot volumes available for sale, with all output committed to term clients, adding that it did not expect to offer material into Europe before February 2026.

Conditions shifted in early December, when price indications fell to around $2,270-2,340 per tonne. Market participants attributed this to a pause after peak compliance buying and slightly looser prompt availability, but stressed that overall liquidity remained thin.

Cost-of-production assessments, meanwhile, held within a narrow base range even as credit dynamics injected some volatility. From June to early December, Fastmarkets’ price assessment for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF max), base cost, exw Netherlands generally hovered around $2,040–2,150 per tonne, with feedstock and hydrogen movements influencing its weekly direction but not fundamentally altering levels.

The sharper shifts came from the credit side. Rising Dutch HBE IX-B values steadily pushed down credit-adjusted breakevens. Net values that sat above $500 per tonne in early July slipped below $200 per tonne in early September, turned negative in late October, with Fastmarkets’ price assessment for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF max), base cost, exw Netherlands (incl. HBE-IXB credits) falling as low as $(130) per tonne by December 5.

Feedstock constraints remain a bottleneck in 2026

However, feedstock constraints remain the most significant structural bottleneck heading into 2026, sources said.

Data from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) shows roughly 81% of SAF feedstock inputs in 2024 were used cooking oil (UCO), with animal fats making up most of the remainder. These streams are limited, import-dependent and exposed to competition from Asia.

Sources said UCO availability did not expand meaningfully in 2025 and that Europe’s reliance on imported material was likely to grow, with the lack of diversification into non-lipid pathways continuing to limit growth from existing European units.

On the supply side, production capacity expansion has been slower than required by the ReFuelEU trajectory. EASA estimates operational European SAF capacity at around 1.4 million tonnes per year. Announced projects could lift this to between roughly 3.6 and 5.2 million tonnes if delivered, but this will still be well below the approximate 9.6 million tonnes needed for the 6% mandate in 2030.

Several large projects were canceled or postponed in 2025, including developments linked to oil majors BP and Shell. Shell told Fastmarkets that the company would not be commenting on the cancellations.

Although producers such as Neste reported strong operational performance through 2025, including higher capacity utilization rates, the gains did not offset the wider lack of new supplies.

Demand continues to rise as blending requirements scale. ReFuelEU moves from 2% in 2025 toward 6% in 2030, while the UK mandate rises toward 10% by the end of the decade, driving structural demand growth already visible across the market.

Airlines are increasingly adjusting procurement strategies in response and Wizz Air said its SAF needs in 2025 were fully covered through term contracts, with no reliance on the spot market.

“We expect SAF prices to continue to rise in 2026. We’ve already been notified by some suppliers about increases for contracted volumes until the end of March 2026, and growing demand in the aviation industry will put further pressure on both the jet fuel and SAF markets,” the Wizz Air spokesperson said, citing feedstock constraints, higher UK mandates and new tariffs on non-EU SAF.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines told Fastmarkets that achieving the joint ambition of a 14% SAF blend in the Netherlands by 2030 would require alternative fuels to become more affordable and more widely available.

The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) latest outlook reinforces the widening gap between policy ambitions and production reality, however.

The association expects global SAF output to reach about 1.9 million tonnes in 2025 – double the 2024 level – but to grow only modestly to 2.4 million tonnes in 2026, equal to roughly 0.6% of global jet fuel consumption for 2025 and 0.8% for 2026.

IATA estimates that the SAF premium added around $3.6 billion to airline fuel costs in 2025, noting that production growth fell short of earlier expectations due to insufficient policy support.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,” IATA director general Willie Walsh said. He warned that mandates in their current form risk increasing costs without guaranteeing supplies.

IATA’s senior sustainability official Marie Owens Thomsen expressed similar concerns and said the regulators must adjust course to ensure long-term SAF viability and scale.

Owens said that, without stronger production incentives, costs will remain high, supply will lag and many of the same problems could emerge under the upcoming e-SAF mandates.

A spokesperson for the European Commission told Fastmarkets that the trade bloc remains on track for the 2030 target, but stressed that delivery of announced projects, faster permitting and feedstock diversification would be essential to meeting rising demand.

Europe’s first mandated year has demonstrated that policy can create demand. But as the market moves into 2026, the central questions remain: whether supply can scale in time, whether feedstock concentration will ease and whether policy frameworks can evolve to support investment without perpetuating volatility.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/uploads/2025/05/CORSIA-phase-1-1024x559.png,N,,2026-01-13 13:57:15.356171

The findings from our latest GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge offer both encouragement and a clear call to action for the year ahead. Engagement continues to rise as more companies commit to measuring and managing their travel emissions ─ yet we also see where progress is stalling, and where we must move faster.

Business travel remains a critical enabler of global collaboration and connection. But with growing expectations from employees, regulators, investors, and customers, it must evolve. Sustainability can no longer be viewed as a compliance exercise. It’s becoming a behavioural expectation, shaping travel programs, influencing procurement decisions, and increasingly defining what strong and strategic leadership looks like.

What the 2025 Acceleration Challenge tells us

With 285 companies participating in 2025, the benchmark shows incremental improvements: improved reporting practices, clearer emissions targets, and a rise in sustainable travel policies. More organisations are introducing carbon budgets, and smaller programs are stepping up, often using sustainability leadership to differentiate themselves.

But the data also reveals gaps. Tools that influence booking choices, such as carbon fees or sustainability nudges, have stalled in adoption. Supplier engagement remains inconsistent, and while some companies are integrating sustainability clauses into contracts or using GBTA’s Sustainable Procurement Standards, these practices are far from mainstream. And while Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is gaining momentum, overall adoption remains low despite its essential role in decarbonisation.

The simple truth is this: progress is happening, but not at the pace the industry needs.

What travel managers should prioritise now

There are several actions organisations can take immediately to drive meaningful impact and embrace their role in shaping a more sustainable business travel ecosystem.

1. Go back to basics

Policies and reporting remain foundational. Sustainable travel policies must be actionable, visible, and integrated into everyday decision-making. Emissions reporting should be accurate, timely, and shared widely to build internal accountability.

2. Actively influence traveller behaviour

Putting sustainability front of mind during booking is one of the most effective levers for change. Carbon displays, recommended options, or default settings that prioritise lower-carbon choices can shift behaviour at scale.

3. Step by step with SAF

SAF can feel complex and budgets are often tight, but even small investments create internal momentum. Our new SAF Corporate Connect hub supports travel managers on this journey, and the SAF Playbook offers a step-by-step guide for integrating SAF into corporate travel strategies.

4. Make sustainability part of the first conversation

Engage suppliers early. Introduce sustainability assessments, include sustainability commitments in contracts, and identify shared goals. Prioritising sustainable procurement strengthens the entire program and drives long-term impact.

5. Planning for longer-term impact

The next phase of sustainable business travel will require greater transformation. Companies must prepare for more robust carbon reporting requirements, ensure travel program structures align with corporate climate goals, and invest in long-term low-carbon solutions. Multimodal travel strategies and SAF procurement pathways are among the tangible steps that can support the acceleration of more sustainable practice.",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bigstock-Business-Growth-Success-Achiev-471025813-e1768313550880.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 10:58:31.334724

Facility aims to produce roughly 2,000 tons of CORSIA certified SAF annually with projected emissions reductions exceeding 70 percent

Total funding now exceeds $60 million with new strategic investors and regional leadership expansion

Sustainable fuels technology company Aether Fuels has raised $15 million in convertible note financing to accelerate development of its first commercial scale sustainable aviation fuel facility, a project that puts Singapore at the center of a fast evolving global market for low carbon aviation fuels.

Founded in 2022, Aether is developing liquid fuels aimed at decarbonizing aviation and maritime transport. Its proprietary Aurora technology converts a broad set of feedstocks including captured carbon dioxide, industrial waste gases, biogas, gasified municipal waste, and waste biomass into sustainable fuels that meet aviation specifications. For heavy transport and aviation, which lack cost-effective electrification pathways, liquid fuels remain an essential part of long-term decarbonization strategies.

Commercial Facility and Production Outlook

The new financing will support Project Beacon, a 50 barrel per day facility expected to produce roughly 2,000 tons of CORSIA certified sustainable aviation fuel each year. The company plans to convert industrial waste gas and biomethane into fuels that meet international sustainability criteria. Engineering is underway, with construction targeted for this year and commercial operations scheduled for 2028. Aether estimates greenhouse gas emissions reductions of more than 70 percent versus conventional jet fuel.

Singapore’s interest in the project intersects with its ambition to position the city-state as a regional hub for sustainable fuels, green maritime solutions, and carbon services. Regulatory developments around book-and-claim systems, emissions disclosure, and sustainable aviation pathways are advancing in parallel across Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States.

Financing and Investor Interest

The round included new investors Aster Ventures and EDBI, alongside participation from existing investors AP Ventures, Xora Innovation, CDP Venture Capital, TechEnergy Ventures, Foothill Ventures, Eni Next, and Chevron Technology Ventures. With the latest raise, Aether’s total funding exceeds $60 million.

Investor appetite for sustainable aviation fuels continues to grow as airlines, airports, and corporate travel programs prepare for tightening compliance mechanisms and rising demand for verifiable emissions reductions. SAF markets remain supply constrained, and projects with clear line of sight to commercial scale are viewed as strategically valuable.

Leadership and Execution Strategy

Alongside the financing, Aether announced several leadership appointments to advance execution and regional scale-up. Stu Stott, Global Vice President of Projects, will be based in Singapore with responsibility for commercial facility delivery. Mei Chia, who joined in 2023, will lead a planned Singapore research and development center expected to open in 2026. TC Goh will continue to lead business development across Southeast Asia.

Implications for Policy, Markets, and Climate

The policy environment for SAF is tightening as governments consider mandates, incentives, and credible carbon accounting structures. Demand is also influenced by CORSIA obligations, corporate Scope 3 targets, and voluntary aviation commitments, which are pushing airlines toward offtake agreements and long-term price hedging strategies. SAF developers must navigate feedstock availability, certification pathways, and infrastructure integration challenges while competing against fossil jet fuel on price.

For investors and corporates, Aether’s positioning reflects a broader shift from demonstration to early commercial deployment in hard-to-abate sectors. As Europe, the United States, and parts of Asia explore coordinated climate regulation for aviation, new projects in Singapore and Southeast Asia could reshape regional market geography and supply chains.

Sustainable fuels for aviation remain a central test for global net-zero strategies. If manufacturers can produce at commercial scale while meeting sustainability, cost, and certification requirements, SAF could become a foundational climate tool for aviation and logistics sectors that lack near-term electrification substitutes. The outcome carries global relevance given aviation’s projected emissions trajectory and the geopolitical competition to anchor emerging supply chains.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2026-01-13 11:12:20.310485

Stewart brings 30 years’ experience in commercialising breakthrough energy and low-carbon technologies, and scaling venture-backed companies across the US and the UK. As CEO, he will lead the growth of UK-based Nova Pangaea including development of the first commercial plant using its proprietary technology, as part of its mission to decarbonise aviation.

The company, which has developed a novel technology to produce carbon negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from waste biomass, is currently working with British Airways and LanzaJet on Project Speedbird, a government-supported collaboration to produce SAF in the UK.

Stewart joins from the New York-based investment bank Javelin Capital, where he advised on ‘green fuel’ opportunities. Originally from Texas, he previously held executive leadership roles with cleantech companies BayoTech and Concord Blue Energy in Los Angeles, and guided UK infrastructure owners on decarbonisation as a Senior Advisor to London-based Ikigai Energy. Across these ventures, his teams have successfully raised over £150m in equity and project capital for breakthrough energy technologies.

“Nova Pangaea has developed a truly differentiated platform to convert biomass into carbon negative sustainable fuels at scale,” said Stewart. “I’m excited to work with the team and our strategic partners to accelerate commercialisation, develop projects in the UK and globally, and build a world-class company, delivering both climate impact and long-term value.”

Gerald Koch, Chairman of the Board, added: “It’s great to have Stewart with his experience, network and personal energy on board to deliver the next important milestones in the technology and the first commercial-scale plant.”

Nova Pangaea’s innovative REFNOVA technology converts cellulosic biomass like forestry and agricultural residues into bioethanol, which can then be processed into SAF. The company operates a demonstration plant at its headquarters in Wilton International, a major manufacturing site in Tees Valley. It plans to deploy its technology at four production plants across the UK as part of Project Speedbird, as well as to license its technology internationally.

The company has raised over £21m to date from investors, including IAG, PXN Ventures, Mercia Ventures and the first Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund, in addition to grant funding of £7m.

The Rt Hon Anna Turley, MP for Redcar, welcomed the appointment. “Nova Pangaea Technologies is something we can be genuinely proud of here in Redcar & Cleveland,” said Turley. “It’s a forward-looking business doing important work on low-carbon technologies, including projects with real carbon-capture benefits, while creating skilled jobs and investment locally.

“Wilton is a hugely important site for our area and for the country. It has the infrastructure, skills, and industrial heritage needed to lead the next generation of cleaner industry, and companies like Nova Pangaea show exactly what that future can look like. I welcome the appointment of the new CEO and wish them every success as the company moves into its next chapter.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SAF-icon.png,N,,2026-01-13 10:58:47.825599

Sustainable fuels technology company Aether Fuels has raised $15 million in convertible note financing to accelerate development of its first commercial scale sustainable aviation fuel facility, a project that puts Singapore at the center of a fast evolving global market for low carbon aviation fuels.

Founded in 2022, Aether is developing liquid fuels aimed at decarbonizing aviation and maritime transport. Its proprietary Aurora technology converts a broad set of feedstocks including captured carbon dioxide, industrial waste gases, biogas, gasified municipal waste, and waste biomass into sustainable fuels that meet aviation specifications. For heavy transport and aviation, which lack cost-effective electrification pathways, liquid fuels remain an essential part of long-term decarbonization strategies.

Northeastern US power, gas prices increase amid cold snap What's happening?
Natural gas prices at Algonquin city-gates jumped to $18.76/MMBtu, driven by freezing temperatures that dramatically increased energy demand.","Europe imported record volumes of LNG from the US in 2025, with the fuel expected to remain key to the region's gas mix moving forward. In China, used cooking oil prices rebound.

1. Europe's gas market transformed by LNG imports

What's happening? Europe's LNG imports reached record levels in 2025, with the US being the leading supplier, accounting for over 77% of imports, according to S&P Global Energy CERA data. Price signals and regional competitiveness influenced cargo flows, while high regasification terminal utilization prompted traders to seek innovative, cost-effective routes, LNG traders based in Europe said. Oversupply widened the LNG-TTF spread, and the narrowing price gap with Asia encouraged more cargoes to remain in Europe. Northwest Europe averaged $11.423/MMBtu over 2025, up from $10.743/MMBtu over 2024, according to Platts data. The Platts DES Northwest Europe marker for February was assessed at $9.144/MMBtu Jan. 9. Platts is part of S&P Global Energy.

What's next? LNG will remain crucial to Europe's gas mix, with imports forecast to peak at 147.74 million metric tons in 2027, S&P Global Energy CERA data showed. Wider LNG-TTF spreads are expected in 2026, possibly prompting pipeline and storage traders to optimize supply, an LNG trader said. Europe's reliance on LNG will persist as the region continues to move away from Russian gas. Additional US supply will drive further changes in pricing and procurement strategies.

2. Simandou iron ore project unlikely to disrupt Pilbara market in 2026

What's happening? The Simandou iron ore project in Guinea is expected to have limited immediate impact on Australia's Pilbara iron ore market in 2026. Logistical constraints and a gradual production ramp-up will restrict the project's market entry, according to market participants who spoke to Platts. Shipments are expected at 15 million mt-20 million mt, and 2027 at 40 million-50 million mt, skewed to the lower end, following the first cargo's delay out of Morebaya. China's iron ore market has been in surplus since 2024 amid sluggish steel demand, even as prices held firm in 2025.

What's next? The immediate price impact looks limited in 2026 at 15 million mt-20 million mt, with CERA analysts expecting IODEX to average around $100/dmt, as Chinese pig iron output drops 1.5%-2% year over year. Oversupply risk rises from 2027 as Simandou ramps up, with CERA analysts seeing a potential 16% price decrease to around $89/dmt by December 2027. With all-in sustaining costs around $55-$60/dmt, some higher-cost seaborne and domestic ore could be pushed out of the market. Simandou's high grade iron ore is expected to be sold largely as mid-grade blends that directly substitute for Pilbara Blend and Vale 62%-63% fines, but for now, Pilbara ore will sustain its competitiveness in China's steel supply chain.

3. Northeastern US power, gas prices increase amid cold snap

What's happening? Power prices climbed into triple digits across the New England and New York Independent System Operators as 2025 ended, with Platts pricing Jan. 1 delivery at $165/MWh and $127.69/MWh, respectively. Natural gas prices at Algonquin city-gates jumped to $18.76/MMBtu, driven by freezing temperatures that dramatically increased energy demand. The extreme cold pushed ISO-NE's December 2025 peakload demand to an average of 17.50 GW, a 4.4% increase, while NYISO load rose 3.5% to 20.51 GW, highlighting the direct impact of winter weather on regional energy consumption.

What's next? Power prices stabilized through the first week of 2026, with ISO-NE and NYISO power trading near $82.50/MWh and $54/MWh by Jan. 8. The price correction followed warmer temperatures and the expiration of winter weather advisories from the US National Weather Service. The rapid market shifts underscore the critical role of weather patterns in shaping power market fundamentals, demonstrating how supply and demand can quickly respond to temperature fluctuations.

4. China's domestic used cooking oil market shows signs of recovery...

What's happening? China's domestic used cooking oil market is rebounding in early 2026 as producers increasingly supply feedstocks to local sustainable aviation fuel plants. On Jan. 9, Platts, assessed UCO prices at major Chinese ports: Tianjin Port at Yuan 7,000/mt, Nantong Port at Yuan 7,050/mt and Nansha Port at Yuan 7,050/mt. Weak export market demand, particularly from Europe, has pushed sellers to focus on domestic SAF plants, with Chinese SAF producers strategically pivoting to hydrotreated vegetable oil production, capitalizing on profitable margins despite antidumping duties. This strategic shift allows producers to maintain operations and cash flow while awaiting SAF whitelist approval.

What's next? Market activity is expected to pick up before the Lunar New Year, with domestic demand and HVO output likely to remain strong as the price spread between HVO and SAF widens, according to a Chinese UCO producer.

5. ...while RME gains premium over UCOME after Germany's RED III clarification

What's happening? Rapeseed methyl ester prices have traded above UCO methyl ester in ARA since Dec. 9, 2025, following Germany's Renewable Energy Directive III legislative clarification. The RME-UCOME spread widened to $54/mt Jan. 6, with Platts assessing FOB ARA RME at an $825/mt premium to ICE LSGO, up $24/mt from Dec. 9, 2025. The German Federal Cabinet's approval of RED III, which removes double-counting incentives for advanced biofuels starting in 2026, has renewed interest in first-generation biodiesel with high greenhouse gas savings.

What's next? Market participants anticipate continued price support for RME in the near term as a winter-spec fuel. In the lead-up to legislative changes, the market had anticipated that the removal of double-counting would create a bullish outlook for renewable diesel in 2026 and that demand for UCOME as a cost-effective alternative would consequently remain strong. With UCOME margins poor, key players are closely monitoring competition for used cooking oil feedstock across UCOME, renewable diesel and the sustainable aviation fuel markets.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-13 10:59:02.350698

The award honours businesses that demonstrate innovative and impactful sustainability practices.

The UK startup is tackling the need to find alternative means of maintaining the standard of living without relying on fossil fuels, by using technology to make waste carbon usable.

OXCCU’s OX1 demonstration facility at London Oxford Airport has already logged 1000 hours producing liquid fuel, with high conversion rates and excellent selectivity for SAF. Following this, the business secured £20.75 million in Series B funding at the end of 2025 to further scale its sustainable fuels and technologies.

The team has developed a single-step process that combines captured CO2 with green hydrogen to create jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons. Its patented iron catalyst converts CO2 and CO directly into liquid hydrocarbons in a single reaction, avoiding intermediate steps and minimising byproducts. This translates into lower capital costs, lower operating costs, and more competitive prices for SAF.

OXCCU aims to produce 10 000 tpy of SAF before 2030 (for context, a Boeing 787 transatlantic flight uses around 50 t) while exploring applications beyond aviation in chemicals and plastics.

OXCCU's co-founder and CEO, Andrew Symes, said: “Being recognised in the Startups 100 Index reflects the momentum we have built this year.

Cost an ongoing problem

Prices twice those of normal fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could force airline ticket prices up by as much as 40 percent, an industry expert has warned, with the greener alternative unlikely to match the cost of conventional jet fuel until around 2050.

The aviation sector accounts for 2.5 percent of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, and will require almost $3.2 trillion of investment to reach net zero by 2050, according to estimates from the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The net zero by 2050 target, derived from the 2015 UN Paris climate agreement, refers to the goal of balancing greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, with removals so total emissions fall to zero by mid-century.

SAF is central to that effort. The fuel can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent and is expected to deliver around 65 percent of the emissions reductions needed for the sector to meet its 2050 target, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The problem is cost. The International Air Transport Association says that SAF prices in 2025 were more than double those of conventional jet fuel, rising to as much as five times higher in markets where usage is mandated, such as the EU and the UK.

“In our view, the 2050 target is achievable and by that date we could have prices that are really affordable for airlines and operations,” said Mohamed Khalifa Rahma, director of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s air transport bureau, speaking on the sidelines of the annual International Renewable Energy Agency assembly in Abu Dhabi.

A global aviation decarbonisation framework agreed in Dubai in 2023 includes a target to cut industry emissions by 5 percent by 2030.

“We need to accelerate the production and deployment of SAF to meet this goal,” Rahma said.

The International Air Transport Association estimates that SAF output in 2025 would reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024, but still only 0.6 percent of total jet fuel consumption.

At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The Gulf is well-placed to soar on SAF – but not yet

Ahmed Badr, director of project facilitation and support at the International Renewable Energy Agency, said widespread use of SAF at current prices would translate directly into higher fares.

“Ticket prices would go up by around 40 percent,” he said. “It’s something people cannot afford.”

The UAE plans to supply its airlines with 1 percent domestically made SAF by 2031 and produce 700 million litres annually. Airlines Etihad Airways and Emirates, oil company Adnoc and several government entities formed a national consortium in 2023 to advance SAF development.

Emirates has begun receiving SAF from oil refiner Neste at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport and signed a deal with Shell in 2024 for deliveries into Dubai Airport. In November 2025, the carrier signed a partnership with oil company Enoc to explore joint SAF initiatives in Dubai.

“I think there is very little SAF around the world in any airport that we operate to today,” Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in an interview in November. “We are always going to be a buyer of SAF if it is available.”

The Emirates Airline chief said last year that passengers will ultimately determine whether the aviation industry can afford to go green, suggesting higher fares might result from environmentally friendlier fuel.

“If you want a certain product, then you have to pay for it,” he said at the Dubai Airshow in November when asked whether travellers would be willing to shoulder higher fares tied to sustainable energy.
