The potential scale-up of sustainable aviation fuels production capacity to meet global and EU policy targets.","As the world grapples with the urgent necessity to combat climate change, the aviation sector emerges as one of the most challenging industries to decarbonize. Air travel, responsible for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions, demands innovative solutions that can reconcile the soaring demand for mobility with the imperative to reduce carbon footprints. In this context, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) have garnered increasing attention as a critical lever to transform the future of flight. A groundbreaking study recently published in Nature Communications by Martulli, Brandt, Allroggen, and colleagues explores the unprecedented potential to massively scale up SAF production capacity to align with both global and European Union climate targets.

The research taps into technological advances, policy frameworks, and economic modeling to investigate pathways through which the production of SAFs could feasibly meet stringent emissions reduction goals laid out for the coming decades. Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude, SAFs are produced from renewable sources such as biomass, waste oils, and even synthetic pathways. These fuels offer the promise of dramatically reduced lifecycle carbon emissions—up to 80% less than conventional jet fuel—without necessitating major modifications to existing aircraft engines or infrastructure. However, scaling this industry remains an enormous challenge that intertwines supply chains, feedstock availability, technical hurdles, and regulatory complexities.

Core to the team’s analysis is a techno-economic assessment that incorporates current and projected capacities across various SAF production technologies. The study dissects the landscape into key segments: hydrotreating of vegetable oils and animal fats, pyrolysis and gasification of lignocellulosic biomass, power-to-liquid synthetic fuels utilizing green hydrogen, and emerging bioengineered pathways. By systematically evaluating resource constraints alongside production costs and energy balances, the researchers demonstrate that aggressive investments and policy support could elevate global SAF output to cover up to 50% of jet fuel demand by 2050.

One of the pivotal findings of the paper is the identification of biorefinery hubs optimized for regional feedstock availability, particularly in Europe. The EU’s policy environment, including the Renewable Energy Directive and the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, validates an optimistic scenario where sustainable aviation fuels are deeply embedded in the continent’s energy mix. The study emphasizes that regional cooperation and supply chain integration are instrumental in overcoming feedstock fragmentation—a significant bottleneck for large-scale SAF production. Furthermore, coupling SAF facilities with existing biofuel and chemical plants could create synergies that sharply reduce capital expenditures and operational risks.

Significantly, the research surfaces the critical role of advanced synthetic fuels, created via power-to-liquid routes that convert renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide into drop-in jet fuels. These fuels, though currently expensive and in early stages of commercialization, have the theoretical advantage of unlimited feedstock potential since they use atmospheric CO2 and green hydrogen derived from wind and solar power. By integrating synthetic SAFs into the broader fuel portfolio, the aviation sector could further decouple itself from biomass limitations and volatile feedstock markets.

The authors also stress the urgency of overcoming economic barriers to widespread SAF adoption. Although operating SAF plants at a massive scale can achieve economies of scale, the initial capital outlays and infrastructure development require robust policy incentives. Carbon pricing mechanisms, blending mandates, and investment subsidies are highlighted as crucial measures to make SAF competitive against conventional jet fuels, which historically benefit from well-established, subsidized fossil fuel supply chains. The forthcoming EU Green Deal and the global alignment under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals provide an enabling backdrop for these policy interventions.

From a lifecycle emissions perspective, the study provides a granular comparison of different production pathways, considering factors such as land use change, water consumption, and indirect emissions. This comprehensive approach is vital for ensuring that SAFs deliver the intended environmental benefits without unintended negative side effects. For example, fuels derived from feedstocks linked to deforestation or intensive agriculture can undermine the sustainability claims of SAFs. Hence, the research underscores stringent sustainability certification schemes as indispensable to maintaining environmental integrity.

An important dimension the study explores is the synergy between SAF production and circular economy principles. Utilizing waste residues from agriculture, forestry, and municipal sources not only offers abundant feedstocks without competing with food production but also mitigates waste disposal issues. Furthermore, by valorizing carbon-rich waste streams, SAF production can function as a carbon sink, contributing to negative emissions in integrated systems. This holistic view aligns with emerging broader climate strategies that encompass carbon management, resource efficiency, and resilient energy systems.

On the technological front, the paper spotlights innovation trends that could tilt the balance in favor of SAFs. Advances in catalytic processes, microorganism engineering, and process intensification hold the promise of improving yield efficiencies, reducing energy inputs, and driving down costs. The integration of digital tools, such as AI-driven process optimization and supply chain analytics, are anticipated to accelerate the maturity of SAF technologies. Furthermore, the research calls for intensified collaboration between academia, industry, and policymakers to fast-track R&D efforts focused on scalable, low-carbon aviation solutions.

A notable policy insight from the study is the balancing act between short-term implementations and long-term strategic visions. While drop-in fuels derived from conventional biomass feedstocks can kickstart SAF deployment today, they may be insufficient for meeting net-zero targets in the mid-century horizon. Therefore, a progressive trajectory that increasingly incorporates synthetic fuels and carbon capture technologies is advocated. This phased approach allows for leveraging existing industrial capacity while incrementally integrating novel technologies as they mature and become commercially viable.

The research also highlights the geopolitical implications surrounding SAF feedstock supply chains. Dependence on certain biomass resources can be geopolitically sensitive, potentially leading to supply insecurities or price volatility. Diversification strategies, including domestic feedstock production and international collaboration frameworks, emerge as critical considerations for building resilient SAF supply chains. European countries, in particular, may need to balance imports with boosting local biomass cultivation and waste utilization to secure sustainable supply while fostering rural economies.

Importantly, the study contextualizes SAFs within broader aviation decarbonization strategies. While SAFs promise significant carbon reductions, they alone cannot achieve the sector’s ambitious climate commitments. Complementary measures, such as aircraft efficiency improvements, operational optimizations, demand management, and the development of electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft for short-haul flights, must proceed in tandem. SAFs thus act as a vital bridge technology facilitating near-to medium-term emissions reductions while the next-generation aircraft technologies advance.

The authors conclude with a compelling narrative of opportunity and responsibility. Mobilizing the capital, political will, and technological creativity required to scale SAF production at a global level is daunting, but feasible. With coordinated action and transparent frameworks, the aviation industry can fundamentally transform its emissions trajectory, securing sustainable skies for future generations. This transformative potential resonates not only for climate mitigation but also for economic innovation, energy security, and environmental justice.

In summary, the groundbreaking analysis by Martulli and colleagues provides a comprehensive and optimistic roadmap for expanding sustainable aviation fuel production capacities aligned with international decarbonization ambitions. It highlights the intertwined roles of technology, policy, economics, and environmental stewardship in shaping the future of flight. As international efforts accelerate towards net-zero emissions, this seminal work crystallizes SAFs as an indispensable pillar in the global climate architecture—a beacon of hope and a call to action for stakeholders worldwide.

The aviation sector is responsible for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in the U.S., approximately 98% of aviation-related emissions result from jet fuel combustion.1,2 This highlights the critical role of fuel decarbonization strategies, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) being considered among the more feasible options available for reducing emissions from medium- to long-haul flights.3 Governments in the European Union (EU) and UK are pushing this transformation forward by setting mandates for the progressive use of aviation fuel originating from sustainable materials.4 For example, as of January 1, 2025, commercial flights taking off from EU airports must carry at least 2% of SAF in their tanks. By 2030, the mandate requires a minimum of 6% of SAF, including a 1.2% synthetic aviation fuel (eSAF) blend with conventional jet fuel.5 In addition, many airline members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have committed to a 10% reduction by 2030, aiming for net zero by 2050.6

The state of SAF. There are two primary categories of SAF: bio-SAF, derived from biomass and eSAF (also known as synthetic or power-to-liquid SAF), produced by combining green hydrogen (H₂) from water electrolysis with captured carbon dioxide (CO₂). These intermediates can be converted into hydrocarbons through several pathways, including Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, methanol-to-jet (MtJ) and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) processes. Each route upgrades intermediates into jet-range hydrocarbons through a series of catalytic steps, which may include oligomerization, hydrogenation and hydroprocessing to meet jet fuel specifications.7,8 When produced from waste-based feedstocks, SAF can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80%–90% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the production pathway.9

Today, SAF deployment faces investment barriers. Cost estimates indicate that SAF is 2─10 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and conversion technology used, largely due to high capital expenditure (CAPEX) for early-stage facilities, limited economies of scale and the expense of green H2 for eSAF pathways.10,11 While SAF is technically mature and scalable, achieving cost competitiveness will require coordinated investment, supportive policy and continued innovation across the value chain.12

Moreover, feedstock availability is limited. The Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) projects global SAF demand could reach 330 MM metric t (MMt)–450 MMt by 2050; however, production is only a fraction of this target.13 For example, Neste (an SAF producer) produces approximately 1.5 MMtpy,14 while Spanish energy company Moeve delivered 14,400 metric t of SAF in 2024 and aims to scale to 800,000 metric tpy by 2030 through a second-generation biofuels plant in Huelva, Spain.15 These figures underscore the scale-up challenge and the need for coordinated policy, investment and technology development to close the gap between capacity and future demand.

While there is a massive SAF market on the rise, the limited availability of waste-based feedstock makes it difficult to meet alternative fuel mandates with bio-based SAF alone. This opens the need for eSAF, made with green H2 and captured biogenic CO2, which is a byproduct of many industrial processes.

The European Union adopted the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation in October 2023 and the African Union adopted a Continental Strategy for SAF in February 2025. The European Union Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), which launched in November 2025, underscores the importance of an EU-Africa co-operation on SAF. Sustainable Aviation Fuels will be the main contributor to aviation decarbonisation, and its development will be a powerful economic catalyst driving the creation of new jobs and economic growth for developing states.

Current production levels of these fuels are still low and there is an urgent need for global action to accelerate the scale up in development, production and deployment of SAF and other cleaner energies, which are produced in a small number of states. Support for SAF and other cleaner energy projects in Africa could play a pivotal role in decentralization of such fuel production across the various regions in Africa, providing an opportunity to participate across the value chain, from feedstock to fuel production and use, therefore achieving common EU and AU objectives in the most efficient way.

In this context, “supporting the development, production and use of SAF in Africa, Latin America/Caribbean and Asia-Pacific” has been designated as a Global Gateway flagship initiative, identifying SAF as a critical priority.

A coordinated and coherent effort by “Team Europe”[1] could help ensure a transformative impact. This is also fully reflected in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan adopted by the European Commission on November 4th 2025, which recognizes that mutually beneficial international partnerships remain critical to enhance access to markets, helping to secure imports of renewable and low-carbon fuels and feedstock materials, while facilitating the import/export of clean tech in line with the recently adopted ‘Global Europe’ regulation proposal.

The EIB and the EBRD, as Team Europe members, as well as the African Development Bank as a MDB focused on Africa, welcome the opportunity to collaborate with the European Commission and with partner institutions, such as AU and the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), to explore pathways for scaling up development, production and deployment of SAF and other cleaner energies in Africa.

Recognizing a concerted effort involving significant investment, enabling policy and regulatory frameworks and robust technical expertise required to achieve the long-term global aspirational goal, and in light of each MDBs respective mandate and complementarity, the signatories to this statement signal their ambition to:

LanzaJet, a leading next-generation fuels technology and production company, announced that it has achieved the world’s first full-plant production of alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as well as the first non-oil-based alternative fuel solution compatible with today’s aircraft.

“DOE is proud to be a part of this historic milestone, which reinforces America’s leadership in innovative transportation technologies,” said Assistant Secretary of Energy (EERE) Audrey Robertson. “Achieving the goal of affordable, domestically produced SAF will create more export opportunities and fuel choices, while supporting American farmers and bolstering our energy independence.”

Supported by BETO since 2016, LanzaJet is not only accelerating the SAF industry with its breakthrough technology, but also helping to revitalize and promote investment in rural America. Its Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, has generated $70 million in new economic activity, employed more than 300 people during construction, and created more than 65 direct and indirect jobs during ongoing operations.

LanzaJet’s production breakthrough will help advance this innovative technology from lab to market, support the aviation industry, and stimulate domestic economic growth. Read more about LanzaJet’s commercialization of its ATJ technology.

The government expects that an application for development consent for a Northwest Runway at Heathrow Airport will be brought forward by the promoter of the scheme, the airport operator, Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL), after the review of the Airports National Policy Statement.","A third runway at Heathrow is another step closer to take off by 2035, as the Transport Secretary confirms today (25 November 2025) that Heathrow Airport Limited’s (HAL’s) proposal will be used as the scheme to progress the project.

The proposal will shape the review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which is the framework within which the planning decision on expansion at the airport will be made, and any amendments to the ANPS will be subject to consultation next summer.

As the UK’s only hub airport, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country, expanding Heathrow will attract international investment, boost Britain’s connectivity, and support economic growth to deliver the Plan for Change. This summer a record 23.4 million passengers travelled via Heathrow, highlighting the level of passenger demand.

After requesting further information last month from the remaining two promoters, the government has assessed that HAL’s proposal offers the most deliverable option and provides the greatest likelihood of meeting the government’s ambition for a decision on a development consent application within this parliament.

Any amendments to the ANPS will be consulted on next summer after the Transport Secretary committed to completing the process 3 years faster than production of the policy statement in 2018. This will provide an important opportunity for businesses, communities, and the wider aviation sector to have their say.

Selection of the scheme to inform the remainder of the review does not represent a final decision on a third runway scheme or design, and any amendments to the ANPS will be subject to consultation and parliamentary scrutiny next year. Exact details such as the length of the third runway, layout, and associated infrastructure implications will continue to be considered throughout the remainder of the ANPS review.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander said:

Heathrow is our only hub airport which supports trade, tourism and hundreds of thousands of jobs, underpinning prosperity not only in the South East but across the UK.

Today is another important step to enable a third runway and build on these benefits, setting the direction for the remainder of our work to get the policy framework in place for airport expansion. This will allow a decision on a third runway plan this parliament which meets our key tests including on the environment and economic growth.

We’re acting swiftly and decisively to get this project off the ground so we can realise its transformational potential for passengers, businesses, and our economy sooner.

The government has been clear expansion plans must meet the UK’s legally binding climate obligations alongside balancing delivering economic growth as well as air quality and noise obligations.

The independent Climate Change Committee will be consulted on as part of the review to ensure expansion is consistent with the net zero framework. Today the Transport Secretary has written to the committee requesting advice including on the role of aviation in achieving the UK’s carbon budgets and inviting feedback on proposed updates to the ANPS to ensure alignment with climate commitments.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

We’re taking action where previous governments hesitated, and moving forward with Heathrow’s third runway to drive economic growth, international investment and better connections for our country.

That means opening the door to new growth and opportunity with Heathrow expansion – creating over 100,000 jobs, boosting our economy, and giving businesses and communities the certainty they need to thrive.

A swift and robust review of the ANPS was launched last month to consider airport expansion in light of new environmental and climate obligations and sets out the government’s criteria to consider future planning applications.

The selection of HAL’s scheme at this stage follows a rigorous assessment of the promoter’s proposals. This has determined that HAL’s proposal includes expansion plans that are resilient and efficient.

The government expects that an application for development consent for a Northwest Runway at Heathrow Airport will be brought forward by the promoter of the scheme, the airport operator, Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL), after the review of the Airports National Policy Statement.

The government is also pressing ahead with modernising airspace across the UK, to deliver quicker, quieter, and more efficient flights with lower emissions, reducing the sector’s climate change impacts.

The newly published Airspace Design Strategic Objectives will mean that the Greater London airspace block will be given priority in airspace modernisation processes. London’s airspace – which sees over 1.1 million takes offs and landings a year – will be redrawn to ensure the capital’s skies are ready for more departures from a third runway from 2035. This will also benefit passengers after record levels of people flying over the summer, by shortening flight routes and improving resilience in the sector.

A consultation has also been launched on simplifying the Air Navigation Guidance to set clear priorities, save carbon emissions, and ensure that people continue to have a meaningful say on airspace changes that affect them.

Today’s milestone follows the approval of Luton expansion earlier this year and Gatwick expansion last month, as the government continues to back aviation projects that will grow the economy and provide highly skilled jobs.

The government is backing the development of green aviation through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill. This bill will ensure Heathrow contributes to the UK meeting its climate targets by providing economic security for the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market by guaranteeing a set price per unit for UK producers.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-25 10:57:00.597804

At the same time, the entire industry is closely watching what the Senate will decide regarding free carry-on and checked baggage on flights in Brazil.

In the third quarter, the three airlines expanded seat capacity while maintaining strong load factors. The favorable supply scenario led to an increase in the average yield (the price paid per passenger to fly one kilometer) across the board. On average, the indicator rose 4.78%, to $0.089.

According to data from the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), Brazilian domestic aviation reached the mark of 9 million passengers transported in October, up 9.1% year over year. The result sets a record for the month since official records began in 2000. ANAC noted that October’s volume was so strong that it became the fourth-largest monthly total ever recorded in the country—behind only January 2015 and January 2020, both with 9.3 million passengers, and July 2025, also with 9 million travelers.

Latam is currently the market leader, with about 40% of domestic demand in Brazil. The company closed the third quarter with net earnings of $379 million, a 25.8% increase year over year, supported by higher demand as well as fuel that was 11% cheaper. Revenue rose 17.3% to $3.85 billion. Brazil, considering both domestic and international operations, accounts for roughly 50% of the Latam group as a whole.

Carinata cleared for aviation fuel production

Given the third-quarter results and prospects for the final three months of the year, Latam raised its EBITDAR guidance (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or lease costs) from $3.65 billion–$3.85 billion to $4 billion–$4.1 billion.

With strong demand, Latam’s leadership announced new routes for next year. The company expects to operate in 63 domestic destinations in Brazil, compared with 59 today.

Latam Brasil CEO Jerome Cadier said there is room for further growth, noting that the group expects to receive at least 12 Embraer E2 aircraft next year. The routes to be operated with the Brazilian manufacturer’s model should be announced in early 2026.

Another company pushing to expand its flight offering in Brazil is Gol. After completing its Chapter 11 restructuring in the United States, the airline managed to return aircraft to service that had been grounded due to a lack of funds for maintenance. As a result, the company reached an average operational fleet of 119 aircraft in the third quarter, 13 more than in the same period last year.

With more aircraft available, the company transported 8.8 million passengers, up 10.7%. Revenue totaled R$5.5 billion, an 11.6% increase.

The completion of the restructuring led Gol’s debt to fall 21.6%, to R$19.6 billion. Less leveraged, the airline posted net income of R$248 million in the quarter, reversing losses of R$1.42 billion a year earlier.

Azul, which is also undergoing a Chapter 11 process, likewise saw significant gains in its operation. The company closed the quarter with net revenue of R$5.7 billion, up 11.8% year over year.

With its debt weighing on the balance sheet, however, Azul ended the quarter with a net loss of R$1.37 billion, reversing the R$121 million profit recorded a year earlier. The company’s financial result was a negative R$1.9 billion, a 200% increase in losses compared with the same period last year, which contributed to the red ink on the bottom line.

Beyond demand trends, the industry is now closely following discussions in Congress regarding baggage regulations for flights.

On October 28, the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House) approved a bill that prohibits the sale of tickets without a carry-on baggage allowance in Brazil’s domestic market. The opinion from the bill’s rapporteur, Congressman Neto Carletto, mandates free transport of carry-on bags and personal items weighing up to 12 kg on flights.

Lawmakers also approved an amendment reinstating free checked bags of up to 23 kg on both domestic and international flights. The free allowance had been suspended in 2017 and reaffirmed in 2021. The issue is sensitive for the sector, which is awaiting the bill’s next steps in the Senate.

Meanwhile, one opportunity on the horizon is a credit line backed by the National Civil Aviation Fund (FNAC). A total of R$4 billion from the fund will be made available for loans across six financing lines that range from purchasing Brazilian-made aircraft to acquiring domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

However, airlines argue that under the current terms, the credit line would be impossible for them to access, as they would not meet the requirements set by the government.

In a recent interview with Valor, ANAC president Tiago Faierstein acknowledged that the current rules may limit the industry’s interest. He noted that discussions are underway between the government and airlines to adjust the conditions.",http://s.glbimg.com/en/ho/static/globocom2012/img/fb_marca.png,N,,2025-11-25 12:56:39.337180

Hydrogen is more than a fuel - it’s a strategic energy vector that can decarbonize industries, power transport, and stabilize grids.
Its potential to store energy long-term and enable sustainable fuels like ammonia and aviation fuel makes could make it a key component of the clean energy future.","The physical and net zero characteristics of hydrogen are long-established but figuring out long term use cases, particularly at scale, is the real challenge. Globally, there is huge appetite in many countries and sectors for hydrogen production and development of hydrogen derivatives, such as sustainable aviation fuel and ammonia.

However, the sector suffers from constant and frequently exaggerated comparisons to other energy sectors - including fossil based and clean energy sources. To date, most global sources of energy have benefitted from historic subsidies and, for example, socialised infrastructure costs such as transportation and shipping.

Although the sector is still in its infancy, and nobody disputes the very real physical challenges to large scale deployment, the appetite to develop and integrate coherent national and international use cases for hydrogen is accelerating. This is underpinned by its potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors, enable long-term energy storage and create new industrial opportunities.

As governments and businesses race toward net-zero targets, hydrogen offers a versatile solution that could reshape energy systems for decades to come.

Ireland’s Hydrogen Strategy, published in 2023, and the EU’s broader policy framework, including RePowerEU and the Fit for 55 package, both reflect ambitious goals to integrate hydrogen into core energy policy.

Potential applications across sectors

Industrial Decarbonisation

Heavy industries that are difficult to electrify such as steel, cement, and chemicals account for a significant share of global emissions. Hydrogen can replace coal and natural gas in these applications, enabling deep decarbonization without compromising productivity.

Transport and Mobility

Hydrogen fuel cells are gaining traction in heavy-duty transport; trucks, buses, trains, and ships, where battery solutions face limitations in range and weight. Hydrogen-derived synthetic fuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are being developed to reduce emissions in long-haul flights.

Power Generation and Grid Stability

Hydrogen can be used in gas turbines or fuel cells to generate electricity, providing flexible backup power for grids dominated by intermittent renewables.

Data Centres

Data centres account for a significant and growing share of national electricity demand. As a clean, dispatchable energy source, hydrogen can help power data centres while reducing reliance on fossil fuels and easing grid congestion.

Ammonia and Global Trade

Green hydrogen enables low-carbon ammonia production, essential for fertilizers and used as a hydrogen carrier for international transport.

Benefits and Opportunities

Long-Term Storage

One of hydrogen’s most compelling advantages is its ability to store large amounts of energy for extended periods, something batteries arguably cannot achieve economically at scale. Seasonal storage of hydrogen can help balance renewable generation.

Market Momentum

Although hydrogen is still in its early stages, the pace of development is significant:

Global hydrogen projects have surged in recent years, with billions committed to infrastructure and technology.

Governments are introducing subsidies, tax credits, and mandates to accelerate adoption.

Regions with abundant renewable resources, such as the Middle East, Australia, and parts of Europe, are positioning themselves as future hydrogen exporters.

Challenges Ahead

Despite its promise, hydrogen faces hurdles: high production costs, limited infrastructure, and uncertain demand.

Domestically and internationally, the hydrogen sector today mirrors the development of renewables generally in the past, nascent and full of promise yet clear hurdles that need to be overcome.

Crucially, at this stage, there is a far higher acceptance of the core role the energy transition now plays in the Irish economy , particularly across power generation, security and resilience of supply.

Hydrogen is more than a fuel - it’s a strategic energy vector that can decarbonize industries, power transport, and stabilize grids. Its potential to store energy long-term and enable sustainable fuels like ammonia and aviation fuel makes could make it a key component of the clean energy future.

While challenges remain, the growth in projects and investment signals that hydrogen is moving from concept to reality.",https://www.pinsentmasons.com/-/media/images/seo-social-media/editorial-use-only/energy/gettyimages-112635374_digital---seosocialeditorial-image.jpg?rev=7bacb2907bb543c49992dbe6a322cded,N,,2025-11-25 10:57:04.790436

Bell 505 achieves SAF milestone with 700 flight hours

Bell Textron announced at European Rotors 2025 that a single, dedicated Bell 505 has now exceeded 700 flight hours using blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This achievement marks a significant step forward in Bell’s wider sustainability drive and underscores the company’s commitment to accelerating SAF adoption across its flight operations.

Robin Wendling, Managing Director for Europe at Bell, said the milestone reinforces the industry’s broader carbon reduction goals. He noted that Bell’s collaboration with Safran Helicopter Engines has provided a vital advantage in testing and advancing greener aviation technologies.

The partnership began in March 2022, when Bell and Safran Helicopter Engines launched a joint initiative to study the technical performance and economic impact of SAF in the Bell 505, powered by the Arrius 2R engine. Less than a year later, the Bell 505 became the first single-engine helicopter to complete a demonstration flight operating on 100% SAF. Since July 2022, Bell has logged more than 700 flight hours using blended SAF on a single Bell 505 at the Bell Training Academy. Evaluations covering engine operability, aircraft performance, and detailed engine inspections have all delivered strong, positive results.

Jean-François Sauer, Safran Helicopter Engines, EVP Programs, commented, “We are particularly pleased with these SAF flights in partnership with Bell. SAF is key towards more sustainable helicopter use. The Arrius 2R, like all our engines, are currently able to operate with up to 50% drop-in SAF. Very soon, our engines will be capable of 100% drop-in SAF, paving the way for wider use of this type of fuel for increased sustainability of helicopter operations.”

The Bell 505 remains one of the most advanced platforms in its category, combining the Safran Arrius 2R engine with dual-channel FADEC and the Garmin G1000H NXi all-glass avionics suite, complete with moving map display. Its panoramic windows, open cabin design, and Synthetic Vision technology make it a versatile five-seat aircraft suited to public safety, utility work, and military training.

While Australia and China are positioned as potential production powerhouses due to their vast renewable resources and industrial CO2 sources, other key economies face significant infrastructure and resource hurdles.
Renewable electricity: Australia and China lead the way with exceptional solar and wind potential, although renewable electricity demand is rising rapidly.
Most APAC economies remain coal-dependent, limiting near-term renewable surplus for PtX production.
CO2 sources: Industrial CO2 is abundant in China and India, but direct air capture technology remains pre-commercial and prohibitively expensive.","Australia and China hold the strongest industrial and renewable energy foundations to drive the Asia-Pacific's transition to Power-to-X aviation fuels. However, the broader region remains hamstrung by ""uneven readiness"" and policy fragmentation, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials said Nov. 24 in a report.

In its first integrated assessment of the region, titled ""PtX and Sustainable Aviation: A Roadmap for Asia-Pacific,"" the RSB identified a distinct divide in the region's capacity to scale Power-to-Liquids and Power-and-Biomass-to-Liquids fuels.

While Australia and China are positioned as potential production powerhouses due to their vast renewable resources and industrial CO2 sources, other key economies face significant infrastructure and resource hurdles.

Divergent regional roles

The report categorizes the APAC market into distinct clusters, highlighting that no single country currently meets all enabling conditions for rapid deployment.

""Australia and China hold the strongest industrial and energy foundations,"" the RSB said, pointing to Australia's developing coastal hydrogen hubs and China's massive renewable generation capacity as critical assets for the sector.

Advanced economies such as Japan, South Korea, and Singapore were identified as leaders in governance, technology, and trading infrastructure; however, the report warned that they face explicit ""geographic and infrastructure constraints"" regarding raw materials.

Emerging economies such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand offer significant potential for biomass feedstock; however, they are currently limited by water stress, land-use pressures, and fragmented policy landscapes.

Barriers to scale

The RSB warned that the region's diversity creates both opportunities and structural risks. The road map outlined six ""interlinked structural challenges"" preventing PtX from scaling beyond niche projects: policy inconsistency, infrastructure gaps, financing and risk, inconsistent certification systems, and limited stakeholder capacity outside of major industrial economies.

No single country in the APAC region can independently cover all critical dimensions for PtX fuel scale-up, including renewable power, CO2 sources, feedstock supply, industrial capacity, and governance alignment.

Renewable electricity: Australia and China lead the way with exceptional solar and wind potential, although renewable electricity demand is rising rapidly. Most APAC economies remain coal-dependent, limiting near-term renewable surplus for PtX production.

Green hydrogen: Demand for hydrogen offtake agreements is concentrated in Japan, South Korea, and Australia, with China scaling rapidly but lagging in export frameworks. India is emerging as a significant producer of hydrogen, but it faces water stress constraints.

Biomass residues: India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand offer vast potential for agricultural residues — such as rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, palm, and forestry residues — yet their supply chains remain fragmented, and deforestation risks necessitate strict sustainability safeguards.

CO2 sources: Industrial CO2 is abundant in China and India, but direct air capture technology remains pre-commercial and prohibitively expensive. The road map warns that reliance on fossil-derived CO2 poses a ""transition risk"" and undermines the credibility of PtX.

Technology readiness levels:

PtL and PBtL pathways remain at pilot or early-demonstration stage. Current cost estimates are $3,800-8,600/metric tons versus $600-900/mt for fossil jet fuel, a gap wider than HEFA-SAF. The road map projects cost competitiveness only after 2040, as renewable electricity prices decline.

PtL-FT (Power-to-Liquids via Fischer-Tropsch): ASTM D7566 approved, TRL 6-7 (pilot-to-demo)

PBtL-GFT (Power-and-Biomass-to-Liquids): ASTM approved, TRL 6-7 (pilot-to-demo)

PtL-MtJ (Power-to-Methanol-to-Jet): Not yet approved, TRL 5-6 (demo stage)

PBtL-MtJ (Biomass-to-Methanol-to-Jet): Not approved, TRL 5-6 (demo stage)

Strategic road map

To bridge the readiness gap, the RSB called for coordinated regional cooperation rather than isolated national strategies. The road map suggests connecting the resource-rich ""opportunity clusters"" —such as Australia's hydrogen hubs and India's feedstock bases — with the technology and finance centers in Singapore, Japan, and South Korea.

Key recommendations for the next decade include aligning certification systems to facilitate cross-border trade, developing shared infrastructure corridors, and integrating future aviation demand into national renewable energy planning.

""The coming decade will determine whether PtX fuels become a niche innovation or a cornerstone of aviation decarbonization in APAC,"" the report concluded.

Direct SAF blending mandates remain scarce across the APAC region. Only Singapore and South Korea have enacted binding SAF mandates (Singapore: 1% by 2026, rising to 3-5% by 2030; South Korea: 1% from 2027). Japan is consulting on a 10% target by 2030, while China's binding timeline remains undefined.

Drop-in sustainable aviation fuel is one of the few scalable pathways to reduce emissions in an industry where electrification and alternative energy carriers are extraordinarily difficult,” Werner says.
This year in Georgia, LanzaJet became the first to commercially produce jet fuel from ethanol.","The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market is expected to reach nearly $66 billion by 2030 and soar to $655 billion by 2050, and jet fuel tech developers are latching on to waste as feedstock to meet demand. The first innovators have focused largely on agricultural byproducts, but there isn’t enough of the material to satiate airlines’ appetites as they commit to net-zero carbon by 2050. So, some developers are beginning to look at biogas from landfills, wastewater treatment plants, and dairy manure.

The University of Sydney developed a plasma technology to convert landfill gas into SAF. Syzygy Plasmonics says its system can also make SAF from landfill and wastewater biogas, among waste stream byproducts. Now, startup Circularity Fuels is working to make a go in this nascent but growing niche. The Redwood, California, company is beginning with dairy manure.

It seemed like a good pathway due to California’s low carbon-fuel standards (LCFS) incentive program, says Stephen Beaton, a jet fuel scientist turned entrepreneur who launched Circularity Fuels in 2023.

“By converting that gas, we're displacing fossil fuel. But we are also preventing the venting of methane through the atmosphere. So, we get more subsidies and incentives for the fuel,” he says.

Beaton believes SAF can open a lot more opportunities for the renewable natural gas (RNG) industry at a time when existing markets, mainly fuel for bus and truck fleet operators, are becoming increasingly saturated. Some developers are having a harder time getting their products into the few states that dole out incentives for RNG as transportation fuel.

“We can take advantage of many of the same subsidies, credits, and corporate programs by producing fuel for aviation in a market that is almost infinitely scalable,” Beaton says.

Still, there is more biogas worldwide than all the fuel-hungry airlines combined require. So the feedstock exists. The key to scaling is more a matter of developing technology and equipment that are affordable to deploy, which takes time.

In an earlier day, Beaton worked on novel fuels for the Air Force, then at the Pentagon, standing up the Air Force's synthetic aviation program. He has since spent years trying to figure out how to make jet fuel at scale and cheaper than has been done to date. Something a little different about Circularity’s model is that the company owns both primary steps of the process that follow anaerobic digestion: making the fuel precursor, syngas, then converting that syngas into jet fuel.

Verticalizing the technology stack to be able to perform the whole process in-house is generating cost and energy efficiencies, as is the technology itself. The system, which uses a modified automotive catalytic converter, is more compact and cheaper to run than traditional methane reforming equipment. Not having to filter out the carbon dioxide (CO2) from the waste stream helps.

“We actually use the CO2 in the process, which allows us to make more syngas per unit of biogas. And by combining the methane and CO2, the syngas is naturally at the ratio required for liquid fuel production [bypassing additional steps],” Beaton says.

While Beaton focuses on finetuning the first on-farm demo, he is thinking ahead, talking with landfills, feedlots, and wastewater treatment plants as well as biogas and RNG developers who are looking for outlets for their gas. On the offtake side, the young company so far has nondisclosure agreements with about half a dozen airlines. Optimizing is a slow-going process as there are some fundamental but complex principles to prove out.

Today’s pilot produces about a gallon of jet fuel a day. The plan is to scale to 100 million gallons per year by the mid-2030s. That would fuel roughly 10,000 transatlantic flights – about 35 million miles of long-haul air travel, Beaton says. So far, he and his team have secured about $9.5 million in seed funding and grants from venture capital firms, the National Science Foundation, California Energy Commission, and others.

The primary funder, DCVC, brought the startup into its entrepreneur-in-residence program, which backs “deep tech” developers aiming to transform underused or low-grade resources into valued products at scale. Producing fuels from waste fits squarely with that focus, says Milo Werner, a partner at DCVC focused on climate.

“Aviation is a natural priority because it is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Drop-in sustainable aviation fuel is one of the few scalable pathways to reduce emissions in an industry where electrification and alternative energy carriers are extraordinarily difficult,” Werner says.

What stood out about Beaton and his team is that they found a way to avoid costly pre-treatment steps and infrastructure barriers that limit traditional reforming technologies (there is no need for a connection to a pipeline).

“Their approach has potential to bring down the cost of SAF production by an order of magnitude. That combination of technical advantage, cost disruption, and applicability to a hard-to-abate sector made Circularity a compelling investment,” Werner says.

Countries around the world are providing incentives and/or implementing SAF mandates to take these emerging technologies further. And these policies are driving demand. Commercial airlines are leaning in to figure out how to secure SAF years in advance of production. Right now, what product is available to them comes with sticker shock. Compared to the roughly $2.50 per gallon cost of traditional jet diesel, airlines pay $7 or $8 per gallon for clean fuels. Renewables that do not come from crop waste, and therefore don’t compete with food production, cost more. Making it more affordable is a work in progress.

Other issues are tough competition for the more widely used feedstocks (ag byproducts) and the availability of energy as companies compete for this resource too. Then there is regulatory uncertainty, particularly in the U.S., where the landscape has shifted.

While the Inflation Reduction Act created a $1.75 a gallon credit for SAF, that figure recently dropped to $1 per gallon. Now several members of Congress have introduced bills aiming to bolster incentives. Airlines can still tap into RINS credits through the U.S. EPA. Though key programs once offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture have stalled, with uncertainty over whether they will reopen.

But slowly, a few domestic SAF projects are coming online and scaling up, with a handful more slated to launch soon. This year in Georgia, LanzaJet became the first to commercially produce jet fuel from ethanol. In Texas, Diamond Green Diesel is making SAF from used cooking oil and animal byproducts; with an annual capacity of 70 million tons, the corporation is reportedly the world’s largest producer of waste-based jet fuel.

But airlines will need 500 million tons of SAF a year to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association. As far as Beaton’s contribution, admittedly, he says, if he meets his aspired targets, he alone will only make a dent. Though he is an optimist. He sees potential for healthy growth ahead in a budding industry.

“California scaled quickly from a very small percentage of compressed natural gas to essentially having 100% of vehicles run on biogas today. We think that scale can exist [for SAF].”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt4a147f9e36f0754a/blt88dcb6ad44d503e5/69248db04df136c21f6aaf99/jet_fuel_2_1540.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-25 08:56:38.204099

The collaboration aims to explore pathways for developing economically feasible SAF production and supply infrastructure in Dubai, with ENOC evaluating its potential contribution to local production. A joint steering committee will guide the evaluation.

As a safe and fully certified drop-in fuel compatible with existing aircraft fleet and airport infrastructure, SAF can be blended with conventional jet fuel at a ratio of up to 50%, creating an aviation fuel that is significantly lower in lifecycle carbon emissions. In its neat form, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.*

Emirates is actively engaged in advancing the UAE's sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem through membership in the Technical Group under the Aviation Fuels Executive Committee, convened by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, and the Dubai Biofuels, Hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel Committee, established by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy.

The airline has contributed to the UAE's General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which aims to transform the UAE into a regional hub for alternative aviation fuels with production targets of 700 million litres by 2030. Additionally, Emirates and the UAE GCAA have played key roles in developing the UAE's power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels roadmap, driven by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure and the World Economic Forum.

Emirates also spearheaded SAF demonstration flights on its Boeing 777 and A380 aircraft. In January 2023, the airline operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100% SAF in one engine, and in November 2023 conducted the first A380 demonstration flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its four engines. That same month, Emirates operated flights with sustainable aviation fuel from Dubai International Airport using 315,000 gallons of blended SAF integrated into the airport’s fuel infrastructure.

Under the partnership, Landmark Group will adopt DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme to reduce Scope 3 emissions across its international shipments using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The Group operates more than 2,200 retail stores across 21 countries and employs over 50,000 people, giving the agreement wide regional impact.

GoGreen Plus shifts away from traditional carbon-offsetting models by replacing fossil-based jet fuel with SAF produced from renewable feedstocks.

Each tonne of SAF used can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, with reductions independently verified and certified by SGS for full accountability.

SAF deployment brings measurable reductions

The agreement was formalised in Dubai by Mahmoud Haj Hussein, Country Manager of DHL Express UAE, and Rajesh Garg, Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer at Landmark Group.

Haj Hussein said that “DHL has committed to investing €7 billion globally in climate-neutral logistics by 2030, and partnerships like this demonstrate how we’re translating that ambition into measurable action,”

Adding, “Landmark Group’s decision to adopt GoGreen Plus reflects how progressive enterprises are keen on moving the industry toward a net-zero future.”

Garg said the partnership embeds sustainability deeper into the Group’s regional logistics footprint. “Our partnership with DHL marks an important step in reducing our Scope 3 emissions and advancing our decarbonisation goals through credible solutions like Sustainable Aviation Fuel.”

Beyond sustainability, Subhas urged governments to take a more active role in strengthening the region’s aviation supply chain.","The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) has described Singapore’s upcoming sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy as an important push to encourage greater production and use of cleaner fuels in aviation, reports New Straits Times.

AAPA director general Subhas Menon said the levy is designed to motivate action, noting that travellers often express support for sustainability but do not always follow through.

He said many passengers claim they are willing to contribute to sustainability efforts, including supporting SAF, but often “words and actions do not match,” and the levy acts as the needed reminder.

According to him, most travellers are unlikely to object to paying between S$1 and S$41—depending on destination and travel class—because the money supports a meaningful cause.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced on November 10 that the SAF levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from October 1, 2026. Charges will vary by distance and cabin class.

Subhas said Singapore has also assured the public that their contributions will be used properly. The levy will go directly toward the purchase of SAF, managed by the newly established Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Co Ltd. (SAFCo), which will handle procurement on behalf of the country.

He described Singapore’s model as a combination of firm government commitment and public willingness to support sustainability.

While the levy has drawn widespread attention, Subhas said it is unlikely that other Asia-Pacific countries will adopt a similar approach, as each government has different needs and policy structures.

“There is no one-size-fits-all,” he said, noting that countries are taking different pathways to increase SAF use.

Japan, for instance, is pursuing a public–private partnership model supported by its large supply of used cooking oil, creating new income opportunities for communities involved in collecting and processing it.

Malaysia, he added, has also laid out long-term plans to build domestic SAF production capacity, targeting significant output by 2050.

Subhas said most Asia-Pacific countries already have policies and regulations in place to expand SAF use, with the region now showing much faster progress than two years ago. He said these efforts are expected to lead to at least five percent SAF usage across the region.

Beyond sustainability, Subhas urged governments to take a more active role in strengthening the region’s aviation supply chain. He said airlines have repeatedly been called upon to push the sector forward, but governments also need to recognise aviation as a long-term economic opportunity worthy of investment.

He said governments can help local companies become regional suppliers of aircraft components—similar to efforts underway in China—and support investments in maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and the broader aviation aftermarket.

On rising concerns over passengers carrying lithium-ion batteries, Subhas said airlines face challenges because different countries follow different rules, causing confusion among travellers.

He noted that some airlines believe no action is needed, while others want clearer guidelines. However, he stressed that regulators—not airlines—should issue the necessary rules.

He added that if regulators do not act, the association is willing to propose recommendations based on established safety procedures.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-14.png,N,,2025-11-25 08:58:46.100604

Sriram Iyer, Chief Operating Officer of PIL, said SAF offers strong potential to advance climate targets while meeting the needs of air freight. He noted that as the push toward net-zero gains speed, renewable fuels provide a clear route to reducing emissions and the partnership with DHL reflects PIL’s commitment to greener operations and better carbon performance.

PIL, a global player in the edible oil and consumer goods industry, already manages its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions according to the GHG Protocol. By joining GoGreen Plus, it is also addressing Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect emissions from supply chain activities.

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from materials such as used cooking oil and other waste, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

According to Phillipp Minarelli, Nufarm Brasil’s carinata manager, the strong results reflect the profile of the producers selected for this first commercial cycle.
“We often say it’s not the producer who chooses carinata, it’s carinata that chooses the producer,” he said.
In October, the facility conducted a test crush of 2,500 tonnes of carinata, producing both oil and meal.
Unlike canola oil, carinata oil is toxic for human consumption, requiring chemical treatment to remove harmful compounds.","Carinata, a close relative of canola and one of the most promising feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), delivered strong results in its first year of commercial trials in Brazil. With harvesting completed in recent weeks, yields easily surpassed initial projections, paving the way for rapid expansion.

Commercial planting covered 100,000 hectares under agreements between farmers and Australia’s Nufarm, which supplied the seeds. The company also secured firm offtake contracts with BP, which uses carinata oil at its SAF biorefineries in Europe.

In Mato Grosso do Sul, which led national planting with 10,000 hectares and has nearly finished its harvest, average yields reached 30 bags per hectare. Although one of the lowest averages among producing states, the result was well above Nufarm’s initial national estimate of 20 to 25 bags per hectare.

Carinata was planted in eight states. All Cerrado areas performed above expectations. In Mato Grosso, yields ranged from 30 to 35 bags per hectare, while in Goiás they averaged 33. Paraná posted roughly 37 bags per hectare. Harvesting is still underway in Rio Grande do Sul, the country’s second-largest producer with 7,500 hectares.

According to Phillipp Minarelli, Nufarm Brasil’s carinata manager, the strong results reflect the profile of the producers selected for this first commercial cycle. “We often say it’s not the producer who chooses carinata, it’s carinata that chooses the producer,” he said. The crop is well suited as a cover crop, planted after soybeans and corn as part of soil-conservation practices typically adopted by farmers with more advanced management systems. “These are farmers who already work to keep soil covered and take care when planting,” he said.

So far, all harvests have comfortably exceeded the breakeven point of 15 to 18 bags per hectare, Minarelli said. Compared with other potential SAF feedstocks, carinata has both lower production costs and a smaller carbon footprint. On average, each megajoule of energy produced from carinata-based SAF emits 14 grams of CO₂, compared with 68 grams from soybean-oil-based SAF, he said. The low carbon intensity will likely boost demand from aviation, a sector facing binding decarbonization targets starting in 2027.

One factor that makes carinata more sustainable than soy is its lower need for nitrogen fertilizers, the largest source of agricultural emissions. “Some farmers in Paraná applied no nitrogen at all and will still harvest 30 bags,” Minarelli said.

Carinata also generates abundant crop residue and has deep roots that improve soil aeration, benefiting the following summer soybean crop. “It makes soybean planting easier, with less diesel consumption and less soil compaction,” he said. And because it belongs to a different botanical family than oilseeds and cereals, carinata helps break pest and disease cycles in grain-producing areas, potentially reducing pesticide use.

There are advantages on the industrial side as well. Carinata seeds contain 38% to 45% oil, roughly twice the oil yield of soybeans.

The crop also stands out among winter alternatives for its resilience to extreme weather. Native to Ethiopia, carinata tolerates temperatures above 30°C and withstands frost. That resilience proved critical this year, when some winter fields endured four frost events and remained intact, while crops like wheat and sugarcane suffered yield losses.

Nufarm aims to double its planted area in Brazil by 2026 through expanded partnerships with producers.

Oil

Last year, when Nufarm conducted pilot trials, the harvested carinata had to be shipped to Belgium for processing. This season, carinata grown in Brazil will be processed domestically at a canola-crushing facility opened this year by Celena Alimentos and Grupo Camera in São Luiz Gonzaga, Rio Grande do Sul. With that, Brazil will begin exporting carinata oil.

In October, the facility conducted a test crush of 2,500 tonnes of carinata, producing both oil and meal. Unlike canola oil, carinata oil is toxic for human consumption, requiring chemical treatment to remove harmful compounds.

Laboratory analyses have already confirmed that carinata meal contains adequate protein levels for feed use. Additional testing is expected to certify the removal of toxic elements, according to Vantuir Scarantti, agricultural manager at Celena Alimentos.

Once meal viability is fully confirmed, the plant is expected to process carinata for one month each year, crushing 20,000 tonnes, while canola will be processed during the remaining 11 months. As domestic output expands, the facility could extend carinata crushing time, either by reducing canola throughput or increasing overall capacity, Scarantti said.

In the coming years, Nufarm expects Brazil’s planned SAF plants to internalize the entire production chain. By 2030, SAF production is slated to begin at the Refinaria de Petróleo Riograndense (RPR) in Rio Grande (Rio Grande do Sul), at Petrobras’s refinery in Cubatão (São Paulo), and at an OilGroup facility under development in Bacabeira (Maranhão).

Now, it is about responsibility too. Also, the sky is more complex than it looks. Essentially, every flight leaves a carbon footprint that sticks around for decades.

Also, sustainability is no longer a trend. Rather, it is a necessity. Moreover, airlines are under pressure, governments are setting targets, and passengers are asking questions.

Now, the conversation has shifted from “Is it possible fly cheaper?” to “It is possible to fly cleaner?” That shift is reshaping the entire industry.

Major Environmental Challenges in Air Travel

At the outset, the truth is hard to ignore. In fact, aviation contributes roughly 2-3% of global carbon emissions. Interestingly, that number is climbing.

It is not just CO₂ but even nitrogen oxides, contrails, and water vapor that amplify the warming effect. Also, the sector’s growth exacerbates this. More planes, more routes, more fuel burned.

Unlike cars, planes cannot just switch to electric overnight. The physics of flight make decarbonization a tough nut to crack. And while other industries have clear roadmaps, aviation’s path is full of technical and financial hurdles.

Major Reasons Why Carbon-Neutral Flights Are Necessary?

Presently, airlines are trying to clean up their act. Carbon offset programs are everywhere now. You book a ticket, and they promise to plant trees or fund renewable projects. Although it sounds good, critics still call it a band-aid solution.

In fact, offsets do not eliminate emissions. Rather, they just compensate for them. Still, it is a good start as some carriers are pledging to reach net zero by 2050. Although it is ambitious, it is actually the sole option left.

International Regulations and Agreements: What Are They Doing?

Global rules matter here. For instance, agreements like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) aim to cap emissions growth. As a result, the following happens:

Countries sign up

Airlines comply

Basically, the idea is to keep aviation from spiraling out of control.

However, enforcement is still complicated. This is because every nation does not play fair, and loopholes exist. Meanwhile, regulations have the capability to bring in innovation. Also, they slow things down if they are too rigid. In fact, it is a balancing act of progress versus practicality.

Innovations Driving Change

This is where things get interesting. Essentially, technology is rewriting the future. Also, engineers are chasing ideas that sounded like science fiction a decade ago.

1. Electric and Hybrid Aircraft Technology

Nowadays, electric planes are no longer mere sketches. In fact, companies like Eviation and Airbus are testing prototypes for short-haul flights. Moreover, batteries are the bottleneck because they are too heavy and still lack sufficient energy density.

Meanwhile, hybrids come with a compromise, as they combine conventional engines with electric systems to reduce fuel consumption. This is how progress actually happens. For example, imagine boarding a plane that hums instead of roars. That is the dream for many.

2. Use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Primarily, SAF is the industry’s current favorite. It is made from waste oils, biomass, and even algae. Also, it can slash lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. Moreover, airlines are blending SAF with traditional jet fuel, and airports are slowly adapting.

However, cost is a major factor here. SAF is expensive, and scaling production is a headache. But if you’ve ever wondered how these innovations work and thought, “write my assignment on sustainable aviation,” you are not alone—this topic is gaining academic interest.

3. Fuel Efficiency Is Possible Through AI and Data Analytics

Obviously, AI is not merely for chatbots. In fact, airlines work with predictive analytics to optimize flight paths, reduce drag, and save fuel.

Moreover, real-time data crunching means fewer wasted miles and smarter maintenance schedules. However, passengers do not see it, but the impact is real. These come in the form of:

Lower emissions

Lower costs

Fewer delays

Although this is invisible innovation, it still matters in the long run.

Challenges and Opportunities

No one talks about how expensive going green is. That is why airlines operate on thin margins. Also, new tech demands big investments. Hence, passengers might feel the pinch too. Moreover, ticket prices could rise as carriers absorb costs. This is because infrastructure is another hurdle.

In addition, airports require charging stations for electric planes, storage for SAF, and systems to handle new logistics. However, there are many opportunities. In fact, if you are an early adopter, you will be able to grab market share. Also, governments will come up with jobs in green tech. As a result, the planet gets a breather.

The following are some of the major friction points in sustainable aviation:

Cost implications. SAF and electric tech are not cheap.

Infrastructure readiness. Airports require major upgrades.

Regulatory complexity: It is difficult to work in compliance with global standards.

Even though there are many challenges, the upside is clear. Basically, cleaner skies mean a stronger brand image for airlines and better compliance with climate goals. Also, you will have a future where flying does not feel like an environmental crime.

Closing Thoughts

Now, sustainable aviation is no longer a dream. Rather, it has become a necessity. Of course, the industry is slowly but surely pivoting toward a future. Hence, flying does not mean frying the planet.

Moreover, expect tech to lead the charge. However, collaboration is necessary between airlines, regulators, and passengers. These factors will actually seal the deal. Although the skies might look the same, the engines powering them will tell a different story.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pexels-karabo-photo-294956252-16510280-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 17:57:30.255123

An interinstitutional project led by UdeA has reached a significant milestone in innovation for the country's energy transition. This project involves developing a prototype to produce biojet fuel, a sustainable alternative meant to replace petroleum-based fuel in airplanes. It is derived from palm oil, which produces one liter of biofuel daily. As a pioneer in Colombia, the project is currently being tested on real microturbines, which paves the way for more sustainable aviation.

What began as an academic effort has become a collaborative project in which the university, industry, and the state share a common goal: to produce sustainable aviation fuel in Colombia. Today, there is a prototype that delivers one liter of biojet per day, and while it may seem like a drop in the ocean, it holds the promise of transforming the way the country thinks about its energy.

The project, which has been underway since 2022, is led by the Industrial Chemical Processes (PQI) research group with support from the Efficient Energy Management (GIMEL) group attached to UdeA’s Faculty of Engineering. Universidad de La Guajira, Fedepalma, and IEA Instruments also collaborated on the project. The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation provided financial backing.

Biojet, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), is the most promising alternative available to the airline industry today for reducing its carbon footprint. Unlike Jet A-1, which is derived from petroleum, it can be produced from renewable raw materials such as vegetable, animal, or waste oils.

Its use does not require changing engines or infrastructure, and although it currently represents less than 5% of global consumption, organizations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) point to it as key to the sector's meeting its environmental goals.

This development is crucial for a country like Colombia, which, under the Paris Agreement, pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030.

This is a significant challenge considering that ""Colombia consumes between 550 and 600 million gallons of fossil fuel per year, so adopting SAF is not a luxury, but a strategic necessity,"" said Major Mauricio López, strategic specialist for aeronautical development at the Autoridad Aeronáutica de Aviación del Estado. He also confirmed that the Colombian Air Force (FAC) alone consumes about 10 million gallons of Jet A-1 per year. According to Clean Fuels Alliance America, by 2022, global aviation consumption reached 99 billion gallons.

""The biojet we produce is derived from palm oil, but we are not alone. There are much more robust research groups and powers worldwide working on these biofuels. Even so, there are still technological challenges to overcome, especially in production costs, which are currently higher than their fossil counterparts. The challenge is to develop technology that reduces these costs and enables a viable substitution of conventional fuels,"" said Luis Alberto Ríos, professor at UdeA’s Faculty of Engineering and director of the PQI group.

The history of this development at UdeA began with the first biodiesel projects the GIMEL group conducted in the early 2000s and the oleochemical research that the PQI group consolidated in 2012. This trajectory led to an inter-institutional project, which aims to leverage technology to produce renewable diesel for ground vehicles and biojet for the aviation sector. This would reduce dependence on foreign patents and lay the foundations for a true energy transition.

From palm trees to sky, this is how UdeAbiojet is made

In the face of global criticism of palm oil as a cause of deforestation, researchers emphasize that the Colombian case is different. ""Our industry here has not developed by clearing natural forests,"" Professor Ríos asserted.

The process begins with palm oil, a raw material chosen for its availability in Colombia. According to Fedepalma, the country is currently the fourth-largest producer globally and the largest on the continent. ""We proved that palm oil has the greatest benefits for combustion of the oils tested,"" commented John Ramiro Agudelo, PhD in thermal sciences and researcher in the GIMEL group at UdeA’s Faculty of Engineering.

The first product, renewable or green diesel, is produced through a hydrotreatment process that involves ""cleaning"" the oil with hydrogen to remove unwanted oxygen. It has already been successfully tested in road vehicles in collaboration with industry partners.

This renewable diesel then enters a second process known as isomerization, during which the molecules are reshaped to better resist cold conditions. ""It's the final step that functions like a molecular antifreeze,"" Professor Agudelo explained. ""We altered its structure to guarantee the fuel remains fluid at high altitudes, where temperatures can drop to -50°C, to ensure it complies with strict aviation standards for biojet fuel.""

The scaled-up prototype, currently located at the University Research Headquarters (SIU), is a system of tubular reactors, high-pressure pumps, and feed tanks in which oil and hydrogen react. At maximum capacity, it can produce up to 30 liters per day. It has reached Technological Readiness Level 7 (TRL 7*) on a scale of 1 to 9.

It was designed and built with the company IEA Instruments, owned by UdeA graduates. It features a catalyst that, in Professor Rios's words, ""does the magic, since it allows the reactions to occur."" This technology has been validated under real-world conditions and could be ready for commercial implementation.

A next leap: starting the engines

The GIMEL group is responsible for the fuel's final validation. Its laboratories evaluate the mixtures' performance using a real aviation microturbine, similar to those found in commercial airplanes. ""We are the first university in Colombia to test a locally produced biojet on this type of equipment,"" said Professor Agudelo.

The tests will begin with gradual blends based on a key industry fact: It is currently not feasible to operate aircraft exclusively on sustainable fuel due to strict engine requirements. Therefore, combinations will initially be evaluated in which, for every 100 liters, between 1 and 5 liters of biojet will be included —mixtures of 1%, 2%, and 5%— maintaining conventional Jet A-1 as the base.

The goal is to measure engine behavior and emissions with each increment accurately, and to this end, the researchers include doctoral students to support this process. ""Unregulated emissions, which have a high impact on human health, are analyzed,"" Agudelo added. He emphasized that, if funding continues, the goal is to improve the quality of the biojet obtained, increase the blend percentages, and scale up production for testing on real aircraft engines.

According to the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the cost of air pollution in Colombia —associated with sources such as transportation, industry, waste management, and the burning of fossil fuels— is estimated at $11.7 billion annually, primarily due to premature mortality and hospital care. Faced with this multisectoral impact, Professor Agudelo emphasized that ""human health cannot be balanced in economic terms,"" and highlighted that initiatives such as biojet production represent concrete progress in reducing the pollution from aviation, one of the sectors most involved in this problem.

For Laura Orozco, co-investigator of the project, the prototype is a tangible result of the UdeA innovation ecosystem. ""What we see here is how the knowledge generated in the laboratory can transcend to generate technology-based companies and provide concrete solutions for the country.""

While this milestone highlights the development of technologies in the University, the next scaling phase will be crucial to turning this scientific achievement into a viable alternative on the market. However, the risk of repeating what happened with biodiesel two decades ago remains: Importing technology to adapt plants while neglecting local knowledge. ""We need continuity, greater funding, and a clear policy that allows academia and industry to work together. The question is not whether we will produce biojet, but whether we will do so with technological sovereignty,"" warned researcher Ríos.

For his part, Major López agreed that the challenge is not only technical but also concerns public policy. ""SAF must be on par with other existing biofuels. To achieve this, Colombia must support the implementation of the first biorefineries and assist investors, with academia as a strategic partner to mitigate the risks in this initial stage.""

In this validation phase, the FAC is emerging as a key ally. ""With our capabilities, we can support academia with test benches, extensive engine testing, and technical verifications that guarantee flight safety with alternative fuels,"" said López. He added that the international standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) require approximately 450 cycles to certify the inclusion of a new SAF.

The social impact is also at stake. Researchers propose partnership models in which rural communities can participate in the value chain, considering the country's high availability of raw materials. ""It's not just about decarbonizing the sky, but also dignifying the land,"" Ríos insisted.

The goal is clear: Transforming the country's agricultural wealth into energy value, thus creating local supply chains that benefit everyone, from small farmers to international airlines. It's not just about replacing fuel but building a new economy around it in the country, as other nations have been doing.

The final message is an invitation not to repeat past mistakes. ""We can import turnkey technology once the world has already solved the problem, or we can be part of the solution by developing our capacity, knowledge, and industry,"" Agudelo concluded.

Careful! They are not the same! Biodiesel, renewable diesel, and biojet

Biodiesel: Produced through a transesterification reaction, which transforms oil into an ester chemical compound. It is already commercially available in Colombia mixed with fossil diesel currently at 10%.

Renewable diesel (green diesel): The result of hydrotreatment. It is a hydrocarbon identical to fossil diesel but of plant or animal origin. It is the first product of the UdeA prototype.

Biojet/SAF: Renewable diesel that undergoes an isomerization process to meet strict aviation requirements, such as a low freezing point. This is the final product.

Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council), Karen Kerrigan, President and Chief Executive Officer: “SBE Council commends the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for advancing a reconciliation proposal that includes funding for critical investments to modernize our nation’s air traffic control (ATC) system. A reliable ATC system is vital to U.S. commerce and competitiveness, providing essential support to small businesses that depend on a well-functioning airspace for efficient travel, cargo transport, and timely delivery of goods…We urge Congress to enhance U.S. airspace efficiency, support small business competitiveness, and secure America’s position as a global leader in aviation by passing this package as part of its One Big, Beautiful reconciliation bill.”

Southwest Airlines, Christa Lucas, Vice President, Governmental Affairs: “On behalf of Southwest Airlines, I write in strong support for the Air Traffic Control (ATC) funding proposal that is slated to be included in the Budget Reconciliation Act. We applaud your leadership in attempting to address critical needs at the FAA and the agency’s ability to properly manage the largest, most complex, and most important ATC system in the world – while at the same time maintaining our nation’s ‘gold standard’ in terms of aviation safety.”

Thales, David Scruggs, Vice President, Government Relations: “Thales commends the Committee for their recognition of the funding issues that continue to affect air traffic staffing, infrastructure and technology. This initial proposed tranche of funding, along with the identified first set of priorities, are a much needed down payment on accelerating modernization. It is essential that, as a nation, we focus on restoring the infrastructure of the NAS to its proper state – reflective of what we all agree is required to remain the safest air space in the world.”

Truckload Carriers Association (TCA), Dave Heller, Senior Vice President of Safety and Government Affairs: “The TCA and its membership favor a fee for all Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Users. We have consistently backed efforts such as Senator Deb Fischer’s (R-NE) ‘Stop EV Freeloading Act,’ now known as the ‘Fair SHARE Act,’ and we are equally supportive of the House companion bill championed by Representative Dusty Johnson (R-SD-At Large)...TCA looks forward to collaborating with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in any way we can to support a strong and sustainable future for our highway system.”

U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Rodney Davis, Senior Vice President, Government Affairs: “As your committee advances the budget reconciliation process, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commends you for exploring opportunities to restore the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) as the primary mechanism financing critical surface transportation projects through targeted ‘user fees’...Modernizing the current user fee system to reflect the realities of rising construction costs, permitting delays, inflation, increasing fuel efficiency, and the growing number of electric vehicles can help ensure all users contribute meaningfully to our nation’s highway system.”

U.S. Travel Association: “U.S. Travel strongly supports the Air Traffic Control modernization proposal the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure put forth to fund critical investments in air traffic control technology, infrastructure, and workforce…We urge Congress to include this much needed ATC funding in the final Budget Reconciliation measure.”

On Saturday, climate negotiations wrapped up in Brazil with a weakened agreement. The agreement avoided any direct reference to phasing out fossil fuels, a win for oil producers and oil-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia. Despite dire scientific warnings about the need to transition from coal, oil, and gas, the final text offered up no concrete commitments and diluted warnings about the cost of inaction. Many countries, including 80 that were pushing for a fossil-fuel phaseout plan, expressed deep disappointment and frustration. Colombian diplomat Daniela Durán González said, “This is the COP of truth. The truth cannot support an outcome that ignores the science.” The lack of meaningful progress further highlighted the disparity between wealthy emitters and vulnerable nations.

G20 summit in South Africa wraps, despite US absence

This weekend, G20 leaders met in Johannesburg, South Africa, for the 2025 G20 Leaders’ Summit. Leaders from the world’s largest economies met in Africa for the first time, and for the first time without the United States in attendance. The Trump administration refused to attend, citing false claims that the South African government was allowing for the killing of white Afrikaners and seizing white-owned land. Despite the U.S. absence, South African Minister of International Relations Ronald Lamola declared the event a success. The G20 issued a joint declaration at the start of the summit rather than at the conclusion. The declaration emphasized gender equality, debt relief for poorer nations, and climate action. President Cyril Ramaphosa closed the summit without the traditional handover, as the U.S. will be the next president of the G20 summit.

Lufthansa signs fuel supply deal with China’s Unipec

China’s Unipec, a national oil trader under refiner Sinopec Corp, has signed a deal with Lufthansa for annual fuel supply. The deal will supply the airline with about 60,000 metric tons of jet fuel each year at airports in Germany and Belgium. For four years now, Unipec’s fuel supply in North Africa and Western Europe has exceeded 5 million metric tons, including sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). After signing SAF supply deals with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Lufthansa, the firm sold 120,000 tons of SAF in Europe this year. Companies committed to sustainable switches can use ESG tools for guidance.

Singapore’s Sembcorp plans IPO in India

After a failed IPO attempt in 2019, Sembcorp, a state-owned energy company based in Singapore, is considering a second attempt at an initial public offering for its Indian unit in Mumbai. The corporation has appointed three investment banks, including HSBC and Citi, to aid in the talks. With an increase in listings, Indian markets are currently trading near record highs. Firms have raised over $16 billion in 2025, establishing India as the third-largest IPO market in the world. Sembcorp’s India unit reached revenues of $252 million in the year ending March 31, 2024. Of that revenue, over $40 million was profit. The company hopes to launch the IPO in eight to nine months.

Hi, my name is Chris Woodruff from the Managing Director of Manchester Airport. We've just had a great sustainable aviation discussion roundtable today. Andy Burnham's been here and we've been sharing the plans for getting on top of net zero in aviation. So it's clear the Northwest of England has an opportunity here in that we have a collection of assets that if brought together could make us a a world leader in this territory. The Northwest can be a real force. In decarbonising aviation, in developing South, in developing the the aircraft and the infrastructure needed to decarbonise aviation. And what I've proposed today is that we convene the political leaders of the wider NW and indeed North Wales to see if we can all come together and realize the opportunity that might be before us. It is a big challenge. It's really hard, but there are some great ideas. If we really put our minds to it, I'm sure we can get there.

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Prior.
“The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated.
About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than sixteen hundred times that of CO2 over a 20 year period.
The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised.","Following the closing of the COP30 climate summit this weekend, the Clean Arctic Alliance criticised the lack of action on fossil fuels, and failure to harness potential quick victories from cutting black carbon and other short-lived climate forcers.

“COP30 promised so much - it’s disappointing that it delivered so little”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “There was a clear lack of urgency amongst governments, in the face of the climate crisis, with a complete dearth of official COP30 attention to easy wins on short-lived climate forcers - like black carbon.”

“However, with less than a fortnight to go for governments to submit a plan for cutting a plan for cutting black carbon emissions from shipping in the Arctic, International Maritime Organization member states - led by Arctic governments - must now respond to the high-level announcement made by several governments - including Canada - at COP30 on sectoral action to tackle black carbon emissions from commercial and residential energy and transport sources”, added Prior.

“These countries clearly recognise the need for urgent action on a potent, short-lived superpollutant where action now could make a real difference in mitigating the impact of climate change and also improve air quality and public health for communities in the Arctic”, said Prior.

“Addressing black carbon offers a unique opportunity to advance climate change mitigation, build climate resilience, improve air quality, safeguard public health, and deliver

sustainable development co-benefits”, said the statement by Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Madagascar, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Uganda.

Governments need to urgently act ahead of the December 5th deadline for proposals on polar fuels, ahead of a meeting of the IMO’s Pollution Prevention and Response committee (PPR 13) in February 2026 in London that will set rules on what fuels can be used in the immediate future by shipping in the Arctic.

Momentum towards these polar fuels is building: the Nordic Council of Ministers recently recommended that Nordic governments work towards the recognition of polar fuels by the IMO and the MARPOL Convention. Now, during COP30, governments have again recognised the need for urgent action on a potent, short-lived superpollutant where action now could make a real difference in mitigating the impact of climate change and also improve air quality and public health for communities in the Arctic.

“As this announcement from COP30 shows, the world is starting to take urgent action on black carbon emissions - we need Arctic governments to take action ahead of the IMO’s December 5th deadline, in order to dramatically reduce black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “By making cleaner fuels (polar fuels) mandatory for shipping in this unique region that is already being dramatically affected by climate change, Arctic governments - and other IMO member states - have a unique opportunity to demonstrate joint leadership on this issue”.

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Prior. “The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated. The next opportunity comes in February 2026, when the IMO’s Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response will meet (PPR 13) to discuss polar fuels.”

“A strong agreement on polar fuels to set rules which will reduce black carbon emission levels from shipping in the Arctic region is essential”, added Prior. “The deadline for submitting proposals is December 5th - and we want to see a concrete proposal led by Arctic states, including Canada, Norway, Iceland, Denmark/Greenland, on polar fuels that will ensure a rapid reduction in Arctic black carbon emissions, ahead of longer-term decarbonisation efforts.”

A regulation requiring the use of polar fuels in the Arctic must set the foundation in MARPOL Annex VI (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) for reductions in emissions which reduce the impact of black carbon on the Arctic.

A recent report by NGO Pacific Environment lays out the case for why the International Maritime Organization (IMO) should immediately act on reducing black carbon pollution — a climate super-pollutant. On Thin Ice: Why Black Carbon Demands Urgent Action, explores how the expansion of Arctic shipping is causing an increase in the release of black carbon into the air, which then settles on snow and ice, accelerating dangerous melting. Switching to readily available and cleaner “polar fuels” — such as marine distillates DMA and DMZ or new fuels with comparable black carbon emissions levels — will rapidly cut emissions, protect vulnerable ecosystems and safeguard communities.

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic

Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than sixteen hundred times that of CO2 over a 20 year period. It makes up around one-fifth of international shipping’s climate impact. Not only does it contribute to warming while in the atmosphere, black carbon accelerates melting if deposited onto snow and ice – hence it has a disproportionate impact when released in and near to the Arctic.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced. More heat in the polar systems – results in increased melting. This is the loss of the albedo effect.

Declines in sea ice extent and volume are leading to a burgeoning social and environmental crisis in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting global climate and ocean circulation. Scientists have high confidence that processes are nearing points beyond which rapid and irreversible changes on the scale of multiple human generations are possible. Scientists say it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, and research has shown that “preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.”

Black carbon also has a negative impact on human health including premature death and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent research has found black carbon particles in the body tissues of foetuses, following inhalation by pregnant mothers.

The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised. On land, considerable effort has been made to ban dirtier fuels in power stations, to install diesel particulate filters on land-based transport, and to improve the burning of dry wood – all to reduce emissions of black carbon and improve air quality. However, at sea the same efforts have not yet been made.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Clean_Arctic_Alliance_COP30.png,N,,2025-11-24 10:56:48.084731

From Baghdad to Vilnius

Founded by the late Dame Zaha Hadid, the Iraqi-British architect who became the first woman to win the prestigious Pritzker Prize, the firm has maintained its reputation for pushing architectural boundaries since her death in 2016.

ZHA-designed airports tend to feel more like art installations than transit hubs, with sweeping curves and dramatic spaces that have redefined what travelers expect from modern terminals.

For Vilnius, this represents a major upgrade to aviation infrastructure in the Baltics.

The demonstration uses Greenlyte’s fully electric, modular LiquidSolar system, which captures CO2, produces green hydrogen, converts both into syngas, and synthesises this into e-fuels such as synthetic natural gas, e-methanol, or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at “fossil-competitive costs.”

As a proof-of-concept facility, the company expects to produce up to five tonnes of synthetic natural gas (SNG) whilst also capturing 40 tonnes of CO2 per year.

Greenlyte says the plant went from engineering to inauguration in under 12 months, with final construction completed in less than three, supported by more than 13,000 hours of pilot operation.

The German start-up added that it can scale the system to much larger commercial plants.

Greenlyte is planning a larger e-methanol facility in Marl, Germany, by 2027, and wants to expand its operations internationally by 2030.

Long-term offtake agreements have also reportedly been signed with Eurowings and MB Energy, although the firm has not disclosed volumes or timelines.

Florian Hildebrand, CEO and co-founder of Greenlyte, claimed the LiquidSolar technology is “economically attractive for customers,” and offers “strong return opportunities for investors.”

The CEO added, “We are building the foundation for a competitive new energy industry by drawing on North Rhine-Westphalia’s industrial legacy, a world-class research ecosystem, and a dense supplier network – making optimal use of the great resources we have here.”

The region’s Minister President, Hendrik Wüst, said North Rhine-Westphalia aims to become “Europe’s first climate-neutral industrial region.”

With Uniper as an associated partner, the initiative received funding from the EU and the German state.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are pivotal for decarbonizing aviation, but how are they certified to be a ""drop-in"" replacement for conventional Jet-A fuel without requiring any modifications to aircraft or engines? It's a rigorous process ensuring uncompromising safety and performance!

The ""drop-in"" capability is essential for rapid adoption, allowing SAF to be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in existing infrastructure and aircraft without costly overhauls. This is achieved through strict certification standards, primarily governed by organizations like ASTM International (ASTM D7566 and D1655).

The certification process involves:

Feedstock to Fuel Pathway: Each SAF production pathway (e.g., HEFA from used cooking oil, alcohol-to-jet) is evaluated, ensuring it meets strict sustainability criteria (e.g., reduced lifecycle CO2 emissions, no competition with food crops).

Chemical Equivalence: The produced SAF must be chemically identical or functionally equivalent to conventional Jet-A fuel. This means matching key properties like:

Energy Content: To ensure equivalent range and thrust.

Freezing Point: Critical for high-altitude operations.

Flash Point: For safe handling and storage.

Density & Viscosity: For proper fuel system and engine operation.

Thermal Stability: To prevent coking in hot engine sections.

In a move aimed at standardising and accelerating environmental progress across the industry, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) has launched its new Integrated Sustainability Program (ISP), a certification framework designed to provide airlines with a comprehensive, auditable approach to sustainability management. The programme provides carriers with a structured pathway to evaluate their environmental performance, track improvements and demonstrate compliance with emerging global sustainability requirements. Earlier this year, the International Air Cargo Association (Tiaca) released the latest edition of its annual Air Cargo Sustainability Insights Report, offering one of the sector’s most extensive assessments of current sustainability practices. Drawing on input from 274 industry respondents, the report highlights a marked increase in commitment to decarbonisation, transparency and operational innovation across the air cargo value chain. Central to the industry’s net- zero pathway is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is expected to deliver around 65% of aviation’s total emissions- reduction target by 2050. Yet SAF remains scarce. Currently, it accounts for only about 1% of global jet-kerosene production, with supply constraints and limited availability posing major hurdles. The EU’s 2% minimum SAF- use mandate, which will rise annually, has already highlighted the gap between policy ambition and production reality. Despite the relatively low starting threshold, many carriers are struggling to secure volumes, underscoring the need for far greater government support, including tax incentives, to stimulate investment in new production capacity. Current SAF prices remain roughly three times higher than conventional Jet A1, adding further pressure to scale supply. Earlier this month, the European Commission released its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) that aims to address some of these long-standing weaknesses in the aviation decarbonisation strategy. Iata welcomed the Commission’s recognition of market challenges that derive from SAF mandates that were flawed from the outset, particularly the price gap between sustainable and conventional fuels, and the need for robust investment support. According to Willie Walsh, Iata director general, the airline industry is committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but this ambition can only be realised if policy frameworks are fully aligned with industry needs and the true scale of the challenge. Industry experts Freight News spoke to said ESG was increasingly being recognised as good for the planet and for business. Sustainability-based strategic growth plans are becoming the norm, with customers, employees, partners, financial institutions and regulators all insisting on stronger environmental and governance practices. Government requirements for increased reporting for public companies over a certain size are also beginning to take effect. In the short term, these are forcing companies to invest in the systems needed to monitor and report on their sustainability performance.

Twenty-five years ago, Jurong Island showed the world what Singapore could achieve when we dared to think big and work together.","Introduction

1. Good evening, everyone. It is heartwarming to see all of you gathered here tonight – from the pioneers who laid the foundations of Jurong Island, to the many partners working here over the years to realise our vision.

2. Tonight, we celebrate not just an anniversary, but a remarkable journey – one that reflects Singapore’s spirit of imagination, partnership, and long-term planning.

From Vision to Reality

3. Twenty-five years ago, Jurong Island began as a bold idea: to create a thriving, integrated hub for energy and chemicals from seven small southern islands.

a. Some wondered whether it would work – whether we could build the infrastructure, attract investors, and create an ecosystem from scratch.

b. But our pioneers believed in our vision. They saw that with clarity of purpose, perseverance, and trust between government and industry, this island could anchor a new engine of Singapore’s industrial growth.

4. That belief paid off. From its early days, Jurong Island brought together companies that started that vision and continued to believe in us.

a. Singapore Refining Company continued refining on Pulau Merlimau even before reclamation began.

b. PCS started Southeast Asia’s first naphtha cracker in 1984, laying the foundations for the downstream petrochemical ecosystem.

c. ExxonMobil, whose predecessor Esso operated a refinery on Pulau Ayer Chawan in the 1960s, built a world-class petrochemical plant here in 2001, and expanded in 2007 and again in 2013, making Singapore its largest manufacturing site globally.

d. These early movers paved the way for others. We have since attracted over 100 global energy and chemicals companies, including Advario, Afton, Asahi Kasei, Evonik and Vopak.

5. Today, Jurong Island is recognised globally as a trusted hub for energy and chemicals. It sits at the heart of an integrated ecosystem that spans the entire petrochemical value chain – from refining and cracking, to petrochemicals and specialty chemicals.

a. This tightly knit ecosystem, with over 100km of pipelines, allows companies to operate efficiently and export reliably to the region and beyond. In fact, Singapore ranks as the world’s 3rd largest oil trading hub, 6th largest refinery export hub, and 9th largest chemicals hub.

b. It is also home to cutting-edge industrial infrastructure, and a thriving environment for innovation and applied research.

6. Our energy and chemicals sector accounts for around 3% of Singapore’s GDP and about one-quarter of manufacturing output in 2024. It provides employment for more than 27,000 workers, including in emerging roles such as industrial biotech, carbon and energy management, and decarbonisation technologies.

a. We owe this success to many of you here this evening – including Philip Yeo, former Chairman of EDB, our industry leaders, our engineers, our workers – who believed in Singapore and helped turn Jurong Island from an idea into reality.

Transforming Jurong Island

7. Even as we celebrate this achievement, we must look ahead. The global energy and chemicals industry, once built around scale and cost-efficiency, is being reshaped by new technologies, the pressure to decarbonise, and rising demand for higher-quality and greener products.

8. Jurong Island must therefore reinvent itself to stay competitive and relevant.

9. Last month, at the Singapore International Energy Week, we outlined the refreshed direction for Jurong Island – to become a premier hub for specialty chemicals and sustainable materials, and a global testbed for new energies and low-carbon technologies.

The Next Chapter of Jurong Island

10. First, specialty chemicals and sustainable materials.

a. Regional demand for higher-quality products in markets such as consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, and electronics is driving the growth in specialty chemicals. This has fuelled the recent entry of new players such as Arkema, Cariflex and Kuraray.

b. Sustainability goals worldwide are also driving demand for products such as bio-based polymers, low-carbon coatings, and green solvents, and in turn drive new investments into sustainable materials.

c. At the same time, existing players are also investing in efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.

i. For example, Aster and Air Liquide have signed an MOU to produce low-carbon hydrogen. This will be integrated with Aster’s cracker furnaces and waste heat recovery systems, and can enable Aster to reduce its carbon emissions.

d. I am glad to note that we are making good progress towards our Sustainable Jurong Island target.

i. The sector’s output of sustainable products has grown 1.4 times since 2019, and we are on track to reach a 1.5-times increase by 2030.

ii. Singapore’s refineries and crackers now rank within the top half of global energy efficiency, and are working toward top quartile performance.

iii. Together, these efforts will transform Jurong Island to stay competitive in a low-carbon future.

11. Another new area of opportunity is in New Energies. We are seeing good progress in the growth of New Energies on Jurong Island.

a. Sembcorp Solar operates the island’s largest solar deployment of close to 120 MWp.

b. IHI Corporation and A*STAR have launched a bench-scale SAF rig, producing sustainable aviation fuel from hydrogen and CO₂.

c. EMA and MPA have appointed a Keppel-led consortium to explore low- or zero-carbon ammonia solutions for power generation and bunkering.

12. Building on this momentum, JTC and Keppel have signed an MOU and will partner with EMA to study the pilot deployment of a microgrid testbed on Jurong Island. This initiative will advance the integration of renewable energy, battery storage systems and smart grid technologies.

13. These efforts will bolster Jurong Island’s proposition as a living testbed for the development of future-ready energy solutions.

14. Last but not least, we will also leverage Jurong Island to drive innovation into low-carbon technologies. In 2027, A*STAR will open its S$62 million Low Carbon Technology Translational Testbed (LCT³) on Jurong Island, providing a modular platform to pilot emerging low-carbon solutions.

a. ISCE² and Surbana Jurong have signed an MOU to pilot and deploy novel low carbon technologies in the LCT³ environment with local and international partners.

15. To further accelerate the piloting and deployment of low-carbon solutions on Jurong Island, JTC will partner Rocky Mountain Institute’s global climate-tech accelerator Third Derivative (D3).

a. This partnership will connect companies on Jurong Island with D3’s global network of over 280 start-ups and solution providers to develop new clean energy solutions.

16. We will also leverage the new power generation capacity on Jurong Island over the next few years to anchor the next generation of power-intensive digital infrastructure.

a. We have set aside about 20 hectares for Singapore’s largest low-carbon Data Centre (DC) Park. This will be able to support up to 700 MW of AI and other DC capacity while meeting stringent efficiency and cooling requirements.

b. To support this development, JTC and NUS have signed an MOU to study the establishment of a Sustainable Tropical Data Centre Testbed 2.0.

i. Through this facility, DC operators will be able to test their low carbon solutions and develop large-scale, water- and energy-efficient systems on Jurong Island.

17. Together, these efforts will create a comprehensive ecosystem at Jurong Island where ideas can be tested, refined, and scaled, enabling Singapore to contribute meaningfully to global decarbonisation.

Transforming our People

18. But transformation is not just about technology. It is also about people. As Jurong Island evolves, we must prepare our workforce for new opportunities in sustainable manufacturing, clean energy and advanced industrial systems.

a. I am glad to note that as part of their MOU, JTC and NUS will work together to cultivate a skilled talent pipeline that supports industrial decarbonisation and sustainable digital infrastructure projects on Jurong Island.

b. In tandem, Advario is working with Workforce Singapore to upskill their workforce with capabilities to support its energy transition, with an estimated 150 personnel benefitting from this partnership.

c. I hope more companies will also take the opportunity and initiative to redesign jobs and upskill their workforce as they transform their product mix. This will strengthen our talent base to support the island’s transformation, and ensure that our people will be ready to seize the opportunities ahead.

Conclusion

19. Twenty-five years ago, Jurong Island showed the world what Singapore could achieve when we dared to think big and work together. Today, as the world enters a new energy era, Jurong Island once again stands ready – to lead in sustainable chemicals, to pioneer new energies, and to develop the low-carbon technologies that will power the industries of the future.

20. As we celebrate 25 years of Jurong Island, let us honour the pioneers who laid the foundation, the workers who keep the island running safely every day, and the innovators who are charting its next frontier. And let us continue working together – government, industry, academia – to ensure that Jurong Island remains not only a hub for the world’s energy and chemicals, but also a beacon of low-carbon innovation for the future.

21. Thank you, and congratulations once again to everyone who has been part of Jurong Island’s extraordinary journey.",https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/166/e1d58d67-6d17-4eaa-a59f-e6201b2d360a/MTI%20Logo.png,N,,2025-11-24 11:56:46.348953

He breaks down the agriculture investing landscape into two worlds: mergers and acquisitions of existing, cash-flow positive and tech-enabled ag businesses and early-stage startups likely to seek venture capital.
“It has, I think, caused investors to pull back in the early stage venture ecosystem of agtech,” he says.
“You have something that’s immediately asynchronous with the funding mechanism of venture capital, but it doesn’t mean it’s not investable and that VC doesn’t work,” he says.
“Just because it works in the lab, doesn’t mean you have a product,” Hedges says.","St. Louis’ agricultural prowess has long given it a leg up in growing or attracting companies working to develop the next big breakthrough in that industry. Yet traditional venture capital isn’t always suited for the rhythms of agriculture–making agtech startups’ success more complicated than buzzier bets on technology or artificial intelligence innovation.

Despite tough odds, startups tied to St. Louis have managed to break through this year, including the gene-editing related startup Spearhead Bio, which raised more than $1 million; Plastomics, also in the genetic modification space, secured close to $6 million in a Series B round; and the soil-testing startup TerraBlaster netted close to $4 million in its pre-seed round. And on the other end CoverCress Inc., is finally nearing its big push to market, marking a payoff for Bayer, which has backed the company for a decade.

Analysts say there is room for more investment.

“The ag space is one that has a significant amount of opportunity that is underserved from a global investment perspective,” says Scott Porter, managing director at Cascadia Capital, where he leads the mid-market investment bank’s food and agribusiness sector.

Porter says agriculture makes up approximately four percent of the global gross domestic product, one quarter of the employed workforce globally, and eight percent of global trade, but only accounts for roughly two percent of mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activities. He adds it has an asset class that he describes as “counter cyclical,” whereby it tends to outperform the overall market when there’s a downturn.

“As the opportunity in agriculture has become clear, as the market has become more educated on [that] opportunity, there’s more interest that has come into the market, and I believe more interest and liquidity will continue to come,” Porter says.

He breaks down the agriculture investing landscape into two worlds: mergers and acquisitions of existing, cash-flow positive and tech-enabled ag businesses and early-stage startups likely to seek venture capital. The former is attracting quite a bit of attention from private equity firms, Porter explains, while investment activity the latter has cooled a bit since earlier this decade when low-interest capital created buzz, but also overinflated valuations.

“It has, I think, caused investors to pull back in the early stage venture ecosystem of agtech,” he says.

TerraBlaster CEO Jorge Heraud is no stranger to raising capital in tougher environments, having done so in 2009 for his previous company, Blue River Technologies, which eventually exited to John Deere for $305 million. He says economic conditions now present a similar challenge. Today’s low commodity prices for farmers can translate into fundraising challenges for companies developing innovative products targeting the farm market.

“It’s not the best and easiest of fundraising times in agriculture, because when the farmer economy is poor, then the big companies start retrenching, and then also investors start retrenching a little bit,” Heraud says.

Heraud says TerraBlaster has managed to break through because the device the company is developing will eventually provide real-time data about soil composition to farmers, circumventing time-consuming and costly soil-testing techniques.

The idea is that more granular information on soil health, water conditions, and other factors will help farmers make better decisions about fertilizing and lead to greater yields.

“Farmers are super interested in being more efficient and more conscious about profit. Part of our big part of our value proposition is that we can help the profitability of a farmer,” he says. “It’s an investment not an expenditure.”

TerraBlaster intends for its first device to enter the market near the end of 2026. That’s a faster development timeline than some other agtech innovations because the company is focused on automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence, which don’t need approvals from government regulators, says Porter. Developing something related to a crops’ genetic traits or a new biological product can take well over a decade, he says.

“It’s critically important that investors understand these timelines, the road map, the capital need, so that they know what they’re getting into ahead of time, and they can better underwrite to the milestones that are to come,” Porter says. “Some of our challenges are, in part, investors not fully appreciating that timeline, and therefore having misaligned expectations relative to the commercialization timeline and the capital necessary.”

Traditional venture capital funds tend to be held to 10-year return cycles, whereas the standard crop technology or crop protection technology can take anywhere from 10 to 13 years to get to market, says PJ Amini, senior director of venture investments with Bayer’s strategic investment unit called Leaps.

“You have something that’s immediately asynchronous with the funding mechanism of venture capital, but it doesn’t mean it’s not investable and that VC doesn’t work,” he says. “These things are still venture investable from the right lens and the understanding of the technology, the regulatory landscape, and the time.”

Leaps operates differently than a traditional venture fund. While Amini does cut checks to support early-stage technology and business models related to Bayer’s main verticals of agriculture, pharmaceutical, and consumer health products, the goal lingering in the background is Bayer eventually being able to partner with the companies it invests in, whether that’s by going to market together, licensing, or completing an acquisition.

The St. Louis-based startup CoverCress Inc. offers a prime example. Starting in 2013, the company has sought to alter pennycress, an unwanted weed on farmers’ fields, into a commercially viable crop whose seeds could be crushed for their oil and refined into a form of sustainable aviation fuel. Critically, it grows over winter and is harvested in spring, creating a revenue stream outside of the main cash crop season.

“Utilizing that land to grow another crop is really paramount to not only CoverCress’ success, but I think for the farmer as they try to kind of reimagine how they can drive more revenues,” says CoverCress CEO Jim Hedges.

Monsanto was an early investor in CoverCress, a stake Bayer maintained after its acquisition of the crop science company in 2018. In 2022, Bayer took a majority 65 percent ownership position in CoverCress with the remaining 35 percent split between Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and Bunge.

“We saw this as something that was good for the soil, good for biofuel production, good for the farmers’ economics, and was doing some element of nitrogen fixation as well,” Amini says.

What Amini calls a “moonshot if we could develop this” in CoverCress is finally nearing its long-awaited commercialization ramp-up almost 15 years since the company formed. CoverCress’ product is on about 13,000 acres this year, which Hedges projects will grow to 100,000 over the next three to four years. (For comparison, there are roughly 135 million acres of corn and soy grown across the Midwest and Great Plains, according to the 2022 Ag Census.)

“We’re getting growers acclimated to it. We’re building the right agency network. We’re getting our regulatory freedom to operate,” he says. “From a technical standpoint, we’re ready to go from a product, which is really a luxury.”

There are a variety of reasons it’s taken this long for CoverCress to get ready to scale. Hedges says the company needed time to get into a position where it could extract the “true value” from the crop that comes from crushing its seeds and processing their oil into the aviation fuel alternative.

There are also regulatory approvals. Since CoverCress’ product is gene edited, the company needed an FDA approval recognizing the crop as generally safe for poultry feed, Hedges says. Plus, the crop isn’t on chemical labels yet, limiting where it can be planted for now, he adds.

It also took time to learn how the plant behaves and the best management practices for it over multiple growing seasons, Hedges says. Without that information, it’s too risky for a new company to scale quickly, he adds.

“Just because it works in the lab, doesn’t mean you have a product,” Hedges says.

Out in “the true proving grounds” of farm fields, there’s no control over rain, temperature, humidity, light intensity, fertility and many other growing conditions, he says. Even with innovations like the device TerraBlaster is developing outside of crop science, the rugged farming landscape still presents its challenges.

“[Our sensor is mounted] behind a tractor that’s moving and there’s dust [that] gets created, there’s unevenness in the soil,” says Heraud. “It creates all sorts of little and big challenges we’re having to solve one by one.”

The company spent the fall gathering soil-testing data in Iowa and will take the winter to analyze it, before going out to capture more testing data with the equipment before planting season and after harvest next year.

“We’re going to be working on real-time measurements [then], as opposed to just capturing spectrum [from this fall],” Heraud says. “It’s going to be two bites at the apple to conquer that.”

Crop-focused innovations don’t enjoy such a fast iteration cycle. Artificial intelligence tools are becoming powerful enough to shave years off the early development timeline for a new crop or biological product, says Amini, but “I still need to grow a plant, test it, see how that does. And I’m limited by the timeliness of the physical world.”

Adds Hedges: “Once you get out into the field, [it’s] one iteration a year. So it’s going to take patient capital.” And St. Louis does have firms willing to make such long-term bets, such as Lewis & Clark’s Agrifood fund, Cultivation Capital and The Yield Lab, and BioGenerator Ventures.

Both Hedges and Heraud say this reality in the ag sector places importance on startups developing or leaning into partnerships with bigger strategic players. In the case of CoverCress, its split ownership between Bayer, Bunge, and Chevron takes care of each piece of the supply chain for the company’s crop, from seeds and distribution to farmers, to crushing to the eventual end users.

“It’s all complementary,” says Hedges. “Trying to vertically integrate all this [at CoverCress], we would never raise enough money, and we would never have enough time. We don’t want to recreate or duplicate what already exists.”",https://www.stlmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/plant-scientist_GettyImages-2196741236.webp,N,,2025-11-24 11:56:49.817535

Overshoot of 1.5°C is a stark warning: deep, rapid emission cuts and massive climate finance are essential.","• Countries agreed to mobilise at least $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for global climate action, with adaptation finance set to triple.

• The loss and damage fund moves into a regular replenishment cycle, backed by new implementation tools and monitoring frameworks.

• Brazil’s presidency committed to develop two new roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuel transition after negotiators failed to secure explicit phase-out language in the final text.

High expectations, difficult compromises

COP30 closed at sunrise on Saturday after a marathon final night of negotiations, delivering a substantial climate-finance package and new implementation mechanisms, but stopping short of a formal commitment to phase out fossil fuels.

UN climate chief Simon Stiell described the outcome as evidence that “194 nations stood together, keeping humanity in the fight for a livable planet, determined to hold the line at 1.5°C.” Even so, tensions ran high over what many delegations viewed as an incomplete energy outcome, with explicit phase-out language removed in the final hours.

The adopted decision reaffirms the UAE Consensus from COP28, calling for “transitioning away from fossil fuels,” but negotiators from South America, the EU and civil society groups said the omission of a roadmap remained a point of concern.

The finance package: scale and structure

The final outcome commits Parties to mobilising at least $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for mitigation, adaptation and resilience. Adaptation finance is set to double by 2025 and triple by 2035, a long-standing demand of climate-vulnerable countries. The loss and damage fund, launched at COP28, now enters an operational and replenishment cycle.

The summit also launched the Global Implementation Accelerator and the Belém Mission to 1.5°C. Both aim to support national climate action plans and improve follow-through on the Paris Agreement’s core obligations.

For the first time at a COP, countries formally acknowledged the threat of climate disinformation. The text includes commitments to promote “information integrity” and counter narratives that erode trust in science or climate policy. Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had opened the summit calling it “the COP of truth,” and the decision reflects that political framing.

What negotiators could not agree on

A draft text circulating 24 hours before the close contained explicit fossil-fuel phase-out language, reflecting Brazil’s proposal for a global roadmap backed by more than 80 countries. It was removed after protracted discussions.

Before the final plenary, Brazilian scientist Carlos Nobre warned that fossil fuel use must fall to zero by 2040–2045 to avoid temperature rises of up to 2.5°C. Without deep reductions, he said, the world faces “the near-total loss of coral reefs, the collapse of the Amazon rainforest and an accelerated melt of the Greenland ice sheet.”

COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago acknowledged the gap between ambition and outcome: “We know some of you had greater ambitions for some of the issues at hand,” he said. “I know the youth civil society will demand us to do more to fight climate change. I want to reaffirm that I will try not to disappoint you during my presidency.”

He committed to preparing two new roadmaps: one on halting and reversing deforestation, and another on transitioning away from fossil fuels “in a just, orderly and equitable manner,” with resources mobilised “in a just and planned manner.”

Fractures, setbacks and a late-night push for consensus

The talks unfolded against a difficult backdrop. Indigenous groups staged blockades demanding stronger protections for the Amazon. A fire at the venue on Thursday disrupted negotiations at a critical moment. Delegates worked through the night to bridge gaps on finance and ambition, with Brazil steering discussions toward outcomes built on past COP commitments rather than reopening core disputes.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres, speaking from the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, said the outcome showed that nations “can still unite to confront challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. Overshoot of 1.5°C is a stark warning: deep, rapid emission cuts and massive climate finance are essential. COP30 is over, but the work is not.”

The Mutirão deal and the wider action agenda

The centrepiece of the conference is the Mutirão text, a consolidated package spanning mitigation, finance, trade barriers and implementation. Seventeen additional decisions were adopted alongside it. The document declares the global shift toward low-emission and climate-resilient development “irreversible,” reaffirming that the Paris Agreement “must go further and faster.”

Voluntary commitments under the Action Agenda added momentum. The Tropical Forests Forever Fund raised $5.5 billion across 53 countries, with at least 20 percent earmarked for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. The Belém Health Action Plan launched as the first global initiative targeting climate-related health threats, backed by $300 million from 35 philanthropic organisations. Public utilities under the UNEZA Alliance pledged $66 billion annually for renewables and $82 billion for transmission and storage.

A coalition of cities, regions and companies reported cutting over 850,000 tons of CO₂ in 2024 across 25,000 buildings, pointing to operational action beyond national pledges.

A global moment with longer-term consequences

For investors, policymakers and corporate leaders, the outcome clarifies the direction of travel: large-scale finance, accelerated implementation tools and expanding pressure for a just energy transition. The absence of explicit fossil-fuel phase-out language keeps the debate alive, but Brazil’s commitment to develop a roadmap ensures it will resurface ahead of COP31.

Renewable investments already outpace fossil fuels two to one. With geopolitical pressures rising, Belém’s outcome demonstrates that multilateral climate cooperation remains intact — though strained — as countries attempt to keep 1.5°C within reach.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/COP30-sets-1.3-Trillion-Climate-Finance-Goal-but-Delays-Fossil-Fuel-Decision.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 14:57:15.988686

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released the Value of Air Transport Study for Uzbekistan, showing that the country’s focus on aviation has driven growing benefits for employment and economic activity.

In Uzbekistan, 12,400 people are directly employed in aviation, generating USD 96.5 million in economic output, equivalent to 0.1% of total GDP. Wider benefits come from the supply chain, employee spending, and tourism, contributing a total of USD 795.5 million, or 0.9% of GDP, and supporting 128,000 jobs.

“Uzbekistan’s continued investment in new airport infrastructure, safety improvements, and in people have played a key role in supporting a resilient and robust aviation sector, strengthening the burgeoning tourism industry and foreign direct investment in the country. It is also key to developing the country’s attractiveness as a future east-west transit hub for both passengers and cargo,” said Rafael Schvartzman, IATA Regional Vice President for Europe.

Tourism supported by aviation contributes USD 282.9 million to GDP, while international tourists are estimated to inject USD 2 billion annually into the wider economy through local goods and services. Uzbekistan is also expanding as a transit point for air cargo. In 2023, 66,600 tonnes of air cargo were transported through Uzbek airports. The opening of a dedicated cargo terminal at Tashkent Airport and continued growth at Navoi’s cargo airport are expected to further increase volumes.

Uzbekistan’s central location in Central Asia provides strategic connectivity to neighbouring states and links between Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe. This position supports investment in aviation infrastructure and employment, with spillover benefits for tourism, trade, and foreign direct investment.

Policymakers are advised to focus on four key priorities to strengthen Uzbekistan’s aviation sector. First, alignment with global standards and best practices is essential for safe, efficient, and affordable air transport, increasing the country’s attractiveness as a hub between Europe and Asia. Second, infrastructure expansion, including new airports in Tashkent, Bukhara, and Urgench, must remain cost competitive to support passenger and cargo growth. Third, the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) should follow international standards to ensure environmental integrity and global acceptance, leveraging Uzbekistan’s Gas-to-Liquids experience while focusing on renewable or low-carbon gases. Finally, investment in people is critical, with a growing workforce needing upskilling and retention to maintain safe and efficient operations.

Introduction

This Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been prepared to inform the Scottish Government’s consultation on the draft Climate Change Plan (CCP).

What are the aims and objectives of the CCP?

Tackling the climate emergency is one of the Scottish Government’s four key priorities, and the CCP is one of the Scottish Government’s foremost strategies towards mitigating the effects of climate change, as part of its wider intent to address the twin crises of climate change and nature loss.

This latest CCP updates on Scotland’s climate change ambitions, detailing the policies and proposals to achieve the Scottish Government's duty to meet the first three of Scotland’s carbon budgets (running from 2026-2030, 2031-2035, and 2036-2040). In doing so, this plan sets a pathway towards Scotland achieving net zero by 2045.

Beyond the emissions reduction, this plan also sets out how these targets will be met in a way that maximises the opportunities of the transition and is fair for people across Scotland.

What are the proposals and policies within the CCP?

Policies and proposals within the CCP are broken down by each sector in the economy and society within which the action will be taken forward. The sectors referenced by this plan are specified by legislation[1]:

energy supply;

transport (including international aviation and shipping);

business and industrial process;

residential and public (in relation to buildings in those sectors);

waste management;

land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF); and

agriculture.

This CCP contains 163 policies and proposals aiming to meet 30 outcomes.

What is Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)?

Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is a means of systematically assessing the likely impact of a public plan on the environment and to seek ways to avoid, or minimise where possible adverse effects and enhance positive effects. SEA provides an opportunity for the public to consider this information and to use it to inform their views on the emerging proposals.

This Environmental Report sets out the findings of the assessment of the draft CCP. The Environmental Report has been published alongside the draft plan for public consultation.

The Environmental Report has been prepared in accordance with the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005. Views are invited on both the Environmental Report and the policies and proposals outlined in the consultation paper.

What is the current state of the environment?

Scotland’s environment is rich in natural and cultural heritage and our network of European protected sites also supports many important and rare plants, birds and animals. Global declines in biodiversity are however mirrored in Scotland. Scotland’s air, soil and water are generally in good condition, but there are concentrations of pollution in some parts of the country. Some of this is historic, but there are also on-going challenges, including diffuse pollution from urban and rural areas. A high-quality environment with good air, soil and water quality is an important contributor to population health and well-being.

Climate change is expected to lead to increases in water scarcity and flood risk across Scotland and will accelerate the rate of biodiversity loss.

Scotland has high quality landscapes, with many iconic views and scenic areas. Scotland also has many natural resources and material assets, including high quality agricultural land, and extensive areas of forestry and woodland. Scotland’s land use is dominated by agriculture and forestry, which together account for around 80% of total land cover. The historic environment includes world heritage sites, listed buildings, scheduled monuments, gardens and designed landscapes, battlefields, and conservation areas. The majority of the historic environment in Scotland is, however, undesignated.

How have reasonable alternatives been considered?

Consideration of alternatives was undertaken as the emerging plan developed. The extent to which alternatives for the CCP could be considered ‘reasonable’ was influenced by the legislative framework for the plan. The context for reasonable alternatives is limited by the requirements to meet ambitious statutory emissions reduction targets. Therefore, reasonable alternatives do not include consideration of a ‘do nothing’ scenario, as the CCP is a legislative requirement of The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. Based on the current legislative context, and the declared climate emergency, it was that the current ambition can only be to achieve the maximum emissions reductions possible, reflected across all sectors based on current technical and practical limitations, and it was therefore concluded that no reasonable alternative could be identified. Possible mitigation and enhancement has, however, been considered for each CCP sector where relevant and applicable and the findings from this assessment are presented in Section 4.

What are the likely environmental effects of the options assessed?

Buildings (Residential and Public)

Overall positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, air quality, and population and human health. The use of synthetic insulation materials, which have a high carbon footprint during production, may offset some of the positive effects for climatic factors. Potential localised negative effects were identified for biodiversity, soil and water. The cumulative impact of renewable technologies like solar panels and heat pumps may alter landscapes and affect the appearance of cultural heritage assets.

Transport

Overall positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, air quality, and population and human health. Mixed effects are anticipated for material assets as greater pressure may be put on the electricity grid from the expansion of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, requiring upgrades to be made to facilitate this transition. There is the potential for negative impacts on biodiversity and landscape depending on the source of biomass required to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and the harvesting practices utilised.

Waste

Positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, material assets, cultural heritage, landscape, air and biodiversity through various circular economy initiatives, improved waste services, and extended producer responsibility policies. Localised negative effects on soil may arise from the construction and operation of new waste facilities.

Energy Supply

Overall positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, air quality, population and human health and material assets. Integrating Energy from Waste (EfW) facilities into heat networks requires careful planning and coordination with local authorities and energy providers. It is assumed that existing regulatory regimes will ensure that any development projects will be subject to appropriate controls, minimising the potential for any negative impacts from such schemes.

Business and Industrial Process

Overall positive effects are anticipated for air, climatic factors, population and human health, and material assets. Potential negative effects were identified for biodiversity, landscape, and cultural heritage associated with retrofitting of industrial buildings and infrastructure changes for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).

Agriculture

Positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, soils, biodiversity, water, air quality, population and human health, material assets and landscapes. The effects of investigating and encouraging uptake of technologies for alternative, improved or more efficient fertilisers are considered to be uncertain as the level of uptake cannot yet be determined due to the early-stage of technological understanding. In undertaking this assessment it has been assumed that nature friendly farming may include practices such as growing organic produce and reduced tillage.

Land use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)

Positive effects are anticipated for climatic factors, soils, and biodiversity, primarily through peatland restoration, rewetting, and improved monitoring. Additional benefits for water, material assets, and population and human health may arise from peatlands’ water storage function. Potential negative effects on landscape and material assets could occur due to land use conflicts, such as the loss of productive agricultural land for woodland creation or peatland restoration.

How can any negative environmental effects be avoided, minimised or mitigated or positive effects enhanced?

Where relevant and appropriate, potential mitigation measures have been identified and include:

Supporting regional or landscape-scale coordination of actions and embedding sector-specific targets

Careful siting and design of industrial buildings, energy infrastructure and woodland creation schemes

Promotion of sustainable materials for construction and retrofit.

What monitoring is proposed?

Section 35B of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 requires Ministers to lay an annual progress report on each substantive chapter of the CCP.

A monitoring framework has been developed for the CCP which sets out indicators for each policy outcome and progress towards key milestones and targets. Delivery of every milestone in the CCP will contribute to reduction of emissions and many of the milestones relate to delivery of strategies, plans or policies which will have wider significant positive effects on the environment. Monitoring of progress towards key milestones and targets will therefore enable early identification of issues with delivery of positive environmental benefits and any unforeseen adverse effects. It is suggested that the monitoring of the environmental effects identified in this SEA combines the monitoring framework for the CCP with other key environmental indicators in order to identify potential correlation between progress towards outcomes and other unforeseen environmental changes, and to trigger further investigation of potential causation.

Policy documents linked to the SDGs contain ‘significantly more’ references to academic research than those related to other topics, it noted.

SDG-related policy

India leads the way in terms of using academic research to support SDG-related policy, with 41% of said documents citing such research. Some 28% of these citations are exclusively Indian-authored research, while 13% are international contributions.

According to the report, this reliance on academic research is due to India’s ‘strong public research ecosystem, where more than half of the research output originates from government-funded institutions, and the increasing presence of Indian experts on national policy advisory bodies’.

Other countries to report a high degree of academic research in SDG-related policy documents include Australia and Brazil.

On a global level, while 78% of the research cited in SDG-related policy comes from authors in the Global North, India and Brazil are notable exceptions, with domestic research more frequently cited in these markets.

Making an impact

“With just five years until the 2030 deadline for the SDGs, understanding how research informs policy is critical,” commented Nicola Jones, sirector, SDG Programme, Springer Nature. “We know science and research can solve problems, but only if it reaches decision makers.

The airline and the engineering firm’s announcement forms part of their commitment to accelerate sustainable energy solutions in aviation. Samsung E&A will build on existing feedstock capacity and infrastructure in the US with its engineering expertise. Meanwhile, Korean Air has signed to become a SAF buyer, ensuring critical long-term demand. Other airlines including Delta and Air France have struck similar agreements to nurture the SAF industry as it takes flight.

Samsung E&A is considering participating in a SAF project that uses gasification–Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology. This second-generation SAF fuels converts abundant woody waste into synthetic liquid fuel, a significant advance on first-generation processes that use limited supplies of waste cooking oil.

On the partnership with Samsung E&A, a spokesperson for Korean Air commented:

This partnership will further contribute to the aviation industry’s Net Zero 2050 goal and enhance our ability to effectively navigate evolving global environmental regulations, including SAF mandates. Through proactive project participation and continuous cooperation, we aim to accelerate global SAF adoption and advance our commitment to sustainable aviation and ESG management.

A report from IATA earlier this year found that SAF production is currently on track to fall 100 million tonnes short of net-zero emissions targets. The air transport association emphasise that investing in technology, not feedstock, was critical to ramping up sustainability efforts. If successful, Korean Air and Samsung’s new partnership will contribute directly to addressing this issue.

“Asia-Pacific airlines continue to demonstrate agility in managing supply chain constraints, with capacity growth keeping pace with demand.
The supply chain squeeze is worsened by ageing aircraft, rising shop-visit volumes, and a persistent labour shortage, with skilled engineers drawn to higher-paying hubs in the Middle East.
“When we look at supply chain pressures, there are many aspects to it.
He emphasised that building a resilient supply chain requires coordination across industry, finance, trade, and manpower agencies.","Asia-Pacific airlines are heading into 2026 with a strong performance outlook, but industry leaders warn that governments must shift from short-term tourism gains to long-term industrial competitiveness to sustain growth.

At the close of the 69th Assembly of Presidents in Bangkok, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) reported that carriers posted a 10 per cent rise in international passenger traffic in the first nine months of 2025, outpacing global averages and reinforcing confidence in the region’s recovery momentum.

“Asia-Pacific airlines continue to demonstrate agility in managing supply chain constraints, with capacity growth keeping pace with demand. However, Asia-Pacific economies are among the hardest hit by higher US tariffs. Further escalation of tariffs could exacerbate these bottlenecks,” noted AAPA director general Subhas Menon.

AAPA leaders also urged governments to strengthen maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) capacity and accelerate aviation manufacturing, warning that the region’s fragmented industrial footprint risks constraining future growth. While International Air Transport Association (IATA) data shows Asia-Pacific accounts for more than one-third of global passenger traffic, much of the world’s heavy maintenance and aviation manufacturing remains in North America and Europe, forcing airlines to route high-complexity engine work offshore.

The supply chain squeeze is worsened by ageing aircraft, rising shop-visit volumes, and a persistent labour shortage, with skilled engineers drawn to higher-paying hubs in the Middle East. Menon warned that without intervention, the region risks permanent constraints on growth.

“When we look at supply chain pressures, there are many aspects to it. But what can you do in the interim to improve the situation? For example, the region simply does not have enough MRO capacity, and only government investment and support can close that gap,” Menon stated.

Menon highlighted that some administrations still take aviation resilience for granted. He cited Asia’s prolonged pandemic border closures as an example of governments assuming airlines would cope, and warned that fragmented policymaking is emerging again, with MRO expansion, workforce development, industrial incentives, and regulatory measures pursued separately rather than strategically.

He emphasised that building a resilient supply chain requires coordination across industry, finance, trade, and manpower agencies. Signs of progress include Thailand’s coordinated approach to its one per cent SAF blend for 2026, involving the energy ministry, civil aviation authority, and fuel suppliers.

“From a long-term standpoint, if this is the largest air transport sector in the world, and the fastest growing, governments should take an interest in it and invest in the infrastructure that is needed for airlines to be able to support the growth. Yes, we do not have a common regulator, so it is a challenge. But that should not stop us from doing the right thing,” he summarised.

The Assembly adopted four resolutions, reaffirming the five per cent SAF target for 2030, urging governments to accelerate production, calling for investment incentives and harmonised regulations to expand MRO and manufacturing, endorsing stronger lithium battery safety measures, and cautioning against non–cost-related taxes that could undermine long-term growth.",https://ttgasia.2017.ttgasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AAPA-DG-Subhas-Menon-640.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 07:57:44.083193

“Our thesis is to accelerate low-carbon technology innovation by supporting first-of-a-kind pilot projects,” said Hao Xu, the company’s head of climate innovation.
Partners get products to market Alongside the financial support, Tencent is connecting winners with larger companies that can help bring products to market.
Another benefit: Carbon credits The funding is designed to drive decarbonization across multiple sectors, but Tencent is also using the competitions to accelerate its own net-zero journey.
Xu anticipates that some of the companies in the competitions will generate carbon credits that Tencent will sign offtake agreements for.","Chinese tech giant Tencent is investing tens of millions of dollars in innovation competitions in carbon removal and other areas as is it looks to cut emissions and define a role for itself as a sustainability leader.

The company, which generated revenues of $92 billion in 2024 from messaging and payments platform WeChat and other products, has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2030 — with credits used to neutralize ongoing emissions — and net zero by 2050. Major U.S. tech firms, including Microsoft and Google, have similar goals and, like Tencent, are focusing on renewable energy as a core strategy. But Tencent is taking a different path with its additional focus on prizes.

“Our thesis is to accelerate low-carbon technology innovation by supporting first-of-a-kind pilot projects,” said Hao Xu, the company’s head of climate innovation.

Tencent’s first competition, CarbonX 1.0, opened to Chinese companies in 2023. The call for proposals elicited 300 entrants, from which 13 winners were awarded a total of $13 million. Winners included a modular direct air capture system developed at Zhejiang University and technology developed by the startup Feynman Dynamics that converts carbon dioxide into sustainable aviation fuel.

The funding is designed to help young companies overcome the “valley of death” between laboratory work and commercialization — an issue Xu said Tencent identified as the “real bottleneck” to scaling emerging low-carbon technologies.

Partners get products to market

Alongside the financial support, Tencent is connecting winners with larger companies that can help bring products to market. One example: Suzhou Kunsheng Biodegradable New Material Company, which produces a foam for cushions made from captured carbon, is partnering with HAY, a Danish furniture maker that plans on using the foam in its products.

Last month, Tencent announced 50 finalists for CarbonX 2.0, a global competition with a $28-million prize pot that attracted more than 660 applicants from 54 countries. Entrants span CO2 removal, carbon capture in the steel industry, products made from captured carbon and long-duration energy storage. Product partners in this second phase include McDonald’s China and PepsiCo, with winners expected to be announced next year.

Another benefit: Carbon credits

The funding is designed to drive decarbonization across multiple sectors, but Tencent is also using the competitions to accelerate its own net-zero journey. To fulfill its 2030 carbon-neutral goal, for example, the company will need to retire around a million metric tons of carbon credits annually. Xu anticipates that some of the companies in the competitions will generate carbon credits that Tencent will sign offtake agreements for.

The company is also considering creating a third competition next year, likely smaller in scale, to incentivize commercialization of building materials, which would be used in the ongoing construction of its new headquarters in Shenzhen.

Tech-sector climate ambition

Companies in the U.S. and Europe also fund competitions, including a 2024 innovation challenge aimed at low-carbon materials that was backed by Microsoft. But the most prominent climate-related competitions have been led by XPRIZE, the nonprofit that oversaw a $100 million carbon removal prize and is now developing a methane mitigation competition. Tencent’s approach is notable in the private sector for both its scope and the size of the financial commitment.

The company’s investment in prizes extends its core climate strategy, which is focused on reducing emissions from data centers and other sources. Tencent’s commitment to cut operational emissions 70 percent by 2030 has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative, alongside its goal to shave 30 percent off emissions from suppliers, product use and other indirect sources in the same timeframe. Longer-term, it’s targeting a 90 percent reduction across all sources by 2050.

Together with Tencent’s 2030 carbon-neutral goal, these targets roughly match the ambition of U.S. tech companies that are seen as leaders on climate, including Google and Microsoft. But Xu argued that the tech sector must pass the baton soon.

“If you look at the decarbonization journey for the whole planet, technology companies shouldn’t be the major force simply because their emissions are limited in absolute terms,” he said. “But we are inspired to be the risk-takers. What we can do is to push the technology forward.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shutterstock-Image-2094870757.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 07:57:57.918680

Summary Singapore’s new SAF Levy adds yet another layer of costs to award redemptions from Changi Airport.","Singapore is set to introduce a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy that will add between S$1 and S$41.60 to every departing flight ticket from October 2026, making it the first country globally to impose such a charge.

ADVERTISEMENT

Coming on top of the 21% airport fee increases we covered last year, this new levy – applicable to tickets sold from 1st April 2026 – means award redemptions from the Lion City face a double whammy that will push cash costs beyond our earlier projections.

What is the new SAF Levy?

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced the levy rates on 10th November 2025. The levy supports Singapore’s goal of having 1% of jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports allocated as SAF – a renewable, low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel – by 2026, rising to 3 – 5% by 2030.

The charges vary based on two factors: your destination and cabin class.

Economy and Premium Economy passengers face lower fees than those in Business and First Class, with the premium cabin levy set at four times the economy rate, Singapore’s first travel-class-differentiated aviation tax.

SAF Levy Rates (from 1st October 2026)

Here are the SAF Levy rates, applicable on a per-passenger basis for air tickets departing from Singapore sold on or after 1st April 2026, for departures from Singapore from 1st October 2026 onwards.

Singapore SAF Levy

Premium Economy Business Class

First Class Band 1 Southeast Asia S$1.00 S$4.00 Band 2 NE Asia, South Asia, Australia, PNG S$2.80 S$11.20 Band 3 Africa, Central/West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands, NZ S$6.40 S$25.60 Band 4 Americas S$10.40 S$41.60

These fees will also be added to the cash element of award redemption tickets, and are in addition to the departure airport charges and taxes – currently set at S$65.20 per passenger but progressively increasing to S$79.20 per passenger in the coming years.

Carrier surcharges are also in addition when travelling on selected airlines, while on some routings, like Singapore – Australia, arrival taxes are also charged by the destination country.

Double whammy: Airport fees also increasing

Compounding the pain for award travellers, Changi is already raising passenger fees by 21% from April 2027 to April 2030, as we reported last year, lifting the current S$65.20 departure charge (Passenger Service / Security Fee, Aviation Levy and Airport Development Levy combined) to S$79.20.

This is designed to fund S$3 billion in projects like Terminal 3 upgrades and the eventual Terminal 5.

This means award redemptions will face a double hit: SAF Levy from October 2026, plus fee hikes from April 2027, pushing 2030 taxes for a New York Business Class ticket to S$145, over 60% more than today’s fees – assuming the SAF Levy does not change.

Impact on award redemptions

Let’s examine how these combined increases will affect popular award redemptions from Singapore. The following tables show the total taxes and fees payable on award tickets, including both the SAF Levy and the progressive airport charge increases.

Example: Band 1 Economy Class

Singapore to Southeast Asia

Economy / Premium Economy Period Airport Fees SAF Levy Total Taxes Current S$65.20 — S$65.20 Oct 2026 – Mar 2027 S$65.20 S$1.00 S$66.20 Apr 2027 – Mar 2028 S$70.20 S$1.00 S$71.20 Apr 2028 – Mar 2029 S$73.20 S$1.00 S$74.20 Apr 2029 – Mar 2030 S$76.20 S$1.00 S$77.20 From Apr 2030 S$79.20 S$1.00 S$80.20

Here the SAF Levy impact is minimal – by April 2030 taxes of S$80.20 are 23% higher than today, but 93% of that increase stems from already-announced airport fee hikes, only 7% is from the SAF Levy, which is only charged at S$1 on these routings.

For example, a Scoot Saver award SIN-PEN booked using KrisFlyer miles is currently priced at:

1,500 miles + S$65.20

For travel from 1st October 2026, booked on or after 1st April 2026, the price will be:

1,500 miles + S$66.20 (+2% cash element)

Example: Band 3 Business Class

Singapore to Europe

Business / First Class Period Airport Fees SAF Levy Total Taxes Current S$65.20 — S$65.20 Oct 2026 – Mar 2027 S$65.20 S$25.60 S$90.80 Apr 2027 – Mar 2028 S$70.20 S$25.60 S$95.80 Apr 2028 – Mar 2029 S$73.20 S$25.60 S$98.80 Apr 2029 – Mar 2030 S$76.20 S$25.60 S$101.80 From Apr 2030 S$79.20 S$25.60 S$104.80

On longer routes like London in Business Class the effect is more marked. Here a near-S$40 increase in taxes by April 2030 is only 35% attributable to airport fee hikes, 65% of the increase is down to the SAF Levy.

ADVERTISEMENT

For example, a Singapore Airlines Saver award SIN-LHR booked using KrisFlyer miles is currently priced at:

108,500 miles + S$65.20

For travel from 1st October 2026, booked on or after 1st April 2026, the price will be:

108,500 miles + S$90.80 (+39% cash element)

Example: Band 4 Business Class

Singapore to USA

Business / First Class Period Airport Fees* SAF Levy Total Taxes Current S$89.20 — S$89.20 Oct 2026 – Mar 2027 S$89.20 S$41.60 S$130.80 Apr 2027 – Mar 2028 S$94.20 S$41.60 S$135.80 Apr 2028 – Mar 2029 S$97.20 S$41.60 S$138.80 Apr 2029 – Mar 2030 S$100.20 S$41.60 S$141.80 From Apr 2030 S$103.20 S$41.60 S$144.80

* Includes USA arrival taxes of S$24, subject to change

Non-stop flights from Singapore to the USA are the hardest hit – already more expensive than most redemptions thanks to USA arrival taxes, and in Business Class a new S$41.60 SAF Levy kicks in from 1st October 2026.

For example, a Singapore Airlines Saver award SIN-LAX booked using KrisFlyer miles is currently priced at:

112,500 miles + S$89.20

For travel from 1st October 2026, booked on or after 1st April 2026, the price will be:

112,500 miles + S$130.80 (+47% cash element)

The impact represents a smaller proportion when redeeming award tickets with carriers that impose significant surcharges on top of mandatory taxes, like fuel surcharges or award segment fees.

For example, a Qatar Airways Business Class award from Singapore to London via Doha will increase in cost from 75,000 Avios + S$349.40 today, to 75,000 Avios + S$375.00 from 1st October 2026 (a 7% cash increase).

Similarly a British Airways Business Class award non-stop from Singapore to London will increase in cost from 110,000 Avios + S$289.80 today, to 110,000 Avios + S$315.40 from 1st October 2026 (a 9% cash increase).

Ironically, KrisFlyer members will therefore feel the biggest relative impact. While other programmes already sting with carrier surcharges that dwarf these new fees, Singapore Airlines’ surcharge-free awards mean members feel the full weight of the increase.

The transit passenger exemption

Here’s where it gets controversial: transit passengers won’t pay the SAF Levy at all. This exemption applies to around a third of Singapore Airlines’ passengers overall, who merely connect through the carrier’s Changi hub en-route from their origin to destination city.

On some SIA routes like London, transit passengers account for over 60% of passengers.

The decision makes commercial sense – Singapore needs to remain competitive as a transit hub competing with the likes of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha, and Hong Kong – but it creates an odd situation where Singapore residents effectively subsidise the costs of purchasing SAF for transit passengers, who fly alongside them on the same routes.

Higher taxes for premium cabins

With this levy, Singapore not only becomes the first country globally to impose a mandatory SAF Levy on passengers – a distinction that may not be entirely welcome – but also joins an exclusive club of jurisdictions that differentiate aviation taxation by travel class.

These include Hong Kong, the Maldives, the United Kingdom, and France.

The Business and First Class cabin multiplier of four times the Economy and Premium Economy rates for the upcoming SAF Levy is based on IATA’s Passenger CO2 Calculation Methodology.

How to avoid the levy (for now)

There’s a simple strategy to avoid the SAF Levy, at least temporarily: book your tickets before 1st April 2026, for any travel after 1st October 2026. The levy only applies to tickets sold from April 2026 onwards, regardless of how far beyond October 2026 you travel.

ADVERTISEMENT

However, with most airlines only selling tickets 11-12 months in advance, this window of opportunity is somewhat limited. For shorter regional routes in Economy where the levy is just S$1 or S$2.80, the extra effort is probably not worthwhile, unless your plans are definite.

But for that New York Business Class redemption? The S$41.60 saving per person could make it worth planning ahead.

Can you ‘game’ the system with a stopover?

You might think booking flights with stopovers could reduce the levy, since it’s only based on your flight’s immediate next destination, not your entire ticketed itinerary.

Technically true, flying Singapore – Hong Kong – San Francisco on Cathay Pacific will attract just S$2.80 / S$11.20 in SAF Levy, versus S$10.40 / S$41.60 for the non-stop Singapore – San Francisco Singapore Airlines or United Airlines flights.

The problem, however, is twofold:

It’s not free to transit through Hong Kong

Around S$37 / S$41 is payable in Economy / Business Class. This immediately outweighs any SAF Levy saving

Cathay Pacific applies a fuel surcharge on its award tickets

Currently set at around S$119 for a SIN-HKG-SFO routing

For Business Class, this brings the award cost to 115,000 Asia Miles + S$279.70, instead of 112,500 KrisFlyer miles + S$130.80. Yes, technically Singapore is collecting S$30.40 less in SAF Levy from your ticket – but it’s certainly not worth it since you are paying much more overall.

ADVERTISEMENT

In another example, choosing Finnair’s one-stop service from Singapore to New York via Helsinki attracts the Band 3 charge instead of Band 4 – an example that saves S$16 in Business Class SAF Levy versus Singapore Airlines’ non-stop service.

However, this award flight will cost you 125,000 Avios + S$187.60, compared to 117,000 KrisFlyer miles + S$130.80, because even though the SAF Levy will indeed be S$16.00 less, you’ll also be hit with:

Finnair’s fuel surcharge: S$22.60

Finland’s transfer passenger fee: S$9.30

Finland’s security charge: S$9.50

Finland’s air transport supervision charge: S$1.40

USA International arrival tax: S$30.00 (not applicable to SIA award tickets)

Net effect: Singapore will of course get S$16 less in SAF Levy from you, but you’ll pay S$56.80 more in total fees, not to mention the inconvenience of a Helsinki layover and the difference in miles outlay.

As you can see, any SAF savings from choosing stopovers are typically offset by additional airport taxes at the transit point.

There’s one exception we found, and that’s SIA’s Singapore – Tokyo – Los Angeles service (SQ12/11).

Taxes on this two-sector journey are only S$16.20 more than for the carrier’s Singapore – Los Angeles non-stop flights, because Japan applies minimal additional charges for international transit passengers.

= S$116.60 First Class n/a 154,000 miles

+ S$105.40

+ S$11.20 SAF

= S$116.60

That will make it S$14.20 cheaper to redeem in Business / First Class, once the SAF Levy kicks in (and of course this routing is your only SIA First Class option to Los Angeles anyway).

However, in Economy or Premium Economy it’s still slightly more expensive to stop in Narita – by S$8.60.

Region banding is odd – but logical

Singapore has also been clever in its band allocation for the SAF Levy.

Notice how the Middle East is lumped into Band 3 alongside Europe, despite Singapore – Dubai being shorter than Singapore – Sydney (Band 2)? This classification means passengers flying Middle East carriers (Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways) to Europe pay the same S$6.40 / S$25.60 SAF Levy as those on non-stop European services.

It’s likely a strategic move to prevent the Gulf carriers’ one-stop routings becoming more attractive from a cost perspective.

While that doesn’t particularly affect award tickets much (ME3 airlines add insane carrier charges to redemption tickets), Singapore Airlines in particular would be at a significant disadvantage if it had to charge a higher SAF Levy for cash tickets on non-stop Europe flights than Emirates did for the same routing via Dubai.

Beyond passenger flights: Cargo and private jets also hit

The levy extends beyond commercial passengers. Cargo shipments will pay S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram depending on destination, while private jets and business aviation face aircraft-based charges ranging from S$40 for small aircraft on regional routes to S$6,500 for large jets flying to the Americas.

What’s driving this charge?

CAAS positions the levy as essential for aviation sustainability, with funds going into a statutory SAF Fund managed solely for purchasing sustainable aviation fuel and environmental attributes. The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) will handle procurement and administration.

The timing is significant – while SAF production doubled last year, it still accounts for only 0.3% of global jet fuel volumes according to IATA. Singapore’s target of 1% by 2026, potentially rising to 3-5% by 2030, is ambitious given the limited global supply.

SAF currently costs three to four times more than traditional jet fuel.

ADVERTISEMENT

The rates announced are actually lower than initial estimates from early 2024, when CAAS projected S$3, S$6 and S$16 for Economy travel to Bangkok, Tokyo and London respectively.

The actual rates of S$1, S$2.80 and S$6.40 reflect lower prevailing SAF costs – though this silver lining may be temporary. Mr Han expects the levy to remain at current levels “for a few years” while the target stays at 1%.

Industry concerns

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has acknowledged the early announcement of Singapore’s SAF Levy as positive for planning purposes, but expressed concern about its potential “dampening effect on air travel”.

While IATA recognises that Singapore’s model may suit its unique circumstances – particularly its limited capacity to produce SAF domestically – the association is hesitant to recommend such a policy framework to other countries.

Nonetheless, Singapore Airlines has thrown its support behind the levy, stating it aligns with the SIA Group’s commitment to gradually increase sustainable aviation fuel use. Meanwhile, major logistics airlines DHL and FedEx are still assessing the impact on their cargo operations.

The bigger picture: Award costs climbing

For award travellers based in Singapore, these stacking fees will be another erosion of redemption value, a topic that’s fresh in many minds following a hike in KrisFlyer redemption rates that kicked in earlier this month.

By 2030, a Business Class award to Europe will attract over S$100 in taxes before even considering carrier surcharges or destination fees. Ultra long-haul Business Class redemptions to the Americas will see total taxes approaching S$145.

The levy is supposedly fixed while the SAF target remains at 1%, but CAAS has already signalled it will be reviewed when it increases to 3 – 5% by 2030.

Summary

Singapore’s new SAF Levy adds yet another layer of costs to award redemptions from Changi Airport. While the amounts seem modest in isolation – especially for short-haul Economy travel – they compound with the already-announced airport fee increases to create a bigger impact on redemption value, especially on longer routes.

For frequent flyers planning premium cabin long-haul redemptions, the strategy is to book before April 2026 where possible, but after that everyone will need to factor these increasing costs into their redemption calculations.

In Uzbekistan, 12,400 people are directly employed in aviation, generating USD 96.5 million in economic output, equal to 0.1% of total GDP. Additional benefits are generated by the wider supply chain, employee spending, and tourism activities, contributing a total of USD 795.5 million, or 0.9%, to GDP and supporting 128,000 jobs.

“Uzbekistan’s continued investment in new airport infrastructure, safety improvements, and in people have played a key role in supporting a resilient and robust aviation sector, strengthening the burgeoning tourism industry and foreign direct investment in the country. It is also key to developing the country’s attractiveness as a future east-west transit hub for both passengers and cargo,” said Rafael Schvartzman, IATA Regional Vice President for Europe.

Tourism directly supported by aviation contributes USD 282.9 million to the country’s GDP, while international tourists to Uzbekistan are estimated to contribute USD 2 billion annually to the wider economy through the purchase of goods and services from local businesses.

Uzbekistan has also played a growing role as a transit point for air cargo. IATA’s report shows that 66,600 tonnes of air cargo were transported through airports in Uzbekistan in 2023. With the opening of a dedicated cargo terminal at Tashkent Airport earlier this year and continued growth at Navoi’s dedicated cargo airport, further growth in cargo volumes is expected.

Key Priorities for Uzbekistan

The country's location in the heart of Central Asia offers strategic connectivity not just for neighboring states but also a link between Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe. This strategic location will drive not only greater investment in aviation infrastructure and employment but also spill over into the wider economy through tourism, trade, and foreign direct investment.

Policymakers should consider four key priorities for Uzbekistan’s aviation sector that would support its growth and attractiveness as a regional hub.

Global Standards: Alignment with global standards and best practice is vital. These standards—from safety to passenger processing—are the backbone of safe, affordable, and efficient air transport. It would also increase Uzbekistan’s attractiveness as a hub between Europe and Asia.

Infrastructure: While the construction of new airports in Tashkent, Bukhara, and Urgench will provide the capacity to support growth in passenger numbers and cargo volumes, it is critical to work with the industry to ensure cost competitiveness.

SAF Production and Energy Transition: Given Uzbekistan’s interest in producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), alignment with international standards incorporated into most major jet fuel regulations is a must. This will enable SAF produced in Uzbekistan to be used confidently by airlines and airports in other countries. While Uzbekistan can leverage its Gas-to-Liquids experience in the SAF transition, the focus should be on sourcing renewable or low-carbon gases to ensure the environmental integrity and international acceptance of its SAF production.

Investment in People: As the industry grows, there will be increased demand to upskill and retain a growing workforce needed to support a safe and efficient air transport industry.

Coal consumption is expected to peak around 2027, with demand from steel and building materials gradually declining.
Overall oil consumption will likely reach its peak around 2026, as the usage of refined oil products for fuel has already peaked and petrochemical feedstock demand will maintain moderate growth.","BEIJING, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- As China progresses towards its 2030 carbon-peaking target, the upcoming five years -- its next national planning cycle -- will be crucial. With coal and oil still at the heart of the energy system, they will be central to the country's climate efforts.

As ""work toward reaching peak consumption of coal and petroleum"" is part of the Communist Party of China Central Committee's recommendations for formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) unveiled last month, how will the world's largest energy consumer achieve this goal while ensuring energy security?

China's shift toward clean energy has gained momentum since 2020, when the country pledged to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The share of non-fossil fuels in the country's total energy consumption has risen in line with national targets, along with the establishment of the world's largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system.

In the next five years, China plans to accelerate building a new-type energy system, one in which non-fossil sources replace fossil fuels in a secure, reliable and orderly manner.

Following the principle of maintaining a stable energy supply, coal consumption will be gradually reduced, while the remaining use will be made cleaner and more efficient. At the same time, China will fast-track the development of major clean energy bases, including wind and solar power in the northwest, hydropower in the southwest, offshore wind farms, and coastal nuclear power projects. New energy sources such as biogas, sustainable aviation fuel and geothermal energy will be advanced based on local conditions.

As coal and oil consumption reach their respective peaks, related industries may face challenges. In response, China plans to optimize industrial layouts and structures, expanding the share of advanced capacity while gradually phasing out inefficient coal mining and oil refining.

Official projections suggest that by 2030, fossil fuels will account for less than 75 percent of total energy consumption.

Coal consumption is expected to peak around 2027, with demand from steel and building materials gradually declining. Overall oil consumption will likely reach its peak around 2026, as the usage of refined oil products for fuel has already peaked and petrochemical feedstock demand will maintain moderate growth.

Achieving carbon peaking is not the end. In September 2025, China unveiled its new Nationally Determined Contributions, setting ambitious goals for 2035, including reducing economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent to 10 percent from peak levels, increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to over 30 percent, and expanding the installed capacity of wind and solar power to over six times the 2020 levels.

Experts believe the new commitments mark China's entry into a more comprehensive and systematic phase of low-carbon, resilient development, strengthening the country's responsibility in tackling global climate change and injecting greater certainty and stability into international climate governance. ■",,N,,2025-11-24 05:56:47.121041

Dubai, United Arab Emirates: DHL Express, the world’s leading express and logistics services provider, has signed a strategic sustainability agreement with Landmark Group, marking a significant step forward in their mission to deliver carbon-neutral logistics across global trade lanes.

The partnership will see Landmark Group – which operates over 2,200 retail stores across 21 countries and employs more than 50,000 people regionally – use DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme to decarbonise its international air freight operations using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme represents a fundamental shift from traditional carbon offsetting models. Rather than compensating for emissions through external environment projects, the service reduces the carbon loan directly within the supply chain by replacing conventional jet fuel with SAF produced from renewable feedstocks.

Every tonne of SAF used through GoGreen Plus reduces lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil fuels. The carbon savings are independently verified and certified by accredited third party SGS, Société Générale de Surveillanceensuring full accountability and traceability for customers.

The collaboration was formalised at DHL's UAE Head Office in Dubai by Mahmoud Haj Hussein, Country Manager of DHL Express UAE, and Rajesh Garg, Group Chief Financial Officer & Chief Sustainability Officer at Landmark Group.

On the occasion, Mahmoud Haj Hussein commented, “DHL has committed to investing €7 billion globally in climate-neutral logistics by 2030, and partnerships like this demonstrate how we're translating that ambition into measurable action. Landmark Group's decision to adopt GoGreen Plus reflects how progressive enterprises are keen on moving the industry toward a net-zero future. We're proud to support their decarbonisation goals with logistics solutions that deliver transparency, credibility, and real impact.""

Rajesh Garg added, ""At Landmark Group, we are embedding sustainability into every aspect of our business and supply chain. Our partnership with DHL marks an important step in reducing our Scope 3 emissions and advancing our decarbonisation goals through credible solutions like Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Collaboration with forward-thinking partners is essential as we transition toward a net-zero future.”

The collaboration supports the UAE’s National Net Zero by 2050 Strategy, which aims to position the country as a global leader in climate action and sustainable economic development. By reducing Scope 3 emissions, which are often the largest and most difficult category for enterprises to address, the two organisations are contributing to systemic transformation required to meet national and global climate targets.

Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani said the mandate — currently being finalised with the transport ministry and industry stakeholders — would form the core policy guiding Malaysia’s long-term shift toward low-carbon jet fuel. He said it also marked a significant step in the country’s aviation decarbonisation efforts.

Johari said Malaysia’s SAF strategy is supported by the Malaysia Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint (MADB) and the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), both of which map out phased pathways to reduce emissions and identify SAF as a priority fuel for the aviation sector.

“To reinforce the commitment, we are working closely with stakeholders to introduce an initial one per cent SAF requirement for flights out of KLIA,” he said during a working visit to the EcoCeres Renewable Fuels Sdn Bhd biorefinery in Tanjung Langsat today.

Johari’s visit included a briefing on EcoCeres’ progress since the facility began SAF production in October. The company is preparing to ship its first batch to customers before the end of the year.

EcoCeres co-chairman James Tam, who hosted the minister and senior officials, said the milestone reflected years of engineering work and Malaysia’s growing capabilities in renewable fuel technologies.

“Our progress reflects years of innovation, teamwork and commitment in advancing Malaysia’s renewable fuel capabilities,” he said, adding that the Johor plant would play a central role in supporting the country’s energy-transition and global decarbonisation agenda.

The EcoCeres plant in Tanjung Langsat is Malaysia’s first SAF biorefinery and has a licensed annual production capacity of 350,000 tonnes. Equipped with integrated control and laboratory systems, the facility is expected to create strong downstream benefits as airlines and fuel suppliers prepare for tighter international emissions rules.

Johari said the growth of the plant supported Malaysia’s strategy to build a competitive low-carbon industry, adding that SAF development would help strengthen the country’s agri-commodity and biomass sectors.

This delivery is the first of 50 MAX aircraft that will go to its Thai unit under a larger $32 billion order held by Vietjet Group.

This marks a major step in Vietjet’s fleet-standardization strategy and gives the carrier access to one of the most capable narrowbodies on the market. The company aims to boost efficiency by building a more harmonized fleet across its operations, and this Boeing delivery signals that ambition is taking off in Thailand.

What We Know About This Deal

Vietjet’s first Boeing 737 MAX 8, registered as HS-VZA, arrived in Bangkok as part of a long-term plan: these 50 aircraft are being transferred to Vietjet Thailand from the group’s total order of 200 Boeing jets. According to Vietjet, the aircraft will begin operating on domestic routes first: the inaugural service is planned for Bangkok–Chiang Mai, followed by a launch on the Bangkok–Cam Ranh (Vietnam) route in December 2025. Following its entry into Thailand, the brand-new Boeing will also be used on international services

In 2026, it will also fly to Japan, South Korea, and China. The Boeing 737 MAX features new-generation LEAP-1B engines, advanced aerodynamics, and a cabin (with a Boeing Sky Interior) designed for comfort. Vietjet highlights the jet’s environmental credentials: it is compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and reduces carbon emissions by 15–20%, while also offering up to 50% lower noise levels, in line with ICAO guidelines, as reported by the Viet Nam News agency. Vietjet Chair Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said:

“The transfer of 50 modern and efficient Boeing 737-8 aircraft to Vietjet Thailand demonstrates our long-term commitment to sustainable aviation development in the region,”

The Broader Context

The Vietjet Group already took delivery of its first 737 MAX 8 in a September ceremony at Boeing’s delivery center in Seattle. However, it has not yet been operating the type commercially, with its Thai subsidiary set to debut the plane later this year. The remaining aircraft will be delivered gradually over the next three years.

The transfer deal for 50 aircraft to Vietjet Thailand was announced earlier in 2025 and formalized at a ceremony attended by both Vietnam’s and Thailand’s prime ministers. Under this agreement, Boeing is also supporting Thai Vietjet with pilot and engineer training, maintenance services, and other technical support to ensure smooth operations.

The Importance Of This Deal

For Vietjet Thailand, this shift toward Boeing MAX jets is transformational. The new aircraft expands the airline’s capacity, enabling it to scale up both domestic and international operations. The MAX’s greater range (up to 3,547.5 NM / 6,570 km, per Vietjet) opens up new route potential across Asia. Its current plan will see the first MAX-8 flying domestically in Thailand on the Bangkok–Chiang Mai route before launching cross-border service to Vietnam in December 2025.

Additional aircraft from the 50-jet order will arrive through 2028, enabling Vietjet Thailand to start new international services across Asia by early 2026. From a sustainability perspective, utilizing SAF-compatible MAX aircraft helps Vietjet align with global efforts to decarbonize aviation. The fuel efficiency and noise reduction could also enhance the airline’s reputation, and possibly its cost structure, as fuel remains a key cost for low-cost carriers.

At the macro level, this deal is part of a larger geopolitical and economic story. Vietjet’s Boeing order strengthens economic ties between Vietnam, Thailand, and the United States, and signals a significant evolution for Vietjet Thailand, from an all-Airbus low-cost carrier toward a more modern, fuel-efficient Boeing-powered airline poised for regional expansion.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-d-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-24 05:57:19.002459

Nawal Saini, Managing Partner and Head of Renewable Power & Transition, South Asia and the Middle East, Brookfield discussed with Moneycontrol in an exclusive conversation the firm’s growth strategy, boom in corporate demand for green power, the future of wind and storage along with the role of hydrogen, and why he believes India is poised to become a major global hub in renewables-related manufacturing.

Edited excerpts:

Q. Let’s start with the big picture. What is Brookfield’s long-term vision for the renewable energy business in India and globally?

Brookfield is one of the largest renewable energy platforms globally, with around $140 billion worth of AUM across solar, wind, hydro, pumped storage, battery storage, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture. We operate in over 50 countries across five continents, and what distinguishes us is the diversity of technologies and markets we operate in.

Three global forces are driving our growth — decarbonisation, de-globalisation and digitalization. Renewables and energy transition sit at the centre of all three. Clean energy is the cheapest form of energy. AI and data centres need vast amounts of power, which can be provided at scale by green power.

In India, our AUM is about $32 billion across infrastructure, renewable power & transition, real estate and private equity. When we began our renewables business here around 2018, we had roughly 300 MW of operating renewables. Today the portfolio is around 45 GW. Around 11–12 GW is operating, and 3 GW is coming online this year — which is nearly 10 percent of India's incremental power capacity. Next year the number is even bigger. We achieve this through our platforms, be it structured equity deals like Avaada, acquisitions like Cleanmax and Leap Green, and ground-up platforms like Evren, where we have committed over a billion dollars.

Q. How do you think about returns across acquisitions, greenfield projects and exits?

Our return philosophy is consistent, but the deployment strategy varies. After COVID, we raised $15 billion for the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I - then the world's largest transition fund. We since launched Brookfield Global Transition Fund II (BGTF II), which raised $20 billion in fund commitments and strategic capital, surpassing its predecessor to become the world’s largest private fund dedicated to the clean-energy transition. Recognizing the large and growing demand for decarbonisation solutions in emerging economies, Brookfield is doubling down on its presence in scaled emerging economies through the Brookfield-managed Climate Transition Fund (CTF), backed by a $1 billion commitment from ALTÉRRA to catalyze up to $5 billion for clean energy and transition investments.

A key element of these funds is additionality — fresh capacity creation. That’s why in India a large share of our capital goes into greenfield development: land, connectivity, PPAs and construction. At the same time, India has matured enough to allow capital recycling. We sold around 1.6 GW earlier this year, and with Cleanmax preparing for a public listing, more liquidity creation is likely. We back businesses that generate yield and also provide exit pathways for our LPs.

Q. Where is renewable-power demand coming from today — government discoms or corporates?

Both. Roughly 75 percent still comes from discoms, but the biggest structural shift is the explosion in corporate demand. Ten years ago, IPPs had to convince corporates to buy green power. Today corporates demand it. Boardrooms have taken clear net-zero positions. Export competitiveness now requires clean energy. And renewable power is simply the cheapest form of power, driving business competitiveness. Increasingly, manufacturers set up new projects in states where they can access green open-access power. That’s a fundamental behavioural shift in India’s industrial landscape.

Q. Solar has been the backbone of India’s renewable transition. How do you see wind, storage and other technologies evolving?

Solar will remain the dominant technology because it is mature, cost-competitive and quick to construct. But wind has a major role, especially for round-the-clock renewable supply. Solar peaks in the day; wind peaks in the evening. Batteries and pumped storage add another layer by giving predictability and dispatchability to renewable power. India will need over 300 GWh of battery storage over the next five to seven years, and as storage grows, renewable energy starts to behave more like baseload.

Q. Given the expected wind upcycle, are you actively evaluating acquisitions in that segment?

We evaluate every transaction. We play to our strength of being owner-operators and providing our portfolio companies the benefit of our scale, be it in the form of access to efficient capital, supply chain and procurement efficiencies or global corporate relationships. We can acquire platforms like Cleanmax and Leap Green and scale them or build large platforms from scratch like Evren. We focus on situations where our capital and operating expertise can accelerate growth.

Q. Several assets are currently on the block. How do you view valuations?

Valuation is always an art. The winning bidder pays the highest price, but that does not mean the value is wrong. They may have a competitive angle others don’t — maybe a PPA pipeline or the ability to contract an uncontracted asset. Different investors want different risk profiles: de-risked assets or under-construction assets. That diversity is healthy for the ecosystem and helps capital rotate.

Q. Earlier the big concern was PPAs not being honoured. Has that chapter closed?

Yes. India has moved beyond that phase. The sophistication of regulation here is world-class. Disputes happen everywhere in the world, but India has strong redressal mechanisms. After the LPS rules and court interventions, payment behaviour improved significantly. Large-scale private-sector capacity addition wouldn’t be possible if PPA sanctity were still a real concern.

Q. What about the recent noise on cancelled bids?

The government has clarified that. In India, stakeholders are heard, and better sense prevails. That clarity helps the sector move forward.

Q. How are you evaluating the green hydrogen and green ammonia opportunity?

We have been hearing about hydrogen for three to four years, and now with SECI issuing 15- to 20-year green ammonia contracts, the visibility is improving. These long-term contracts are essential to build the sector. India has strong natural advantages — some of the world’s cheapest renewable power, and strategic proximity to Japan and South Korea, which are major future buyers of green molecules. Hydrogen will scale the way solar scaled: slow at first, then rapidly once project structures mature. India also has an energy-security angle because green molecules reduce import dependence and save foreign exchange. Over time, this will add to the renewable-capacity requirements even further.

Q. Are you seriously evaluating investing in hydrogen?

We are constantly evaluating opportunities, including in partnership with molecule-side specialist. Hydrogen requires aligning electrons and molecules, which means additional technical complexity. But since 50 to 70 percent of hydrogen’s cost is renewable power — and that is what we are experts at. We will not take binary risks. We need a bankable contract, land, interconnect and tied-down project costs. If those fall into place, we can move quickly. Over the next three to four years, I expect us to be doing something meaningful in this space, maybe earlier.

Q. Are you using global learnings for this?

Absolutely. We evaluate hydrogen opportunities globally in Europe, the US and other markets. The learnings — contracting mechanisms, risk allocation, cost structures — are institutionalised within the firm. Those insights flow to India continuously and shape how we think about timing and execution.

Q. How are you approaching Make in India for renewables?

We were early movers. When we invested in Avaada, part of the capital went directly into setting up their manufacturing business. Avaada is now building nearly 8.5 GW of module capacity and 6 GW of cell capacity. Five years ago, India had only module assembly. Today we have cell and module lines, glass manufacturing is coming up, and backward integration is accelerating. In five years, India will likely have wafer and ingot capacity, and possibly even polysilicon manufacturing. India has the raw materials, the engineering talent and now the policy push to support this.

Q. Is transmission keeping pace with renewable growth?

Transmission tends to lag renewables because renewables are fast to build and transmission is relatively slow and complex. Rajasthan is an example where renewable capacity has come up faster than evacuation. This is not a demand problem — India has demand. It is a timing and infrastructure-execution issue. As storage capacity grows, some of these stresses will ease because excess power can be stored.

Q. What drives your expansion in Andhra Pradesh?

We are present in all major renewable-generating states, and Andhra Pradesh is one of them. We recently signed an MOU with the Andhra Pradesh government to invest up to $12 billion in renewable energy projects across the state. Brookﬁeld will develop, construct, and operate a diversiﬁed portfolio of solar, wind and storage projects. We have already commenced development and construction works for projects worth over US$ 2.5 billion, and we have the pipeline to do more in the state.

Existing regulations do not yet set out specifications or enforcement mechanisms for E15, despite the fuel having been authorised under recently passed legislation (AB 30) and used safely across the United States for the past 14 years.

In written comments submitted to CARB, ACE’s Chief Marketing Officer, Ron Lamberty, called on the Board to issue a clear statement confirming that E15 sales are permitted and to publish implementation guidance without delay.

“We urge CARB to move quickly with a clear statement that the sale of E15 is allowed in California, and provide guidance promptly, so California fuel marketers can begin offering the low-cost and clean fuel to consumers immediately,” Lamberty said.

He stressed that E15’s safety and compatibility are already well proven through extensive research by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, as well as more than a decade of day-to-day use by millions of motorists.

“E15 is no longer a new, untested product. We now have 14 years of safe, real-world use in unmodified tanks, lines, and dispensers at thousands of retail stations,” he added.

ACE is urging CARB to classify E15 as a standard petrol grade, in line with federal treatment, warning that categorising it as an alternative fuel would drive up retailer costs, create confusion for drivers, and weaken the potential air-quality benefits for California.

The organisation also highlighted evidence that much of California’s fuelling infrastructure is already compatible with E15. ACE’s Flex Check tool, available at flexfuelforward.com, helps retailers verify whether existing tanks, lines, dispensers, and hardware can safely handle the blend.

According to Lamberty, “the short answer is there should be little or no cost for the majority of California’s fuel terminals and retailers.”

It can cut aviation emissions without requiring changes to aircraft or airport facilities.
EcoCeres Renewable Fuels Sdn Bhd, the country’s first SAF producer, has been supplying commercial-grade fuel from its Tanjung Langsat plant since October.
The facility is capable of producing up to 350,000 tonnes of SAF per year, establishing Malaysia as an emerging supplier of low-carbon aviation fuel in the region.
“To strengthen our commitment, the ministry is working with industry players and the transport ministry to introduce a national SAF blending mandate.","Pasir Gudang: Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani said Malaysia’s first commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) represents a major step in the country’s efforts to reduce aviation emissions and strengthen its position in the regional clean-fuel market, reports New Straits Times.

He said the launch comes at the right time, as sectors that are difficult to decarbonise — especially aviation — face increasing pressure to meet global net-zero goals.

“To achieve our national targets, we must also address high-emission sectors, including aviation.

“Globally, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and SAF has been identified as a key way to reduce emissions in this industry,” Johari said during his working visit to the facility today.

Malaysia has committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 under the Paris Agreement.

SAF is a low-carbon jet fuel made from waste and renewable materials. It can cut aviation emissions without requiring changes to aircraft or airport facilities.

EcoCeres Renewable Fuels Sdn Bhd, the country’s first SAF producer, has been supplying commercial-grade fuel from its Tanjung Langsat plant since October. The facility is capable of producing up to 350,000 tonnes of SAF per year, establishing Malaysia as an emerging supplier of low-carbon aviation fuel in the region.

Those present at the launch included the ministry’s secretary-general Datuk Yusran Shah Mohd Yusof; Biomass and Biofuel Division undersecretary Dr Sang Yew Ngin; EcoCeres co-chairman James Tam; and executive vice-president Dannis Poon.

Johari noted that several national policy documents support the SAF initiative, such as the Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint and the National Energy Transition Roadmap, which lay out phased plans to cut emissions in the aviation sector and place SAF at the centre of these efforts.

“To strengthen our commitment, the ministry is working with industry players and the transport ministry to introduce a national SAF blending mandate. The plan includes an initial requirement of 1 per cent SAF for flights departing Kuala Lumpur International Airport,” he said.

He also said that securing enough raw materials will be essential.

“Malaysia has identified used cooking oil (UCO) as the main raw material to maximise emissions reduction. Since July 2023, an awareness campaign with Petronas Dagangan Bhd has collected more than 1,200 tonnes of UCO from nearly 66,000 Malaysians at 89 collection stations.

“This shows that households can earn extra income while supporting the circular economy. We must continue expanding our collection network and include other raw materials such as empty fruit bunch (EFB) oil and palm oil mill effluent (POME) oil to meet rising demand,” he said.

EcoCeres’ plant is the first in Malaysia to produce SAF certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) for both ICAO’s global emissions scheme and the European Union.

With an investment of more than US$800 million (RM3.31 billion) and over 300 jobs created, Johari said the plant’s wider economic impact will help strengthen the country’s biofuel and biomass sectors.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-11.png,N,,2025-11-24 05:58:34.176893

The newly released COP30 draft text omits any direct mention of fossil fuels, raising alarm among climate advocates and investors. As this softens the language, the net-zero signal, on which companies need a coordinated global message to base their corporate transition planning, is weakened. Observers say the lack of mention of fossil fuels could delay the momentum toward decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors such as energy, transport, and heavy industry.

With negotiations still in flux, the draft underlined tensions between climate diplomacy and political compromise, leaving businesses and investors in limbo. Businesses may have to intensify internal targets and independently verifiable strategies, rather than rely on international mandates. The development underlined that proactive transition planning and transparent sustainability reporting are increasingly crucial as global climate signals unfold.

US government pullback from climate science fuels boom for private data firms

The retreat of the U.S. government from public climate science and growing political pressure on NOAA and NASA have opened a widening gap that private companies are rapidly moving to fill. Constrained federal programs have led corporations to turn to commercial climate-risk platforms, advanced modeling tools, and proprietary datasets to inform decisions across insurance, infrastructure, agriculture, and energy, among other sectors. This has accelerated the rise of private climate-intelligence firms offering high-resolution projections and disaster-risk analytics well beyond traditional government data.

But the proliferation of for-profit providers has raised significant questions about the privatization of critical climate information. The use of paywalled datasets would reduce access for communities and smaller organizations, undermining what once was considered a public good. As financial and market pressures intensify, many warn that an increasing reliance on unregulated, opaque commercial models could weaken rather than strengthen transparency in the disclosure of climate-related risk. As the U.S. steps away from its decades-long leadership in federal climate science, a central question now emerges: Who will own and control the climate data that will shape resilience?

Companies navigating climate-risk data gaps can leverage ESG tools to make informed, resilient sustainability decisions.

Vietjet’s delivery of Thailand’s first Boeing 737-8 marks a significant milestone in the country’s aviation history, as the aircraft ushers in a new era of sustainable travel. This move is set to enhance Vietjet’s services to the US and Philippines markets, with the fuel-efficient Boeing 737-8 offering a reduced environmental footprint while expanding the airline’s capacity. By incorporating this next-generation aircraft, Vietjet not only bolsters its commitment to sustainability but also positions itself as a leader in modern aviation in the region.

Vietjet has marked a significant milestone in its fleet development with the delivery of its first Boeing 737-8, the first of 200 aircraft ordered in a monumental $32 billion deal. This new addition represents a key step in Vietjet’s strategy to standardize its fleet, increase operational efficiency, and support its expansion as a major international airline group. As part of the airline’s long-term vision, this aircraft is set to play a central role in Vietjet’s efforts to boost its capacity, meet rising travel demand, and expand its network across key Asia-Pacific destinations.

The first Boeing 737-8 landed at Suvarnabhumi International Airport, marking the beginning of Vietjet Thailand’s incorporation of Boeing jets into its fleet. The airline is slated to receive a total of 50 Boeing jets by 2028. This first aircraft will not only contribute to the carrier’s capacity to serve current routes but also help Vietjet accommodate the growing passenger demand as the airline looks to expand into new markets and strengthen its position as a leading player in the aviation industry.

Vietjet Thailand plans to deploy its new Boeing 737-8 on the popular Bangkok-Chiang Mai domestic route.

With five return flights per week, the new service will enhance travel experiences and increase connectivity between Vietnam, the Philippines, and the broader Asia-Pacific region.

Manila, the capital of the Philippines, has become increasingly popular among international travelers due to its blend of history, culture, and modern amenities. Visitors can explore the UNESCO-listed Intramuros old town, a historic district rich in colonial-era architecture, or visit iconic landmarks such as Baroque churches and the bustling Mall of Asia. Manila is a unique destination that offers both cultural exploration and the excitement of modern city life.

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietjet’s home base, is Vietnam’s economic and cultural hub. The city offers visitors a lively mix of modernity and tradition, with landmarks such as Nguyễn Huệ Walking Street, the Notre Dame Cathedral, and Bến Thành Market, one of the city’s most famous markets. The vibrant food scene, with its unique mix of local and international cuisine, further strengthens the city’s appeal to tourists and travelers alike. Ho Chi Minh City is a gateway to the rich cultural experiences of Vietnam and continues to grow as a center for business, tourism, and innovation.

The combination of cutting-edge fleet enhancements with new route expansions is positioning Vietjet as a key player in the regional aviation market. The new Boeing jets and the recent addition of the Ho Chi Minh City-Manila service reflect Vietjet’s forward-thinking approach, combining fleet modernization with increased network connectivity to meet the growing demand for travel in Asia and beyond. As the airline continues to innovate and expand, it remains committed to providing travelers with affordable, high-quality, and sustainable flight options, ensuring that it remains a top choice for passengers in the region.

Complete Interview with David Stribley

1. What inspired you to co-found HAMR Energy?

David Stribley: We established HAMR Energy several years ago with a clear objective—to help our customers access the low-carbon fuels they’ll need for the future. Our mission is twofold: to accelerate their decarbonization journey and to support them in meeting growing regulatory requirements. We noticed that many fuel users face a significant challenge: they are under increasing pressure to reduce emissions and comply with regulations, yet often lack reliable access to renewable fuel alternatives. HAMR Energy was founded to bridge this gap—by producing low-carbon fuels at scale, at competitive costs, and by ensuring that our customers can transition smoothly to sustainable energy solutions.

2. Question: What did your first pitch to investors sound like, and how did they react to your vision?

David Stribley: Our vision is shaped by the understanding that decarbonization is inevitable, though not a linear journey. Around 30% of global primary energy still comes from liquid fuels—a segment that’s seen little progress compared to electricity, where solar, batteries, hydro, and nuclear have driven major advances.

Sectors like aviation, shipping, heavy industry, and chemicals will continue relying on liquid fuels for the foreseeable future. This presents a huge opportunity, as many customers in these industries now seek support to access low-carbon solutions. That’s exactly why HAMR Energy exists—to help bridge this gap and drive the decarbonization of liquid fuels.

3. You have worked for ExxonMobil. Which lessons from your ExxonMobil days do you find yourself applying to most at HAMR Energy?

David Stribley: Our time at ExxonMobil gave us a strong foundation. Both my co-founder and I learned the importance of executing large-scale, capital-intensive projects with discipline—a hallmark of Exxon’s approach. We also learned to stay customer-focused; there’s no point developing a product that doesn’t meet real market needs.

Equally important is ensuring strong industrial logic—working where the right resources and conditions exist, rather than pushing uphill. And finally, having a deep technical understanding is essential. You must truly know the technology behind the projects you’re delivering.

4. What have been some defining challenges in leading HAMR Energy?

David Stribley: We’ve learned a lot along the way, and our main challenges haven’t been technical. The technology to produce sustainable fuels already exists, and through partners like ThyssenKrupp, we’re working with proven, bankable solutions.

The real challenge lies within the market itself, as sustainable aviation fuel and low carbon methanol remain emerging commodities without an established trading ecosystem. That uncertainty—around pricing, demand, and long-term outlook—makes it difficult to plan. The whole industry is facing the same question: how do you build a Commodity-scale product when the future market is still taking shape?

5. Could you explain how HAMR Energy’s renewable methanol technology works, and what differentiates it from competitors in the market?

David Stribley: Our approach integrates biomass gasification with green hydrogen. This hybrid pathway offers the cost advantage of bio-projects with the scalability of e-fuel projects. It enables us to produce renewable methanol efficiently, supplying multiple sectors—from shipping and aviation to chemicals—while maintaining cost competitiveness. We combine advanced technology with resource advantage. Our Portland Project is based in Australia’s largest forestry region, giving us access to abundant, underutilized biomass and renewable power. Its proximity to a deep-water port strengthens export logistics. This alignment of resource, technology, and location gives us a clear edge.

6. How do you see this technology evolving over the next five years?

David Stribley: It’s a really interesting space. Looking at how oil and gas production has evolved over the past 50–60 years, you can see that once facilities are operational, there’s significant room for optimization—whether it’s switching to lower-cost feedstocks or improving efficiency.

For example, we’re starting to explore how electrolyzers interact with variable energy grids, which presents exciting optimization opportunities we haven’t fully tapped yet. We’re also collaborating with technology companies, like Supercritical in the UK, to make electrolyzers more efficient.

Overall, I expect a lot of innovation around these building blocks, and the real challenge will be integrating them effectively into a single, optimized system.

7. What are the biggest technical hurdles HAMR Energy has faced in developing large-scale low-carbon fuel projects?

David Stribley: While the technical building blocks for projects like this are well-established—gasification, electrolysis, and methanol production have all been around for decades—the bigger challenges lie in the commercial side.

Specifically, it’s about securing offtake agreements in emerging markets. There are customers interested, but giving them the confidence to commit long-term is difficult when the market outlook for 2035–2040 is still uncertain.

The real challenge is integrating the commercial and technical elements—they must work together. It’s not just about perfecting the technology; the technical and commercial aspects need to align seamlessly for the project to succeed.

8. Tell us about the Portland Renewable Fuels Project, its significance, and how it will influence local jobs and regional development.

David Stribley: The Portland project is our flagship low carbon methanol development and one of the largest low-carbon fuel projects in Australia. When completed around 2030, it will produce 300,000 tonnes of green methanol annually, using second-generation lignocellulosic biomass and green hydrogen. If used as a fuel, it will abate over 320,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

What makes the Portland project unique is its positive impact on regional communities. Since biomass feedstock is sourced locally, it supports regional economies, creating about 80 full-time jobs across forestry, transport, port, and export sectors, and over 200 jobs during construction.

The project is versatile, capable of decarbonizing multiple sectors, including maritime—where many vessels are now dual-fuel methanol—chemical industries such as adhesives, and aviation through our methanol-to-jet plant. Its scale, technological approach, and regional benefits make it a major milestone in Australia’s low-carbon fuel transition.

9. HAMR Energy plans to build Australia’s first large-scale methanol-to-jet fuel facility. How will this transform aviation?

David Stribley: Our methanol-to-jet project builds on Portland’s foundation. It uses a hub-and-spoke model, centralizing upgrading where demand is strongest—such as Melbourne. This modular approach allows us to scale production in line with aviation’s gradual adoption of SAF, ensuring flexibility and resilience as the market matures.

10. What key partnerships have enabled HAMR Energy to scale?

David Stribley: We believe partnerships are critical in this space. For our gasification-to-methanol project, we’ve partnered with Thyssenkrupp Uhde in Germany as our primary licensor, and we’ve recently completed pre-FEED with them. Feedstock supply is also essential, so we’ve partnered with forestry companies including one of Australia’s largest One Forty One, which has assets across Australia and New Zealand.

We’re also working closely with Honeywell on our Methanol-to-Jet process, and hope to announce offtake partnerships soon. For us, partnerships must create mutual value—together, we can achieve more than we could separately. If a partner doesn’t benefit, the relationship isn’t meaningful. In this sector, strong, value-driven collaborations are vital to success.

11. How do you see initiatives like the Cleaner Fuel Program shaping the renewable fuel sector in Australia and Asia-Pacific?

David Stribley: It’s a very exciting time. Over the past six months, we’ve seen significant momentum in the sector, driven by both government support and growing market demand. Programs like Australia’s $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels initiative, the $250 million Low Carbon Liquid Fuels Fund through ARENA, and Hydrogen Head Start 2.0 are clear signals that the government recognizes the critical role of transportation in the region and the need for a decarbonization pathway.

What’s particularly encouraging is that we’re now seeing demand-side drivers as well, including greenhouse gas targets from the International Maritime Organization and sustainable aviation fuel targets across Southeast Asia by 2030. This combination of government incentives on the production side and strong emerging demand creates a substantial supply-demand gap—and presents enormous opportunities for scaling low-carbon fuels. It’s an exciting moment as both sides of the equation begin to align.

12. How do you balance sustainability goals with commercial realities?

David Stribley: At the end of the day, we are a commercial enterprise. While sustainability and decarbonization are important, our primary focus is producing the best product for our customers at the right price.

We see a clear market gap for low-carbon liquid fuels, driven partly by customer incentives and partly by regulatory compliance requirements. Meeting these needs while maintaining commercial viability is central to our approach.

13. How is HAMR Energy preparing for potential market disruptions or shifts in technology?

David Stribley: Early in our strategy, we chose methanol because of its versatility across multiple markets. For example, our methanol-to-jet plant could face low demand in aviation during events like a pandemic, but at the same time, shipping demand might surge. Having multiple, decoupled markets provides strategic resilience and helps manage market risks.

Methanol also benefits from a strong existing fossil-based market, giving a stable underpinning while the low-carbon sector scales. Additionally, our customers make long-term investment decisions—vessel operators, for instance, may order ships today that won’t be delivered until 2028 and will operate for 25+ years. Our designs need to be robust for current and future technologies, such as electrolyzers, while reflecting long-term macro drivers and capital deployment trends that will persist into the 2040s.

14. Where do you see the greatest opportunities and risks for renewable energy development in Australia and Asia Pacific region over the next five years?

David Stribley: Our greatest opportunity—and risk—is timing. Regions like Australia have a unique advantage: abundant, underutilized biomass and access to renewable power, combined with proven technology. This gives us everything needed to develop low-carbon liquid fuels at scale.

The risk is moving too slowly. By 2030, demand for sustainable aviation fuel and IMO targets for shipping will ramp up significantly. If Australia doesn’t act quickly, we risk missing the chance to establish a local low-carbon fuels market, losing both economic opportunity and potential GDP benefits. Delaying action means others will fill the gap, and we’ll end up paying the cost as consumers without capturing the economic upside. Timing is critical.

15. What advice would you give emerging entrepreneurs in clean energy, and should future founders focus on technical innovation, industry networking, or both?

David Stribley: First and foremost, start with your customers. You can have the best idea in the world, but if it doesn’t solve a real problem or meet a genuine need, it will remain just an idea. Talk to your customers—understand what they want, the challenges they face, and how you can support them through the energy transition. It’s important to recognize that this transition is complex and uncertain for many businesses, so patience and empathy are essential.

Perseverance and patience are also key. The energy transition isn’t a straight path—it will have ups and downs. What matters is staying committed to the direction we’re heading, celebrating small wins, and learning from the setbacks along the way.

Finally, I’d say industry networking is just as important as technical innovation. While new technologies will continue to emerge, much of what we need to decarbonize already exists today. What we need now is stronger collaboration, customer engagement, and real-world deployment. Networking helps align solutions with market needs—because without customer offtakes and partnerships, the transition simply won’t happen.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-24 01:56:49.786490

According to the IBA, India currently burns around 7.3 million tonnes of paddy straw, mostly in North Indian states. But the association says this same amount of straw can be used to produce Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) worth about INR 270 crore (USD 30.2 million) every year.

In a statement, the IBA said the latest anaerobic digestion technologies can “efficiently convert this agricultural residue into Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG), which can directly replace imported natural gas”, as quoted by the Press Trust of India.

The association also pointed out that paddy straw is rich in cellulose, nearly 40 percent, which makes it suitable for producing bioethanol. It claimed that this can help India achieve import substitution worth INR 1,600 crore. Even the remaining part, which is lignin, can be turned into “high-value products, such as polymers, activated carbon, Graphene and resins”. Renewable energy is a huge part of India’s ambitious goal. The country said it is planning a massive clean energy investments of USD 150 billion by 2030.

India, in January 2026, is scheduled to host the 4th edition of India Energy Week, drawing in over 75,000 energy professionals from over 12 countries. The mega assembly will take place in Goa from January 27 to 30.

IBA Chairman Gaurav Kedia said the upcoming biogas policy could give a big push to the sector. “This policy is likely to attract investments of Rs 37,500 crore and facilitate the setting up of 750 CBG projects in the country by 2028-29. More significantly, this represents an import-substituting move toward LNG, ensuring savings in precious foreign exchange by building energy security from domestic resources. Parallel goals of Sustainable Aviation Fuel include 1 per cent blending for international flights by 2027, further expanding the bioeconomy landscape,” he said.

The association stressed that the way paddy straw is seen today needs to change. It said farmers burning the residue cause big pollution spikes every year. “The conventional perception of paddy straw as waste represents a failure of imagination,” it said, adding that burning one tonne of straw releases about 1,460 kg of carbon dioxide, 60 kg of carbon monoxide and 3 kg of particulate matter into the atmosphere.

IBA says India must adopt innovative technologies so that the straw becomes a resource instead of a pollutant. It also said that some solutions are already visible, including strategic plantation around North Indian cities and highways. Mature trees can absorb around 22 kg of CO2 every year and filter particulate matter, giving a natural shield against pollution.

Citing Delhi as an example, the IBA said the capital has shown what large-scale greening can do, planting more than 2.5 million saplings in 2023. It added that Miyawaki forests, highway green corridors and community “Adopt a Tree” programmes together can create a strong natural defence system for cities.

Around 11–12 GW is operating, and 3 GW is coming online this year — which is nearly 10 percent of India's incremental power capacity.
Ten years ago, IPPs had to convince corporates to buy green power.
But since 50 to 70 percent of hydrogen’s cost is renewable power — and that is what we are experts at.
Rajasthan is an example where renewable capacity has come up faster than evacuation.","Brookfield is one of the largest renewable energy platforms globally, with around $140 billion worth of AUM across solar, wind, hydro, pumped storage, battery storage, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture. We operate in over 50 countries across five continents, and what distinguishes us is the diversity of technologies and markets we operate in.

Three global forces are driving our growth — decarbonisation, de-globalisation and digitalization. Renewables and energy transition sit at the centre of all three. Clean energy is the cheapest form of energy. AI and data centres need vast amounts of power, which can be provided at scale by green power.

In India, our AUM is about $32 billion across infrastructure, renewable power & transition, real estate and private equity. When we began our renewables business here around 2018, we had roughly 300 MW of operating renewables. Today the portfolio is around 45 GW. Around 11–12 GW is operating, and 3 GW is coming online this year — which is nearly 10 percent of India's incremental power capacity. Next year the number is even bigger. We achieve this through our platforms, be it structured equity deals like Avaada, acquisitions like Cleanmax and Leap Green, and ground-up platforms like Evren, where we have committed over a billion dollars.

Q. How do you think about returns across acquisitions, greenfield projects and exits?

Our return philosophy is consistent, but the deployment strategy varies. After COVID, we raised $15 billion for the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I - then the world's largest transition fund. We since launched Brookfield Global Transition Fund II (BGTF II), which raised $20 billion in fund commitments and strategic capital, surpassing its predecessor to become the world’s largest private fund dedicated to the clean-energy transition. Recognizing the large and growing demand for decarbonisation solutions in emerging economies, Brookfield is doubling down on its presence in scaled emerging economies through the Brookfield-managed Climate Transition Fund (CTF), backed by a $1 billion commitment from ALTÉRRA to catalyze up to $5 billion for clean energy and transition investments.

A key element of these funds is additionality — fresh capacity creation. That’s why in India a large share of our capital goes into greenfield development: land, connectivity, PPAs and construction. At the same time, India has matured enough to allow capital recycling. We sold around 1.6 GW earlier this year, and with Cleanmax preparing for a public listing, more liquidity creation is likely. We back businesses that generate yield and also provide exit pathways for our LPs.

Q. Where is renewable-power demand coming from today — government discoms or corporates?

Both. Roughly 75 percent still comes from discoms, but the biggest structural shift is the explosion in corporate demand. Ten years ago, IPPs had to convince corporates to buy green power. Today corporates demand it. Boardrooms have taken clear net-zero positions. Export competitiveness now requires clean energy. And renewable power is simply the cheapest form of power, driving business competitiveness. Increasingly, manufacturers set up new projects in states where they can access green open-access power. That’s a fundamental behavioural shift in India’s industrial landscape.

Q. Solar has been the backbone of India’s renewable transition. How do you see wind, storage and other technologies evolving?

Solar will remain the dominant technology because it is mature, cost-competitive and quick to construct. But wind has a major role, especially for round-the-clock renewable supply. Solar peaks in the day; wind peaks in the evening. Batteries and pumped storage add another layer by giving predictability and dispatchability to renewable power. India will need over 300 GWh of battery storage over the next five to seven years, and as storage grows, renewable energy starts to behave more like baseload.

Q. Given the expected wind upcycle, are you actively evaluating acquisitions in that segment?

We evaluate every transaction. We play to our strength of being owner-operators and providing our portfolio companies the benefit of our scale, be it in the form of access to efficient capital, supply chain and procurement efficiencies or global corporate relationships. We can acquire platforms like Cleanmax and Leap Green and scale them or build large platforms from scratch like Evren. We focus on situations where our capital and operating expertise can accelerate growth.

Q. Several assets are currently on the block. How do you view valuations?

Valuation is always an art. The winning bidder pays the highest price, but that does not mean the value is wrong. They may have a competitive angle others don’t — maybe a PPA pipeline or the ability to contract an uncontracted asset. Different investors want different risk profiles: de-risked assets or under-construction assets. That diversity is healthy for the ecosystem and helps capital rotate.

Q. Earlier the big concern was PPAs not being honoured. Has that chapter closed?

Yes. India has moved beyond that phase. The sophistication of regulation here is world-class. Disputes happen everywhere in the world, but India has strong redressal mechanisms. After the LPS rules and court interventions, payment behaviour improved significantly. Large-scale private-sector capacity addition wouldn’t be possible if PPA sanctity were still a real concern.

Q. What about the recent noise on cancelled bids?

The government has clarified that. In India, stakeholders are heard, and better sense prevails. That clarity helps the sector move forward.

Q. How are you evaluating the green hydrogen and green ammonia opportunity?

We have been hearing about hydrogen for three to four years, and now with SECI issuing 15- to 20-year green ammonia contracts, the visibility is improving. These long-term contracts are essential to build the sector. India has strong natural advantages — some of the world’s cheapest renewable power, and strategic proximity to Japan and South Korea, which are major future buyers of green molecules. Hydrogen will scale the way solar scaled: slow at first, then rapidly once project structures mature. India also has an energy-security angle because green molecules reduce import dependence and save foreign exchange. Over time, this will add to the renewable-capacity requirements even further.

Q. Are you seriously evaluating investing in hydrogen?

We are constantly evaluating opportunities, including in partnership with molecule-side specialist. Hydrogen requires aligning electrons and molecules, which means additional technical complexity. But since 50 to 70 percent of hydrogen’s cost is renewable power — and that is what we are experts at. We will not take binary risks. We need a bankable contract, land, interconnect and tied-down project costs. If those fall into place, we can move quickly. Over the next three to four years, I expect us to be doing something meaningful in this space, maybe earlier.

Q. Are you using global learnings for this?

Absolutely. We evaluate hydrogen opportunities globally in Europe, the US and other markets. The learnings — contracting mechanisms, risk allocation, cost structures — are institutionalised within the firm. Those insights flow to India continuously and shape how we think about timing and execution.

Q. How are you approaching Make in India for renewables?

We were early movers. When we invested in Avaada, part of the capital went directly into setting up their manufacturing business. Avaada is now building nearly 8.5 GW of module capacity and 6 GW of cell capacity. Five years ago, India had only module assembly. Today we have cell and module lines, glass manufacturing is coming up, and backward integration is accelerating. In five years, India will likely have wafer and ingot capacity, and possibly even polysilicon manufacturing. India has the raw materials, the engineering talent and now the policy push to support this.

Q. Is transmission keeping pace with renewable growth?

Transmission tends to lag renewables because renewables are fast to build and transmission is relatively slow and complex. Rajasthan is an example where renewable capacity has come up faster than evacuation. This is not a demand problem — India has demand. It is a timing and infrastructure-execution issue. As storage capacity grows, some of these stresses will ease because excess power can be stored.

Q. What drives your expansion in Andhra Pradesh?

We are present in all major renewable-generating states, and Andhra Pradesh is one of them. We recently signed an MOU with the Andhra Pradesh government to invest up to $12 billion in renewable energy projects across the state. Brookﬁeld will develop, construct, and operate a diversiﬁed portfolio of solar, wind and storage projects. We have already commenced development and construction works for projects worth over US$ 2.5 billion, and we have the pipeline to do more in the state.

Having said that, we are also major players in other states including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, UP, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Our ambition is national, and we will keep investing wherever the fundamentals allow us to deploy capital at scale.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/11/20251124031601_Nawal-Saini-Managing-Partner-Head-of-Renewable-Power-and-Transition-South-Asia-and-the-Middle-East-Brookfield.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 00:56:48.520616

“Malaysia also has the Malaysia Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification, which ensures that every metric tonne of palm oil is sustainably produced and instils confidence in international markets,” he added.

Johari made the remarks to reporters following a visit to the country’s first SAF biorefinery, Ecoceres Renewable Fuels Sdn Bhd, in Tanjung Langsat, Johor.

Earlier reports had raised concerns about the suitability of palm oil as an SAF feedstock, particularly due to negative perceptions among European buyers over deforestation and environmental sustainability.

He said Malaysia, as the world’s second-largest palm oil producer, has an advantage in raw material supply for the SAF industry.

“The SAF initiative is also part of Malaysia’s strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can be considered a low-carbon business activity,” he said.

Johari added that the ministry has been actively engaging stakeholders and working with the Ministry of Transport to develop a national SAF blending mandate, with plans to introduce an initial one per cent SAF blending requirement for flights departing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

“Since July 2023, the ministry, together with Petronas Dagangan Bhd, has organised awareness programmes to promote UCO collection.

“As of September this year, more than 1,200 tonnes of UCO have been collected from nearly 66,000 customers at 89 selected Petronas petrol stations nationwide,” he said.

The Ecoceres plant in Johor is Malaysia’s first SAF biorefinery, with a licensed capacity of 350,000 metric tonnes per year, and began producing SAF last month.

Speaking at the Asia Pacific Hydrogen Summit, state climate change and energy minister Penny Sharpe spoke of the importance of the Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub in addressing the hard-to-abate sectors like manufacturing, farming and transport.

She also spoke about how the renewable fuels strategy would help NSW meet its emissions reduction targets.

Renewable fuels are low carbon alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biomethane, sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, biodiesel and renewable diesel.

Ms Sharpe said a strong renewable fuels sector would accelerate the transition from fossil fuels because these alternatives offered low carbon solutions for hard-to-electrify sectors like shipping, manufacturing, aviation and heavy transport.

“This is a win-win-win opportunity: a win for jobs, a win for fuel security and a win for the planet,” Ms Sharpe said.

She said the government was “boosting local production of renewable fuels to diversify the economy and deliver new jobs, growth and enhanced energy security for our state”.

Ms Sharpe said the Renewable Fuels Strategy “shows our commitment to building a robust and resilient renewable fuels industry right here in NSW”.

She also mentioned the importance of the partnerships NSW had with Japan and South Korea to build and expand export opportunities.

The minister also drew DCN’s attention to the Port of Newcastle Clean Energy Precinct, as it acts as an export hub for clean energy products and technologies, including hydrogen and ammonia.

The precinct is supported by a $100 million Commonwealth Grant administered by the state government.

The strategy outlines 20 actions to boost the state's renewable fuel industry, including:

Expanding the Renewable Fuel Scheme to include biomethane.

Up to $170 million in funding for renewable fuel and biomethane production in NSW.

Funding research and innovation to improve industry capability, including crop research and development trials to test and demonstrate biomass production opportunities in partnership with primary producers.

Supporting the expansion of GreenPower certification to additional renewable fuels and co-products.

The strategy was developed in collaboration with government and industry stakeholders and informed by feedback gathered from the 2024 discussion paper.

The WA Government announced in mid-October that it would commit $1.2 million towards the development of an Advanced Biofuels Strategy.","The NSW Government late last week released its Renewable Fuel Strategy. What’s involved in the strategy, and how are other states prioritising biofuels?

The Strategy commits up to $170 million in funding for renewable fuel and biomethane production and expands the Renewable Fuel Scheme – which was previously focused on green hydrogen – to include biomethane.

Up to $130 million funding will be provided through the Net Zero Manufacturing Initiative to support emerging technologies and build local manufacturing capacity.

Renewable diesel trials will also be carried out in transport, construction, mining and agriculture sectors, along with crop research and development trials to test and demonstrate biomass production.

Bioenergy Australia chief executive officer Shahana McKenzie said the Strategy provides much-needed policy direction.

“Renewable fuels are no longer a future ambition for NSW,” she said. “Today’s announcement moves them into the mainstream of the state’s clean energy transition and provides the certainty needed for investment, construction and new regional jobs.”

McKenzie said this policy would help build “capability at scale” and be especially critical for sectors unable to electrify quickly.

“Heavy transport, mining fleets, manufacturing, maritime and aviation all need viable low carbon alternatives right now,” she said. “Renewable fuels and biomethane offer immediate, scalable solutions for these sectors, and NSW is positioning itself to meet that demand.”

An Australia-wide commitment

NSW is being praised as a national leader by launching a dedicated renewable fuels strategy, so how is the rest of Australia tracking in its commitment to bioenergy?

The Federal Government announced its $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program in mid-September, forming part of the Future Made in Australia initiative. This is focused on low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) such as waste materials, biomass, and renewable hydrogen.

Submissions for comment are open until December 19, with the Federal Government seeking input for the framework and key design principles of the program.

The Federal Government launched its National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy soon after, which will be focused on developing clear, coordinated direction to support sustainable production of bioenergy feedstock.

The WA Government announced in mid-October that it would commit $1.2 million towards the development of an Advanced Biofuels Strategy.

Churchill Capital Consulting and GHD will partner to deliver the Advanced Biofuels Strategy, which will look to leverage WA’s vast supplies of oat, wheat and barley stubble to explore the production of bioethanol and other biofuels.

A comprehensive economic analysis into WA’s biomass feedstocks, supply chains and technology pathways will be conducted as part of preparations.

Queensland has a goal to be an Asia-Pacific hub for biorefining in an effort to enhance fuel security, support economic diversification, and create high value jobs. At the same time, the state is supporting local agriculture to become a $30 billion industry by 2030.

Queensland has also launched biofuels mandates as part of the Liquid Fuel Supply Act 1984 that requires fuel sellers in the state to sell minimum amounts of bio-based fuels such as E10.

Tasmania aims to launch its Future Clean Fuels Strategy in late 2025, while Victoria and South Australia don’t have dedicated biofuels strategies in play. The Northern Territory, on the other hand, is eager to become a leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, which blends with conventional jet fuel to decarbonise the aviation industry.

Ernst and Young was engaged by the NT Government in 2024 to undertake a feasibility study into the development of a SAF industry in the NT.

Australia has demonstrated its commitment to biofuels in various shapes and forms, with NSW the clear bellwether in this space. With this nascent industry proving to be a low-hanging fruit for industrial decarbonisation, expect plenty more biofuels developments on a national and state scale.",https://www.energymagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_353266785-750x492-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 19:56:13.178135

For the first ten months of this year, tonnages from Southeast Asia to the US were up by an average of nearly +26%, YoY.
For some countries, such as Taiwan, it also partly reflects very strong demand this year for high-performance semi-conductor chips, including those used in AI.

Average spot rates from Asia Pacific origins rose by +4%, week on week (WoW), to US$4.11 per kilo in the second full week of November (week 46: 10 to 16 November), with tonnages from that manufacturing powerhouse region continuing to increase (+1%, WoW) during this key retail period.

Spot rates from Asia Pacific to the US increased by a further +4%, WoW, to $5.51 per kilo, driven by a recovery from Japan in tonnages (+16%, WoW) and spot prices (+10%) following the one-day national holiday in Japan the previous week, plus rate increases from South Korea (+13%), and Vietnam (+8%). However, average spot rates from Asia Pacific to the US are down, YoY, since the end of April and stand at -11% in week 46, with some of the biggest decreases seen from Japan (-31%, YoY), Singapore (-19%), Indonesia (-19%), Vietnam (-17%), South Korea (-10%), and Hong Kong (-8%).

As highlighted last week, ex-Asia Pacific markets in the final months of 2024, for example to the US and Europe, experienced exceptionally strong demand and a big squeeze on capacity, particularly from China, due to surging volumes of Chinese e-commerce exports. This year’s rates, therefore, face tough comparison figures with last year, and remain relatively high by historical standards.

Air cargo tonnages from Asia Pacific to the US remain significantly higher, year-on-year (YoY), despite the imposition, since April, of higher tariffs and de minimis restrictions on US imports of goods from China and other countries in the region. Although tonnages from China (-2%, YoY), Hong Kong (-16%, YoY), and South Korea (-10%, YoY), remained below last year’s levels in week 46, tonnages from the region as a whole were +6% higher, YoY.

That has been the case for most of the last six months, thanks to big YoY increases from Taiwan and Southeast Asia origins to the US. Indeed, according to new analysis by WorldACD, demand from Southeast Asia (SEA) origins to the US was up by +40%, YoY, in October, the highest YoY full-month growth figure this year. For the first ten months of this year, tonnages from Southeast Asia to the US were up by an average of nearly +26%, YoY.

In contrast, year-to-date (YtD) tonnages from China and Hong Kong (CN/HK) to the US were down by nearly -6%, YoY, whereas to Europe they were up by around +8% – partly reflecting a diversion of CN/HK air exports from the US to Europe and other markets. YtD tonnages from SEA to Europe are down by almost -6%, YoY.

These figures partly reflect a trend for US importers to seek suppliers from other countries as alternatives to China. For some countries, such as Taiwan, it also partly reflects very strong demand this year for high-performance semi-conductor chips, including those used in AI. Air imports from Taiwan have been consistently up by around 30-50% this year, with similar YoY increases from Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, where semi-conductors and other electronic goods and components also form a significant part of air exports.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

IBA estimates the policy push for CBG could attract investments of Rs 37,500 crore and enable the establishment of 750 CBG plants by 2028-29, reducing LNG imports and strengthening energy security. It also aligns with emerging biofuel goals, including 1 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel blending for international flights by 2027.

The association highlighted the environmental cost of stubble burning, noting that each tonne of straw burnt emits around 1,460 kg of CO₂, 60 kg of CO, and 3 kg of particulate matter. Instead, converting straw into bioenergy and other products can curb pollution and create value. IBA also stressed nature-based solutions such as large-scale plantation drives, urban green shields, Miyawaki forests and community “Adopt a Tree” initiatives.

Despite earlier reports of Middle Eastern carriers expressing an interest in acquiring a minority stake in TAP Air Portugal, none submitted formal offers. According to Portugal’s Parpública – the country’s National Wealth Fund – only Europe’s big three airline groups formally entered the bidding process.

Air France-KLM, the International Airlines Group and the Lufthansa Group all sent letters to the Portuguese government indicating their interest in TAP Air Portugal. The government is in the process of selling 49.9% of the company, of which 5% is to go to staff.

For the remaining 44.5%, the government is seeking a long-term airline partner to support TAP’s expansion plans and ensure connectivity to and from Portugal.

Europe’s big 3 airlines submit bids

Though Parpública did not name the companies that formally expressed interest, it said that three entities did so. Europe’s big three all confirmed earlier this week that they had in fact sent letters of interest which were due by Saturday.

Due diligence is expected to begin for qualified investors as of January, with the deadline for non-binding offers on 1 April. Binding offers, the process terms state, are due three months later.

In July, Portugal’s Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said that major airlines outside the European Union had expressed an interest (informally) in TAP Air Portugal. Then, earlier this week, it emerged that Middle Eastern airlines were in discussions with the government.

One name that surfaced on several occasions, according to sources speaking to Italy’s Corriere della Sera on the condition of anonymity, was Qatar Airways.

Why does Portugal want to sell TAP?

The Government of Portugal is seeking to sell a minority stake in TAP for several reasons. It – and the airline itself – believes that it requires a larger partner to support it as competition in Europe and beyond remains intense.

Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium shows that although TAP controls about half of the seats flown out of its Lisbon hub, Ryanair and easyJet combined make up just under 20%. Across Europe more broadly, a competitive aviation landscape puts pressure on yields.

The decision is also financial. Portugal invested roughly €3.2 billion euros in the company relating to COVID-19 struggles. By selling a stake in TAP, it hopes to recover some of the money it spent.

As it sells the airline, the government has several conditions. The partner must:

Preserve the TAP brand

Grow the airline’s fleet

Maintain its network to Portuguese-speaking countries including in South America and Africa

Invest in local sustainable aviation fuel projects

Continue flying out of Lisbon and Portugal’s secondary airports (Porto, for instance)

Following the approval of the decree by the Council of Ministers, the document has to be signed into law by the country’s president. If the bill is approved, interested parties will have 60 days to prequalify. After that, potential investors will be given 90 days to submit non-binding proposals.

TAP’s added value

TAP’s network in South America, particularly Brazil, is of great interest to Europe’s big three airline groups. IAG for its part already has control over the continent, and any investment in TAP would further cement its role as the primary operator to the South Atlantic.

This is precisely where Lufthansa and Air France-KLM see an interest, allowing them to counter IAG’s growth while expanding in a generally profitable market.

As mentioned, TAP also controls the majority of Lisbon’s seat share and elusive slot capacity. Slots at Lisbon’s Humberto Delgado airport are hard to come by, so much so that TAP has begun expanding long-haul operations out of Portugal’s second-largest city, Porto, which has more available space.

But beneath the fanfare, one question keeps surfacing in every conversation, every press conference, every closed-door meeting: Can the Middle East’s aviation boom and sustainability ambitions actually coexist?

Over the week, we sat down with five leaders shaping the future of aviation across the region and beyond, including:

Paul Griffiths, CEO, Dubai Airports

Julien Manhès, Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Carbon Dioxide Removal, Airbus

Yousif Bin Saeed Al Lootah, CEO, Lootah Biofuels

Darren Hulst, Vice President of Commercial Marketing, Boeing

Michel Azar-Hmouda, President of Commercial Aviation, CAE

This episode brings together a selection of their answers — recorded live in partnership with the Dubai Airshow 2025 and CAE. Full interviews with each guest will follow in the coming weeks.

Why the Middle East matters

When we asked these leaders about the Middle East’s potential to lead sustainable aviation innovation, several common themes emerged.

The region’s strengths are clear: massive infrastructure investment, operational excellence at major hubs, strong government commitment, and access to capital.

Add to this abundant renewable energy resources and the region’s central geographic position, and you have a compelling foundation.

Three takeaways from the conversations

With existing expertise in energy production and a track record of deploying innovation quickly, the Middle East is positioning itself as a proving ground for sustainable aviation technologies at a commercial scale.

1. A hotbed of opportunity

Beyond the structural advantages, the region’s geographic position matters too. Sitting at the crossroads of global aviation, connecting East and West, Europe to Asia, the Middle East handles enormous volumes of traffic.

This creates opportunities to validate technologies and demonstrate that sustainable aviation can work at scale. With fleets in the region expected to more than double over the next 20 years, whatever innovation happens here has the potential to influence global aviation.

2. The execution challenge

But optimism must be tempered with realism. While ambition is easy, execution is harder. Every leader we spoke with was candid about the challenges ahead. Workforce development emerged as a pressing concern, with forecasts suggesting 1.5 million personnel will be needed globally over the next decade. Infrastructure must keep pace with growth. Supply chains need to be built out. Coordination across governments, airlines, and fuel producers requires sustained effort.

3. Pragmatic optimism

The question isn’t whether the Middle East has the resources or ambition. It clearly does. The question is whether it can turn those advantages into demonstrable results that provide a blueprint for how sustainable aviation growth can work globally.

What emerged from these conversations was a pragmatic optimism: an understanding that this is difficult, that timelines are tight, that coordination will require effort, but also a belief that the Middle East could actually pull this off.

Sustainable aviation isn’t optional anymore. The world is watching the Middle East to see if it can set the pace.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!k0aX!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F179678736%2F7687f775-6c96-4b2a-89bc-c83d44858578%2Ftranscoded-1763901048.png",N,,2025-11-23 15:57:32.121697

One of the key highlights of Emirates’ presence at the Dubai Airshow was its announcement of major aircraft orders, including 65 Boeing 777-9s and 8 Airbus A350-900s, worth a combined total of US$41.4 billion. This marks a significant expansion to Emirates’ fleet, bringing its total wide-body aircraft orders to 375, with deliveries scheduled through 2038. The new aircraft will support the airline’s global expansion efforts, allowing it to enhance its network and improve operational efficiency. This large-scale investment underscores Emirates’ confidence in the future of air travel and its long-term commitment to growth.

The addition of the Boeing 777-9s and Airbus A350-900s will help Emirates strengthen its position as one of the world’s leading airlines. These next-generation aircraft are designed for efficiency and sustainability, helping the airline reduce fuel consumption and emissions while enhancing passenger comfort. This fleet expansion will not only help Emirates meet the growing demand for air travel but also support its goals of improving connectivity, particularly to key international destinations. As global travel rebounds, this investment positions Emirates to continue playing a leading role in the industry for years to come

Innovating In-Flight Experience with Starlink and Cabin Upgrades

In addition to its fleet expansion, Emirates is taking significant steps to enhance the in-flight experience for its passengers. At the Dubai Airshow, the airline unveiled Starlink high-speed Wi-Fi on one of its retrofitted Boeing 777-300ERs. This move aligns with Emirates’ commitment to providing passengers with the best connectivity available in the skies.

SAF is considered a key solution for reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint, and Emirates is positioning itself at the forefront of this effort. By working with ENOC and other industry partners, Emirates aims to accelerate the adoption of SAF, which will play a vital role in achieving the airline’s sustainability goals.

In addition to SAF initiatives, Emirates is also investing in research to enhance the efficiency of UAE airspace. The airline has partnered with Dans and Thales to pioneer new methods for reducing arrival holding patterns at Dubai International Airport (DXB), improving the efficiency of air traffic management. These efforts are expected to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, making air travel more sustainable in the long term. Through these initiatives, Emirates is reinforcing its commitment to sustainability and its role in shaping the future of aviation.

Aerospace Excellence and UAE’s Growing Capabilities

Emirates’ efforts to build a stronger aerospace industry in the UAE were highlighted by several significant announcements at the Dubai Airshow. The airline signed an MoU with Safran Seats to establish Dubai’s first aircraft seat manufacturing facility. This facility will initially produce retrofit seats for Emirates’ aircraft, with plans to expand into line-fit production in the future. The collaboration with Safran will help the UAE become a key player in the global aerospace supply chain, creating jobs and boosting local manufacturing capabilities.

Emirates also partnered with the CCE Group to co-develop next-generation cabin and cargo products in the UAE.

The certification marks a major advancement for the country’s aviation sector, enabling in-house approval of substantial design changes.
The GCAA’s direct certification of Emirates Engineering’s design work allows the regulator to independently assess and process major aircraft modifications, representing a significant development in the evolution of UAE aviation oversight.
Adel Al Redha, Emirates Deputy President and Chief Operating Officer, said: “This approval fundamentally changes our approach to aircraft modification.

The GCAA’s direct certification of Emirates Engineering’s design work allows the regulator to independently assess and process major aircraft modifications, representing a significant development in the evolution of UAE aviation oversight.

Adel Al Redha, Emirates Deputy President and Chief Operating Officer, said:

“This approval fundamentally changes our approach to aircraft modification. In-house design and certification capability gives us direct control over our product development and helps us to define our specifications and our timeline.

“The timing also aligns with our expansion at DWC, where this certification expertise will be integral to our engineering operations. We thank the GCAA for their partnership in developing the regulatory framework that made this milestone possible.”

Eng. Aqeel Al Zarooni, Assistant Director General for Aviation Safety Affairs at the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority, said:

“This accreditation represents an important advancement in the development of the aircraft design and engineering approval ecosystem in the UAE. It reflects the readiness of the regulatory framework the GCAA is building to empower all maintenance and engineering service providers to enhance their capabilities.

Granting Emirates Engineering the status of an Approved Design Organisation paves the way for developing local design solutions that meet global standards, and strengthens the national aviation sector’s ability to carry out major aircraft modifications with greater efficiency and competitiveness. This milestone is fully aligned with the GCAA’s vision to elevate safety standards and develop national engineering capabilities that can meet the future growth needs of the aviation industry in the UAE.”

The new approval expands Emirates Engineering’s existing authority for minor modifications to include major cabin reconfigurations and other complex changes. This shift provides the airline with more direct control over development timelines, costs and innovation priorities. Until now, such major work depended on external original equipment manufacturers or specialist design houses.

Covering both Airbus and Boeing aircraft types, the approval provides flexibility across Emirates’ current fleet and potential future acquisitions.

In preparation for certification, Emirates Engineering has significantly grown its internal design organisation over the past six months, recruiting specialist design engineers and updating procedures to meet stringent GCAA standards. The team will expand from five to more than thirteen dedicated staff, with further growth planned.

This accreditation positions Emirates Engineering among a select group of airlines worldwide with fully fledged in-house design and certification capability, strengthening the UAE’s role in the global aviation and aerospace industry.

Supporting a major fleet refurbishment initiative

The enhanced design authority will directly contribute to Emirates’ extensive refurbishment programme for its Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft. It provides the flexibility to manage modification schedules internally, reducing reliance on external organisations with competing deadlines.

Looking ahead, the approval also facilitates future advancements in cabin technology, supports ambitions in component production, and provides a platform for developing locally manufactured parts based on Emirates-owned intellectual property.

The certification complements the expansion of Emirates’ maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities at Dubai World Central (DWC), where these design capabilities will be central to long-term engineering and production plans.",https://travel-news.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-11.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 15:57:35.838766

Doug Sombke is a Brown County farmer and has been president of the South Dakota Farmers Union since 2005.","So, the ethanol industry is asking for what is essentially a clarification applying Reid vapor pressure relief to all blends that would allow refiners and retailers to use ethanol if they choose, but not be forced to?

The oil industry, free market folks they are, oppose such choice. Like the horse and buggy industry being outraged by the advent of the automobile, the oil industry remains adamant that there are actually 11 commandments, with the 11th being they should have sole control of what goes in our vehicles.

MORE: Aberdeen Insider letters to the editor, guest column policy

The American Fuel and Chemical Manufacturers has been consistent in its disdain for ethanol. It’s used hundreds of lobbyists and billions in profits to thwart ethanol at every turn, most recently getting 27 members of the U.S. House to write a letter to leadership citing concerns that ethanol could “disadvantage the U.S. refining sector.”

That comes on the heels of the American Petroleum Institute reneging its support for 15% ethanol blend and setting conditions to reconsider support. Those conditions, of course, are to continue to gut the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The oil industry continues to push the narrative that the RFS is only about energy security and how we produce so much oil that the standards are obsolete. The reality is that it is an environmental program with roots all the way back to the Clean Air Act when oxygenates like ethanol were required to get the cancer-causing, smog-forming, deadly compounds refiners use for octane out of gasoline.

Those requirements remain on the books. The single highest value of ethanol is as clean octane replacing toxic carcinogenic aromatics. C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel to George Bush, was a key architect of the Clean Air Act and was often asked why he supported ethanol. His answer was direct.

“Because it saves lives.”

The natural question is why we haven’t addressed this, and the answer is simple. Our leaders in the ethanol industry have failed us. Our leaders in the agricultural industries have failed us. Our leaders in Congress have failed us.

We beg with hat in hand to be “allowed” to add more than 10% ethanol, while the oil industry poisons that same gasoline with 25% or more toxics, contributing to everything from respiratory diseases to neurological ailments.

Why aren’t the ethanol and corn industries suing the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to enact non-discretionary toxic controls? Are they afraid of the oil industry they sell to — the same oil industry that is slowly ensuring ethanol remains a bit player in the fuel mix?

Could it be a backroom deal was struck that the oil industry would give its blessing to E15 if the ethanol industry would not go after aromatics?

MORE: Rick Young: The myth of freedom in a rigged system

Spare us any talk that Donald Trump loves farmers and will support ethanol. Anyone who has ever spent five minutes in Washington understands if Trump really supported ethanol, E15 would have been in the “Big Beautiful Bill.” One phone call from him and it would be done.

We are on our own if we want to save our farmers and have any hope of growing the ethanol industry. While exports have been a welcome addition to the portfolio, enforcing toxic controls with an E30 program here at home would double corn demand and bring aromatics down to minuscule levels.

Ethanol producers and corn growers need to sue the EPA to enforce the law. The South Dakota Farmers Union represents family farmers, and, even with modest resources, has waged this battle for years. We have the data, but have never had the support of national organizations with multimillion dollar budgets who could easily take on the fight.

Instead of allowing this blasting in the atmosphere, India can leverage innovative technologies to convert straw into valuable resources, it said.","New Delhi, Nov 23 (IANS) The 7.3 million tonnes of paddy straw, which is currently being burnt by farmers, can be converted into compressed biogas and bioethanol which could save Rs 1,600 crore forex on energy imports and cut pollution as well, according to a statement issued by the Indian Biogas Association (IBA) on Sunday.

This policy is likely to attract investments of Rs 37,500 crore and facilitate the setting up of 750 CBG projects in the country by 2028-29.

More significantly, this represents an import-substituting move toward LNG, ensuring savings in precious foreign exchange by building energy security from domestic resources, the statement said.

The latest anaerobic digestion processes can efficiently convert this agricultural residue into Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG), which can directly replace imported natural gas, the statement noted.

Beyond energy, paddy straw is excellent for bioethanol production because of its 40 per cent cellulose content, it added.

It has the potential to achieve import substitutions worth Rs 1,600 crore, the IBA statement said.

“Parallel goals of Sustainable Aviation Fuel include one per cent blending for international flights by 2027, further expanding the bioeconomy landscape,” IBA Chairman Gaurav Kedia said.

Even the remaining 20 per cent lignin fraction, which is a complex organic polymer deposited in the cell walls of plants, can yield high-value products, such as polymers, activated carbon, Graphene and resins, the statement added.

The conventional perception of paddy straw as waste represents a failure of imagination.

IBA has also highlighted that the burning of each tonne of straw releases around 1,460 kg of carbon dioxide, nearly 60 kg of carbon monoxide, and 3 kg of particulate matter directly into the atmosphere.

Instead of allowing this blasting in the atmosphere, India can leverage innovative technologies to convert straw into valuable resources, it said.

Mature urban trees have also been found capable of absorbing as much as 22 kg of CO2 annually while filtering out dangerous particulate matter.

One of the lowest-hanging fruits from a solution perspective could be the strategic plantation drives in and around north Indian cities, especially along highways, which can protect us from the pollution volatility with a green shield, the statement added.

Equal consideration can be given to the weather-balancing effect by this natural shield, which can further help the urban heat island effect throughout the year.

It points out that cities like Delhi have already shown what is possible as more than 2.5 million saplings were planted during 2023 alone.

Combining Miyawaki forests in degraded urban parcels of land with highway green corridors and community-driven “adopt a tree” initiatives would provide a strong natural buffer against pollution, the statement said.

But even if they work on it expeditiously, it could still take months before farmers receive any checks.
A potential bailout is not the only federal program up in the air for farmers.
Typically, that debt can be rolled into a new loan, and some farmers rolled 2023 debt into their 2024 loan and 2024 debt into their 2025 loan.
“That is a case-by-case basis.” Farm debt is growing at agricultural banks, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.","For months farmers have pleaded for government aid to soften the blow of trade wars and another unprofitable harvest. But even with the Trump administration receptive to the idea and the government again open, most farmers and bankers have concluded that any aid will be too little and too late to rescue the next planting season.

“I’m cash-flowing on what my anticipated yield is based on what I know today,” said Anne Schwagerl, who farms 1,100 acres in Minnesota with her husband and son. “I am not banking on the U.S. government to do it.”

The federal government reopened last week after 43 days, which Trump administration officials had said was necessary before they could finish any farmer aid plan. But even if they work on it expeditiously, it could still take months before farmers receive any checks. That would be well after the crucial winter period when farmers talk to their bankers and make decisions about the next year.

Schwagerl said the American Relief Act, which was passed in December during the Biden administration, offered an example of how long it could take for funds to reach farmers. Applications for the act’s $30 billion in disaster assistance did not open until July, and Schwagerl received her payment in September, nearly nine months after the money was authorized.

Administration officials have floated the idea of an aid package, or possibly the first in a series of aid packages, of between $10 billion and $15 billion. Some members of Congress have said much more may be needed, but after a handshake trade agreement last month with China that should restart American soybean sales, the amount that farmers ultimately receive may be revised downward.

“We may need to have a bridge to next year, but how many lanes that bridge has is going to be determined by what the market does between now and then,” Stephen Vaden, the deputy secretary of agriculture, said on the “AgriTalk” radio show last month.

A spokesperson for the Agriculture Department said there was “nothing new to share at this time” about any concrete plans for aid. “President Trump is utilizing all the tools available to ensure farmers have what they need to continue their farming operations,” the spokesperson said.

A potential bailout is not the only federal program up in the air for farmers. It is also unclear if Congress will pass a new farm bill, which expired in 2023 and was extended a third time as part of the legislation to reopen the government, or if regulations on ethanol or sustainable aviation fuel will be changed and stimulate more demand for corn and soybeans.

“Even if all these levers were flipped today, it would still take time to actually see these markets moving,” said Amy France, a Kansas farmer who is chair of the National Sorghum Producers.

With so much uncertainty, and a hard-won skepticism that politicians will make decisions quickly or pass new legislation, a lot of farmers are in for difficult conversations with their bankers in the coming months.

“It is tough to run an operating note for 2026 on, like, hopes and prayers,” Schwagerl said.

Most farmers take out a production loan in the winter to buy seeds, fertilizer and equipment before planting in the spring. They pay back the loan in the fall after they harvest and sell their crops. But analyzing farmers’ business plans is much tougher if their bankers do not know when, or if, there will be government assistance.

“We will just start assuming there won’t be any payments,” said Barry Benson, vice president of agribusiness banking at First National Bank of Omaha.

An important consideration will be how much debt remains from a farmer’s 2025 production loan, said Doug Fish, the CEO of BTC Bank in Missouri. Typically, that debt can be rolled into a new loan, and some farmers rolled 2023 debt into their 2024 loan and 2024 debt into their 2025 loan. But with the 2026 crop price outlook looking bleak, at what point would a banker be throwing good money after bad?

“If you can’t make it work and cash-flow with the current debt, how are you going to make the payment if you add additional debt?” Fish asked. “That is a case-by-case basis.”

Farm debt is growing at agricultural banks, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The percentage of loans that are past due on payments remains low, but it is rising.

The one positive, bankers said, is that while farmers across the country are facing a cash crunch, most still have a valuable asset: land. Agricultural land values have remained strong, or declined only slightly, so farmers who own their land still have equity in it. But they may have to refinance or otherwise tap that equity to receive a loan.

For some farmers, a government bailout is not just about how much fertilizer they can buy or whether they can afford to upgrade a broken-down combine, but about whether they can continue farming at all.

“There will be some producers, row-crop farmers, that will have to make the decision, ‘Do I sell out when I still have equity and walk away, or do I load additional debt onto my equity in hopes that it will be better next year?’” Fish said.

With prices for corn, soybeans and other crops still below what it costs farmers to produce them — even after a small bump when the trade agreement with China was reached — many farmers have sold less of their crop than normal. Instead, they are storing as much as they can, hoping something changes that will raise the value of their crop.

The bins on Schwagerl’s farm are 100% full, she said. She has sold about 35% of her crop and signed a contract to sell an additional 10%, meaning more than half of it remains unsold.

But she cannot sit on it forever, waiting for something to cause the price to go up.

“The problem with that is I need the money,” she said. She still has about $160,000 of accounts payable before the end of the year.

A bailout would not be a panacea for farmers. Jeff Bailey, the president and CEO of the Bank of Eastern Oregon, said that for most farmers in his region it would be the difference between slight losses and slight profits.

“Government payments will help, but I don’t think of it as necessarily being a game changer,” he said.

What would be a game changer? Markets. Basic economics. There needs to be more demand for crops or less supply, or ideally both. With crops selling on a world market, changes could come domestically or internationally. Regulations for sustainable aviation fuel could cause more domestic demand for soybeans, or a lowering of tariffs could lead more countries to buy American crops. Weather disasters anywhere in the world could reduce supply.

While Schwagerl, as a leader of the Minnesota Farmers Union, has voiced support for government aid, she believes that it comes at a long-term cost.

“Boy, do I not want to be just waiting for a bailout,” she said. “I think politically that won’t last very long. I think the taxpayer will have questions about that.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tzr-zOTNeEk4.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-11-23 10:56:46.223047

India can convert 7.3 million tonnes of burnt paddy straw into renewable gas worth Rs 270 crore annually. This agricultural residue can also produce bioethanol, leading to import substitutions worth Rs 1,600 crore. Innovative technologies will transform straw into valuable resources. This initiative will attract investments and create jobs, building energy security from domestic resources.

The use of 7.3 million tonnes of paddy straw currently burnt by farmers in the biogas plants can produce renewable gas worth about Rs 270 crore per year, said the Indian Biogas Association (IBA) on Sunday.

The latest anaerobic digestion processes can efficiently convert this agricultural residue into Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG), which can directly replace imported natural gas, an IBA statement said.

Beyond energy, paddy straw is excellent for bioethanol production because of its 40 per cent cellulose content, it added.

It has the potential to achieve import substitutions worth Rs 1,600 crore, the IBA claimed.

Even the remaining 20 per cent lignin fraction can yield high-value products, such as polymers, activated carbon, Graphene and resins, it added.

According to the statement, diverting only the 7.3 million tonnes of paddy straw currently burnt to biogas plants can produce renewable gas worth about Rs 270 crore per year.

""This policy is likely to attract investments of Rs 37,500 crore and facilitate the setting up of 750 CBG projects in the country by 2028-29. More significantly, this represents an import-substituting move toward LNG, ensuring savings in precious foreign exchange by building energy security from domestic resources.

""Parallel goals of Sustainable Aviation Fuel include 1 per cent blending for international flights by 2027, further expanding the bioeconomy landscape,"" IBA Chairman Gaurav Kedia said.

The conventional perception of paddy straw as waste represents a failure of imagination.

As a matter of fact, the burning of each tonne of straw releases around 1,460 kg of carbon dioxide, roughly 60 kg of carbon monoxide, and 3 kg of particulate matter directly into the atmosphere, IBA pointed out.

Instead of allowing this blasting in the atmosphere, India can leverage innovative technologies to convert straw into valuable resources, it added.

India, fortunately, has few running examples now.

One of the lowest-hanging fruits from a solution perspective could be the strategic plantation drives in and around North Indian cities, especially along highways, which can protect us from the pollution volatility with a green shield.

Mature urban trees have been found capable of absorbing as much as 22 kg of CO2 annually while filtering out dangerous particulate matter.

Equal consideration can be given to the weather-balancing effect by this natural shield, which can further help the urban heat island effect throughout the year.

Cities like Delhi have already shown what is possible: more than 2.5 million saplings were planted during 2023 alone.

Combining Miyawaki forests in degraded urban parcels of land with highway green corridors and community-driven ""Adopt a Tree"" initiatives provides a comprehensive natural defence system.

Director of the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon , Associate Professor Karine Chenu , said the team would focus on creating better inputs for processing.
“Most of the research investment in this space has shown that processing plant biomass into aviation biofuels or other bioproducts is technically viable and should be done,” Dr Chenu said.
“But the price of sustainable aviation fuel is still typically 2 or 3 times the price of standard jet fuel and no one wants the price of flying to go up.
“For example, with sugarcane only 20 to 25 per cent of the carbon in the bagasse can be converted to carbon in the fuel,” Professor Henry said.","A research hub at The University of Queensland is taking a unique approach to converting plant waste into carbon-based compounds like jet fuel.

“But the price of sustainable aviation fuel is still typically 2 or 3 times the price of standard jet fuel and no one wants the price of flying to go up.

“We need to make the more environmentally desirable option at a price that’s competitive.

“As processing methods are already in place, one of the Hub’s main focuses is on using new scientific capabilities to improve plant biomass, making it easier to process.

“By understanding and modifying the biosynthesis and composition of plant cell walls, our team will increase the proportion of carbon that we can convert to a final product, whether that be a fuel or a biomaterial.”

Hub Chief Investigator Emeritus Professor Robert Henry said having a product that was easier to process and was cost effective and sustainable was where future gains could be made.

“For example, with sugarcane only 20 to 25 per cent of the carbon in the bagasse can be converted to carbon in the fuel,” Professor Henry said.

“We want to increase that to 50 per cent, effectively doubling the amount of fuel we get from a tonne of bagasse and that would have a huge effect on the final price.

“We can see a path to producing sustainable aviation fuel at a price that’s competitive with the fossil product, which would greatly accelerate adoption.”

Launched on 10 November, the ARC Research Hub marks a significant step toward building a bio-based economy in Australia.

Its collaborative structure in partnership with industry in Australia and internationally is designed to support innovation and deliver practical outcomes.

“We have partners across the whole value chain from spatial genomics and technology companies to the farm and potential processors, and hopefully, all the way to through to flying planes,” Professor Henry said.

“That ensures we have industry input and feedback into what we’re doing, so that what we come up with is relevant and works for them.”

Sugar Research Australia Cytogeneticist and Partner Investigator, Dr Nathalie Piperidis, said SRA was proud to be working with the Hub to advance a shared vision of innovation.

“Working with different partners is an incredible opportunity to share ideas, expertise, and knowledge,” Dr Piperidis said.

“This initiative marks an important stride toward improving conversion efficiency, strengthening economic outcomes, and enhancing the sustainability of our sugarcane industry for growers and millers alike.”",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-9.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 10:56:54.006417

Market Opportunity: U.S. SAF market projected at $7 billion by 2030, with a $25 billion global opportunity

Strategic Investment: $350 million invested in the New Rise Reno facility, advancing America’s push to decarbonize aviation

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today commented on the expanding policy momentum supporting SAF adoption across the United States.

Momentum is building fast. Under the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030 – scaling to 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100% of domestic demand. Today, production remains below 1% of U.S. jet fuel use, underscoring both the urgency and the scale of the opportunity.

The U.S. SAF market is expected to grow more than seven-fold – from approximately $860 million in 2024 to nearly $7 billion by 2030 – representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~47%. Globally, the SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand surpassing 5.5 billion gallons over the same period.

At the state level, momentum is accelerating in parallel. California, Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted low-carbon fuel standards that include SAF, and five additional states are advancing similar frameworks. Collectively, these states represent nearly 40% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, creating a rapidly expanding incentive landscape for SAF deployment.

“Policy momentum is transforming aspiration into execution,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global. “The U.S. is making it clear that sustainable aviation fuel is essential to the future of aviation. With supportive federal and state frameworks, airlines and energy companies can move beyond pilot programs and commit to long-term, scalable decarbonization strategies. At XCF, we’re building one of America’s leading SAF platforms – designed to scale production, strengthen domestic supply chains, and meet the growing demand for home-grown, low-carbon fuels.”

From inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF’s flagship New Rise Reno facility. The company is advancing a project pipeline of three additional sites. The second facility, New Rise Reno 2, located adjacent to the existing site, will share utilities and logistics infrastructure to maximize efficiencies. XCF expects construction to begin in 2026 and operations from 2028, following an additional $300 million investment that is expected to double production capacity to ~80 million gallons per year.

As global demand accelerates, the U.S. has an opportunity to not only meet its own decarbonization goals but also to become a leading exporter of low-carbon fuels. Expanding domestic SAF production supports the Make More in America Initiative, creates high-tech, clean-energy jobs, and strengthens the nation’s competitiveness in the global energy transition.

“America’s aviation industry has always thrived on innovation,” Cooper continued. “With clear policy alignment and accelerating demand, the U.S. has a generational opportunity to lead the world in sustainable aviation. XCF is committed to turning that opportunity into action – transforming today’s policy commitments into tomorrow’s progress.”

A major technology provider has introduced a breakthrough in hydrocracking for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production from biomass. This development directly addresses the high-cost barrier that has slowed the aviation sector’s decarbonization efforts, making the conversion of fats and oils into jet fuel more economical for refiners. The new catalyst and process design will immediately impact the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) supply chain, which currently dominates SAF production. The technology is projected to deliver up to 20% in cost savings for producers, which is a critical step toward closing the 2x to 5x price gap with conventional jet fuel.

Context

The core question for the aviation industry has been how to scale SAF production without relying on massive, long-term subsidies. Current SAF supply represents only 0.3% of global jet fuel, and its production cost is significantly higher than fossil fuel, often by a factor of two to five times, which has stalled new project announcements. The industry consensus was that a fundamental technological leap was required to make bio-SAF economically viable at the scale needed to meet global blending mandates.

Analysis

This cost reduction is a direct result of a new, highly efficient catalyst and process design that improves the chemical reaction known as hydrocracking. Hydrocracking is the core industrial step where biomass-derived oils are broken down and rearranged into stable, drop-in jet fuel molecules. The breakthrough increases the efficiency of this conversion, meaning less feedstock is wasted and less energy is consumed per gallon of fuel produced.

Think of it like a turbocharger for a refinery: it extracts more high-value product from the same input material with less energy. Manufacturers are expected to rapidly adopt this technology, as it lowers their operating costs and capital expenditure, thereby de-risking new SAF plant investments and accelerating compliance with mandates.

Outlook

The immediate signal to watch is the final investment decisions (FIDs) for new, large-scale SAF facilities. This technology lowers the financial hurdle for these projects. If a wave of new FIDs is announced in the next 12-18 months, it will confirm that this cost breakthrough has successfully de-risked the capital deployment. Additionally, monitor the spread between the price of HEFA-based SAF and conventional jet fuel; a sustained narrowing of this gap will indicate the technology is achieving commercial traction.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Aviation-Sector-Decarbonization-Pathways-Ecological-Interdependence-and-Green-Transition-Imperatives.jpeg,N,,2025-11-23 10:57:51.747900

Both for industry and households, the UK has some of the highest electricity prices in the world.
At consumer level, high power prices are a deterrent to installing heat pumps and shifting from petrol and diesel cars to EVs.
Alongside allowing gas to set the overall price, green levies added to bills also keep Britain’s power prices high.
These levies make up 16% of the final price of electricity, and add about £140 a year to electricity bills.","When Rachel Reeves visited a heat pump manufacturer in Truro this summer, she posed for selfies with the team and described the business as crucial to transforming Britain into a “clean energy superpower”.

The company Kensa, last month announced redundancies for up to a fifth of its workforce, blaming “policy instability and market uncertainty.” It was a second round, following a 20% cut last year.

As political consensus over net zero breaks down, it’s a bewildering time to be a green business in Britain. Reform has threatened to strike down contracts awarded under the latest auction round for renewable energy developers, while the Conservatives plan to scrap climate change legislation.

On the face of it, the adoption of clean technology looks rapid. Heat pump sales rose more than 60% year on year to around 98,000 in 2024, and EV sales reached a record high of over 380,000 cars, around a fifth of new car sales last year.

But behind the headline numbers there is disquiet about the pace of decarbonisation, given the scale of the change needed to shift the UK economy away from fossil fuels – the figures for heat pumps account for 6% of the overall boiler market and are a long way short of the official target set under the last government of 600,000 installations a year by 2028.

Both for industry and households, the UK has some of the highest electricity prices in the world. At consumer level, high power prices are a deterrent to installing heat pumps and shifting from petrol and diesel cars to EVs.

One energy company executive said the government’s plan for 95% clean power by 2030 was slowing the transition by setting an artificially high target for ramping up the supply of renewables in a narrow window of time.

Instead, they said, the emphasis should be on bringing power prices down to encourage people to switch to clean tech: “If every single decision the government made was about lowering the prices of electricity, we would have decarbonised faster.”

In July, ministers decided against “zonal pricing”, which would have varied prices so that people in windier parts of the country, such as Scotland, got cheaper power. Supporters of the reform argued that it would lower costs overall, as it would reduce the expenses of balancing the system – such as switching wind turbines off in Scotland when they produce more energy than the grid can transmit south. The government said it would focus instead on reforms to make the power system more efficient.

Critics have also focused on the UK’s “marginal pricing” system, where the cost of power is set by the most expensive source needed to meet total demand – mostly gas-fired power plants. In January, the owners of two gas-fired power stations were paid £17m for a few hours of power in a cold snap.

Alongside allowing gas to set the overall price, green levies added to bills also keep Britain’s power prices high. These levies make up 16% of the final price of electricity, and add about £140 a year to electricity bills.

Richard Lowes, a specialist in energy policy at the Regulatory Assistance Project, a thinktank, said: “The government has walked away from zonal pricing. Decoupling from gas isn’t happening any time soon.

“There are historical levies that are being paid for through bills, such as feed-in tariffs – paying people to put solar panels on roofs – where the market has got going but we have a legacy cost on bills. All of this upward cost pressure on electricity means it is not a particularly inviting investment environment.”

Delays in introducing net zero policies have also chilled investment. In its statement announcing redundancies, Kensa criticised the “continued wait for the future homes standard” – a policy that means new homes will no longer be connected to fossil fuel-powered heating systems. The last government said the future homes standard would come into force in 2025, but it is now unlikely to happen until 2026. The previous government had also planned to ban the sale of new gas boilers by 2035, but weakened the plan – and this government has dropped it.

A spokesman for Kensa said: “Kensa had invested in its heat pump manufacturing capacity in recent years and had ambitions for further expansion, including a second factory. But delays and changes in heat policy have, unfortunately, meant pausing those plans and even reducing our workforce.”

In transport, the single largest emitting sector, the government has softened its position in the face of lobbying by the car industry, relaxing the rules in April to allow hybrid cars to be sold until 2035 – five years later than first scheduled.

The unravelling of the political consensus on net zero is also slowing the transition, Krajinska said. “As soon as we saw the shift in politics, business very quickly shifted positioning from being very [in favour of] ambitious uptake to pushing back against regulation.”

She said: “[The transport sector] is exploiting Labour’s need to deliver growth and jobs on a rapid timescale – they are using the narrative that the transition is going to cost jobs in some of the most deprived areas of the UK, some of the most likely to vote Reform.”

While the EU has introduced binding emissions targets for heavy goods vehicles, there is still no zero emissions mandate for HGVs in the UK. Krajinska said: “There is a real risk that production of that technology won’t properly kick-start in the UK at scale, before we have a significant rise in imports from China. We are now in a race to scale up this technology.”

There are pockets of good news. Among them, the fact that the building materials company Heidelberg has signed a contract with the government for a carbon capture project in Padeswood, north Wales, to produce cement, while capturing the associated emissions – though this is driven by taxpayer’s cash. The Padeswood plant falls under £9.4bn announced for carbon capture in the government’s spending review in June.

Mahesh Roy, programme director for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)at the Green Finance Institute, said: “There’s quite a strong signal being sent by government. As a result there are dozens of [SAF] developers, many of them with a pathway to getting a final investment decision.”

Among business leaders, criticism of Labour is more widespread than anxiety about the prospect of a Reform government. While the latter has threatened to rip up contracts guaranteeing a minimum price for low carbon energy, developers point out these are legally binding agreements. Some welcome the growing discord between parties as the shattering of a false consensus, allowing a franker debate about the costs of the energy transition.

Synthetic fuels comparison The good news is that the cost of green power should keep falling as the technology gets more efficient.","Imagine powering long-haul aircraft and heavy ships with fuels derived from just air, water and renewable electricity. This is moving from science fiction to the verge of reality, thanks to the falling price of renewables like wind and solar.

Whereas burning today's fuels releases carbon into the atmosphere that has been sequestered underground for millions of years, these ""e-fuels"" would be more environmentally friendly, adding and subtracting carbon from the air in roughly equal quantities.

We're seeing a glimpse of the future in HIF Global's Haru Oni project in the south of Chile, backed by Porsche and ExxonMobil. It uses wind power to produce synthetic methanol and gasoline, marking one of the first commercial e-fuel ventures. Similar projects are under development in North Africa, Iceland and the Arabian peninsula, targeting export of e-methanol and e-kerosene.

E-fuels sit within the broader category of synthetic fuels, which are vital for sectors like aviation and shipping that won't be able to switch to electric power or clean fuels such as hydrogen any time soon.

Synthetic fuels are chemically similar to the energy-dense liquid fuels these modes of transport currently rely on, though it's equally possible to produce gases. They still only comprise a tiny share of fuels in these sectors—for instance, around 0.3% of global jet engine fuel was synthetic in 2024.

This is expected to change dramatically in the coming years, potentially rising as high as 50% by 2050. In the meantime, each synthetic fuel comes with trade-offs that affect their costs, scalability and the time to reach the market.

Biochemical fuels are derived either from processing waste fats and oils, or using fermentation or enzymes to transform things like crops and organic waste into alcohols. In both cases, there's a final step that involves adding hydrogen, in a process called catalytic hydrogenation.

The supply chains are well established for this kind of production, but there's a lot of competition for the raw materials. They have to be grown on land or water that would otherwise be used for food. Even under optimistic assumptions, these won't satisfy global demand for sustainable fuels alone.

Thermochemical production uses high temperatures to convert wood residues, waste biomass or even plastics into syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen). This is then converted into liquid fuels through an industrial process such as Fischer–Tropsch, in which they are heated and run over a catalyst like cobalt.

There's no need for food feedstocks here, and the industrial processes are proven. However, you must still collect and transport large volumes of feedstock, while the high-temperature plants are expensive. As it stands, the vast majority of today's synthetic fuels are therefore biochemical, mostly from reprocessing oils.

E-fuels

E-fuels are the newest option. Many leaders in global energy expect them to play a central role in decarbonizing aviation and shipping—especially as biomass feedstocks reach their limits. The challenge is that making e-fuels is energy-intensive and currently expensive, particularly where renewable power is scarce or costly. Here's how it breaks down:

1. Carbon dioxide capture

Capturing and concentrating CO₂ requires about 1–3 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy per tonne, which is fairly significant. Using commercially supplied CO₂ is about one-third the cost of capturing it from the air, so hybrid approaches that use some commercial CO₂ will probably take off first. Commercial CO₂ is usually a byproduct from burning fossil fuels, so this has an environmental downside.

2. Hydrogen production

Even the best methods for extracting hydrogen from water operate at about 70% efficiency. This means that 50–55 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity are needed to produce 1kg of hydrogen, which stores only 33 kWh of chemical energy—in other words, considerably more energy goes in than out. This is one reason why making fuels from electricity will probably never be as cheap as using direct electrical power.

3. Compression, storage and transport

Hydrogen must be compressed or liquefied, consuming additional energy (for example, around 10–13 kWh per kg of hydrogen for liquefaction). Hydrogen is also prone to leakage and can embrittle steel pipelines, making long-distance transport difficult.

4. Converting carbon dioxide to fuel

The captured and concentrated C0₂ is converted into fuel by reacting it with hydrogen—or it can first be reduced to carbon monoxide in a catalytic ""fuel synthesis"" process. In both cases, the resultant product can be an alcohol such as methanol, or a more complex hydrocarbon such as a mixture of paraffins or waxes. Dependent on the desired final product, further processing may be necessary. These steps require high temperatures and pressures, adding energy demand and capital cost.

In sum, each of these four processes compounds energy losses. Until green electricity gets much cheaper, e-fuels will remain a premium product.

In the US and UK, electricity prices are currently around four times greater than natural gas, whereas in Europe it's about 2.5 times greater. Roughly speaking, e-fuels will remain more expensive than fossil fuels until these prices reach parity. Electricity prices incorporate manufacturing and distribution costs as well as taxes, so we'll need reductions across the board.

Synthetic fuels comparison

The good news is that the cost of green power should keep falling as the technology gets more efficient. In aviation, recent analysis predicts that most sustainable fuel will be biochemical or thermochemical until 2040, but after that most growth is likely to come from e-fuels. By 2050, these could make up over half of all synthetic fuels.

E-fuels could be made in regions rich in renewables such as North Africa, Patagonia and Iceland—creating new players in the global energy trade. A whole ecosystem involving everything from large-scale renewables to fuel logistics will have to be scaled rapidly to make this industry viable.

In short, the chemistry works but the economics are still catching up. And while e-fuels are an exciting prospect, they're not a silver bullet. Governments and the energy industry will still need to prioritize the switch to electric power and greater energy efficiency wherever possible.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/fuel-made-from-just-ai.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 21:56:09.298016

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. In my work with global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed firsthand the urgent race toward decarbonization that’s reshaping the entire industry. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents the most promising near-term solution, yet we’re standing at the very beginning of a transformation that will fundamentally alter how we power flight. The World Economic Forum estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed for aviation to reach net-zero by 2050. What fascinates me most isn’t just the technological innovation happening today, but the complete reinvention of fuel production, distribution, and economics that’s unfolding before us. We’re not just talking about cleaner fuel – we’re witnessing the birth of an entirely new energy ecosystem that will redefine aviation’s environmental and economic landscape for decades to come.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Scale and Cost Conundrum

The most immediate barrier I consistently encounter in my consulting work with airline executives is the staggering gap between current SAF production and what’s needed for meaningful industry transformation. McKinsey & Company reports that current global SAF production represents less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel demand, creating a classic chicken-and-egg scenario. Airlines hesitate to commit to large-scale SAF adoption without guaranteed supply at competitive prices, while producers remain cautious about investing billions in production facilities without long-term purchase agreements. I’ve sat in boardrooms where the math simply doesn’t work – SAF currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel, creating an unsustainable financial burden for airlines already operating on razor-thin margins. As noted by Harvard Business Review, this cost differential represents one of the most significant barriers to widespread adoption, requiring either technological breakthroughs or substantial policy intervention to bridge the gap.

Challenge 2: Feedstock Limitations and Sustainability Questions

The second challenge that keeps industry leaders up at night revolves around feedstock availability and the genuine sustainability of current production methods. Deloitte research highlights that first-generation SAF production, which relies heavily on food crops and waste oils, faces significant scalability constraints due to limited feedstock availability. In my discussions with energy ministers and agricultural experts, I’ve seen how the competition for biomass between fuel production, food security, and other industrial uses creates complex ethical and logistical challenges. Furthermore, PwC analysis warns that without robust certification and lifecycle assessment frameworks, some SAF production pathways may not deliver the promised emissions reductions when accounting for land-use changes and production emissions. The industry is grappling with how to scale production while ensuring genuine environmental benefits – a balancing act that requires sophisticated supply chain management and transparent verification systems.

Challenge 3: Infrastructure and Distribution Bottlenecks

The third critical challenge involves the massive infrastructure overhaul required to support widespread SAF adoption. Current aviation fuel infrastructure, from pipelines to airport storage facilities, wasn’t designed with SAF in mind. Accenture research indicates that retrofitting existing infrastructure for SAF compatibility represents a multi-billion dollar investment that no single stakeholder is prepared to shoulder alone. I’ve advised airport authorities facing the dilemma of whether to invest in dedicated SAF infrastructure now or wait for clearer market signals. The logistical complexity extends beyond airports to the entire supply chain – from production facilities to blending stations to final delivery. Forbes insights suggest that without coordinated investment in infrastructure modernization, the industry risks creating production capacity that can’t efficiently reach the aircraft that need it, creating artificial supply constraints and driving costs even higher.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that we’re seeing remarkable innovation addressing these challenges head-on. From my front-row seat observing technological evolution, three solutions particularly excite me:

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Technologies

First, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies are emerging as game-changers. Unlike biomass-based approaches, PtL uses renewable electricity to produce synthetic fuels from carbon dioxide and water, essentially creating fuel from air. Major European energy companies are already building commercial-scale PtL facilities that could eventually produce SAF with near-zero lifecycle emissions. The beauty of this approach is its scalability – it’s not limited by biomass availability and can be located anywhere with access to renewable energy and CO2 sources.

Blockchain-Based Tracking Systems

Second, advanced certification and blockchain-based tracking systems are bringing unprecedented transparency to the SAF value chain. I’ve consulted with airlines implementing distributed ledger technology to track every liter of SAF from production to combustion, providing irrefutable proof of sustainability claims. This technological solution addresses both the sustainability verification challenge and enables more efficient carbon accounting, which is becoming increasingly important as carbon pricing mechanisms evolve.

Innovative Business Models

Third, we’re seeing innovative business models that spread risk and investment across multiple stakeholders. Corporate sustainability programs, where companies purchase SAF to offset their business travel emissions, are creating guaranteed demand that helps de-risk production investments. Similarly, fuel offtake agreements between airlines, producers, and financial institutions are creating the long-term certainty needed to justify massive capital investments in production facilities.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a picture of explosive growth and transformation. According to BloombergNEF, the global SAF market is projected to grow from approximately $500 million in 2023 to over $30 billion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate of nearly 40%. What’s particularly fascinating from my futurist perspective is how this growth will catalyze broader industry transformation.

2024-2028: Technology Scaling and Cost Reduction

Less than 0.1% current SAF production scaling toward meaningful adoption

Power-to-liquid technologies reaching commercial scale

2-4x cost premium gradually narrowing through innovation

Corporate sustainability programs creating guaranteed demand

2029-2033: Market Transformation and Infrastructure Development

$30B global SAF market by 2035 trajectory

SAF reaching price parity with conventional jet fuel

Third-generation SAF using novel feedstocks reaching commercial scale

10-15% of global aviation fuel demand met by SAF

2034-2038: Ecosystem Maturity and New Business Models

“Fuel-as-a-service” companies managing entire SAF value chain

40-50% of aviation fuel demand met by SAF by 2050

Regional SAF hubs creating efficient distribution networks

Standardized global certification frameworks established

2039-2050: Sustainable Aviation Ecosystem

SAF evolving from sustainability initiative to core strategic imperative

Complete reinvention of aviation fuel production and distribution

Integration of SAF into airline operations as standard practice

Aviation industry achieving net-zero emissions targets

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, Sustainable Aviation Fuel will evolve from a niche sustainability initiative to a core strategic imperative for the entire aviation ecosystem. We’ll witness the emergence of regional SAF hubs, the development of standardized global certification frameworks, and the integration of SAF into airline operations as a standard rather than exception. The companies that thrive will be those that view SAF not as a cost center but as a competitive advantage – a way to future-proof their operations while meeting growing stakeholder demands for environmental responsibility. The transition will be challenging, but the organizations that embrace innovation and collaboration today will define the aviation industry of tomorrow.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The journey toward sustainable aviation represents one of the most exciting technological and business transformations of our generation. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The future of flight isn’t just about reaching destinations – it’s about arriving at a cleaner, more sustainable world.” The Sustainable Aviation Fuel revolution demonstrates how human ingenuity, when combined with strategic vision and collaborative effort, can solve even the most complex challenges. We’re not just changing how planes fly; we’re reimagining humanity’s relationship with the skies.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. In my work with global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed firsthand the immense pressure the industry faces to decarbonize while maintaining growth. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents the most promising near-term solution, yet current production meets less than 0.1% of total jet fuel demand. The World Economic Forum estimates that achieving aviation’s net-zero ambitions will require investments exceeding $1.5 trillion in SAF production and infrastructure by 2050. What I’m seeing across boardrooms worldwide is a fundamental rethinking of aviation’s future—not just as a transportation sector, but as a complex ecosystem where sustainability, technology, and economics converge in unprecedented ways. The transformation ahead will redefine everything from fuel sourcing to flight operations, creating both immense challenges and extraordinary opportunities for forward-thinking organizations.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The SAF Production and Scalability Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting with aviation executives is the massive gap between SAF ambition and production reality. According to McKinsey & Company analysis, meeting aviation’s 2050 net-zero targets would require building approximately 300-400 new SAF production facilities globally—a scale of industrial development that rivals the entire current global refining capacity. The fundamental issue isn’t technological feasibility but economic viability and scalability. As noted by Deloitte’s energy specialists, current SAF production costs remain 2-4 times higher than conventional jet fuel, creating a significant adoption barrier. I’ve sat in strategy sessions where airline CEOs grapple with this cost differential while facing shareholder pressure for sustainability progress. The real-world impact is stark: airlines committing to SAF offtake agreements face billions in additional fuel costs without corresponding revenue increases, creating a fundamental business model challenge that must be solved through innovation and policy support.

Challenge 2: Infrastructure and Supply Chain Transformation

The second critical challenge involves the complete reengineering of aviation’s fuel infrastructure. In my experience advising airport authorities and fuel suppliers, the transition to SAF requires massive capital investment in entirely new supply chains. Harvard Business Review research highlights that existing pipeline systems, storage facilities, and refueling infrastructure were designed for petroleum-based fuels, creating compatibility and logistics hurdles for widespread SAF integration. What many business leaders underestimate is the domino effect: changing one element of the fuel ecosystem requires rethinking the entire value chain. I’ve seen this firsthand in projects with major European airports where SAF integration necessitated everything from new storage tank modifications to revised safety protocols and specialized transportation arrangements. The business impact extends beyond direct costs to include operational complexity, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder coordination across multiple jurisdictions and organizations.

Challenge 3: Technological Uncertainty and Investment Timing

The third challenge that keeps aviation executives awake at night—and one I frequently discuss in my future readiness workshops—is navigating the technological landscape amid competing SAF production pathways. According to PwC’s energy transition analysis, at least eight distinct SAF production technologies show promise, from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) to power-to-liquid (PtL) and alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathways. Each technology carries different capital requirements, feedstock dependencies, scalability timelines, and carbon reduction potentials. The dilemma for business leaders is determining which technologies to bet on today for returns that may take decades to materialize. I’ve witnessed this uncertainty paralyze investment decisions in organizations that traditionally prefer proven, low-risk technologies. As Accenture’s sustainability practice notes, the risk of backing the wrong technology or timing investments poorly could result in stranded assets or competitive disadvantage in a rapidly evolving market.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. In my research and consulting, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that leading organizations are implementing today.

Long-Term SAF Purchase Agreements

First, major airlines like United and Delta are pioneering long-term SAF purchase agreements with fuel producers, creating demand certainty that enables production scale-up. These agreements, often structured with price premium sharing mechanisms, demonstrate how industry collaboration can overcome initial cost barriers.

Advanced Bioengineering Solutions

Second, technology companies are developing advanced bioengineering solutions that dramatically increase SAF production efficiency. Companies like LanzaJet and Gevo are leveraging synthetic biology and advanced catalysis to convert diverse feedstocks—from agricultural waste to captured carbon—into high-quality SAF. I’ve toured facilities where these technologies are achieving near-commercial scale, with carbon reduction potentials exceeding 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Digital Platforms for Logistics and Certification

Third, digital platforms are emerging to optimize SAF logistics and certification. Blockchain-based tracking systems, similar to those I’ve helped implement in other industries, are now being deployed to ensure SAF sustainability credentials and streamline supply chain management. These digital solutions reduce administrative overhead while providing transparent environmental accounting that satisfies regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations.

Policy Innovation and Financing Mechanisms

Fourth, policy innovation is creating new financing mechanisms. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s SAF tax credits and the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative are creating economic incentives that accelerate investment. In my strategic advisory work, I’m seeing how these policies are triggering cascading effects across the value chain, from feedstock producers to fuel distributors.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of technology adoption curves and industry transformation patterns, I project that SAF will account for approximately 15-20% of global aviation fuel by 2035, up from less than 0.1% today. According to BloombergNEF forecasts, the global SAF market will grow from approximately $500 million in 2023 to over $30 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of nearly 70%. This explosive growth will be driven by regulatory mandates, corporate sustainability commitments, and rapidly improving production economics.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

The coming decade will witness the most profound transformation in aviation since the jet engine. SAF will evolve from niche alternative to mainstream fuel source, supported by technological breakthroughs, policy frameworks, and changing consumer expectations. The opportunities for early movers are substantial: first-mover advantage in new fuel production, premium pricing for sustainable travel options, and strengthened brand positioning. However, risks abound for organizations that delay adaptation, including regulatory non-compliance, competitive disadvantage, and stranded assets in conventional fuel infrastructure. The companies that thrive will be those embracing innovation today while building flexible, future-ready organizations capable of navigating the uncertainties ahead.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of aviation isn’t just about reaching destinations—it’s about arriving at a sustainable world. As I often tell leaders in my keynotes, “The runway to sustainability is built with innovation, fueled by courage, and cleared by vision.” The transition to SAF represents one of the most significant industrial transformations of our lifetime, creating extraordinary opportunities for organizations that lead rather than follow.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge facing the aviation and SAF industry is the massive gap between current production capacity and future demand. As noted by McKinsey & Company, global SAF production needs to increase by approximately 3,000 times current levels to meet 2050 climate goals. In my consulting work with airline executives, I’ve seen the frustration firsthand—they want to commit to SAF but simply can’t secure the volumes needed at competitive prices. The reality is that scaling SAF production requires billions in infrastructure investment, complex supply chain development, and technological breakthroughs that haven’t yet been proven at commercial scale. Harvard Business Review highlights that this isn’t just a technical challenge but a fundamental business model problem, where traditional risk-averse investment approaches clash with the need for rapid, massive capital deployment.

Challenge 2: The Cost Competitiveness Conundrum

Sustainable aviation fuel currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel, creating what Deloitte describes as the “green premium” that threatens widespread adoption. From my perspective working with both airlines and fuel producers, this price differential creates a classic chicken-and-egg problem. Airlines can’t justify paying premium prices without passenger willingness to share the cost, while fuel producers can’t achieve economies of scale without guaranteed offtake agreements. The World Economic Forum reports that this cost gap represents one of the most significant barriers to decarbonizing aviation. I’ve sat in boardrooms where CFOs grapple with how to balance sustainability commitments against shareholder expectations for profitability, and this tension is reshaping corporate strategy across the aviation value chain.

Challenge 3: Regulatory and Certification Complexity

The third major challenge lies in the complex web of international regulations, certification requirements, and sustainability standards that vary significantly across regions. According to PwC research, the lack of harmonized global standards creates uncertainty for investors and slows down project development. In my experience advising government agencies and private companies, I’ve seen how differing certification requirements between the EU, US, and Asia create compliance headaches and increase costs. The Harvard Business Review notes that regulatory fragmentation threatens to undermine the global nature of aviation itself, potentially creating regional disparities in sustainability progress. This regulatory maze requires sophisticated navigation that many traditional aviation companies aren’t equipped to handle.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. Leading organizations are implementing several key strategies that I believe will accelerate the SAF revolution.

Strategic Partnerships and Offtake Agreements

First, major airlines like United and Delta are securing their future fuel supply through strategic partnerships and long-term offtake agreements with SAF producers. These agreements provide the certainty needed to justify production investments while giving airlines price stability. I’ve advised several carriers on structuring these deals, and the most successful ones include volume commitments, price mechanisms, and shared risk profiles.

Technological Innovation Across Production Pathways

Second, technological innovation is rapidly advancing across multiple SAF production pathways. Companies like LanzaJet and Neste are scaling up production using different feedstocks and processes. According to Accenture research, the diversification of production methods creates resilience in the supply chain and drives cost reductions through competition and innovation.

Digital Technologies for Value Chain Optimization

Third, digital technologies are playing a crucial role in optimizing the entire SAF value chain. Blockchain for tracking sustainability credentials, AI for optimizing production processes, and IoT for monitoring fuel quality are becoming standard in leading organizations. In my work with energy companies, I’ve seen how digital twins of production facilities can accelerate scale-up while reducing capital risk.

Corporate Sustainability Programs

Fourth, corporate sustainability programs are creating demand pull through voluntary carbon offset mechanisms. Microsoft, Amazon, and other major corporations are purchasing SAF certificates to decarbonize their business travel and supply chains, creating additional revenue streams for producers.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a compelling picture of transformation. According to BloombergNEF, the SAF market is projected to grow from approximately $1 billion today to over $130 billion by 2050, representing one of the fastest-growing segments in the energy transition. My analysis suggests we’ll see several key developments over the next decade.

2024-2028: Cost Parity and Market Scaling

SAF reaching cost parity with conventional jet fuel in key markets

Production tax credits and carbon pricing driving adoption

Major airlines securing 10-20% of fuel from SAF sources

Aviation industry achieving net-zero carbon emissions targets

2050+: Sustainable Aviation Ecosystem

Aviation becoming a model for sustainable transportation

SAF production integrated with circular economy principles

Global harmonization of standards and certification

Aviation contributing to carbon removal through advanced SAF technologies

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, aviation will undergo its most significant transformation since the dawn of the jet age. SAF will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream fuel source, fundamentally reshaping airline operations, airport infrastructure, and global energy markets. The airlines that thrive will be those that embrace this transition as a strategic imperative rather than a compliance requirement. We’ll see new business models emerge, from fuel-as-a-service offerings to integrated sustainability platforms. The risks are substantial—companies that delay adaptation may find themselves permanently disadvantaged—but the opportunities for innovation and leadership are even greater.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of aviation isn’t just about flying—it’s about flying responsibly, efficiently, and sustainably. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The companies that will dominate the future aren’t waiting for change; they’re building the engines of transformation today.”

Through its partnership with Samsung E&A, the two will develop a SAF production and supply chain originating in the United States.
KE and Samsung E&A will identify and evaluate overseas SAF production projects, and review long-term SAF opportunities.
FT-based production can process non-edible and waste biomass such as wood residues, while offering significantly greater carbon-reduction benefits, KE said.

SAF lessens the carbon footprint in flight operations as this is made up of renewable waste and raw materials.

""This partnership will further contribute to the aviation industry’s Net Zero 2050 goal and enhance our ability to effectively navigate evolving global environmental regulations, including SAF mandates,"" KE said in a statement on Friday.

Through its partnership with Samsung E&A, the two will develop a SAF production and supply chain originating in the United States.

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed by KE Vice Chair Woo Kee-hong and Samsung E&A chief executive officer Hong Nam-koong Hong at the KE's headquarters in Seoul on November 20.

KE and Samsung E&A will identify and evaluate overseas SAF production projects, and review long-term SAF opportunities.

They will also explore investments in SAF-related technologies and projects.

According to KE, the US was chosen as first target market since it has an abundant feedstock, advanced technology, and strong infrastructure.

Samsung E&A is currently reviewing participation in a US SAF project that will use gasification Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology to convert woody waste into synthetic liquid fuel.

This next-generation approach expands the range of usable feedstocks beyond the limitations of first-generation SAF, which depends on restricted materials such as used cooking oil.

FT-based production can process non-edible and waste biomass such as wood residues, while offering significantly greater carbon-reduction benefits, KE said.

The airline said it is reviewing its participation as an offtaker of the SAF produced through the project.

""Through proactive project participation and continuous cooperation, we aim to accelerate global SAF adoption and advance our commitment to sustainable aviation and ESG (environmental, social and governance) management,"" KE said.

To recall, KE is the first Korean carrier to operate a SAF-blended flight in 2017.

In 2024, KE began using domestically produced SAF for select flights departing from Incheon International Airport and later expanded its use in flights via Gimpo International Airport.

KE has been using a 1 percent SAF blend on flights from Incheon to Kobe, and Gimpo to Osaka from Sept. 19, 2025 to Dec. 31, 2026. This will cover around 90 flights on the Kobe route and 26 flights on the Osaka route.

The airline’s SAF is sourced from domestic suppliers, and was produced from used cooking oil.",https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/11/23/839630.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 16:56:09.974222
