With the interagency review process is complete, the EPA is expected to soon publish the proposed rule in the Federal Register and open a public comment period.
The OMB has also concluded its review of a final rulemaking to partially waive the 2024 cellulosic RVO.
The agency in December 2024 first proposed plans to issue the partial cellulosic waiver and extend the 2024 RFS compliance deadline.
The EPA in March took action on the deadline component of its proposal, issuing a final rule extending the 2024 RFS compliance deadline.","The White House Office of Management and Budget on June 11 concluded its review of two Renewable Fuel Standard rulemakings, including a proposed rule to set new renewable volume obligations (RVOs) and a final rule for a partial waiver of the 2024 cellulosic RVO. Both rulemakings had been under review by the OMB since May 14.

The proposed rule to set new RFS RVOs is formally titled “Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program: Set 2.” While no details have been made public, a brief summery posted to the OMB website indicates the rulemaking is expected to include 2026 RVOs for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, biobased diesel and total renewable fuel. According to the OMB, the “action also contains several regulatory changes to the RFS program intended to improve the program’s implementation.”

The OMB interagency review process marks a final step before a proposed rulemaking is released for public comment. The OMB review process aims to ensure agency-proposed regulations align with White House priorities and offers an opportunity to various federal agencies to weigh in the proposal. Trade groups, industry representatives and other members of the public can request to meet with government officials to discuss the proposed regulatory actions during the review period. According to OMB records, representatives of the Advanced Biofuels Association, Kinder Morgan, Gevo Inc., OPAL Fuels, the Sustainable Advanced Biofuels Refiners Coalition, NATSO, the Renewable Natural Gas Coalition, Growth Energy, Clean Fuels Alliance America, the Renewable Fuels Association, Amp Americas, the American Biogas Council, American Petroleum Institute, Fuels America, and National Oilseed Processors Association are among those who met with OMB officials during the review process.

With the interagency review process is complete, the EPA is expected to soon publish the proposed rule in the Federal Register and open a public comment period.

The OMB has also concluded its review of a final rulemaking to partially waive the 2024 cellulosic RVO. At part of the review process, the agency met with representatives of the Small Refineries coalition and Wynnewood Refining Co., RFA, Amp Americas, NATSO and SIGMA, the RNG Coalition, Marathon Ashland Petroleum Co., and American Fuel and Petrochemicals Manufacturers.

The agency in December 2024 first proposed plans to issue the partial cellulosic waiver and extend the 2024 RFS compliance deadline. At that time, the EPA proposed to reduce the 2024 cellulosic RVO from 1.09 billion renewable identification numbers (RINs) to 880 million RINs.

The EPA in March took action on the deadline component of its proposal, issuing a final rule extending the 2024 RFS compliance deadline.

In total, Montana Renewables will not pay property taxes on $67.4 million worth of assets at the plant.
Initially, Montana Renewables attempted to qualify the entire biorefinery, valued at $562 million, as tax-exempt under the pollution control equipment benefit.
Montana Renewables appealed and maintained that the entire operation is “one emissions-reducing unit.” Following the settlement, Montana Renewables dropped its appeal.
The company is going through its second multi-year tax protest since 2017 and has three pending cases before the Montana Tax Appeal Board.","A state board has nearly tripled the amount of equipment eligible for a tax exemption at the Montana Renewables biorefinery in Great Falls and left the door open for additional exemptions in the future.

The company, a subsidiary of Calumet, reached a settlement with the Montana Tax Appeal Board in May. Montana Renewables had appealed a prior determination by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality that $24.5 million in assets qualified for a tax exemption as “pollution control equipment.”

The terms of the settlement, released through a public information request by Montana Free Press, show that an additional $42.9 million in equipment will be eligible for the tax exemption. In total, Montana Renewables will not pay property taxes on $67.4 million worth of assets at the plant.

The exemption is retroactive to December 2022. The settlement also stipulates that the exemption applies to current assets only and that “nothing in this settlement agreement shall prevent MRL [Montana Renewables] from seeking pollution control equipment certifications for new assets” in the future.

Initially, Montana Renewables attempted to qualify the entire biorefinery, valued at $562 million, as tax-exempt under the pollution control equipment benefit. The exemption is aimed at “portions” of equipment or machinery that prevent the creation of air or water pollutants, according to Montana law.

The exemption request applied to the future expansion of the biorefinery, which is estimated to be finished by late 2027.

The DEQ rejected the request for a full tax exemption and identified specific equipment that controls or reduces emissions at the plant. The agency determined that the eligible equipment amounted to $24,579,241. Montana Renewables appealed and maintained that the entire operation is “one emissions-reducing unit.” Following the settlement, Montana Renewables dropped its appeal.

Montana Renewables did not return a request for comment Thursday.

Calumet launched Montana Renewables in 2021 to operate within the footprint of the Great Falls oil refinery. The biorefinery uses agriculturally based raw materials like canola oil and soybean oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to Montana Renewables to fund an expansion that will more than double the plant’s output.

Sustainable aviation fuel produces less pollution than conventional jet fuel. However, some researchers have questioned the environmental benefits of fuels derived from agriculture, taking into account the land use and production impacts.

Projections submitted by Montana Renewables suggest that the fully expanded plant could emit more pollutants than the plant did as a dedicated crude oil refinery.

The Calumet crude oil refinery continues to operate, though it has scaled down production to make room for Montana Renewables. Total greenhouse gas emissions at the entire Great Falls site were 427,371 tons in 2023, the highest amount in EPA’s published data for the location since 2010.

It’s not yet clear exactly how much this will impact the company’s property tax liability. The Montana Department of Revenue must apply multiple tax benefits to the site. Those include a 50% tax break on a portion of the plant from the city of Great Falls and a 50% break on the entire plant from Cascade County, both of which apply to Montana Renewables. The company also applied for a 50% tax break through a state-level energy production benefit that’s still under review.

This latest settlement will be worked into those calculations. A spokesperson for the Department of Revenue didn’t return a question about how the exemption would be applied. The two companies are among the largest taxpayers in Cascade County.

Calumet, which is taxed separately for the crude oil refinery operation, is subject to an 80% tax break on $6.1 million in equipment. The company is going through its second multi-year tax protest since 2017 and has three pending cases before the Montana Tax Appeal Board. Hearings are currently scheduled for 2026.",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCF3189_2.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 21:00:14.801644

On Trade Certainty:

“I’ve made clear that I support President Trump’s goals of getting better trade deals for U.S. producers. I’ve heard from many industries and businesses in Iowa. Each one of them [is] in a very unique position due to the tariffs, but all express one common concern – and that’s the need for certainty around trade.

“I’ve spoken with several Trump administration officials and nominees about the importance of finalizing two or three deals to provide some certainty around trade. So, would you agree that trade deals need some certainty and that at the same time, provide fair market access for U.S. goods would benefit the economy and provide much needed markets?”

On 45Z Regulations and Farmers:

“The Senate Finance Committee has been working on what will soon be the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Tax Credit. Implementing this credit properly is important for the biofuels industry and especially for farmers.

“The Biden administration failed to meaningfully address 45Z regulations. They put some out for comment, but not much beyond that. But the regulations it released for the 40B Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credit demonstrated that Treasury officials in that administration knew nothing about farming.

“Prior to issuing rules governing 45Z, we need everyone in the Trump administration to take some time to learn a thing or two about how farming works. So, this is kind of a question of working ahead, looking after the president signs this bill, and regulations are going to be written on 45Z. Would you be willing to work with congressional colleagues, farmer-led organizations and even this senator to make sure that we get regulations under 45Z that work for farmers?”

Extending 2017 Trump Tax Cuts:

“The 2017 tax law provided tax relief across all incomes with a focus on the middle-class. Just as important, the law included pro-growth reforms to incentivize business investment, boosting production and leading to higher wages.

“A study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found the 2017 law boosted investment 20 percent. What will making the 2017 tax law permanent mean in terms of economic growth, job creation and wage growth?”",https://www.grassley.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.png,N,,2025-06-12 21:01:11.280347

But you cannot manage what you don’t measure. Therefore, a vital consideration is the transparent and accurate provision of CO2 emissions data from flights, for both passengers and cargo.

In 2022, IATA launched CO2 Connect, a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonization, driven by global standard methodologies and high-quality data. With the contribution of more than 70 airlines today, the tool has been established as the benchmark for measuring aviation emissions globally.

French airlines are among the key players leading the way. We spoke to three airlines—Corsair, Air Corsica and ASL Airlines France—that have recently joined the CO2 Connect program to understand how the tool is helping them.

The EU, including France, has implementednumerous regulations to reduce CO2 emissions from air transport. What does it mean for your airline?

Marie Antoinette Santoni, VP Network, ESG and Communications at Air Corsica notes that the airline industry’s commitment to net-zero, together with regulations introduced by the EU, requires the airline to rethink its operations to reduce its carbon footprint. “This means investing in a newer fleet of aircraft—with 85% of the fleet renewed, we have seen a 16% reduction in CO2 emissions—cleaner technologies and optimizing our routes to consume less fuel and reduce our CO2 emissions.”

“For the moment, it means additional costs, charges and taxes. SAF, which is a solution, is not available in the market and is too expensive. And the ReFuelEU anti-tankering provisions are unfairly onerous and costly to airlines serving smaller regional airports across Europe,” says Captain Nicolas Redier, Flight Ops Director at ASL Airlines France.

“The growing body of European regulations reflects a strong commitment to transformation, but their implementation poses significant operational and economic challenges for our sector,” says Cyrille Digon, Director of Flight Support and CSR at Corsair.

But overall, the airlines are firmly committed to reducing their environmental impact and complying with the regulations, says Santoni.

How important is the data from CO2 Connect in providing an accurate, credible picture of CO2 emission reductions across the aviation industry?

“CO2 Connect, using the IATA methodology, provides standardized, verifiable, and comparable data. Contributing our data is part of our commitment to reducing the overall emissions from aviation,” says Digon.

Captain Redier from ASL Airlines France, highlights that CO2 emission reduction is a commitment for the whole aviation industry. “CO2 Connect is a common tool for a common target. Working together in the same direction makes our efforts more efficient and accurate.”

“The data provided by CO2 Connect, in accordance with the IATA methodology, is essential for establishing an accurate and credible picture of our emissions reduction efforts. It not only allows us to track our progress, but also enables us to communicate transparently with our customers and partners about our environmental impact,” says Air Corsica’s Santoni.

Is your airline providing or considering using CO2 Connect to provide visibility of the carbon footprint to your flying passengers or corporate clients?

“Yes, we plan to soon integrate CO2 Connect across all our customer segments—flying passengers, corporate clients, and cargo—to enhance environmental transparency. Our intention is to make it available directly on our website, allowing customers to easily access and monitor their carbon footprint,” says Digon.

Santoni notes that Air Corsica recognizes the importance of transparency regarding its carbon footprint. “We are currently considering integrating CO2 Connect into our services to provide our passengers and business customers with clear visibility into the emissions associated with their travel. This could help them make more informed decisions when choosing more sustainable flight options.”

How important is the ability for CO2 Connect to account for SAF in the emissions calculations?

“It is a key driver,” says Digon, “Alongside fleet modernization, to achieve net-zero objectives. The increasing use of SAF, and soon e-SAF, must be properly reflected and valued in emissions accounting methodologies.”

“SAF represents a tangible solution for reducing CO2 emissions from aviation. The inclusion of SAF in CO2 Connect emissions calculations is crucial to achieving our net-zero targets. We are closely monitoring technological developments and hope that the production of these new fuels will enable us to increasingly integrate them into our consumption,” says Santoni at Air Corsica.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/5a66352875d14648ace7630457924ba7/gettyimages-1331820787-1200x800-6a45073.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 21:01:19.211270

Today, all Airbus aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and conventional fuel. By 2030, all Airbus aircraft and helicopters will be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF. Our next-generation single aisle aircraft is being designed with SAF compatibility in mind.

SAF is one of the key ways that the aviation industry can reduce emissions, and could contribute more than 50% of the aviation industry’s carbon dioxide emissions reduction according to ATAG’s “Scenario 3”. However, encouraging airlines and operators to switch from fossil-based fuels like kerosene is a challenge. SAF is currently several times more expensive than traditional aircraft fuel, and it is less readily available.

Airbus agrees that SAF will be an important way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and is positioning itself as a catalyst in the ecosystem to promote SAF production and uptake by deploying SAF in its own operations, by forming cross-industry partnerships, and by making strategic investments.

What is SAF?

Airbus believes that scaling the SAF ecosystem isn’t possible without collaboration from different partners including airlines and operators. For this reason, Airbus has partnered with several airlines to trial the use of SAF in their operations.

Two pilot schemes launched in 2024 were:

Airbus partnered with easyJet to launch a pilot scheme on the Toulouse-Bristol route. Airbus financed 106 tonnes of SAF, the equivalent amount of fuel necessary to run flights between Toulouse and Bristol on a 30% SAF blend during the three month trial period. The trial aimed to act as a proof of concept, demonstrating how airlines and corporate organisations can share the cost of SAF in a mutually beneficial way, ultimately creating additional supply and demand for SAF.

Airbus provided technical guidance and expertise to WizzAir during a SAF operational trial where WizzAir operated more than 50 flights using a blend of SAF and traditional jet fuel.

During the WizzAir trial, a passenger survey was also launched, emphasising the importance of understanding how travellers feel about low-carbon aviation, and whether they would be willing to pay extra to reduce the emissions on their flights.

In terms of partnerships that support the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus has a long-standing relationship with TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. Since 2024, TotalEnergies supply enough SAF to meet more than half Airbus’ needs in Europe, and the two companies also have a shared research programme that is working on the transition to 100% SAF capability.

In recent years, Airbus has also signed MOUs with Neste – to jointly advance the production and uptake of SAF – and with OMV – to explore joint solutions that broaden access to SAF for various customer groups, stimulating new demand and supporting investments in new SAF production facilities.

In 2024, Airbus made two investments:

Airbus invested in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund (SAFFA). SAFFA makes investments that support the production of SAF that is eligible for RefuelEU Aviation or CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) certification.

Airbus invested in SAF producer and technology company LanzaJet. LanzaJet will use the investment to scale their SAF production which uses the Alcohol-to-Jet pathway.

In 2022 and 2023, Airbus made a number of investments alongside Qantas. In 2022, Airbus and Qantas agreed to invest up to $200 million to develop the SAF industry in Australia. In 2023, Airbus and Qantas, alongside the Queensland Government, invested in a Queensland biofuel facility being developed by Jet Zero Australia in partnership with LanzaJet. These investments seek to address the availability of SAF in Australia, improving accessibility to SAF for airlines and operators who want to use it.

To further address the challenge of accessibility, Airbus has launched a “Book and Claim” demonstrator. This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. This system will improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those located far from supply points or production facilities.

As a facilitator, Airbus purchases SAF certificates and manages the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/72590.pdf FAQ What are Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs)?","Latest Developments in Sustainable Aviation Fuels

The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, and Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are being touted as a key solution. SAFs are fuels that are made from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste, or algae, and can be used to power aircraft. In recent years, there have been significant developments in the production and certification of SAFs, which are bringing the industry closer to a more sustainable future.

New Feedstocks and Conversion Technologies

One of the key challenges in the production of SAFs is the availability of suitable feedstocks. Traditional feedstocks, such as corn and sugarcane, have been criticized for their impact on food prices and land use. As a result, researchers have been exploring new feedstocks, such as agricultural waste, forestry residues, and algae. These feedstocks offer a number of advantages, including lower costs and reduced environmental impacts. For example, a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that agricultural waste could be used to produce up to 4.8 billion gallons of SAF per year in the United States alone 1. Similarly, a report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that forestry residues could be used to produce up to 10% of the world's SAF needs by 2030 2. In addition to new feedstocks, researchers have also been developing new conversion technologies that can be used to produce SAFs. These technologies include advanced fermentation, gasification, and hydroprocessing. For example, a company called LanzaJet is developing a technology that uses fermentation to convert biomass into a jet fuel that is compatible with existing aircraft engines 3.

Advances in SAF Production and Certification

In recent years, there have been significant advances in the production and certification of SAFs. A number of companies, including Neste, Boeing, and Shell, have developed commercial-scale SAF production facilities. For example, Neste's Singapore refinery is capable of producing up to 1 million tons of SAF per year 4. The certification of SAFs is also becoming more streamlined. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has developed a number of standards for SAFs, including ASTM D7566, which covers the specification for aviation turbine fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons 5. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has also developed guidelines for the use of SAFs, including a CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) methodology for calculating the emissions reductions from SAFs 6.

Industry Partnerships and Collaborations

The development and deployment of SAFs is a complex task that requires collaboration across the aviation industry. A number of partnerships and collaborations have been formed to support the development of SAFs, including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group, which is a coalition of airlines, airports, and other industry stakeholders that are working together to promote the use of SAFs 7. Other examples of industry partnerships include the collaboration between Boeing and Neste to develop a commercial-scale SAF production facility in Finland 8, and the partnership between Shell and SkyNRG to develop a SAF supply chain in Europe 9.

Commercializing Sustainable Aviation Fuels

While there have been significant advances in the production and certification of SAFs, there are still a number of challenges that need to be overcome before they can be widely adopted. One of the key challenges is the cost of production, which is currently higher than traditional fossil fuels. However, a number of companies are working to reduce the cost of SAF production through economies of scale and improvements in efficiency.

Progress Towards Commercial-Scale Production

A number of companies are making progress towards commercial-scale SAF production. For example, Neste is planning to expand its SAF production capacity to 1.5 million tons per year by 2023 10. Similarly, LanzaTech is developing a commercial-scale SAF production facility in the United States that is expected to produce up to 100 million gallons of SAF per year 11.

Challenges and Opportunities for Industry Stakeholders

The commercialization of SAFs presents a number of challenges and opportunities for industry stakeholders. One of the key challenges is the need for significant investment in infrastructure, including production facilities, storage tanks, and distribution networks. However, this also presents an opportunity for companies to develop new business models and revenue streams. For example, a report by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that the adoption of SAFs could create up to 22,000 new jobs in the United States by 2035 12. Similarly, a study by the European Commission found that the adoption of SAFs could generate up to €4.3 billion in economic benefits for the European Union by 2030 13.

Role of Policy and Regulation in Supporting SAF Adoption

Policy and regulation will play a critical role in supporting the adoption of SAFs. Governments can provide incentives, such as tax credits or subsidies, to support the development and deployment of SAFs. For example, the United States has a tax credit of up to $1.50 per gallon for SAFs that meet certain criteria 14. Regulators can also play a role in supporting the adoption of SAFs by developing standards and guidelines for their use. For example, the European Union has developed a number of regulations and guidelines for the use of SAFs, including a requirement that all aviation fuels sold in the EU contain at least 2% SAF by 2030 15.

The Road to a Sustainable Aviation Future

The adoption of SAFs has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAFs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by up to 80% by 2050 16.

Potential Emissions Reductions from SAF Adoption

The potential emissions reductions from SAF adoption are significant. According to a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the use of SAFs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by up to 75% by 2050 17.

Industry Targets and Timelines for SAF Deployment

The aviation industry has set a number of targets and timelines for SAF deployment. For example, IATA has set a target of 2% SAF adoption by 2025, and 32% by 2035 18. Similarly, the European Union has set a target of at least 32% of aviation fuels being SAF by 2035 19.

Opportunities for Innovation and Growth in the SAF Sector

The adoption of SAFs presents a number of opportunities for innovation and growth in the SAF sector. For example, companies are developing new technologies and business models to support the production and deployment of SAFs. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, the global SAF market could be worth up to $150 billion by 2050 20. The development of new feedstocks and conversion technologies is also expected to drive innovation and growth in the SAF sector. For example, the use of algae as a feedstock for SAF production is expected to become increasingly important in the coming years 21.

\text{Emissions reductions} = \frac{\text{SAF adoption rate} \times \text{emissions reduction per gallon}}{\text{total aviation fuel consumption}}

Conclusion

The future of bioenergy in aviation is looking increasingly promising, with significant advances being made in the production and certification of SAFs. While there are still challenges to be overcome, the potential emissions reductions from SAF adoption are significant, and the industry is working towards a more sustainable future.

This partnership unlocks strong synergies in the development of Advanced Air Mobility infrastructure in the United States and beyond.

The collaboration between UrbanV and Signature Aviation aims to lay the groundwork for a scalable AAM ecosystem by focusing on:

The partnership will focus on evaluating the economic viability and technical feasibility of building and managing networks of vertiports in the identified U.S. markets and beyond.

Studies will assess network planning, demand potential, infrastructure feasibility, operational integration and financial modeling to support vertiport site selection and deployment strategies.

Business Development & Ecosystem Creation

Signature Aviation will integrate vertiports within its network of private aviation terminals and drive regulatory discussions.

The JV will engage with potential vertiport sites and AAM operators, leveraging both companies’ industry connections to form strategic partnerships aimed at accelerating AAM adoption.

“This joint venture agreement is a major step in the development of AAM infrastructure for the United States,” said Carlo Tursi, CEO at UrbanV. “We have the ambition to become a major global operator of vertiport networks and we will pioneer the establishment of some of the first AAM routes. By leveraging UrbanV’s expertise in vertiport development and Signature Aviation’s established network of private aviation terminals, we are laying the foundations for seamless, efficient, and sustainable short-distance aerial transport in the United States.”

“Our partnership with UrbanV elevates our commitment to sustainability, innovation, and most importantly, our guests,” said Tony Lefebvre, Chief Executive Officer, Signature Aviation. ""As we bring together our expertise, resources, and strategy, we’re focused on driving the adoption of advanced air mobility, while also establishing the safe, seamless, and efficient infrastructure needed for the development of vertiports.""
