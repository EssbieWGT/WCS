Last year, Aether Fuels announced a partnership with Illinois-based GTI Energy to work together to commercialize, scale and produce sustainable fuels from low-value waste streams like feedstock.
The location of Aether Fuels' next scaled-up manufacturing plant is still under consideration.
Incentives and other support offered, or a lack there of, will likely play a role in Aether Fuels' ultimate decision.
Government support has helped Aether Fuels get to this point.","Conor Madigan, founder and CEO of Chicago climate-tech company Aether Fuels, thinks the United States could — and should — be a leader in sustainable aviation fuel manufacturing, but first it has to get the policy right.

""We can make it a great manufacturing opportunity for the U.S., where we build plants [and] create jobs, not only at the factories but also to source all the feedstocks — something which disproportionately benefits rural communities,"" he told Chicago Inno at a media event this week. ""It's a great opportunity. The key to it, though, is that you have to have the best manufacturing technology because it's a commodity product. It's not like 'My SAF is better than your SAF.'""

Becoming an industry leader is going to be all about which companies — and the countries they operate out of — have the best technology to develop the cheapest and most efficient manufacturing plants, he added.

And right now, supporting local technological innovation in certain industries such as climate tech does not appear to be as big of a national priority for the current administration. Threats to national scientific funding sources have left some researchers and tech startups in the sector facing funding uncertainty.

Established in 2022 as a spinout of Xora Innovation, a Singapore-based early-stage deep-tech venture firm, Aether Fuels is working on technology that is considered a potential breakthrough for SAF production by converting waste into fuel. Last year, Aether Fuels announced a partnership with Illinois-based GTI Energy to work together to commercialize, scale and produce sustainable fuels from low-value waste streams like feedstock. The climate-tech startup announced a $34 million Series A raise in 2024.

Aether Fuels celebrated an important milestone on Tuesday, unveiling a new research-and-development center near Chicago O'Hare International Airport where it will look to scale-up SAF production. At the event, Madigan demonstrated for investors and other company stakeholders the company's electric tri-converter technology, which Madgian thinks has the potential to transform the sustainable fuels industry by accelerating large-scale deployment.

Aether Fuels plans to complete the construction of a demo plant later this year. After that, the company will look to continue to scale up in 2025.

What's next for Aether Fuels and why national policy will play a role

Madigan anticipates that by the end of the year, Aether Fuels will be announcing the location of its first commercial plant that will have the capacity produce more than 50 barrels per day.

The company's current pilot plant at GTI Energy's corporate campus in Des Plaines can produce 1.5 gallons per day — a fraction of a barrel, which in the U.S. oil industry is defined as 42 gallons. The demo plant at the same campus, which is slated to be operational this year, will push that to more than a barrel per day.

The location of Aether Fuels' next scaled-up manufacturing plant is still under consideration.

""Right now we're identifying candidate sites, talking to feedstock suppliers, off-takers [buyers] and strategic partners to assemble our top two, three [or] four options,"" he told Chicago Inno. ""By the end of the year, we will have selected and announced where that first commercial plant will be that we want to be in commercial operation by 2028.""

While Madigan is keeping his cards close to his chest right now on where the company might be looking, he did say Aether Fuels is considering sites both in the U.S. and internationally. Aether Fuels has offices in Chicago and Singapore.

""Our strategy definitely has a big focus here in the U.S., but we also have quite a focus in Southeast Asia,"" he said.

Incentives and other support offered, or a lack there of, will likely play a role in Aether Fuels' ultimate decision. Government support has helped Aether Fuels get to this point. The company's joint project with GTI Energy has been aided by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, including funding through the Bioenergy Technologies Office.

""It definitely accelerated that project by two years for us to be able to get it to that scale so right off the bat we were way ahead of the game than a peer company that may not have had access to that kind of funding,"" Madigan said.

Still, Madigan knows government grant funding is always ""inherently unpredictable,"" and the company is prepared to push forward with or without new grant opportunities. However, he worries that if grant programs designed to incentivize commercial-scale facilities freeze, it could create a disincentive for a period of time to build commercial plants in the U.S., because companies like Aether Fuels may be able to get more support elsewhere.

Other countries like the U.K. and Japan have stricter SAF milestone objectives moving forward, with Japan aiming for 10% SAF use by 2030 and the U.K. requiring 2% of jet fuel to be SAF in 2025, increasing to 22% in 2040.

""This is a product where the majority of the demand is actually outside of the U.S. right now,"" Madigan explained. ""So while we're not the major consumer, what we can be is the biggest producer. This is a high-value product that people are desperate to get their hands on.""",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12949004/dsc04476*1200xx6000-3381-0-46.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 17:56:26.283452

They tend to be offloaded for energy generation, mulch or animal bedding, manufactured into composite products, or, unfortunately, sent to landfills.

""Biomass energy facilities around the Upper Great Lakes that convert residuals into energy have been taken offline, and many pulp and paper mills have closed. That leaves wood residuals as a burden instead of a revenue source for the forest industry,” according to Brenda Haskill, manager of timber sales and wood utilization for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

Green Gold: Wood Residuals Summit 2025 May 6-8 in Traverse City, Michigan, will showcase new markets and opportunities that will increase the demand for wood chips, sawdust, or bark and related wood-based materials.

The Michigan Forest Biomaterials Institute is organizing the event in collaboration with the DNR and colleagues in Finland to leverage expertise from across the U.S. and other countries.

“This is a global challenge, and we all need to learn from each other. Commercial technologies exist; it’s time to bring them here to Michigan,” said Julie Manley, board Chair, MIFBI. ""We encourage all stakeholders in wood residuals to join the discussion this May in Traverse City, Michigan.""

Highlights include:

Biochar developments. Eden Lakes Inc. will introduce its applications benefiting both forests and water – two of Michigan’s abundant natural resources.

Lignin and cellulose require downstream partners to develop products for diverse markets including building and construction, apparel and textiles, and others. BASF and Dow will share their perspectives on expanding into new markets.

Sustainable aviation fuel and other biofuel projects are possible from Michigan’s woody biomass. Nathalie Ionesco, chief operating officer of Haffner Energy, Inc., and David Winsness, president of Comstock Fuels, will share how their operating models align with their interest in Michigan.

In-woods residuals are of particular interest to PJ Woodlands, which is developing wood-fiber plastic composite for the building sector; and Cambium, which is developing a range of products including furniture and mass timber, leveraging technology to manage the supply chain of fallen or salvaged wood.

Market development is important. Experts from Metsä Spring, VTT, Natural Resources Institute Finland, and others will share their experiences in product and market development.

Funding models will be explored to help support the range of needs to build more stable and higher value markets from wood residuals.

Christchurch, NZ and Brisbane, Australia, 26 March 2025 – Stralis Aircraft, Fabrum and Ara Ake are collaborating to advance hydrogen-powered aviation by designing, developing and testing liquid-hydrogen storage tanks and a fuel system for Stralis aircraft. The partnership aims to enable Australasia’s first liquid-hydrogen-powered flight – and support the transition toward zero-emission aviation.

Australian company Stralis Aircraft, which develops high-performance, low-operating-cost hydrogen-electric propulsion systems, will integrate Fabrum’s tanks and fuel system into its aircraft. New Zealand company Fabrum, which specialises in zero-emission transition technology, will provide lightweight composite tanks and dispensing systems, essential enablers for hydrogen-powered aircraft. The project is supported by Ara Ake, New Zealand’s future energy centre, and aligns with Fabrum’s recently announced hydrogen testing facility at Christchurch International Airport.

Christopher Boyle, Managing Director of Fabrum, said:

Our hydrogen liquefier provides readily available liquid hydrogen onsite, allowing the capability to access the critical fuel source to prove and test the tanks and fuel system we are developing for Stralis and their fixed-wing fuel-cell electric aircraft,

“With Ara Ake support, we are excited to be delivering our light-weight composite tanks and fuel system for Stralis to advance the future of hydrogen-powered flight.”

Cristiano Marantes, CEO of Ara Ake, said:

This project is a strong example of Ara Ake’s role in connecting leading organisations across countries to advance real-world clean energy solutions,

“By enabling this initiative, we’re supporting the first hydrogen-electric demonstration with liquid hydrogen and positioning New Zealand as a global testbed for sustainable aviation innovation.”

Stralis’ fuel-cell technology is significantly lighter than existing alternatives, potentially enabling aircraft to fly ten times further than battery-electric solutions at a lower cost than fossil-fuel-powered planes. The company is already testing its hydrogen-electric propulsion systems with a team that has deep expertise in electric-aircraft development.

Stuart Johnstone, co-founder and CTO of Stralis Aircraft, said:

This project is a significant step forward for Stralis as we test and refine our hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and build our liquid hydrogen capability,

“We look forward to advancing hydrogen-electric aviation and fostering new partnerships in New Zealand.”

Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis of water using renewable electricity. With an energy density three times higher than sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and over 100 times greater than batteries, hydrogen can offer a credible alternative for aviation[1].

The support from Ara Ake has enabled Stralis and Fabrum to accelerate the development of this technology, with the goal of achieving Australasia’s first liquid-hydrogen-powered flight. This collaboration represents not just a technical milestone, but a pivotal step toward making zero-emission aviation a commercial reality in Australasia and beyond.

The new body will function as a centralised platform to foster collaboration across governments, airlines, manufacturers, fuel providers, and other key stakeholders.

Tackling one of aviation’s biggest challenges

CADO aims to scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, advance zero-emission technologies, and establish global policy alignment to support the industry’s climate goals.

IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh said, “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF.”

“The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigour,”

The organisation’s mandate includes creating frameworks for financing green aviation projects, accelerating the certification of SAF and hydrogen technologies, and facilitating public-private partnerships to close the gap between ambition and action.

Why it matters now

The launch of CADO comes at a pivotal time for the aviation industry.

While passenger numbers are recovering post-pandemic, pressure is mounting from regulators, environmental groups, and travellers demanding more sustainable air travel.

Yet infrastructure gaps, supply limitations, and policy inconsistencies continue to slow momentum.

IATA hopes CADO will streamline international cooperation and drive policy incentives to accelerate decarbonisation efforts—particularly in developing economies and high-growth markets.

A regional opportunity for the Middle East

For the Middle East—a region home to some of the world’s fastest-growing airlines and aviation hubs—CADO presents a chance to shape the global conversation on green aviation.

With carriers like Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Saudia investing in next-generation fleets and exploring SAF partnerships, the region is poised to play a leading role in the transition.

By decoupling the physical flow of SAF from its environmental benefits, the ""Book and Claim"" system addresses these challenges, enabling broader participation in SAF usage.","Airbus has launched a groundbreaking initiative to bolster the global adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by piloting a “Book and Claim” system. This innovative approach seeks to bridge the gap between SAF production and consumption, offering a flexible and scalable solution to overcome logistical and economic barriers hindering widespread SAF usage.

Airbus, acting as a facilitator, will purchase SAF certificates and manage the sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a globally recognized certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, including aircraft and helicopter operators, fostering a robust demand for SAF in the short term.

The “Book and Claim” system allows aviation stakeholders to purchase SAF certificates, effectively claiming the associated emission reduction benefits, even if the physical SAF is utilized at a different location. This decoupling of physical fuel flow from emissions reduction claims is crucial for enabling smaller operators and those located far from SAF supply points to participate in decarbonization efforts.

The company has already garnered significant industry support, with SMBC Aviation Capital signing the first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Subsequently, AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup have also expressed their commitment to joining this collaborative initiative, signaling a strong industry-wide desire to accelerate SAF adoption.

The pilot program, scheduled throughout 2025, aims to provide vital insights into the functionality and scalability of the “Book and Claim” mechanism. It will assess the market's appetite for third-party facilitated SAF solutions and evaluate the robustness of the system in managing sustainability attributes.

Julien Manhes, Airbus head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, emphasized the significance of this initiative, stating, “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”

The challenges associated with SAF adoption are multifaceted, including limited production capacity, high costs, and logistical complexities related to distribution. By decoupling the physical flow of SAF from its environmental benefits, the ""Book and Claim"" system addresses these challenges, enabling broader participation in SAF usage.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-26 14:56:43.603411

With this move, Vibra becomes the first company to supply sustainable aviation fuel in the country.
Initially, the fuel will be blended at a 10% SAF to 90% conventional jet fuel ratio.
Higher blend percentages, up to the internationally permitted limit of 50%, may be introduced in the future.
The fuel is a key component of the aviation sector’s goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.","Fuel distributor Vibra announced on Tuesday (25) that it has begun offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Brazil. The imported biofuel is now available at its facility at the Tom Jobim International Airport (GIG) in Rio de Janeiro.

With this move, Vibra becomes the first company to supply sustainable aviation fuel in the country.

SAF is a central component of the aviation sector’s strategy to reduce CO₂ emissions. Brazil is seen as a potential global player in SAF production given its expertise in ethanol. However, the country has yet to produce the fuel domestically.

The Galeão terminal facility recently obtained International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), ensuring sustainability tracking across the entire supply chain—from raw materials to bio-refinery production and final distribution at the airport via BR Aviation, Vibra’s aircraft fueling business unit.

Produced from renewable sources, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

First shipment from Belgium

In January, 23 iso-tank containers carrying approximately 550,000 liters of SAF departed from the Port of Antwerp in Belgium bound for Rio de Janeiro.

The SAF supplied by Vibra is derived from used cooking oil (UCO), one of the lowest-carbon-intensity feedstocks since it is a waste product.

Initially, the fuel will be blended at a 10% SAF to 90% conventional jet fuel ratio. Higher blend percentages, up to the internationally permitted limit of 50%, may be introduced in the future.

“We are ready to expand SAF availability in the Brazilian market, leveraging our infrastructure in over 90 airports and our expertise in delivering safe and competitive solutions,” said Marcelo Bragança, Vibra’s chief operating officer, in a statement.

Industry targets net-zero by 2050

According to projections from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global SAF production reached approximately 1.9 billion liters in 2024—three times the volume produced in 2023.

The fuel is a key component of the aviation sector’s goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, in 2024, SAF accounted for just 0.53% of the industry’s total fuel demand, highlighting the sector’s challenge in attracting investment and public policies to boost production.

Beyond limited availability, SAF remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Depending on the region, its price can be more than five times higher. Vibra has not disclosed details about SAF pricing in Brazil.

Fuel costs currently represent about 30% of an airline’s operating expenses worldwide, rising to 40% in Brazil.

As America races toward a greener future, the demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has never been higher. Minnesota is seizing the opportunity to break into this emerging industry before the competition, leveraging its agricultural strength to kickstart a hub that could establish the state as a pioneer in SAF production.

The Minnesota SAF Hub, a coalition comprising the Greater MSP Partnership, Bank of America, Delta Air Lines, Ecolab, Xcel Energy and other stakeholders, is on a journey to develop a fully integrated SAF supply chain in Minnesota.

A “Demand Consortium” including Bank of America, Deloitte, Delta and Ecolab will purchase the first several million gallons of SAF each year, starting during the second half of 2025. Each participating company is providing funding to scale production, drive down costs, increase continued demand and reduce carbon emissions associated with their employee business travel.

“While Delta has committed to purchasing millions of gallons of SAF, there isn’t enough being produced today to fuel the world’s commercial airlines for a single week,” said Peter Carter, Delta’s executive vice president of external affairs, in September. “That’s why this blending facility is so important — it’s like hanging an ‘Open for Business’ sign to SAF producers to consider doing business in Minnesota, where we see SAF as a great opportunity for all players across the value chain.”

Plant-Powered Progress

Minnesota SAF Hub partners at the University of Minnesota Forever Green Initiative are also developing a novel crop called winter camelina seed, which can be used for various purposes, including producing oil for conversion into SAF. It has one of the lowest carbon intensity scores among the many feedstocks used for producing SAF today. Corn, soybeans, canola, continuous living cover crops, agricultural biomass, woody biomass, hydrogen, waste oils and fats are also used to produce SAF, all of which are available in Minnesota.

Cargill, an American multinational food corporation based in Minnetonka, is collaborating with the university on this project, expanding its active role in growing the Midwest’s supply of this versatile crop.

In 2023, Cargill worked with Minnesotan and North Dakotan farmers to plant 2,000 acres of winter camelina. In September 2024, the first 7,000-gallon shipment of blended SAF made from these crops arrived at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport fueling facility.

“This initial SAF delivery is another example of how we are making SAF real in Minnesota and showing the world how to do it right,” said Peter Frosch, president and CEO of the GREATER MSP Partnership. “We are highlighting the first SAF flight from MSP International as another major milestone in our push to build a SAF economy anchored in Minnesota. This ambitious effort is moving fast and gaining momentum due to the bold leadership of Minnesota SAF Hub partner organizations. The Minnesota SAF Hub is on track to create thousands of good jobs for Minnesotans by delivering a climate solution the nation and world urgently need.”

In January, through its Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the University of Minnesota $10 million for the Oilseed Crops to Sustain the Environment and Meet Energy Demand (OILSEED) project led by Mitchell Hunter, PhD, co-director of the university’s Forever Green Initiative. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture, U of M, Cargill and North Dakota State University are providing a combined $2.5 million in additional funds.

“Winter oilseed crops like camelina and pennycress have the potential to be adopted on millions of acres in our region in the coming years and decades,” Hunter said, citing a recent report that found widespread adoption of camelina, pennycress and other crops that provide over-winter cover could reduce nitrogen loss from farmland by 23% and soil erosion by 35%. “The winter oilseeds can preserve topsoil, protect water quality, feed pollinators and, by producing low-carbon fuel, help fight climate change, all while giving farmers a new source of income.”

Sustainable Growth

While building a strong network from within is essential, the true test of a hub’s potential comes when a newcomer decides to join the club. Through initiatives such as the SAF Tax Credit, the coalition is actively working to bring producers of all sizes and varying feedstocks to the state. DG Fuels’ decision to locate a manufacturing facility in Moorhead, expected to generate $50 billion in economic impact, marked a major milestone for the Minnesota SAF Hub, cementing the state’s reputation as a rising leader in the industry.

Attracting a project of this magnitude will make significant headway in addressing the demand for SAF at MSP International Airport, which currently outstrips supply. DG Fuels expects this new facility to produce 193 million gallons of low CO2 lifecycle emission SAF each year, representing nearly half of the fuel used at the airport.

As of November, the Minnesota SAF Hub was working with DG Fuels and the City of Moorhead on the next set of requirements to advance this project, including aggregating feedstocks. DG Fuels’ manufacturing process uses cellulosic biomass in the form of lower-value agricultural by-products such as corn stover and timber waste as its feedstock. It also incorporates various forms of clean hydrogen feedstock to produce near-zero carbon fuel.

Accessible labor and logistics helped the company choose Moorhead, DF Fuels Chairman and CEO Michael Darcy told Site Selection’s Ron Starner in January. “We can rail aviation fuel to refineries in Minnesota to feed our customers at the airport. That is a barrier in the rest of the country. Minnesota helped us with the logistics.” The state also helped with attitude: “Having a proactive state is always a good thing for a project,” Darcy said. “Minnesota on its own worked out a deal to have SAF refined there. We wish more states did that.”

Located within the Red River Valley, Moorhead and its neighboring communities in Clay County are surrounded by some of the nation’s most fertile land, bolstering a thriving agricultural sector that provides a strong foundation for SAF production. In addition to this wealth of natural resources, Moorhead boasts Minnesota’s largest shovel-ready industrial park, the MCCARA Industrial Park, adding to the area’s attractiveness and growing business climate.

On Tuesday (March 25), we were excited to deliver the first of 99 F404-IN20 engines to our valued customer Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft Mk 1A fight jet. It is an important milestone in our 40-year relationship with HAL and in our efforts to ensure a strong future for India’s military by developing next-generation fighters while enhancing the country’s defense manufacturing capabilities.

GE Aerospace has a strong history of military jet propulsion collaboration in India. After collaborating with the Aeronautical Development Agency in the 1980s, GE Aerospace’s F404-IN20 engine was selected for the single-engine Tejas in 2004. This was an important breakthrough for both India and GE Aerospace.

Our F404 engine family, one of the most successful in military aviation history, powers thousands of combat aircraft worldwide. The F404-IN20 engine is a tailored design for India’s single-engine fighter with the highest thrust within F404 family and a higher-flow fan, unique single-crystal turbine blades, and numerous special components. GE Aerospace and Tejas teams collaborated closely for several years to customize it for the needs of Indian Air Force. The F404 demonstrated it was an excellent fit for the Tejas LCA. On its first test flight in 2008, the aircraft climbed to numerous mission altitudes and achieved Mach 1.1 speed.

By 2016, GE Aerospace fulfilled its commitment to HAL and delivered 65 F404-IN20 engines for the Tejas LCA. With no additional engine orders on the horizon, the production line for F404-IN20 was shut down. However, when HAL ordered an additional 99 engines in 2021 for the Tejas Mk1A LCA, our team began the complex task of restarting the F404-IN20 production line, which had been dormant for five years, and re-engaging the engine’s global supply chain.

Restarting a jet engine production line is a challenging process. Restarting the F404-IN20 engine line during the COVID pandemic was even more challenging. With a high focus on safety and quality, and a remarkable commitment from our supply chain teams and our suppliers and partners, we have managed to restart the line. Our proprietary lean operating model, FLIGHT DECK, helped us alleviate bottlenecks and identify solutions to improve manufacturing processes and turnaround time. Today, we are working closely with our suppliers to ramp up production on parts and materials for the F404-IN20.

We will continue to work together with our suppliers to keep the production line efficient, maintain the highest standards of safety and quality, and deliver to our customer. This week’s first engine delivery is a testament to what we have accomplished with HAL over the past 40 years, and a symbol of our combined potential to ensure a strong future for India’s military.",https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/default/files/aerospace-1200x650-1.jpeg,N,,2025-03-26 12:57:23.323411

The first MoU was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup, who confirmed their interest in joining this collaborative initiative, reinforcing the industry-wide intention to increase SAF adoption.

The book and claim approach allow a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism. It will also assess market interest in third-party facilitation of such integrated SAF solutions.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, said, “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”",https://www.traveltrendstoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/favicon.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 12:57:33.250683

This electric Tri-Converter demonstration has a capacity that is more than 50 times larger than the previously demonstrated pilot plant. The results represent a breakthrough for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The electric Tri-Converter converts waste carbon feedstocks into the syngas that supplies the downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) unit in the Aether Aurora process. The purpose of the demo was to prove that the electric Tri-Converter can continuously produce syngas at an increasingly larger scale using a mix of real-world feedstocks, including biogenic CO2, renewable natural gas (RNG), and clean hydrogen. The program is part of Aether’s program to build and operate a fully integrated demonstration plant (the “Demo Plant”) producing more than one barrel per day of sustainable fuels. Aether plans to complete the construction of the Demo Plant later this year.

The demonstrator is a joint project between Aether and GTI Energy. Aether Aurora integrates technology elements first developed by GTI Energy in a gas-to-liquids program, which is supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Aether has licensed the relevant technologies from GTI Energy and leverages the laboratory and demonstration spaces at its Chicago-area campus. Aether has subsequently taken over responsibility for future Aether Aurora development and commercialization, including expanding its R&D team.

The results of the demonstrator validate that the electric Tri-Converter is ready for integration into the Demo Plant. More critically, they demonstrate the solution’s capability to use a wide range of abundant feedstocks to create sustainable fuels—a breakthrough that can potentially shatter a key barrier to scaling production.

This milestone was celebrated yesterday at the Aether and GTI Energy demonstrator site where Aether investors and feedstock executives joined federal, state and local officials to view the technology, meet the team, tour Aether’s R&D center and GTI Energy lab spaces, and learn how the innovations will accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels. State Senator Laura Murphy (IL-28th) was on hand to deliver opening remarks.

The Syngas Generation Engine for Next-Gen Sustainable Fuels

Aether Aurora optimizes the well-established FT process to create drop-in liquid hydrocarbons leveraging its novel electric Tri-Converter and Upgrading technologies. As the solution’s “syngas generation engine”, the electric Tri-Converter improves and streamlines the process where feedstocks and the internally recycled downstream byproducts are converted into syngas. This is achieved via novel catalysts and a reactor that uses electricity instead of combustion to generate the reaction heat. Where typical syngas production requires multiple reactors to convert the same mix of inputs, Aether Aurora employs just one. The streamlined equipment configuration reduces CAPEX while the electrification innovations generate higher energy efficiency and yields than a conventional combustion reactor.

Aether’s demonstrator is supported by suppliers that include bp for RNG, Invenergy for clean hydrogen production, and Certarus Ltd for low carbon energy supply and logistics.

State Senator Murphy remarked: “The road to the future is paved in sustainable practices, and GTI Energy and Aether Fuels are at the forefront of this future. They are leading the way in developing energy solutions that will transform how we power industries, transportation and everyday life. Their innovation not only drives us forward, it drives economic growth that supports every hardworking Illinoisan.”

Aether CEO, Conor Madigan, said: “This is an exciting milestone for Aether and a tribute to our R&D experts and our partners at GTI Energy. The aviation and ocean shipping industries need affordable sustainable fuels at scale and the electric Tri-Converter technology is a transformative step forward. It drives critical process simplification and enables cost-efficient feedstock flexibility. When integrated into our Aether Aurora solution we’re making SAF production more scalable and cost effective.”

GTI Energy’s VP of Carbon Management and Conversion, Don Stevenson, said: “GTI Energy has a long history of pioneering advanced energy solutions, and we’re proud to see technologies incubated in our labs being integrated into solutions for scaling low-emission fuels. Through collaboration with DOE and companies like Aether Fuels, GTI Energy helps unlock the potential of waste carbon streams while creating economically viable fuels solutions for industries.”

Elie Fayad, Aether’s Senior Director of R&D, noted: ""Today’s milestone represents nearly a decade of dedicated innovation and significant R&D investment by GTI Energy and Aether Fuels. The electric Tri-Converter is one of the breakthroughs in our Aether Aurora solution that drastically improves SAF economics and brings large-scale deployment within reach.”

Synthetic aviation fuels (also known as e-kerosene) are not yet available on the market but production is projected to ramp up rapidly by 2040.
But its high production costs mean SAFs are not cost competitive with fossil kerosene, hindering its market uptake.

Major challenges include reducing the price gap and scaling SAF production in the EU and globally.","A net-zero aviation future requires large quantities of SAF

Global aviation accounts for around 2.5% of CO2 emissions.4 Strong growth in aviation demand is outpacing aircraft fuel efficiency, causing emissions to rise relentlessly.5

To reduce aviation-related emissions, SAFs offer a practical solution. Chemically similar to fossil kerosene,6 these drop-in fuels can be used in high proportions in existing aircraft, can be produced globally, and transported to demand centers using existing infrastructure. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the leading global industry body representing all actors across the aviation value chain, estimates that SAFs could drive 65% of the emission reduction needed to achieve the body’s net-zero emission goal by mid-century.7 The remaining emission reductions will be met by new aircraft technologies, continued improvement in air-traffic management and aircraft operations, and carbon capture and offsetting.8

Creating a net-zero aviation industry thus requires large-scale production and use of SAFs. Deloitte estimates that in a net-zero scenario, total production volumes of SAFs will need to reach 37 million tons by 2030 and 297 million tons by 2050. In the long-term, these volumes will consist of nearly equal shares of biofuel and synthetic fuel, the two main SAF categories (Figure 1).

Aviation biofuels are projected to scale rapidly. They are primarily produced from oils and fats using the so called HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) production pathway, which has long been in use, particularly for biodiesel production. Biofuels can also be produced from other renewable feedstocks, but various sectors compete for their deployment and feedstock is limited, throwing up a barrier to scale production.

Synthetic aviation fuels (also known as e-kerosene) are not yet available on the market but production is projected to ramp up rapidly by 2040. These fuels are produced from clean hydrogen and sustainably sourced carbon dioxide (CO2) (see box 1), and offer greater scalability than biofuels, since CO2 is more abundant than biogenic feedstocks.2

The EU sets ambitious quotas to enable scaling of the SAF market

SAFs represent a crucial decarbonization solution for the EU aviation industry to reach the Union’s goal of a 90% reduction of transport-related emissions by mid-century. But its high production costs mean SAFs are not cost competitive with fossil kerosene, hindering its market uptake. To move SAFs beyond their nascent market stage, the EU is stepping in with ambitious fuel quotas under the ReFuelEU aviation regulation (Figure 2). Starting January 1, 2025, aircraft fuel suppliers must comply with these quotas.

With fuel quotas set to reach 70% by 2050, the EU is taking the global lead in regulatory measures for establishing the SAF market. At the global level, key stakeholders recognize the importance of SAFs in reaching climate targets, and SAF mandates are already being planned and implemented in several countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Canada, Türkiye, and Indonesia.12 However, only the United Kingdom has introduced a fuel mandate that approaches the level of ambition of ReFuelEU aviation. On January 1, 2025, it implemented a mandatory SAF share that will rise to 16% by 2035, but only to 24% by 2050.13

A major barrier to market introduction is the high production cost of SAFs

The SAF mandate aims to accelerate the adoption of alternative fuels by ensuring a steady demand path within the EU, but high production costs remain a challenge for their uptake. In 2023, the average market price of HEFA SAF in the EU was EUR 2,768 per ton – 340% higher than the price of fossil kerosene.2 Based on these prices, the quota now in place is estimated to lead to a 5% increase in fuel cost.

While HEFA SAF will play a key role in meeting the quota in the coming years, synthetic fuels must be in use by 2030. A review of cost estimates in the literature shows that production costs are expected to decrease over time as production scales and technologies further mature. However, the cost of SAFs produced with CO2 from direct air capture (DAC) will still be 30% to 280% higher by 2050 compared with the price of conventional jet fuel in 2023 (Figure 3).14 SAFs produced with DAC are more expensive than those produced with CO2 from point sources such as industrial facilities. However, as decarbonization progresses, this CO2 source will become increasingly scarce.2

The main cost drivers of synthetic fuels are stringent energy requirements that lead to significant operating costs, followed by high capital expenditure. Financing costs further contribute to overall expense. Deloitte estimates that the cost of capital for solar power projects, such as those providing the renewable electricity needed to produce synthetic fuels, varies from 7% in Western Europe to about 18% in Sub-Saharan Africa.15 A key strategy for reducing the cost of the debt and equity and improving SAF bankability is to mitigate risk, including political, regulatory, technical, market, and financial risks.

Building a competitive and sustainable aviation industry in the EU

The mandatory fuel quota in place since January 1, 2025, has the EU aviation industry embarking on an ambitious journey towards a climate-neutral yet competitive future. Major challenges include reducing the price gap and scaling SAF production in the EU and globally.

Several instruments can help reduce costs and improve the bankability of SAF projects, one of which is offtake contracts. These are long-term purchase agreements (typically up to 20 years) with SAF producers that ensure stable revenue streams. Such contracts help mitigate price fluctuation and demand uncertainty, making it easier for producers to secure funding and scale production. For instance, the largest contract in 2024, measured in SAF volume,16 secures IAG’s European airlines a long-term supply of e-kerosene produced by Twelve in the US.17

Meanwhile, none of the planned European production of e-kerosene has yet passed final investment decision.18 The EU’s Clean Industrial Deal promises a window of opportunity, and the European Commission has announced a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan prioritizing short- and medium-term support for sustainable aviation fuels.3 Specific instruments to reduce the price gap for domestically produced synthetic fuels have been announced for the longer term.19

The journey to widespread SAF adoption is challenging, and strategic policy measures, innovative financing solutions, and long-term investment will play a crucial role in preparing sustainable aviation for take-off.

The announcement, made at the company’s 2025 Airbus Summit, comes shortly after Airbus revealed that it had delayed its plans to develop a hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035 due to slower than anticipated development of the hydrogen ecosystem and technologies.

Bruno Fichefeux, Airbus Head of Future Programmes, said:

“Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonise aviation. While we’ve adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionise air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.”

The aviation industry accounts for approximately 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with that figure potentially rising dramatically over the coming decades if no action is taken. Several initiatives are being pursued in order to address the climate impact of the industry, typically involving efforts to improve aircraft efficiency, develop sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), or create aircraft utilizing low or zero carbon propulsion systems such as electric or hydrogen-based.

While many initiatives are currently targeting areas allowing for more rapid sector decarbonization, such as electrified propulsion or SAF, hydrogen is viewed by some in the industry as a more promising long-term solution, given its potential to be produced through carbon-free methods, and its energy attributes, containing significantly more energy per weight than jet fuel.

Airbus had previously announced a goal to develop the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035, stating that it had identified hydrogen as one of the most promising zero-emissions solutions, as it emits no carbon dioxide when generated from renewable energy, with water being its most significant by-products.

The company launched its ZEROe program in 2020, exploring the feasibility of hydrogen propulsion technologies, based on either hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. While not ruling out future investments into hydrogen combustion, Airbus said that it has selected hydrogen fuel cell technology as the propulsion method for its future aircraft, following the results of the fuel cell prototype and powertrain testing, as well as research into complementary technology such as cryogenics, which supported the viability of the technology.

The new aircraft will feature an electric propeller propulsion system powered by hydrogen fuel cells that convert hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy through a chemical reaction, producing only water as a byproduct. The aircraft will be powered by four, 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system, and supplied by liquid hydrogen tanks.

Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project, said:

“Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept. We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology. In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Airbus-Hydrogen.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 10:56:29.949875

This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for sustainable aviation fuel worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

The first MoU was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup, who confirmed their interest in joining this collaborative initiative, reinforcing the industry-wide intention to increase the adoption of alternative fuels.

Book and Claim approaches for adopting SAF use

In simple terms, the Book and Claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of sustainable aviation fuel and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere.

Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and who are far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body.

These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, therefore stimulating the short-term demand for SAF.

Scaling up the market for alternative fuels

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative Book and Claim mechanism. It will also assess market interest in the third-party facilitation of these integrated SAF solutions.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, said: “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market.

“For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to sustainable aviation fuel can be challenging, depending on the amount needed.

“Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and de-risk the process for operators and SAF suppliers by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them.

“This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate that Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”

Further Airbus initiatives to achieve net zero

Airbus aligns with global and binding decarbonisation programmes, in addition to other market-based measures, to help cap the aviation industry’s CO2 emissions.

This supports and contributes to the industry-wide ambition to implement global market-based measures for the aviation industry.

The aviation industry, including Airbus, has committed to an industry-wide decarbonisation movement that includes the following key targets:",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shutterstock_2563538061-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 09:56:09.046433

The results will support future fuel specifications and policy recommendations to minimise the environmental footprint of aviation.

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) to study the aviation sector's non-CO2 emissions with a focus on contrails.

Recent studies suggest that the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) could reduce both soot particles and contrail ice crystals. However, additional information on fuel composition and its processing in the engine is necessary to better understand the effects and benefits of SAFs.

The project will test a range of fuels under controlled conditions, with consistency in combustion parameters and hardware. Lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center will extend to full-aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse in France.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions.

It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions.

Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques.

Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

In related news, Airbus is seeking to scale up SAF adoption with a new 'Book and Claim' approach. This allows a buyer to 'book' a certain amount of SAF and 'claim' the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere.

The fantasy that the renowned author Jules Verne envisioned in his novel, The Mysterious Island, is close to becoming reality thanks to low-emission hydrogen, and particularly green hydrogen. This fuel created through the electrolysis of water (decomposition of the H2O molecule into hydrogen and oxygen) using renewable energy sources could hold the key to the decarbonization of some sectors in which direct electrification is still very complicated, such as heavy transport or certain industrial processes.

Some of the biggest benefits of green hydrogen include its versatility, its low level of harmful emissions, and minimal waste. “Green hydrogen is a replacement for gray hydrogen (produced using natural gas and other polluting hydrocarbons) and greatly diminishes emissions compared to other options. Its use is crucial to the decarbonization of the steel sector, and other sectors that use natural gas or coal, such as the aluminum or cement industries. It also holds the key to the decarbonization of the shipping and steel sectors through the production of green methanol, or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” explained the engineer Gotzon Gómez Sarasola, Head of Spain and Portugal for the Stegra Project. This Swedish startup is dedicated to the decarbonization of the economy, and has become one of the leading companies in the production of green hydrogen in Europe.

According to estimates in the European Union report Hydrogen Roadmap Europe: A sustainable pathway for the European Energy Transition, clean hydrogen could prevent 560 million tons of CO2 annually in Europe by 2050. The EU believes that it has the potential to generate around 2,250 TWh of hydrogen across all sectors, or one-fourth of Europe’s total energy demand. This energy could power approximately 42 million large cars, 1.7 million trucks, or more than 5,500 trains. It would also heat the equivalent of 52 million homes and cover up to 10% of energy demand for buildings. Furthermore, combining captured carbon or biomass with 120 TWh of hydrogen could produce synthetic feedstock for 40 million tons of chemical products by 2050.

This is one of the reasons that Brussels is one of the biggest defenders of this technology. The EU set a goal of producing 10 million tons by the end of this decade.

Challenges remain

However, several challenges must be overcome before it can be established as a real alternative to fossil fuels. At the moment, the high cost of this gas compared to the fuels it seeks to replace is one of the biggest obstacles. Gómez Sarasola stresses that financing for projects of this kind is conditioned by the high value of the so-called ‘green premium’, or the higher price consumers are willing to pay for a sustainable, but more expensive alternative compared to a cheaper, more polluting one. “Many green hydrogen production projects do not get off the ground due to a lack of buyers willing to assume this ‘green premium’ over gray hydrogen,” he warned.

Gómez Sarasola (Stegra): “Green hydrogen holds the key to the decarbonization of the shipping and steel sectors”

Rafael Cossent, a researcher at the Institute of Technological Research (IIT) of the ICAI School of Engineering at Comillas Pontifical University, is one of Spain’s leading experts in hydrogen. He currently co-directs the Chair of Hydrogen Studies at ICAI-ICADE, a prestigious educational institution linked to the University. The expert explains that the investments related to green hydrogen are high because they often entail also making adjustments to the equipment so they can use this fuel. “New engines, furnaces, and burners for industry are needed… It means developing supply structures and creating new facilities.”

Reducing investment costs is a priority, but the same applies to operating costs, this expert noted. “Cheaper electricity is needed, as well as reducing consumption per kilogram generated, improving the efficiency of electrolysis and enhancing plant design to optimize processes.”

Another issue that must be addressed is how to get this fuel to consumers. “Transportation in trucks is already a reality for small volumes and short distances, but establishing a large-scale open hydrogen network has to deal with uncertainty surrounding the development of sufficient demand”, Cossent argued.

Franz Bechtold (Lhyfe): “The massive adoption of renewable energy and government aid will both be key elements”

Franz Bechtold of Lhyfe, a pioneering business group that opened the world’s first green hydrogen production plant directly connected to a wind farm in 2021, pointed to other factors that are hindering the change. “The lack of infrastructure is blocking many projects and raising the final production cost of others.” The same goes for the absence of “clear administrative guidelines regarding what will occur in the future in terms of both emission taxes and other medium-term aid,” he warned.

Momentum in Europe

Despite these obstacles, the potential of this technology to decarbonize heavy industry means that green hydrogen projects are on the rise. Lhyfe, which is present in 11 European countries, is also developing projects in the Iberian Peninsula, such as the Vallmoll plant (Tarragona), and intends to weave a renewable hydrogen network throughout the country. Besides, Gómez Sarasola from Stegra confirms the potential of the Iberian Peninsula for the deployment of this technology: “Spain and Portugal are the only countries, apart from northern Scandinavia, that have the capacity to produce renewable electricity in large volumes and at a competitive price. The electricity grids of the two countries are expected to have 80-85% renewable energy by 2030,” he argues.

The European Hydrogen Bank —an initiative created by the European Union with the aim of promoting the renewable hydrogen market through subsidies for companies to cover the cost difference between renewable hydrogen and fossil fuels— recently completed a pilot auction for €720 million, benefiting seven projects: three in Spain, two in Portugal and the remaining two in Norway and France.

For Betchtold, “the massive adoption of renewable energy and government aid will both be key elements in order to make hydrogen one of the most viable solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Another factor that could accelerate this time frame, Gómez Sarasola added, is “reinforcing grid interconnections between generation plants and consumption projects.”",https://www.bbva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bbva-sostenibilidad-ethic-hidrogeno-verde-1024x575.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 11:56:28.414819

It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions.
Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.
“The PACIFIC project will quantify and measure the non-CO2 emissions emitted from various SAF compositions.","Studies have found that Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) could reduce soot particles and contrail ice crystals, but additional information on fuel composition and its processing in the engine is necessary to better understand the effects and benefits of SAF.

Along with a consortium of 10 European partners, PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) aims to bridge the gap in understanding aviation's non-CO2 emissions by testing a range of fuels under controlled conditions.

The project is expected to ensure consistency in combustion parameters and hardware similarity from lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to full aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions. It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions.

Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques.

Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

Airbus said the project ‘will ultimately help define new fuel specifications aimed at reducing aviation’s climate and air quality impact while reinforcing Europe’s leadership in sustainable aeronautics.’

In a statement, Airbus CTO Sabine Klauke said: ""Addressing aviation's non-CO2 emissions is critical in our journey toward truly sustainable flight. Through collaborative science-based approaches and innovative technologies, we're committed to minimising these effects while maintaining operational efficiency.

“The PACIFIC project will quantify and measure the non-CO2 emissions emitted from various SAF compositions. Using an innovative ground experiment process, we will be able to replicate conditions without delay and repeat them if needed. We look forward to the results of this multi-year project.""",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/qcbltotg/contrail_adobestock_255646030.jpg?width=1002&height=564&v=1db9e3d8b6a8850,N,,2025-03-26 08:56:38.731940

I have witnessed executives coming from completely different industries who haven’t focused enough on the company culture and business complexity.","Back in 2006, Neste made a big decision. After 75 years in oil and gas, the company opted to make the transition to renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, a move that would position it globally as a future leader in the renewable fuel sector.

The shift to renewables wasn’t simply about Neste adopting new technologies or entering new markets. This was a comprehensive strategic shift that required the organization to fundamentally rethink its structure, its culture, and its talent pipeline.

Big questions arose, among them: what capabilities were they going to need to make this transition successfully? How would culture and talent management have to evolve? And did they have the right people in situ to successfully execute the new strategy?

As Executive Vice President of HR, Hannele Jakosuo-Jansson knew she would have a critical role to play in aligning the company’s policies, leadership development, and talent strategy with its new direction.

From the outset, hers was an approach grounded in open communication and unwavering integrity, together with the ability to accurately assess leadership quality and capabilities, while simultaneously managing sensitive interactions and discussions.

Key enablers of transformation: culture and people

When a company undergoes a major transformation or shift in its strategy, it is crucial to bring organizational culture and key people-related issues into close alignment with the evolving strategy. As Jakosuo-Jansson puts it: “Culture and people are the key enablers of transformation.”

The board of directors plays a critical role in this process.

While boards must avoid getting into management’s operational responsibility, they instead have a very important role in promoting a strong and resilient culture, and in facilitating leadership development that maps to the organization’s strategic needs, says Jakosuo-Jansson.

“Boards must define a set of clearly articulated profiles in terms of future leadership, effectively translating the organization’s broader strategy into its new leadership requirements. And this involves regularly reviewing and updating succession plans to reflect evolving business priorities.”

Boards must also oversee talent across the entirety of the organization – and with a broader scope and longer time horizon than management. And this means engaging in detailed discussions around workforce planning, recruitment, and leadership development.

“While boards do not manage talent directly, they must nonetheless ensure that the right systems and processes are put in place to develop and retain the organization’s future leaders,” she adds, “And they must make sure that sufficient time and energy are given to these efforts.”

CEO succession planning and the importance of cultural fit

CEO succession planning is critical, and it must be an integral element of risk management. Jakosuo-Jansson’s advice? Start as early as possible.

“Planning should begin as soon as a new CEO takes office. It should be part of regular board discussions and not treated as a sensitive topic to be discussed behind closed doors. Open dialogue with the current CEO fosters trust and ensures alignment on leadership needs.”

In times of transformation, leadership pipelines need to have great flexibility.

A dramatic change may require external insights or leadership with new capabilities, prompting boards to look beyond internal succession plans. Sometimes, hiring an external candidate with fresh perspectives is essential for success in a new direction. But it’s critical not to underestimate cultural fit here, says Jakosuo-Jansson.

“Even if the ideal CEO candidate exists, you must also look at their character. I have witnessed executives coming from completely different industries who haven’t focused enough on the company culture and business complexity. That’s why we should not underestimate the importance of cultural fit.”

Ultimately, success lies in being able to identify leaders who have both strategic vision and execution capabilities, but who are also capable of developing a strong performance and organizational culture.",https://www.imd.org/ibyimd/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/People-Culture-and-Strategy-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 07:56:39.330891

Electric propulsion

The company showcased a notional concept of a hydrogen aircraft powered by four 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. Two liquid hydrogen tanks would support the system. Further testing will refine the concept, focusing on hydrogen storage, distribution, and propulsion systems.

“Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts before selecting this fully electric concept,” said Glenn Llewellyn, head of the ZEROe project. “We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology. In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.”

In 2023, Airbus demonstrated a 1.2-megawatt hydrogen propulsion system, followed by end-to-end testing in 2024 of an integrated fuel cell stack, electric motors, gearboxes, inverters, and heat exchangers.

The project was carried out at RPD Technologies’ facilities in Crosby, Texas, from August to December of last year.
Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies, highlighted the broader implications of the pilot: “This project’s impact goes far beyond technical validation.
A key advantage of Flexiforming is that it enables SAF to be fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM certification is achieved.
This process is critical for verifying the fuel’s safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its suitability for commercial aviation.","To support the goals of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and enhance feedstock availability, Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel) has successfully completed a five-month pilot project. The initiative showcased the effectiveness of the company’s Flexiforming technology, demonstrating its ability to produce SAF chemically similar to conventional jet fuel from a variety of renewable feedstocks. The project was carried out at RPD Technologies’ facilities in Crosby, Texas, from August to December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, indicating that the technology is ready for scaling. The project specifically focused on converting methanol and ethanol into SAF, as well as ethanol mixed with paraffinic renewable naphtha produced through Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) into SAF. The SAF samples produced by Unifuel’s Flexiforming technology have undergone extensive testing and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening, the first step in the SAF certification process.

Joshua Heyne, Director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab at Washington State University, emphasized the importance of advancing SAF technologies: “As an industry, we must continue to explore new technologies that enhance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel. The ability to produce aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single platform not only streamlines SAF production but also lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible to producers and airlines.”

The pilot resulted in two distinct types of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential component for blending paraffinic SAF with fossil kerosene, and a fully synthetic, 100% drop-in SAF with the necessary aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International. This aromatic component, derived from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) naphtha, can be combined with the primary paraffinic SAF stream, creating an opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units. This simplifies logistics, reduces costs, and aids in broader industry adoption.

Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies, highlighted the broader implications of the pilot: “This project’s impact goes far beyond technical validation. A key advantage of Flexiforming is that it enables SAF to be fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM certification is achieved. Because of its aromatic properties, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT processes and sold directly to airlines, without the need for additional blending. As the aviation sector faces growing pressure to reduce its environmental footprint and manage costs, innovations like Flexiforming could play a crucial role in scaling up SAF production to meet demand.”

Flexiforming offers flexibility in SAF production, with the pilot validating several production routes, including ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ). The technology’s lower energy and hydrogen requirements mean that Unifuel estimates Flexiforming costs to be about half of current ETJ processes. Additionally, it enables renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, which can be blended into fully synthetic, drop-in-ready jet fuel.

Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor at the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, noted, “The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise for full certification as aviation turbine fuel.”

After more than a decade of research and testing, Unifuel is now preparing samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the pilot project for submission to ASTM for certification. This process is critical for verifying the fuel’s safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its suitability for commercial aviation.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-8.png,N,,2025-03-26 04:56:16.913363

The Toulouse-based airframer provided an update during the 2025 Airbus Summit on a new narrowbody product that it envisions delivering sometime in the second half of the 2030s.

Airbus has previously stated that it would launch such a programme before the end of this decade.

But it did not get specific on when it plans to finalise the design of its next-generation narrowbody. Airbus is seemingly in no rush to market as Boeing attempts to gain momentum with its 737 Max programme – allowing more time for engine and wing concepts to mature.

Reuters reports that Airbus chief Guillaume Faury said during the event that its next narrowbody platform would be “evolutionary rather than revolutionary”, with renderings suggesting the aircraft could take a familiar-looking form.

Boeing is still attempting to achieve Federal Aviation Administration certification of the Max 7 and Max 10 – the smallest and largest variants of the Max family, respectively.

Already badly delayed, those programmes are being further hindered by issues related to the stall management yaw damper system on both the Max 7 and Max 10.

Airbus, meanwhile, started delivering its long-range variant of the A321neo to airline customers in October.

”We have the most advanced aircraft portfolio in the market and the A321XLR is at the very forefront of today’s single-aisle aircraft technology,” says Bruno Fichefeux, Airbus’ head of future programmes.

”Now we are taking the best of what we’ve done and preparing another jump to make our single-aisle aircraft even better and pioneer the future of flight, when the time is right.”

Airbus has also experienced recent setbacks on the innovation front. Last month, it pushed back the service-entry target for a hydrogen-powered aircraft developed under its ZEROe project by up to 10 years.

With its next narrowbody jet, Airbus is targeting a 20-30% increase in fuel efficiency compared with A320neo-family aircraft.

Airbus is exploring various airframe configurations, including “long foldable wings allowing for significant aerodynamic gains”, a concept it is studying through its Wing of Tomorrow technology research programme.

Such a design would provide the aircraft ”a longer wingspan in flight, increasing lift and reducing drag, while still making it compatible with airport gates,” Airbus says.

”Imagine a new Airbus single-aisle aircraft with wings designed with advanced aerodynamics and biomimicry in mind to generate significantly more lift, reducing fuel consumption and increasing efficiency.”

It is also seeking to gain ground on engine efficiency, pointing to ”disruptive open-fan designs”, such as CFM International’s advanced open fan concept RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines).

”An open-fan engine looks quite different from a modern turbofan, as the fan blades that generate thrust are larger and not contained by a nacelle, the cowling that contains the fan in current-generation engines,” Airbus says. ”This allows air to move efficiently through the engine, reducing fuel consumption.”

Airbus is partnering with CFM on the RISE open-fan engine demonstrator, which could reduce aircraft emissions by 20% compared with today’s most efficient single-aisle jets. It is planning to launch a flight-test programme using the open-fan design on an A380 test article before decade’s end.

The company is also exploring hybrid technology that could supplement burning conventional or sustainable aviation fuel with batteries or fuel cells. Such an approach could potentially reduce carbon emissions by up to 5%, Airbus says, by ”using otherwise wasted energy to power non-propulsive functions”.

”These batteries could be used to power the aircraft while taxiing on the ground, as well as during flight for onboard functions like the air conditioning system or lighting,” it says.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/8/7/9/108879_airbusnextgensingleaisle_62003.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 02:56:36.060749

The tourism industry contributes nearly 8% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions according to Sustainable Travel International, with aviation alone accounting for 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, as noted by the World Economic Forum.

With summer around the corner, March is an ideal time to start planning a vacation. According to McKinsey, demand for leisure travel is increasing as their research indicated that the leisure industry was expected to make a full recovery at the end of 2024, following its 75% decline in value during the 2020 pandemic. This upward trend makes early booking crucial for securing better prices and availability while ensuring more sustainable choices. A 2024 Vacasa report found that booking summer trips by early April secures the best deals, as search volume rises soon after. With March nearly over, there's still time to plan strategically. This article will show you how to reduce your environmental footprint while enhancing your travel experience.

1. Choose Low-Carbon Vacation Transportation

Air travel remains one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions. According to the International Air Transport Association, sustainable aviation fuel could reduce aviation emissions by up to 80%, yet the December 2024 IATA report indicated that it currently accounts for less than 0.3% of global jet fuel production. As a result, even if you want to fly using SAF, it would be limited, so to offset your impact, consider the following where possible:

Choose non-stop flights whenever possible, as they consume less fuel and produce fewer emissions than connecting flights. This is because the most fuel-intensive phases of a flight are takeoff and landing. When planning a sustainable trip, prioritize flights with fewer connections to reduce your carbon footprint.

Where feasible, consider rail travel which is significantly more greenhouse gas efficient than road transport and aviation. According to the European Environment Agency, rail travel emits just 35g of CO₂ per kilometer, compared to 246g per kilometer for a domestic flight and 154g per kilometer for a short-haul flight, as reported by Our World in Data.

2. Stay in an Eco-Certified Vacation Hotel

Just like your home, hotels and vacation rentals generate emissions from energy use, with heating, air conditioning, water heating, and electricity consumption being major contributors. Larger resorts and hotels typically have higher emissions due to their extensive amenities, whereas smaller lodgings, such as homestays and guesthouses, tend to have a lower environmental impact. By conducting energy audits, these accommodations can assess their energy demand and implement efficiency measures, leading to both environmental and financial benefits. Accommodation accounts for nearly 2-5% of global CO2 emitted by the tourism sector according to UN Tourism. Here’s how you can select sustainable accommodations or be sustainable if the accommodation is not:

Look for certifications like LEED, EarthCheck, or Green Key, which ensure sustainability standards.

Choose accommodations that use renewable energy, waste reduction programs, and water conservation initiatives.

Opt for locally owned eco-lodges and resorts instead of large international chains that contribute to over-tourism.

Choose temperature settings that are comfortable and avoid over cooling and overheating the rooms.

Turn off heaters, or air conditioners when not in the rooms.

3. Eat Sustainably on Vacation

Food accounts for a significant portion of a vacation’s carbon footprint. A 2024 United Nations Climate Change article estimates that food waste accounts for nearly 8-10% of global emissions and costs UDS 1 trillion annually. Here is how you can eat sustainably while on vacation.

Support farm-to-table restaurants that source local, organic ingredients.

Choose plant-based meals where possible, as they tend to have a lower carbon footprint than meat-based dishes.

Reduce waste by ordering only what you can eat, especially when staying in all inclusive resorts.

4. Engage in Responsible Vacation Activities

Mass tourism often damages local ecosystems and cultures. Over tourism happens when a destination receives more visitors than it can handle sustainably, resulting in issues like overcrowding, environmental harm, infrastructure strain, and a lower quality of life for locals. Essentially, it is what happens when a place becomes a victim of its own popularity. Here are tips to engage in responsible vacation activities:

Choose ethical wildlife experiences (e.g., sanctuaries over zoos or animal rides).

Support local businesses and vetted local tour guides to boost the tourism industry’s contribution to local economies.

Avoid activities that contribute to over-tourism in fragile ecosystems like coral reefs.

5. Pack and Travel Responsibly for Your Vacation

Sustainable packing and mindful habits during vacations play a crucial role in reducing environmental impact. According to the EPA, plastic pollution accounts for 60-80% of marine debris, posing a severe threat to marine ecosystems. Making eco-conscious choices helps travelers significantly minimize waste.

To reduce waste while traveling, consider packing reusable essentials. Bring a durable, refillable water bottle and fabric shopping bags to minimize single-use plastics.

Opting for reef-safe sunscreens is another important step. Traditional sunscreens contain chemicals like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which harm coral reefs. Choosing mineral-based sunscreens with non-nano zinc oxide helps protect marine life.

Using solid toiletries can also make a difference. Replacing mini plastic bottles of liquid shampoos, conditioners, and body washes with solid bars reduces plastic waste and makes packing more convenient.

6. Shop Sustainably for Vacation Clothes

Instead of buying new clothes for your vacation, check your closet first to see if you already own suitable outfits. This helps reduce textile waste and overconsumption. If you need new pieces, consider shopping sustainably by thrifting or choosing ethically made clothing. The fashion industry contributes approximately 10% of global carbon emissions, so opting for second-hand or sustainably produced items helps lower your environmental impact.

Sustainable travel revolves around making mindful decisions that lessen your environmental impact while enhancing the travel experience. Opt for eco-friendly transportation, stay in energy-efficient accommodations, choose sustainable dining options, participate in responsible tourism, pack consciously, and shop for clothes and gear sustainably. Every small action adds up as demand for travel rises, helping secure a greener future.

Airbus highlighted its cutting-edge technologies, innovative design and novel engineering capabilities during the third edition of its Airbus Summit in Toulouse on 24 and 25 March, 2025.

Airbus’ Head of Future Programmes Bruno Fichefeux said that: “Every second, an Airbus aircraft takes off – connecting people, cargo and business around the world. We have the most advanced aircraft portfolio in the market and the A321XLR is at the very forefront of today’s single-aisle aircraft technology. Now we are taking the best of what we’ve done and preparing another jump to make our single-aisle aircraft even better and pioneer the future of flight, when the time is right.”

The company provided a glimpse at the roadmap it has drawn up to pioneer the future of commercial aviation, and unveiled a number of new next-generation single-aisle aircraft design concepts. These showcase some of the different configurations being studied, highlighting potential solutions that are being explored in order to achieve a major leap forward in aircraft efficiency. Airbus hopes that these will bring a real contribution to the decarbonisation of air travel in the decades to come, underpinning the future of sustainable aerospace.

Technologies for this future single-aisle aircraft aircraft could include more efficient engines, including disruptive open fan designs; long foldable wings allowing for significant aerodynamic gains; next-generation batteries to enable hybrid architectures where electricity is increasingly used to support propulsive and non-propulsive functions aboard the aircraft and lightweight materials and integrated systems for a connected aircraft.

Airbus says that it is “investigating the potential of a few promising engines technologies,” and that “one primary contender is the open fan.” An open or unducted fan engine looks quite different from a modern turbofan, as the fan blades are larger and not contained within the nacelle. This allows air to move efficiently through the engine, reducing fuel consumption.

Airbus is working with engine-maker CFM on the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan engine demonstrator, and plans to flight test RISE on its A380 flight test aircraft by the end of the decade. The demonstrator is planned to demonstrate a reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 20% compared to today’s most efficient equivalent engines.

Unducted fan (UDF) engines were previously explored in the early 1980s by General Electric (the GE36, tested on a Boeing 727), Pratt and Whitney (the Model 578-DX tested on a Gulfstream II) and International Aero Engines (the IAE V2500SF). McDonnell Douglas began developing propfan variants of its MD-80, the MD-91X, and the MD-92X, and flew a UDF prototype (N980DC, also known as the UHB (Ultra High Bypass) Demo testbed) with a GE-36 engine to port. This aircraft made 93 flights totalling 165 hours of testing and was even displayed at the Farnborough Air Show in September 1988. Falling oil prices and technical issues led to the abandonment of the various unducted fan projects.

Airbus hopes that the time has come for the open fan engine, marking the next step after the piston, turbojet and turbofan. These engines will consume 20% less fuel than current powerplants, making air travel more decarbonised and cost-effective.

A video shown at the Airbus Summit showed two main open fan powered variations of a notional next-generation single-aisle airliner, one with underwing engines and a conventional empennage, the other with a stretched forward fuselage and a T-tail, and two rear-mounted engines.

Airbus Head of R&T Karim Mokaddem said: “Airbus teams are working relentlessly towards the key decisions that will ultimately finalise the choices of the aircraft’s engine type, wing design and additional innovations once their maturity is demonstrated.”

The end result will be an anticipated 20-30% increase in fuel efficiency compared with the current generation of airliners, as well as the ability to fly with up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This will, it is hoped, support the aviation sector’s roadmap towards achieving net-zero emissions in 2050.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-25-at-18.45.13.png,N,,2025-03-25 18:56:34.583603

The campaign demonstrated the effectiveness and viability of the company’s Flexiforming technology in producing SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel from various renewable feedstocks. The project was conducted at the facilities of RPD Technologies in Crosby, Texas, from August through December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, signaling readiness for the technology to scale up. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol to SAF and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) to SAF. Samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF have been thoroughly tested and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening—the initial step of the SAF certification process.

“As an industry, it’s crucial that we continue to support and explore new technologies to advance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel,” said Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Lab (BSEL) at Washington State University. “The capability to make aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single technology platform not only streamlines SAF production but also significantly lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible for producers and airlines.”

The pilot yielded two distinct forms of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential aromatic blend component for maintaining compatibility of paraffinic SAF with the composition of fossil kerosene, and a 100% drop-in, fully synthetic SAF that contains the correct aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International, the leading global technical standards organization. As a result, the aromatic component of SAF produced through Flexiforming, made from HEFA and FT naphtha, can be blended with the primary paraffinic SAF stream from these units. This creates the opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units, reducing the costs and complexity of the logistics and aiding in industry adoption.

“The impact of this pilot project reaches far beyond technical validation,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. “A considerable value of Flexiforming is that it contributes to making SAF fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM approved. Because of its aromatic properties, which are essential for compatibility with today’s aircraft, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT and sold directly to airlines without the need for blending with another fuel. As the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact and contain costs, technologies like Flexiforming could be crucial in scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production to keep pace with demand.”

Flexiforming provides several options for SAF production, making it especially adaptable for various renewable fuel scenarios. The pilot campaign validated ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ) production routes, offering flexibility in feedstock selection. Due to the technology’s substantially lower energy and hydrogen requirements, Unifuel estimates Flexiforming to be half the cost of current ETJ processes. Moreover, Flexiforming allows renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes to create high-value aromatic SAF that can be blended into fully synthetic drop-in-ready jet fuel.

“The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise to proceed to full certification as aviation turbine fuel,” said Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor of the BSEL at Washington State University.

Unifuel’s team has completed over a decade of research and extensive testing on its Flexiforming technology. As Unifuel transitions to the next stage, samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the campaign are being prepared for ASTM certification submission. This certification process is essential for validating the fuel's safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its viability for commercial aviation use.

Providing clean fuel projects with long-term revenue certainty is critical to unlocking initial investments.
Creating a sustainable future through clean fuels The shift towards clean fuels has the potential to deliver significant economic and environmental benefits.","The world is undergoing a major shift towards cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. In addition to expanding renewable energy, the fuel landscape must transform to lower emissions in sectors that are difficult to electrify directly, such as aviation and shipping. These fuels—including low-carbon fuels, e-fuels, and renewable fuels—are vital to meeting global climate targets.

Production, however, is currently far from the levels needed to realize a pathway to net zero in 2050. By 2030, 0.8 billion gallons are needed to meet the EU’s mandates for SAF and e-SAF. In 2024, only 0.3 billion gallons of SAF was produced, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The role of industrial policy in the fuel transition

Supportive policies are crucial to speed up the adoption of clean fuels. The industry for clean fuels is being built on an accelerated timeline in a short amount of time, relying initially on rudimentary supply chains with relatively high costs due to the small scale. This makes it difficult for new technologies and pathways to compete with an efficient industrial system that has been optimized for over 150 years.

Conventional fuels have a daily volume of over 3 billion gallons, are supported by mature value chains and established industry standards, and have been able to optimize efficiencies and economies of scale over many decades. In addition, market prices fail to account for the climate impact of fossil fuels.

This creates a price gap, where clean fuels are, on average, three to five times more expensive than conventional fuels. Consequently, consumers are often reluctant to commit to using clean fuels due to increased costs and fear of losing competitiveness in their downstream markets. Many clean fuel plants are first-of-a-kind industrial projects, and without committed off-take, they are not considered bankable and, therefore, fail to move to final investment decisions.

Robust industrial policies are needed to drive down costs for new technologies and pathways in order to level the playing field and drive the fuel transition.

Building a strong policy framework

In recent years, several governments have taken the lead in establishing supportive industrial policies driven by climate considerations and the desire to strengthen energy security, enhance resilience and foster sustainable economic growth and job creation.

A crucial component of industrial policy is setting 'demand-pull mechanisms,' such as mandates and regulations. For example, the EU's Renewable Energy Directive(RED II and III) requires that a specific percentage of fuels used in industry and the transport sector come from renewable sources, encouraging investment in cleaner alternatives. Similarly, the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate requires fuel suppliers to supply SAF at airports, ensuring a market for these fuels.

The use of market-based measures that allow the trading of emissions certificates, such as the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), can be another powerful driver for the fuel transition. Following the 'polluter pays principle,' efficient carbon pricing mechanisms are essential to create a level playing field between conventional fuels and cleaner alternatives, encouraging consumers to reconsider their fuel choice.

In the absence of a global carbon market, regional or sectorial approaches offer tangible solutions to move forward. The International Maritime Organization, for instance, is considering introducing a global greenhouse gas levy. If adopted, this measure could generate billions in revenues that could be re-invested to finance a just and equitable transition and the development of sustainable marine fuels. The European Hydrogen Bank is already demonstrating how ETS money can be used to produce renewable hydrogen.

Beyond mandates and carbon pricing, governments are also using financial incentives to help fuel producers. The Clean Hydrogen Energy Standard, for example, is a support programme for hydrogen-generated electricity in South Korea. It includes a series of auctions for clean ammonia to be used in co-firing plants, allowing project developers to receive a fixed or indexed price over a 15-year period. Providing clean fuel projects with long-term revenue certainty is critical to unlocking initial investments.

Another example is the UK, where the government has announced a revenue certainty scheme for SAF production, providing much-needed support to the industry. This approach, which combines demand-driving policies with financial incentives, helps ensure that the supply of clean fuels will grow at the same pace as demand.

Fostering innovation and resilient SAF supply chains

Industrial policies focus on productivity growth and innovation. The EU and UK SAF mandates, for instance, encourage the innovation of advanced fuels, particularly with the introduction of a synthetic jet fuel mandate (e-SAF) from 2030 onwards. Fostering technological advancement can help build future industrial leadership and competitiveness.

Both the United States and the EU have adopted measures to support clean energy value chains in their industrial policies, allowing for faster deployment of innovative technologies. The Net-Zero Industry Act, the Critical Raw Materials Acts, and the Inflation Reduction Act are examples of these measures. They aim to support the scaling of critical clean technologies by aligning industrial and energy policies and providing long-term viability to attract investments.

Local content requirements can further ensure that the ramp-up of domestic clean fuel production capacities and cleantech manufacturing benefits the local economy and helps mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities, especially in the context of increasing geopolitical tensions. This is particularly relevant to strengthening energy security and reducing and preventing reliance on imports for critical components, such as electrolyzers used in hydrogen production.

At the same time, industrial policies must balance these goals with the need for global cooperation. The transition to clean fuels is a global challenge that requires international collaboration. While regional policies are essential, they must be carefully designed to avoid isolating markets and ensure that global trade continues to flow, fostering innovation worldwide and facilitating economies of scale.

Creating a sustainable future through clean fuels

The shift towards clean fuels has the potential to deliver significant economic and environmental benefits. It can drive economic growth by supporting new industries and creating jobs. It can also boost energy security. By developing domestic production capacities for fuels like green or low-carbon hydrogen and SAF, regions like Europe can reduce their dependence on foreign energy sources, creating more resilient economies.

Governments must act decisively to ensure the transition is fast and sustainable. By fostering partnerships between public and private sectors, aligning policies across borders and incentivizing local production, industrial policy can accelerate and unlock the full potential of clean fuels.

The time to act is now — and industrial policy will be the catalyst for the transformation that is urgently needed to achieve a sustainable, low-carbon future.

MUMBAI: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently announced that it has enhanced its IATA CO2 Connect emissions calculator to account for carbon emissions reductions related to the usage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Initially, CO2 Connect will apply equal per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. In future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added, said IATA.

“Corporations and individual travellers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President Commercial Products and Services.

IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, directly contributed by airlines. This approach contrasts with other calculators that primarily rely on modelled averages. With the recent inclusion of Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas, and Royal Air Maroc, some 60 airlines are now contributing data to CO2 Connect. With each new airline participant, the accuracy and transparency of IATA CO2 Connect’s calculations improve—for individual travellers and corporates.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonisation powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.

The development follows the recent publication of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology, which helps airlines and industry stakeholders accurately report SAF-related emissions reductions and sets the accounting foundation baseline in the upcoming IATA SAF registry. It also provides guidance to reflect SAF emissions reduction in per-passenger and per-shipment emissions calculations.

Developed in collaboration with more than 40 airline experts worldwide, the methodology is designed to complement existing international frameworks and to reinforce consistency without duplicating efforts, according to IATA. The IATA methodology fully intends to serve as a reference for both regulatory and voluntary environmental initiatives, it said.

SAF has been identified as the biggest lever in decarbonizing aviation. As airlines scale up SAF, the need for the aviation industry to demonstrate clearly and transparently the emissions reduction from SAF use becomes more eminent, said IATA. ""Clarity in a global and robust SAF accounting framework is essential for SAF deployment and its commercial viability. A robust, feedstock-agnostic, and technology-neutral methodology, irrespective of chain-of-custody used, is critical to avoid double-counting and uphold environmental claims’ integrity,"" it added. A robust and global SAF accounting framework can also help to deploy SAF most efficiently while widening market access of SAF irrespective of its uplift locations, said IATA.

Dialogue between all stakeholders is the basis of the third edition of the ALTA Fuel and Sustainability Conference

Aviation in Latin America and the Caribbean faces challenges that require a coordinated and efficient approach. Dialogue among all stakeholders is essential, which is why the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA) is holding its 3rd ALTA Fuel & Sustainability Conference this week in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. This event brings together industry experts to discuss strategies for a more sustainable and economically viable future.

Jet fuel accounts for approximately 35% of airline operating costs in the region. It is the largest expense in the cost structure and is considerably more expensive than in other parts of the world. This is a critical challenge that requires urgent attention, as it directly impacts airfares and, consequently, the ability of more people to access this essential service.

Experts will also discuss key strategies for decarbonizing the sector. While airlines have made significant progress through fleet modernization and operational improvements, decarbonization requires a broader range of measures: large-scale adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—which still faces barriers such as high costs and limited availability—emission offset strategies, and other initiatives.

Peter Cerdá, ALTA’s CEO, highlights that “aviation is an essential sector for the prosperity of Latin America and the Caribbean. We connect communities, drive tourism, commerce, and job creation. Although we account for approximately 2% of global emissions, we are strongly committed to making air transport more sustainable. However, there is no sustainable future without economic and operational feasibility. Decarbonization strategies must be viable for our region.”

Cerdá stresses that “if the measures we adopt to reduce emissions increase air transport costs and limit access to aviation, they will simply not be sustainable over time. We need solutions that are efficient, realistic, and tailored to our region—this means promoting the development of sustainable fuels with effective regulations, improving infrastructure, and optimizing operations with a focus on competitiveness.”

In addition to SAF, the conference will examine the evolution of traditional fuels like Jet A-1 and Jet A, the need to optimize their supply chains, the impact of climate change on aviation, circular economy initiatives, and the role of regulation in fostering a more sustainable industry.

A key highlight will be the discussion of a regional sustainability roadmap being developed by ALTA and ICF, with active participation from governments.

With the support of the Dominican Institute of Civil Aviation (IDAC) and the Superior Academy of Aeronautical Sciences (ASCA), ALTA reaffirms its commitment to a more efficient and sustainable aviation sector. This conference marks a milestone in the pursuit of innovative solutions that will enable aviation in Latin America and the Caribbean to move toward a future where sustainability and competitiveness go hand in hand.",https://ala.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/alta-logo-color-transparent.png,N,,2025-03-25 17:56:45.255318

Avfuel remains committed to leading the industry forward in all aspects of sustainability.","CR Sincock, Avfuel’s Executive Vice President, answers questions on sustainable aviation fuel availability, Avfuel’s investment in SAF production and distribution, and his confidence that business aviation sustainability initiatives will continue even if federal support is lost

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) seems to have been more easily available in the US on the West Coast. Is that still the case?

Since SAF was introduced to business and general aviation operations in 2019, its availability has been heavily concentrated in the West, largely due to California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the state’s commitment to sustainable energy solutions.

However, in 2025 we’re seeing a shift as supply infrastructure on the East Coast strengthens. At Avfuel, we’re actively working to close the gap through strategic collaborations, including a new supply relationship with Valero Marketing & Supply Company, and an expanded agreement with Neste.

Through our agreement with Valero, we now have SAF supply sources in Port Everglades, Florida, Linden, New Jersey, and Pasadena, Texas. These locations are instrumental in broadening our reach and ensuring SAF is available at key hubs across the eastern US.

This is supplemented by a proprietary book-and-claim registry that allows Avfuel to effectively sell SAF attributes no matter where an operator flies. With multiple purchasing options, new supply locations coming online and our investment in multimodal delivery methods – including truck and pipeline solutions – we’re ensuring greater nationwide availability of SAF for our customers.

Avfuel sells fuel globally. How are your sustainability efforts looking in overseas markets?

Avfuel operates with a global mindset. Sustainability is a universal challenge, making the demand for SAF grow internationally. In Europe and the UK, regulatory momentum – including ReFuelEU and various SAF mandates – is pushing SAF adoption forward.

We not only continue to monitor those developments, but also directly support them. Along with 24 SAF locations in the US, Avfuel’s customers can purchase physical SAF molecules at 26 locations across the EU and into the UK.

With our focus on supply agreements and the future of fuel, Avfuel is positioned to significantly expand its SAF footprint and help advance global SAF adoption.

Avfuel supplies the full spectrum of aviation segments along with business aviation. Does SAF translate across other segments?

As a drop-in replacement for jet fuel, SAF is a viable solution across all aviation segments. Business aviation operations have been early adopters, driven by the industry’s ability to move quickly on ESG [environmental, social, governance] commitments. However, we’re also working with airline and cargo companies who are increasingly interested in supporting the SAF initiative.

As commitments from these segments grow, the next challenge will be scaling production to keep pace. Scalability will be crucial in ensuring all segments can access SAF at the volumes they require; it will also likely contribute to the price gap between SAF and jet fuel narrowing, which can only further encourage adoption.

Avfuel was among the first companies to offer SAF. How has it differentiated itself from other companies who have since entered the space?

Avfuel has been a leader in SAF’s adoption and supply from the beginning, and remains a definitive leader in supplying SAF to business aviation operations.

Several companies offer sustainability programmes, audits or book-and-claim, but don’t have direct access to physical SAF molecules – they have to source these molecules from other suppliers in order to meet the needs of their end customers. At Avfuel, we provide a full, end-to-end sustainability programme – AvfuelZero – that not only helps customers pinpoint their emissions, set goals and report on their progress, but also effectively reduce emissions with in-house products. These products include physical SAF molecules, carbon credits and a robust book-and-claim system with the highest regard for accuracy, ensuring each environmental attribute is only counted once.

AvfuelZero is a complete, closed system that simplifies what has historically been a complex process. Our aim is to make it easy for operators to adopt sustainable practices by supporting them from end to end, or anywhere in between, with the assistance of ESG experts and the products that make the biggest difference within any budget.

Along with supplying SAF, Avfuel has become an expert industry resource on the matter. Where do you see the SAF market going?

The SAF market is at a critical juncture. With production capabilities expanding, supply chains maturing and increasing adoption rates, 2025 and beyond hold significant potential for SAF to become a mainstream fuel solution. Industry analysts predict continued exponential growth, with Avfuel expecting to once again increase its supply capabilities in 2025 and beyond, particularly with extended supply reach geographically. This is fuelled by strategic agreements with producers including Neste, Valero Marketing & Supply Company, and Gevo, whose new production facility will contribute to a more robust supply chain.

One of the key drivers of market growth will be the advancement of next-generation fuel technologies, which will diversify SAF feedstocks. To this end, Avfuel has made significant investments in technology-driven fuel solutions coming from organisations like AIR Company, Alder Renewables and VerdeGo Aero.

For instance, AIR Company’s carbon conversion technology represents a major step forward in producing SAF from CO2. Similarly, Alder Renewables is advancing woody biomass-based SAF production, while VerdeGo Aero is working on hybrid-electric power solutions to complement sustainable fuel strategies. These collaborations allow Avfuel to remain at the cutting edge of the industry and ensure our customers have early access to next-generation solutions.

As the US changes presidential administrations, what is the state of sustainability initiatives?

No doubt policy will also play a pivotal role in determining the pace of SAF’s market expansion. With the US presidential administration changing, there’s been a bit of uncertainty regarding the future of sustainability initiatives. Federal incentives like the Producers Tax Credit and other state credits have historically supported SAF affordability and production expansion. If these incentives are renewed or expanded, the market could see unprecedented acceleration.

Should federal incentives not be renewed, we still expect state-level initiatives to come into play in the coming years, much like we’ve seen in California with low-carbon fuel standard credits and its new emissions reporting legislation. Support from the states will certainly help maintain progress in sustainability initiatives.

Furthermore, public and private corporations alike have made ESG commitments; we expect those initiatives to remain in place, helping to maintain and grow SAF commitments from business aviation operations.

Avfuel remains committed to leading the industry forward in all aspects of sustainability. Our efforts in securing new supply agreements, investing in future-ready fuel technologies, and working alongside regulatory bodies position us to help customers transition toward a more sustainable future. The SAF market is evolving rapidly, and Avfuel is leading the charge to ensure its success.

Avfuel is also taking a leading stance on removing lead from avgas. Can you provide an update on that initiative?

Beyond SAF, Avfuel has heavily invested numerous resources toward the unleaded avgas initiative. We understand the importance of providing a viable, safe alternative to 100LL, and we’re actively engaged with industry partners to progress this initiative. While there’s still work to be done in terms of approvals and infrastructure, we’re making meaningful progress. Our goal is to ensure orderly, safe and widespread adoption of unleaded avgas while maintaining the reliability and performance that general aviation operators depend on.

Transitioning away from leaded avgas is a complex process, but with industry collaboration and continued investment, we are optimistic about a future where general aviation supports a cleaner world.",https://evaint.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2025/03/09-Av-Fuel-2-10-25-Florida-596-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 16:56:34.512650

SINES, Portugal (Reuters) - Portuguese oil company Galp Energia's gasoline exports to the United States could be curtailed if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on European goods, but the company is confident it can find alternative destinations.

Executive Board member Ronald Doesburg, who is in charge of industrial assets, told Reuters on Tuesday that if U.S. demand for gasoline drops as a result of higher prices stemming from the proposed 25% tariffs, Galp will be able to deal with it.

Galp's only refinery in Sines usually produces about 2 million metric tons of gasoline per year, of which between 1.2 million and 1.5 million tons are exported to the United States. The remainder is taken by the Portuguese market.

Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all European goods, raising the risk of a trade war that could prove damaging for export-oriented European companies.

""The energy market is global, gasoline streams are global, and hence our gasoline production will have sufficient flexibility to find its way to different markets,"" Doesburg said.

Tariffs would have an impact, ""but it's an impact that will be managed ... We will look at our options"", he said, adding that Galp has handled trade-related disruptions in the past and that Sines could be realigned towards different types of products, depending on prices and demand.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

In the meantime, Galp continues its shift towards greener fuels and expects to start producing biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel from waste, such as used cooking oil, by mid-2026 at a unit it is building at its refinery, said Galp's head of hydrogen, Sergio Machado.

The 400 million euro ($432 million) Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) plant, a 75% to 25% joint venture with Japan's Mitsui, will have annual production capacity of 270,000 tons and will be using green hydrogen from a 100 megawatt electrolyser that will cost 250 million euros.

""Our expectation is to have both units in production by mid-2026 and to reach cruising speed shortly thereafter,"" Machado said.

In an online statement, the airport claimed it is already one of the “largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021.”

Through the supply deal with H2R, Farnborough Airport will become the “first and only” airport in the world to offer fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, according to CEO, Simon Geere.

The CEO added, “The transition to new fuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen.”

UK and European SAF mandates began taking effect at the start of 2025. Aircraft operators, EU airports and managing bodies must blend an increasing level of SAF with kerosene, starting this year.

“This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill,” claimed Stephen Voller, CEO at H2R.

Non-recyclable waste may be abundant, but its inconsistent composition can undermine syngas quality and SAF yield – an issue the IEA flagged as a key barrier to scaling in 2023.

Offtake agreements offer a way to derisk investment in crucial climate tech.

These four examples of best practices can build a winning offtake strategy.

As the world works towards reducing emissions from fossil fuels, it is increasingly important to develop new technologies that can maintain our quality of life without contributing to climate change. Many promising solutions that could enable a circular carbon economy already exist, but not at the necessary scale. These first-of-a-kind (FOAK) projects need to scale up, but that’s easier said than done.

Offtake agreements can boost investments

Scaling up takes financing, which can be difficult to acquire. This is because climate tech projects are inherently risky. New technologies that test well in a lab may not work in the real world. Investors know about these high risks, and don’t want to waste their money. But without investment no new technologies can be developed, preventing new climate tech from coming to market.

Offtake agreements offer a solution to this problem. Under an offtake agreement, a buyer agrees to purchase a certain portion of a seller’s goods once produced, guaranteeing cash flow as soon as the product is ready. This security makes a product seem less risky to investors, significantly increasing funding chances. Plus, offtake agreements demonstrate market interest to stakeholders, boosting a company’s credibility.

The right offtake agreement for each stage: the 'Maslow Pyramid'

Not all offtakes are created equal. Different types of offtake agreements are useful at different stages of a project’s life. Think of this like Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, where the bottom of the pyramid is occupied by basic needs that must be fulfilled in order to build up to greater things.

The “Maslow Pyramid of Offtakes” looks a bit like this (bullet points start from the bottom of the pyramid):

Soft agreements: Non-binding letters of intent (LOIs) and memorandums of understanding (MOUs) are essential at the Prototype stage (TRL 4-5). These build early trust without heavy commitments.

Binding agreements: During the pilot/demo phase (TRL 6-7), binding agreements offer legal certainty for short-term engagements or smaller quantities, often tied to conditional milestones.

Bankable agreements: By the time you reach FOAK and NOAK (Nth of a Kind) (TRL 8-9), bankable agreements provide long-term cash flow certainty, crucial for securing major capital and scaling.

When the right offtake agreement type is used, offtakes help founders secure project financing by de-risking projects for investors. Think of offtakes for climate tech as equivalent to Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) for software startups – they're critical indicators of an ability to develop technology the market actually wants and will pay for.

Here are four best practices which can be used to build winning offtake strategies:

1. Don't sell – partner

If you want to succeed in the long run, you have to be strategic from the very beginning. Strategic players repeatedly mention that they aren't interested in signing offtake agreements as customers – they want to be partners for the journey.

Secure key corporate partners who align with your vision at an early stage. This will allow you to collaborate on co-development opportunities, leveraging their expertise and infrastructure to help you refine your product, giving you credibility at an early stage and allowing you to negotiate for favourable terms. Use pilot plants to showcase your technology, allowing partners to test and validate it early.

For example, consider the partnership between Holcim and Sublime Systems, which included both equity investment and offtake agreements, creating a win-win relationship beyond mere customer-supplier dynamics.

2. Diversify offtakers to mitigate risks

Offtakes mitigate risks for investors, but they come with their own risks. Never put all your eggs in one basket. Offtake agreements can fall through, so it’s important to avoid over-reliance on a single customer. Instead, it’s a good idea to engage multiple offtakers across the value chain.

This means you’ll want to move beyond just your own direct offtakers, and start thinking about your offtakers’ offtakers. Having a diverse group of offtakers at different parts of the value chain reduces your vulnerability to market volatility and means that your projects can progress even if one partnership fails.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

3. Design flexible contracts

Uncertainty is a fact of life, so if you want to make investors feel comfortable financing your project, you need to ensure that your offtake contracts are adaptable in the face of those uncertainties. While early-stage agreements are flexible by default, as you move towards more binding agreements you’ll need to balance flexibility and preparedness to get the most out of your offtakes.

Include mechanisms like cost caps, tiered pricing, and competitive bidding to manage risks and align with ever-evolving project realities. Avoid rigid terms that could limit you in the future. Don’t rush into firm commitments, but keep agreements flexible until you’re ready. By staying flexible, you can ensure that both parties can adapt to changes without compromising commitments.

4. Align agreements with offtakers' operational cycles

When making offtake agreements, it helps to remember that your offtakers are running companies of their own, which means they’re also beholden to procurement, R&D, or seasonal cycles. To get the most out of your offtake agreements, integrate them into your offtakers’ normal operational dynamics, ensuring seamless adoption of your product. Tailoring your agreement to their timelines significantly increases the likelihood of success.

Climb the offtake pyramid

Whatever you decide to do, and whoever your offtakers are, offtake agreements are a necessary part of financing your FOAKs. If you play your cards right, you can use your offtake agreements to help you negotiate complexities and balance your scalability needs with customer expectations, manage fluctuating demand and pricing uncertainties, and transition your FOAK projects to scalable, NOAK operations.

Start with low-risk commitments and work your way up to bankable agreements as you deliver on key milestones, and build customer relationships and trust. Take things step by step, be strategic, and soon enough, you'll make these contracts work for you, helping you scale up your solutions and tackle climate change.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_GMr9F4K84fB47M9c4-WWEMagI-IE-_FVdheqRddiTNM.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 15:56:52.858107

Airbus Head of Future Programs Bruno Fichefeux said, “Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonize aviation. While we've adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionize air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.”

These technologies were showcased as part of a new concept of a hydrogen aircraft powered by four 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. The four fuel cell systems would be supplied via two liquid hydrogen tanks. This concept will continue to be refined over the coming years as additional tests will help mature the technologies associated with hydrogen storage and distribution, as well as with the propulsion systems.

Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project Glenn Llewellyn added, “Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept. We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology. In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.”

In 2023, Airbus demonstrated a 1.2MW hydrogen-propulsion system, and in 2024, end-to-end testing of an integrated fuel cell stack, electric motors, gearboxes, inverters and heat exchangers was completed.

In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to ""book"" a certain amount of SAF and ""claim"" the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can help reduce carbon emissions, provides an opportunity for India, where sustainability is high on the agenda, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury has said. One of the world's fastest growing civil aviation markets, Airbus sees ""more and more potential in India"", with one of the senior officials saying the country is nothing but ""growth"" for the company.

Apart from having hundreds of aircraft orders placed by Indian carriers, the plane maker has a joint venture Final Assembly Line (FAL) for C295 aircraft and a FAL for helicopter H125 will be set up this year in India.

Besides, Airbus sources more than 1 billion euros worth of components and services for global exports from the country.

""SAF is an opportunity for India... sustainability is something that is very high on the agenda in India.... India has a bigger share of aviation... of the global aviation. Therefore India has a bigger role and a bigger responsibility to play in the global equation,"" Guillaume Faury told PTI on Monday.

He was speaking to PTI on the sidelines of the Airbus Summit 2025 in Toulouse.

Aviation accounts for around 2-3 per cent of the global carbon emissions and SAF can help in reducing these emissions.

By replacing 10 per cent of global jet fuel consumption with SAF, the aviation industry could reduce the emissions by around 50 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year, as per Airbus.

India has a great potential to become a SAF producer, Head of SAF and CDR Developments Sustainability Organisation at Julien Manhes said.

For SAF production, the country can look at utilising its ethanol supplies and availability of lipids feedstocks like non-edible industrial oils.

Talking about the development of the global aviation sector, Faury said the first revolution was about getting in the air more than a century ago and the second was to have a safe mode of transport.

""The third was making travel affordable for people. Going to sustainability, which is the fourth revolution, we do not want to lose the benefits of what we have achieved so far,"" he emphasised.

Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer of the commercial aircraft business at Airbus Christian Scherer told PTI on Monday that the company is growing its supply chain in India.

""We are increasing our supply, whether it is engineering services where India is really good, it is intellectual supply compared to metallurgical supplies. We are also increasing our metallurgical supplies,"" he said and stressed that ""India is nothing but growth for Airbus"".

Executive Vice President Operations of the commercial aircraft business at Airbus Florent Massou said there are more and more products being made and also sourced from India.

""We see a lot of opportunities... we see more and more potential in India.... many companies are ramping up their capabilities, automotive for instance... we are having a lot of discussions with them and see under which conditions they could join our club of suppliers,"" he said.

The newly established organization will manage the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry developed by IATA. CADO operates as an independent, non-profit organization based in Montreal, Canada, and is designed to ensure the transparency and traceability of SAF transactions.

According to IATA Director General Willie Walsh, the SAF Registry is a crucial market infrastructure for enabling global and transparent trade in sustainable aviation fuels. The establishment of CADO is also intended to encourage governments, fuel producers, and investors to become more involved in the SAF market. As a founding member, IATA will provide technical and operational support, while CADO will manage the registry as an independent organization.

CADO membership is open to various stakeholders, including companies in the SAF value chain, government and semi-government organizations, and other groups with an indirect interest in the use of sustainable aviation fuels. The goal is to create a consistent and verifiable basis for international trade in SAF.

The SAF Registry, developed by IATA, will enable the recording and tracking of SAF transactions in a standardized format. This is intended to help airlines and their business customers fulfill their obligations under legal requirements and voluntary climate protection programs. Participation in the SAF Registry is free of charge until April 2027.

Trump’s administration has promised to significantly scale back federal efforts to mitigate climate change, which could impact the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
Production of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has grown rapidly in recent years, driven in part by Biden administration incentives.
The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which included a tax credit for SAF production, has been frozen by Trump’s administration.
Stakeholders in the aviation industry must navigate these changes carefully, as the stakes are becoming higher.","The future of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) under United States President Donald Trump in this new year is uncertain. Trump’s administration has promised to significantly scale back federal efforts to mitigate climate change, which could impact the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Production of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has grown rapidly in recent years, driven in part by Biden administration incentives. But early moves by the Trump administration are fuelling uncertainty about what will come next in the United States and ultimately globally.

SAF is a fuel that can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks, including, but not limited to; the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks. SAF can be blended at different levels with limits between 10 percent and 50 percent, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced.

The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which included a tax credit for SAF production, has been frozen by Trump’s administration. This tax credit was crucial for the development of SAF, as it helped bridge the price gap between SAF and traditional petroleum-based fuel. The Trump administration has also removed some federal web pages related to SAF initiatives, including sites detailing the $244.5 million in grant funding the FAA allocated last year to SAF projects, according to reports.

Also, the Trump administration’s potential increase in tariffs on imported goods from China could affect the availability of non-petroleum feedstocks needed for SAF production.

Despite these challenges, some experts believe that the SAF industry could still thrive under Trump’s administration. For example, Trump’s focus on rural economic priorities could lead to an increase in corn-based ethanol production, which could be used as a feedstock for SAF.

However, the long-term outlook for SAF under Trump’s administration remains uncertain. The industry relies heavily on government incentives and support, which could be reduced or eliminated under Trump’s administration.

IATA estimates that SAF will be responsible for 65 percent of the emissions reductions that will be required for the industry to achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, also adopted by the United Nations aviation arm. It seems SAF is entering a turbulent future, with many questions arising from the uncertainty that currently clouds it around achieving net zero.

Less than four years after boldly pledging to reach net zero emissions by 2050, IATA appears to be dropping the target. Willie Walsh, IATA director general, speaking at an industry event in Phoenix, expressed strong doubts airlines could meet their emissions goals in the next 25 years. Facing a diverse audience of financiers, lessors, banks, and industry stakeholders, Walsh acknowledged for the first time that the sector is unlikely to meet its long-standing target. This admission not only marks a turning point for IATA but also calls for deep thinking about the feasibility of the aviation industry’s current sustainability plans.

The benefits of SAF point to how fundamental its production is for achieving net zero. The aviation industry accounts for 2.5 percent of global Co2 emissions, but it has contributed around four percent to global warming to date, say reports. With SAF, however, it has the potential to lower flight emissions by 80 percent, compared to conventional jet fuel. It is also a drop-in fuel, meaning there is no need for modifying aircraft or constructing new fuelling stations. SAF produces fewer harmful pollutants and contains lower levels of sulphur and aromatic components, allowing aircraft engines to burn more cleanly and generate less pollution compared to conventional fuels.

Perhaps there are indications that the ESG landscape is in a state of flux. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have officially exited the Net Zero Banking Alliance, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse around financial commitments to climate goals. Their departures signal not just a retreat from collective climate pledges but also raise questions about the future of net zero ambitions among U.S. banks.

From high-profile exits of major banks to ambitious corporate sustainability goals, the actions taken now will shape the future of responsible investing and corporate accountability. Stakeholders in the aviation industry must navigate these changes carefully, as the stakes are becoming higher.",,N,,2025-03-25 08:57:13.798315

This move by Airbus marks a step forward in the effort to make aviation more environmentally responsible.","Sustainable aviation fuel is getting a major push forward thanks to a new initiative by Airbus, which has launched a “Book and Claim” system to make SAF more accessible and scalable.

Through this model, Airbus aims to overcome existing challenges that limit the adoption of sustainable fuels, especially for smaller operators and those located far from SAF supply points.

The Book and Claim approach allows buyers to “book” a specific amount of SAF and “claim” the related emissions reductions, even if the physical fuel is used elsewhere. This system separates the sustainability benefits from the actual delivery of fuel, creating flexibility and opening the door for wider use of SAF across the aviation sector.

As part of a year-long pilot program running throughout 2025, Airbus will act as a facilitator by purchasing SAF certificates and managing them through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognized certification body. These sustainability attributes will then be resold to interested customers—ranging from aircraft to helicopter operators—helping to create short-term demand for SAF and support long-term growth.

SMBC Aviation Capital was the first company to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to support this program. Other key partners who have since confirmed their interest include AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup. Their participation reflects a growing commitment across the aviation industry to scale SAF adoption through innovative and collaborative models.

The pilot is expected to generate valuable insights into the operational capacity and effectiveness of the Book and Claim system. Airbus will use these findings to explore the potential for third-party facilitation of similar SAF solutions and gauge broader market interest.

By enabling companies to financially support SAF production and usage—even when physical access is limited—the Book and Claim method lowers the barrier to entry for operators of all sizes. This is particularly significant for smaller carriers and private aviation firms that often face logistical or economic hurdles in securing SAF for direct use.

Julien Manhes, Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals at Airbus, emphasized that this system is designed to simplify and derisk the process. By purchasing certificates upfront and distributing them when needed, Airbus aims to make SAF more viable and attractive for a broader group of stakeholders. Manhes also noted the opportunity to prove that Book and Claim is both reliable and scalable, paving the way for its adoption in both voluntary and regulatory frameworks.

This move by Airbus marks a step forward in the effort to make aviation more environmentally responsible. SAF has long been seen as one of the most promising tools to cut carbon emissions in flight, but limited supply and complex logistics have slowed progress. By decoupling sustainability benefits from fuel logistics, Airbus’s system offers a practical workaround that can help bridge the gap between current demand and future capacity.

While this pilot program is still in its early stages, its success could signal a turning point for green aviation. If the system proves reliable, it could become a cornerstone of sustainable strategies in the sector, especially as pressure mounts on the aviation industry to reduce its climate impact.

For now, the Book and Claim pilot offers a glimpse into a more inclusive and scalable future for sustainable fuel—one where geography and infrastructure no longer stand in the way of meaningful environmental action.

To learn more about Universal Fuel Technologies, please visit unifuel.tech.","To support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production goals and increase feedstock availability, Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel) has completed a successful five-month pilot project. The campaign demonstrated the effectiveness and viability of the company’s Flexiforming technology in producing SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel from various renewable feedstocks. The project was conducted at the facilities of RPD Technologies in Crosby, Texas, from August through December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, signaling readiness for the technology to scale up. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol to SAF and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) to SAF. Samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF have been thoroughly tested and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening—the initial step of the SAF certification process.

“As an industry, it’s crucial that we continue to support and explore new technologies to advance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel,” said Joshua Heyne, Director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Lab (BSEL) at Washington State University. “The capability to make aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single technology platform not only streamlines SAF production but also significantly lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible for producers and airlines.”

The pilot yielded two distinct forms of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential aromatic blend component for maintaining compatibility of paraffinic SAF with the composition of fossil kerosene, and a 100% drop-in, fully synthetic SAF that contains the correct aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International, the leading global technical standards organization. As a result, the aromatic component of SAF produced through Flexiforming, made from HEFA and FT naphtha, can be blended with the primary paraffinic SAF stream from these units. This creates the opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units, reducing the costs and complexity of the logistics and aiding in industry adoption.

“The impact of this pilot project reaches far beyond technical validation,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. “A considerable value of Flexiforming is that it contributes to making SAF fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM approved. Because of its aromatic properties, which are essential for compatibility with today’s aircraft, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT and sold directly to airlines without the need for blending with another fuel. As the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact and contain costs, technologies like Flexiforming could be crucial in scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production to keep pace with demand.”

Flexiforming provides several options for SAF production, making it especially adaptable for various renewable fuel scenarios. The pilot campaign validated ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ) production routes, offering flexibility in feedstock selection. Due to the technology’s substantially lower energy and hydrogen requirements, Unifuel estimates Flexiforming to be half the cost of current ETJ processes. Moreover, Flexiforming allows renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes to create high-value aromatic SAF that can be blended into fully synthetic drop-in-ready jet fuel.

“The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise to proceed to full certification as aviation turbine fuel,” said Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor of the BSEL at Washington State University.

Unifuel’s team has completed over a decade of research and extensive testing on its Flexiforming technology. As Unifuel transitions to the next stage, samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the campaign are being prepared for ASTM certification submission. This certification process is essential for validating the fuel's safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its viability for commercial aviation use.

Tested pathways to SAF include methanol-to-jet, ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), and renewable HEFA naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ).

In the ETJ mode, Flexiforming uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other ETJ processes, cutting processing costs by up to 50%.

To support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production goals and increase feedstock availability, Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel) has completed a successful five-month pilot project. The campaign demonstrated the effectiveness and viability of the company’s Flexiforming technology in producing SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel from various renewable feedstocks. The project was conducted at the facilities of RPD Technologies in Crosby, Texas, from August through December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, signaling readiness for the technology to scale up. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol to SAF and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) to SAF. Samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF have been thoroughly tested and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening—the initial step of the SAF certification process.

“As an industry, it’s crucial that we continue to support and explore new technologies to advance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel,” said Joshua Heyne, Director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Lab (BSEL) at Washington State University. “The capability to make aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single technology platform not only streamlines SAF production but also significantly lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible for producers and airlines.”

The pilot yielded two distinct forms of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential aromatic blend component for maintaining compatibility of paraffinic SAF with the composition of fossil kerosene, and a 100% drop-in, fully synthetic SAF that contains the correct aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International, the leading global technical standards organization. As a result, the aromatic component of SAF produced through Flexiforming, made from HEFA and FT naphtha, can be blended with the primary paraffinic SAF stream from these units. This creates the opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units, reducing the costs and complexity of the logistics and aiding in industry adoption.

“The impact of this pilot project reaches far beyond technical validation,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. “A considerable value of Flexiforming is that it contributes to making SAF fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM approved. Because of its aromatic properties, which are essential for compatibility with today’s aircraft, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT and sold directly to airlines without the need for blending with another fuel. As the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact and contain costs, technologies like Flexiforming could be crucial in scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production to keep pace with demand.”

Flexiforming provides several options for SAF production, making it especially adaptable for various renewable fuel scenarios. The pilot campaign validated ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ) production routes, offering flexibility in feedstock selection. Due to the technology’s substantially lower energy and hydrogen requirements, Unifuel estimates Flexiforming to be half the cost of current ETJ processes. Moreover, Flexiforming allows renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes to create high-value aromatic SAF that can be blended into fully synthetic drop-in-ready jet fuel.

“The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise to proceed to full certification as aviation turbine fuel,” said Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor of the BSEL at Washington State University.

Unifuel’s team has completed over a decade of research and extensive testing on its Flexiforming technology. As Unifuel transitions to the next stage, samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the campaign are being prepared for ASTM certification submission. This certification process is essential for validating the fuel's safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its viability for commercial aviation use.

From 10 to 11 March, the RAeS and IATA hosted a joint workshop on how the management of aircraft contrails can play its part in this in relation to other solutions such as eco-friendly fuels. JACK RICHARDSON reports.

Looking into the sky, eyes are regularly drawn to the tiny shapes of aircraft flying high above, in their wake, are contrails, formed when water from the combustion process freezes to form ice crystals before turning into water vapour. Although these can either be short or stretch for many miles looking harmless and perhaps even photogenic, there is a risk that they may have longer lasting environmental implications through trapping heat from the Earth in the atmosphere, leading to increased atmospheric warming. RAeS Past President 2001-2002, Professor Ian Poll has argued that through basic measures such as managing the altitude and routes of aircraft to avoid zones most likely to form contrails, the environmental impact of aviation can be significantly reduced for relatively little intervention (see AEROSPACE January 2025). In order explore these issues, the RAeS jointly hosted a workshop with IATA from 10 to 11 March, entitled ‘Contrails: From modification to avoidance to management’.

Addressing the problem

An Emirates Airbus A380 leaves long contrails in its wake, with a range of potential consequences for the environment.

Opening the event, Hemant Mistry, Director Net Zero Transition at IATA said ""there are no quick fixes,"" something that is apparent when the various options to mitigate the climate impact of aviation are examined. Managing demand for flights would have adverse impacts on the economy while solutions such as electric aircraft are not practical for long distance flights due to their limited range and small size. Also, there are well publicised issues with producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) due the costs involved (see AEROSPACE March 2025) with many of the proposed solutions yet to be produced at scale. Giving a keynote address, Stephen Barrett, Professor of Engineering at Cambridge University made the point that although aircraft designed to reduce emissions are in the process of being developed, with innovations such as the blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, these are still some time away from maturity. He added that they will take ""a generation"" to bring into service when the length of production backlogs for existing aircraft are taken into account. With these issues in mind, Marc Stettler of Imperial College London described contrail management as “lower hanging fruit” for addressing aviation emissions. With the modern technology ecosystem being key to this strategy, Dinesh Sanekommu of Google Research, said to delegates: “Hopefully, what we can be for everyone in this room is one of those grabbers that help you get the fruit or like a footstool that will help you reach what you want to reach.” Taking many different factors into account, techniques are emerging to counter the environmental impact of contrails.

Finding the contrails

If the management of contrails is to play its part in reducing climate impact, ways in which to do this will have to be trialed and perfected. An initial step is being able to observe contrails, their formation and dissipation. At a basic level, real-time observation of contrails can be achieved in some parts of the world by using cameras placed on buildings at ground level. However, companies all over the world are developing more sophisticated methods. German holiday carrier TUI performed test flights in January 2024 at first involving ten pilots, who would carry out post flight evaluations and take photographs on the contrails whilst inflight. Managing contrails requires a significant amount of data and in order to get this, SWISS has taken advantage of the data which is generated from the aircraft’s flight data recorder combined with sophisticated modelling to produce methods for its aircraft to circumvent areas where contrails are most likely to form.

Other well-known organisations working on the observation of contrails include NASA, measuring emissions from both ground and air vehicles as well as the world first use of a downward looking LIDAR in order to examine the exact structure and moisture level of contrails. Another way of monitoring contrail pattens to minimise the extent of aircraft forming them can be observation from space. The first image of a contrail from space was taken in 1975 and since then, more advanced methods have been employed to exploit this imagery, including deep learning systems from 2022. The effectiveness of this method very much depends on the type of satellite used, with those in geo-earth orbit (GEO) being able to provide a broad view due to their higher altitude, but their distance from the earth as well as the time it takes for the contrail to become visible, means information they generate can quickly become outdated. By contrast, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have the ability to observe the aircraft which produces the contrails, although these have a more narrow field of view. This is a disadvantage which can potentially be mitigated through the deployment of an LEO satellite array, such as the FireSat system Google is deploying order to monitor wildfires.

Business aviation too, is also looking at contrail management as way of reducing its climate impact, with Flexjet sustainable aviation spin-off 4AIR conducting research and integrating contrail forecasting into Flexjet long range aircraft dispatch automatically- giving pilots and dispatchers visibility of contrail areas.

Trade-offs

With a growing number of tools to monitor contrails emerging, Adrien Chabot of Amelia, a French Airline which has deployed contrail management techniques on its routes within France using an Embraer jet with plans to extend this over 2025 to 10,000 eligible flights on larger aircraft including the A320 family, delivered a message to delegates. “Come and experiment contrails mitigation with us.” Although progress has been made and the potential of contrail management to reduce emissions is attractive, questions still have to be asked about how effective and desirable they will be.

While Sian Andrews from the UK’s NATS described contrail management as: “a very small price for a large climate benefit” she sounded a note of caution about key questions that have to be asked. These are in terms of practicalities around the feasibility for a large number of airlines to alter their flight paths to manage contrails when many others are looking to do this at the same time, leading to the risk of congested airspace. On this theme, she raised the question of how any changes could increase the workload of air traffic controllers across the world, with solutions currently being focused on existing tools instead of AI. Similarly, several speakers raised the point that in order to manage the contrails produced by their aircraft, airlines could end up sending their aircraft on longer routes and therefore generating more carbon emissions. Brice Bergantz of Airbus pointed out planning for contrail management will vary according to route, with short haul flights being able to plan their whole route prior to departure, but long haul flights have to keep up-to-date with contrail conditions for the journey’s duration. As a result, Sigrun Matthes of Germany’s DLR said that fuel and time costs will have to be factored into flight plans. She showed delegates an example of planning software, in which contrail avoidance can be turned on and off at will. She stressed during her remarks however that: “we need to investigate if such eco-efficient flight trajectories are feasible.”

Trails to the future

Despite the return of notable climate change sceptic President Trump, the world is still moving towards net zero with all of the behavioural and technological change this entails. The workshop showed that managing contrails could be a potent tool in this arsenal, but it also highlighted key challenges. Examples include having the necessary information to know where contrails are as well as being able to tell when their management would be counterproductive. As with any new environmental technology in aerospace, this innovation has several trade-offs that need to be managed. With tough questions now being asked over whether SAF can help meet aviation's net zero targets, contrail management is thus becoming more important.",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26130/contrail-control-gathers-pace-header-web.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 05:56:08.734711

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC, a project to study the impact of aviation's non-CO2 emissions on Local Air Quality and Climate with a focus on contrails.
The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions.
Airbus Chief Technology Officer Sabine Klauke says, ""Addressing aviation's non-CO2 emissions is critical in our journey toward truly sustainable flight.
The PACIFIC project will quantify and measure the non-CO2 emissions emitted from various SAF compositions.","The PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) consortium gathering 11 partners from four countries has answered the Horizon Europe call for proposal on Accelerating climate neutral aviation, minimising non-CO2 emissions.

The PACIFIC project will investigate the impact of fuel composition and engine cycle on particle emissions, from laboratory tests to full-scale aircraft ground testing.

The project, funded by the European Union, started in January 2025 and will last until June 2028 with the aim of improving modelling and prediction capabilities to better assess contrail formation and the broader climate impact of aviation.

The results will support future fuel specifications and policy recommendations to minimise the environmental footprint of aviation.

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC, a project to study the impact of aviation's non-CO2 emissions on Local Air Quality and Climate with a focus on contrails. Recent studies suggest that the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) could reduce both soot particles and contrail ice crystals. However, additional information on fuel composition and its processing in the engine is necessary to better understand the effects and benefits of SAF.

PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) seeks to bridge the gap in understanding aviation’s non-CO2 emissions by testing an unprecedented range of fuels under controlled conditions. The project will ensure consistency in combustion parameters and hardware similarity from lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to full aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions. It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions. Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques. Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

By consolidating these insights, PACIFIC will contribute to a robust cost-benefit assessment of various fuel options, providing crucial inputs for potential future fuel-related regulations. The project will ultimately help define new fuel specifications aimed at reducing aviation’s climate and air quality impact while reinforcing Europe’s leadership in sustainable aeronautics.

Airbus Chief Technology Officer Sabine Klauke says, ""Addressing aviation's non-CO2 emissions is critical in our journey toward truly sustainable flight. Through collaborative science-based approaches and innovative technologies, we're committed to minimising these effects while maintaining operational efficiency. The PACIFIC project will quantify and measure the non-CO2 emissions emitted from various SAF compositions. Using an innovative ground experiment process, we will be able to replicate conditions without delay and repeat them if needed. We look forward to the results of this multi-year project.""

Since its introduction, this pioneering technology has redefined approach operations, delivering remarkable environmental benefits and operational efficiencies that have set a new standard for the aviation industry.

TBS dynamically adjusts the spacing between arriving aircraft based on time rather than distance. This intelligent approach has been instrumental in reducing the need for extended airborne holding, saving fuel and cutting carbon emissions and improving on time performance.

Since its introduction for Heathrow in 2015, TBS has achieved remarkable results, cutting headwind delays by 62%, reducing airborne holding by 1,500,000 minutes – the equivalent of almost three years of holding time – and saving over 100,000 tonnes of fuel, worth approximately $70 million based on current jet fuel prices. Additionally, TBS has saved over 300,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, contributing to a more sustainable aviation industry.

The success of TBS is a testament to the power of collaboration between industry leaders. Originally developed and delivered by NATS and Leidos for Heathrow Airport, the technology has set a benchmark for airport arrivals management worldwide, inspiring the adoption at other major airports across the globe as part of the Intelligent Approach toolset.

Chris Norsworthy, NATS Director Airspace and Future Operations, said: “Time Based Separation is a great example of how technology can transform air traffic management. By working closely with Heathrow and Leidos, we pioneered and delivered a solution that benefits passengers, airlines, and the environment. We’re incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved together.”

Beyond its environmental benefits, TBS has delivered substantial economic savings. By reducing the time aircraft spend holding, TBS has delivered cost savings for airlines. Based on an estimate of €100 per minute for the operational costs associated with extended flight times - as per a 2015 Eurocontrol study - airlines have saved an estimated €184 million since TBS was introduced.

Dale Reeson, Heathrow Director of Airside and Airspace Operations, said: “Time-Based Separation has been a game-changer for Heathrow. For airlines, it has unlocked major efficiencies, cutting fuel consumption and costs. For passengers, it has meant smoother, more reliable journeys. And for us, it has enabled Heathrow to be more resilient while reducing our environmental impact. TBS is a perfect example of how innovation can deliver benefits for everyone.”

The success of TBS as part of Intelligent Approach demonstrates the potential for advanced air traffic management solutions to deliver significant benefits for the aviation industry and the environment. As the industry continues to evolve, NATS and Leidos remain committed to driving innovation and enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of air travel.

The organization’s mandate is to operate the SAF Registry as an independent entity, distinct from IATA, to ensure credibility, transparency, and inclusivity across the SAF value chain.
The SAF Registry, a key infrastructure component in IATA’s decarbonization strategy, will allow aviation stakeholders to track and verify SAF production and consumption globally.
Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, shared his perspective on the initiative’s importance: “The SAF Registry is indispensable in building a transparent, global market for SAF.
By involving a wide range of stakeholders, CADO aims to ensure that the global SAF market is built on shared principles and international cooperation.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced the establishment of the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), a new entity tasked with managing the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry. This move aims to drive the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts by establishing a transparent and efficient framework to support the global adoption of SAF, which is a key component in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

CADO’s creation marks a pivotal moment in IATA’s broader strategy to accelerate sustainability in the aviation sector.

The organization’s mandate is to operate the SAF Registry as an independent entity, distinct from IATA, to ensure credibility, transparency, and inclusivity across the SAF value chain.

The registry will play a crucial role in developing a liquid and transparent global market for SAF, fostering trust and enabling stakeholders from governments to fuel producers and investors to engage in SAF production and use.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, emphasized the significance of this initiative. “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its role is critical in managing the registry with an open, global approach that supports scrutiny from all stakeholders. The door is open for any entity within the SAF value chain to join CADO, including governments. This inclusive model is crucial in harmonizing the principles that govern SAF registries worldwide,” she said.

The SAF Registry, a key infrastructure component in IATA’s decarbonization strategy, will allow aviation stakeholders to track and verify SAF production and consumption globally. This transparency will help drive confidence in SAF as a viable, scalable alternative to conventional jet fuel. CADO’s leadership in managing the registry will help the industry meet the ambitious goal of ramping up SAF production to significant levels, a necessary step to reduce the aviation sector’s overall carbon emissions.

Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, shared his perspective on the initiative’s importance: “The SAF Registry is indispensable in building a transparent, global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to launching the registry and establishing CADO as its manager should encourage governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage more vigorously in the SAF market. Our common goal is to significantly increase SAF production, and the structure we are creating with CADO is a vital step forward in advancing aviation decarbonization.”

As the aviation industry navigates the path toward sustainability, the SAF Registry will serve as a critical tool to ensure the transparent and efficient scaling of SAF. By involving a wide range of stakeholders, CADO aims to ensure that the global SAF market is built on shared principles and international cooperation.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented: We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery.
Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power.
“Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF.
We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.","Farnborough Airport, the Birthplace of British Aviation and Europe’s leading airport for premium air travel connectivity, has today announced that it has signed a landmark deal with Hydrogen Refinery for 12.5 million litres or 10,000 tonnes per annum of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) produced locally from waste.

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates taking effect at the start of this year, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly being put at risk by the lack of production and investment within the UK.

The UK and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025 and also the way that SAF must be produced in the future. This is to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support the required growth in SAF production without incentivising farmers to switch from growing food to growing SAF feedstocks. SAF today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids), however Hydrogen Refinery’s ground-breaking technology is able to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented:

We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery.

“Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s own target of 10% by 2030. What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the UK.

He went on to comment:

The transition to new fuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen.

“Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller-modern aircraft which we handle and the significant economic value of the flights we support. As a local company, Hydrogen Refinery exemplify the deep-rooted technological capabilities of the companies which form part of Farnborough Airport’s aeronautical research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership which will generate significant local inward investment and will reinforce our ambitions to become a Global Sustainability Showcase for Airports around the world.”

This news follows a series of successful milestones in recent years at the Airport. In 2024, Farnborough Airport was awarded Level 4+carbon accreditation status by the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) scheme, one of only five UK airports and the only business aviation airport to achieve such recognition. Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power. In 2022, for a two-week trial period in the lead up to the Farnborough International Airshow, Farnborough Airport became the first airport in the world to offer SAF at the same price as standard Jet A1 fuel, after it took a major step in driving the adoption of SAF by offering it to all customers the year prior. Also in 2022, Farnborough Airport made a commitment to be Net Zero by 2030 or sooner for emissions within its control, setting one of the most ambitious targets in the aviation industry.

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, commented:

We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling.

“Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF. This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill. We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.

This new entity was created to manage the IATA-developed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry once it is released.

IATA senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said: “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

IATA director-general Willie Walsh added: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonization forward.”

What exactly is CADO?

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations.

CADO membership is open to organisations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain, or that represent any association or group of participants in the SAF value chain; states or quasi-state organisations with a direct interest in the operations and benefit of the SAF Registry; and related interest groups indirectly benefitting from SAF deployed in the aviation system.

The SAF Registry that CADO will take charge of helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply which is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally.

The Registry will do this by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location.

In addition, it gives access to airlines’ corporate customers to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2025/03/01d01186-iata-saf-registry.jpeg,N,,2025-03-25 00:57:03.828421

Indonesia is accelerating its efforts to embrace clean energy and electric vehicle (EV) technologies, forging stronger partnerships with South Korea to meet its environmental goals. The country aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 31.89% by 2030 and its growing collaboration with South Korean companies is seen as a key factor in achieving these targets.

Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto met with the Vice President of and President of an advanced materials company. The discussions aimed to explore new investment opportunities and expand technology-sharing agreements. The meeting focused on enhancing the cooperation between the two countries in the clean energy and EV sectors. The company is a global leader in battery technology and has already played a significant role in Indonesia’s EV ecosystem and both parties expressed their commitment to strengthening this collaboration.

Minister Hartarto emphasised the significance of ongoing international support for Indonesia’s green energy initiatives. His remarks underscored the government’s commitment to strengthening partnerships that drive the development of the EV ecosystem and clean energy sector, reinforcing Indonesia’s position as a key player in the global transition to sustainable technologies.

Despite challenges in the global EV industry, such as declining demand, discussions highlighted Indonesia’s strong potential for growth in this sector. The country’s abundant natural resources, skilled workforce and supportive policies were noted as key advantages. Emphasis was placed on Indonesia’s strategic importance in the green industry, reinforcing its role in the broader transition to sustainable technologies and its expanding presence in the global EV battery supply chain.

A major highlight of the partnership is the ongoing development of an EV battery cell factory in Karawang, West Java. The factory is being built in two phases. The first phase, which has a capacity of 10 gigawatt-hours (GWh), was completed in 2024. The second phase, which will expand the facility’s capacity to 20 GWh, is currently under construction. This factory is part of a larger collaboration and it is expected to play a key role in providing batteries for the growing EV market in Indonesia and beyond.

In addition to its work in the EV sector, the company has proposed further collaborations in areas such as biodegradable plastics. These innovations could help Indonesia reduce plastic waste and improve sustainability. This aligns with Indonesia’s broader sustainability goals, as the country is looking to expand its clean energy solutions across various industries.

Minister Hartarto welcomed the proposal, emphasising Indonesia’s openness to attracting investment in a variety of clean energy projects. The government is eager to tap into new technologies that can help address the environmental challenges the country faces.

One of the most promising initiatives discussed during the meeting was the potential to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using Indonesia’s abundant palm oil resources. Indonesia’s vast palm oil plantations position it as a leader in the production of SAF, which could significantly reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint.

The company, which has already developed SAF production capabilities in South Korea, expressed a strong interest in collaborating with Indonesia to develop this alternative fuel. Such advancements could enhance energy security while reducing emissions in aviation.

Indonesia and South Korea are positioning themselves at the forefront of global efforts to combat climate change while advancing the green economy. These collaborations provide not only technological advancements but also a pathway to a more sustainable, low-carbon future.

As Indonesia continues to drive its green transition, its global partnerships, particularly in the areas of clean energy and EV technology, will be crucial.

In addition to the 60% reduction in UCO exports experienced in December, the GAIN report indicates that the China’s UCO market slowed further in February due to declining order numbers and prices, traffic congestion and logistics delays.
Despite China’s sluggish domestic UCO market, international demand for UCO has reached unprecedented levels, according to the report.","China’s exports of used cooking oil (UCO) reached a record high in 2024 but fell sharply in December after the Chinese government eliminated the 13% export tax rebate for UCO, according to a report filed with the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service’ Global Agricultural Information Network.

The U.S. was the top export market for Chinese UCO in 2024, at 1.27 million tons. That volume is up approximately 52% when compared to 2023, accounting for 43% of China’s total UCO exports in 2024. The country’s total UCO exports, however, fell by 60% between November and December after the government of China eliminated a 13% export tax rebate on UCO.

The elimination of the UCO export tax rebate was announced on Nov. 15, 2024, and became effective Dec. 1, 2024. According to a November 2024 GAIN report, the policy shift aimed to redirect China’s biobased diesel industry from an export-focused model to a more domestically oriented industry. The change is also expected to create export opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in China, as the European Union provisionally excluded SAF from proposed antidumping duties in July 2024.

The policy shift triggered immediate changes in UCO pricing, according to the report. Leading Chinese UCO producers set initial December and January contract prices at $1,000 to $1,050 per metric ton, an increase of $100 to $150 over previous rates.

In addition to the 60% reduction in UCO exports experienced in December, the GAIN report indicates that the China’s UCO market slowed further in February due to declining order numbers and prices, traffic congestion and logistics delays. According to the report, many UCO traders are reluctant to sell at lower prices and are minimizing purchases to avoid losses from price fluctuations.

Despite China’s sluggish domestic UCO market, international demand for UCO has reached unprecedented levels, according to the report. The current domestic market slump in China is expected to be temporary, as growing international demand and tightening domestic supplies lead to a market rebound.

A full copy of the report is available on the USDA FAS GAIN website.

But in an increasingly competitive environment, can European carriers keep pace with the rise of Middle Eastern and Asian cargo hubs?

Global air cargo demand has been in flux since the pandemic, with new trade corridors emerging and geopolitical uncertainties reshaping supply chains. While Asia-to-Europe routes remain a dominant force, new markets like India and Vietnam are growing rapidly, requiring airlines to adapt their networks.

“Trade is becoming more diverse, and airfreight markets are evolving,” said Lufthansa Cargo.

“We see strong growth in Southeast Asia, and to remain competitive, European cargo hubs must ensure they are well-positioned to handle these shifts efficiently.”

This diversification is reflected in Lufthansa Cargo’s 29 percent increase in freighter capacity to Asia during the last peak season, with new stations added in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou to support the e-commerce boom. However, the question remains—will Europe continue to lead global air cargo, or is it at risk of losing its stronghold?

e-commerce revolution

The rise of e-commerce-driven air freight has been one of the most significant shifts in recent years. The need for rapid delivery times has increased demand for dedicated freighter capacity, particularly from Asia.

Airlines must adapt to the fast-paced nature of e-commerce logistics, ensuring long-term capacity commitments and flexible charter options. However, with passenger flights returning to full capacity, the balance between freighters and belly cargo remains a delicate challenge.

“We’re seeing increased demand for long-term capacity commitments, particularly from e-commerce customers,” Lufthansa Cargo’s representative added.

“Adjusting our freighter network accordingly is essential to maintaining efficiency.”

While dedicated freighters offer greater control over cargo operations, belly capacity remains a crucial part of European carriers’ strategies.

However, the industry is facing yield pressures, with Lufthansa Cargo reporting only a 3 percent increase in cargo yield in 2024, a sign that post-pandemic peak freight rates are now stabilising.

AI and automation

European cargo hubs have long been criticised for inefficiencies, particularly in handling times and operational bottlenecks, addressing this by embracing automation and AI, positioning itself at the forefront of digital transformation in air cargo.

A pilot project launched in the autumn of 2024 saw autonomous tow vehicles (AGVs) introduced in Frankfurt, transporting freight between buildings without human intervention. Meanwhile, AI-driven automation has reduced response times in Lufthansa Cargo’s customer service centres, with 40 percent of inquiries now handled automatically.

“Automation and AI are not just about efficiency—they are about resilience.”

“As the industry faces a growing skills shortage, digitalisation will play a key role in ensuring smooth operations and reducing delays.”

Additionally, Lufthansa Cargo is supporting the push towards IATA’s ONE Record initiative, which aims to create a standardised, open data-sharing framework for air freight. If fully implemented, such initiatives could revolutionise cargo visibility and tracking, eliminating inefficiencies caused by fragmented data systems.

Despite digitalisation and network expansion, the biggest challenge for European cargo carriers remains sustainability. With net-zero targets looming, airlines are under increasing pressure to reduce emissions and invest in cleaner technologies.

Lufthansa Cargo has committed to halving net CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieving full carbon neutrality by 2050. However, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption remains limited due to high costs and restricted availability.

“Our biggest CO2-saving potential lies in the air,” stated Lufthansa Cargo.

“Sustainable aviation fuel and fleet modernisation are critical, but the reality is that the industry needs broader collaboration to make SAF scalable and commercially viable.”

xThe airline has already transitioned its entire freighter fleet to Boeing 777Fs, the most fuel-efficient aircraft in its category. It also has seven Boeing 777-8 freighters on order, which promise further emission reductions. However, with SAF still making up a small fraction of overall fuel use in aviation, sustainability remains one of the biggest hurdles for Europe’s air cargo industry.

Investing in the future

As European cargo hubs face rising competition from the Middle East and Asia, investment in infrastructure modernisation is seen as a key differentiator.

Lufthansa Cargo is investing €600 million into modernising its Frankfurt hub through the LCCevo project, aimed at boosting efficiency, reducing handling times, and expanding digital capabilities. The 330,000m² Lufthansa Cargo Center will undergo phased upgrades to minimise disruption while enhancing operational capabilities.

The development has been welcomed as attempts are being made to reduce the carbon emissions of the aviation sector.

But not all experts are as enthusiastic about the focus on so-called “eco-fuels” or “e-fuels” which are synthetic sustainable aviation fuels produced from fossil-free electricity and recycled carbon dioxide.

How to fly green

“There’s a collection of sectors such as aviation, long-distance maritime shipping, chemical industry, steel production. Making these sectors sustainable is not as easy as for other sectors, where you can just directly apply electrification,” chemical engineer Maartje Feenstra tells Cosmos. Feenstra is a senior research consultant at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures in Australia.

“For instance, batteries are not viable technical solutions for airplanes,” she continues. “They don’t provide the right energy density. So that means that for aviation, we have a limited amount of technical possibilities for the energy transition. That means we have to rely on sustainable aviation fuels.”

University of Adelaide researcher Tracey Dodd is an expert on energy policy. She says in an interview with Cosmos that she believes the aviation industry is trying to lobby for the right policy environments for sustainable fuels.

“But I think even with the best projections, it’s only going to be 1% of fuel globally,” she says. “That’s a drop in the ocean. How can we say we have this sustainable aviation revolution?”

She says that the technology exists for the transition to sustainable fuel sources.

“There are a number of synthetic biofuels that can be used in existing aircraft, so they don’t need to change the fuels. … There’s also algae which has huge potential, but costs more because that feedstock can be used in other things, like pharmaceutical products. And there are new pathways that scientists are exploring, like hydrogen and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels,” she says.

“So every day we have a new innovation. The problem is scaling it up.”

What is sustainably produced aviation fuel?

The European Union (EU) roadmap for sustainable aviation fuels says these fuels will make up 2% of the supply in Europe by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050.

“The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,” says Roland Dittmeyer from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany.

“Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable,” Dittmeyer adds.

Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernicus P2X project that announced advances in sustainable fuel production last week.

KIT, along with industrial partner Sunfire, say they have used water vapor and CO2 co-electrolysis technology to produce synthetic kerosene at a scale that could be used industrially.

“It’s nice to see this technology scaling up and getting sort of demonstration volumes,” says Feenstra, who is not involved in Kopernicus P2X.

Sunfire and KIT say this is a world first. Their “syngas” – a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are converted into long-chain hydrocarbons called “syncrude” – has a 220-kilowatt (kW) output.

A Boeing 777’s twin-jet engines have a total power output of about 130,000 kW.

“Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step,” says Hubertus Richter, senior engineer at Sunfire. “Up to 85% of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.”

“In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,” Richter says. “This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.”

Feenstra helps illustrate Kopernicus P2X’s output another way: “With a daily production of 300 L of syncrude, it would still take 796 days (over 2 years) to fill up a Boeing 747-400. For the next envisioned production of a tonne a day it would still take slightly over half a year to fill up a Boeing 747-400.”

So there’s some way to go yet.

A problem of soaring costs

“The challenge for the aviation industry is that the renewable fuels are more expensive than the normal fuel set. … The more sustainable aviation fuel we require, the more that price difference is going to hurt you,” Feenstra says. “If we want to make aviation sustainable, we’ll have to enable these fuels in one way or another.”

Dodd has been outspoken in her concerns about “flight shame” – the guilt caused by being a passenger on a CO2 emitting aircraft. While scientists have raised concerns about global tourism emissions, Dodd says we need to consider ways of tackling the issues collectively.

She says that people “shouldn’t necessarily have to stop doing what we love doing and what makes the world tick. We just need to be really innovative about how we can move forward. And in innovation, research shows us the only way you can move forward is if you understand the problem. And I think don’t talk about aviation enough.”

“It is a sector that’s really hard to abate, and everyone I know in that sector is really committed to it. I really want to support and encourage that work. And I know how hard it is, because I work in the renewable energy sector, that we do have to focus on decarbonising the electricity system in Australia.”

Feenstra says that conversations around sustainable aviation fuels in Australia tend to be based around biofuel alternatives.

Dodd says that one way forward would be to encourage businesses and universities that require long-distance travel to function to invest in sustainable aviation fuels.

“I think just even businesses being aware of and paying attention to how impacted their supply chain is by aviation and how for us to move forward, that perhaps they could be supporting and partnering the the airlines to scale up commercial availability of sustainable aviation field,” she says.

“You want to make sure that that we’re doing this in a way that is economically sensitive, and then it’s not going to price certain people out of the market to fly, or price certain people out of the market of things like flowers or coffee that we ship.”",https://cosmosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-172190964.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 15:56:08.378733

Large global technology companies have become the main buyers of renewable energy to power their data centers and operations.
The DeepSeek announcement surprised many in the industry, leading to initial market volatility in the renewable power sector.
About 30 countries—ranging from sophisticated economies to developing nations—are considering, planning or starting nuclear power programs.
Renewables are expected to one day deliver enough capacity to meet electricity demand peaks and provide critical grid-stabilizing and ancillary services.","The global demand for electricity is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, outpacing prior forecasts and reshaping the energy landscape. Driving this surge are large corporations looking for reliable, low-cost energy solutions. Enter renewables, the cheapest source of bulk power in most regions of the world.

As a result, renewable power is playing a leading role in the “any and all” approach to increase generation capacity. Two decades from now, annual energy transition and grid investments must reach $7.8 trillion—a 3.7x increase from today’s annual investment—to achieve net zero (see Figure 1). For investors, we believe that renewables offer both immense growth potential and attractive risk-adjusted returns with embedded downside mitigation.

While some recent developments have caused some volatility in the renewable power industry—including shifting U.S. policy and the implications for a new artificial intelligence (AI) model from DeepSeek—they also have positive implications for energy and renewables demand that we believe markets have not priced in. Investors who focus on the lowest-cost, most mature renewable power and transition technologies—which are experiencing the greatest demand from corporate customers and are not reliant on government subsidies—are best positioned to benefit in the current environment, in our view.

Corporations are the single largest driving force behind this increasing demand for renewables. Large global technology companies have become the main buyers of renewable energy to power their data centers and operations. That, along with the electrification of a wide range of industries, has resulted in a 12-fold increase in corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) volumes since 2016.1 Today, corporate demand from these “hyperscalers” is exceeding, by far, the renewable projects that are available to supply it.

For example, Microsoft and Brookfield announced in May 2024 the signing of a global renewable energy framework agreement to contribute to Microsoft’s goal of having 100% of its electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030.2 The agreement provides a pathway for Brookfield to deliver over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity between 2026 and 2030 in the U.S. and Europe, and the scope could potentially expand to deliver additional renewable energy capacity within the U.S. and Europe, and beyond to other regions.

This corporate demand is mobilizing at dizzying speeds. In 2023, Amazon achieved its goal of matching 100% of the electricity it consumed across its operations with renewable energy, seven years ahead of its original 2030 goal; Meta is matching its electricity use with 100% renewable energy and has set a net-zero goal across its value chain by 2030; and Google aims to achieve net-zero targets across all of its operations and value chains by 2030 by reducing its emissions by 50% and investing in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize its remaining emissions.3,4,5

These hyperscalers have committed to the most aggressive decarbonization targets across businesses in different sectors—and the fastest and easiest way to get there is through renewable power. But here’s the bottom line: Regardless of net-zero targets, companies will seek to secure as much renewable power as they can simply because it’s the cheapest.

The Race to Power Data Centers

AI is poised to transform every industry worldwide, fueling explosive growth in data center construction to compute and store the enormous volume of data created. Global data center power demand is expected to rise 15-fold by the end of this decade.

But access to power in high demand regions is increasingly the bottleneck hindering data center and AI development. Businesses are now ramping up their efforts to lock in supply to ensure they can achieve their growth targets—and they are looking to power all these new data centers with renewables.

Recently, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made headlines with the news that its advanced models reportedly achieved comparable results to leading U.S.-based AI labs while using less-expensive hardware, less computing power and less energy. The DeepSeek announcement surprised many in the industry, leading to initial market volatility in the renewable power sector. Yet, AI implementation was never expected to be linear, and AI deployment will continue to require significantly more computing power and energy for inference and model training than is currently available, in our view.

If DeepSeek and other models emerge to make AI cheaper, it will likely accelerate AI adoption for training and inference models, robotics and other promising technologies. In other words, cheaper AI is likely to spur more demand for AI—and subsequently more power. We view this as positive for continued long-term demand for data centers and new energy infrastructure.

Also, it’s important to remember that the expected increase in electricity demand is due to much more than just data centers—industry, buildings, transport and other sectors are all demanding more power (see Figure 3).

Clean Energy Solutions Are Stepping Up to the Plate

Solar has made incredible leaps and is on course to be the largest source of generating capacity for electricity by mid-2035. To put it in perspective, back in 2004, it took an entire year for solar sources to produce a gigawatt of power. Now it takes just half a day. But electricity grids always need to be balanced between supply and demand—and while sunshine and wind are plentiful and free, they’re not available 24/7.

Companies need access to stable, consistent baseload power. To complement wind and power, they require a diverse range of decarbonization solutions to mitigate the intermittency challenges from traditional renewable sources and to decarbonize hard-to-abate areas of their business. These decarbonization solutions are at various stages of scaling, ranging from well-established technologies like wind, solar and large-scale nuclear to rapidly maturing options such as batteries and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). And over the longer term, technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs), microreactors and hydrogen show a lot of promise.

But today, three technologies are making notable strides: nuclear, batteries and SAF.

Nuclear

Currently, nuclear is the only commercially viable provider of baseload carbon-free power. Over time, technological advances, shifting public sentiment, the need among governments for energy security and increasing corporate demand have resulted in a nuclear industry resurgence.

Indeed, several global technology players have recently announced plans to restart or enable the development of nuclear capacity. For example, Microsoft signed an agreement in 2024 to restart the Palisades reactor in Michigan, which had been decommissioned in 2022, to serve its data center footprint. And Meta announced that it is seeking up to 4 GW of new nuclear power to help meet its AI and sustainability objectives.6 Hyperscalers need reliable, low-cost, stable baseload solutions at scale—and they are increasingly looking to a small number of trusted partners to deliver what they need, where they need it and when they need it.

These tailwinds have resulted in life extensions for an increasing number of existing nuclear reactors as well as renewed interest from federal and local governments expanding nuclear power by building new plants. About 30 countries—ranging from sophisticated economies to developing nations—are considering, planning or starting nuclear power programs.

Looking ahead into the next decade, advances in SMRs and microreactors are opening up new possibilities for nuclear power applications—particularly for behind-the-meter and off-the-grid use by industrials, technology and mining companies, as well as remote communities. These innovative solutions are not only more flexible and scalable but also offer enhanced safety features. The development of long-duration energy storage systems further complements nuclear power, making it an even more attractive option for meeting future energy needs. While full-scale deployment is still several years out, we expect small-scale nuclear to form part of the long-term energy solution.

Battery prices have dropped dramatically over the past few years, following a trajectory similar—but faster—than what we saw with solar. This was mainly due to improving technology, economies of scale, market dynamics and a fall in prices of critical battery metals like lithium, cobalt and nickel. For example, lithium carbonate prices fell from a high of approximately $70,000 per metric ton to well below $15,000 in 2024.7 Batteries now also require less time to plan and install than solar and wind systems (see Figure 4).

Renewables are expected to one day deliver enough capacity to meet electricity demand peaks and provide critical grid-stabilizing and ancillary services. Batteries will play a crucial role in achieving that, making energy production more efficient and creating value for renewable platforms. Today, growth in both solar and batteries is breaking records,9 a trend we expect to continue over the next decade.

Sustainable aviation fuel

SAF is considered one of the only viable near- and medium-term pathways to decarbonize the hard-to-abate long-haul air transport sector. It is produced by combining hydrogen generated from renewable electricity with captured carbon dioxide. It is considered a “drop-in” fuel, meaning the same jet engines can operate on either SAF or traditional jet fuel or a mixture of both. Crucially, it enables a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions relative to the same volume of conventional jet fuel.10

Similar to solar and wind, SAF is a proven technology seeing increasing demand from airlines and corporations seeking long-term take-or-pay contracts to secure supply to meet their net-zero targets and regulatory requirements. SAF benefits from significant policy tailwinds contributing to the supply demand. For example, under RefuelEU, a component of the European Union Green Deal, all planes refueling at European airports must use a blend containing a minimum percentage of SAF starting this year.

SAF is at the point where both the technology and the commercial uses are ready to go—and the tailwinds in this sector are strong. Fourteen airlines, controlling half of the market for jet fuel, have SAF targets,11 suggesting strong long-term demand for this technology. According to a study by the World Economic Forum and Kearney,12 global SAF demand is expected to reach 17 million tonnes per year by 2030, about 5% of total jet fuel consumption. By the end of 2024, production capacity was expected to be 4.4 million tonnes per year, with an additional 6.9 million tonnes per year expected from new refineries and facility expansions. However, to meet 2030 demand, an extra 5.8 million tonnes of production capacity is needed by 2026.

The Effects of Shifting U.S. Policy

The new U.S. administration has introduced some market uncertainty around renewables. However, we believe fundamentals for power remain exceptionally strong and we expect demand to continue to outpace supply, driving growth in required energy capacity—regardless of what happens in Washington.

Today, demand for clean power is driven by a “corporate pull” due to its position as the lowest-cost form of bulk power in most markets, which will continue to support new and existing projects. Certain industries, such as U.S. offshore wind, wind on federal land, and electric vehicles, will likely be affected by U.S. policy changes, but most technologies will not. In our experience, focusing on low-cost renewable power and decarbonization technologies and high-growth regions allows developers to mitigate impacts on their businesses from regulatory or subsidy changes.

The U.S. has indicated that it will take an “all of the above” approach to providing energy and solidifying its energy dominance. Given how integrated renewables are in the energy mix, they will continue to supply domestic energy as well as support exports of any potential surplus in the country’s oil production. With respect to fully repealing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), we still feel it would be difficult because not all Republican lawmakers support such a drastic step. The IRA has generated significant investment in new clean energy projects while creating a meaningful number of jobs, directly benefiting Republican states.

While shifting U.S. policy does introduce some (manageable) risks into the renewable power sector, we believe that other positive developments have captured less attention in the markets. For example, the new administration is expected to drive significant growth in U.S. industries through its focus on manufacturing and data center development. This would likely generate incremental power needs on top of the already significant demand growth and supply-demand fundamentals that we are seeing today. The “any and all” approach in the U.S. will benefit renewables, as the lowest-cost source of power, as well as other forms of generation such as gas and nuclear.

The aviation industry is considered as one of the hard-to-abate sectors in the green transformation, and sustainable aviation fuels are required by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, starting with a 2 % quota in 2025 and aiming for 70 % SAF in all EU airports from 2050. The BioTJet project is based on the E-BioTfueL concept, which combines biomass eligible to produce advanced biofuels (RED EU definition), and green or low-carbon hydrogen eligible to produce renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RED EU Definition, also called e-fuels). The technology brings proven process building blocks which have been developed and tested in a semi-industrial plant from 2010 to 2021 by the Bionext consortium consisting of Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies nouvelles, Total Energies and thyssenkrupp Uhde.

The PRENFLO® gasification technology is part of thyssenkrupp’s Decarbon Technologies portfolio and will contribute to the sustainable production of biomass-based synthetic products, including methanol, hydrogen, and SAF. With its origins in the Koppers-Totzek process, the PRENFLO® technology has been continuously refined to meet evolving industry needs. It is known for its robustness and flexibility, capable of handling a wide range of feedstocks.

Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy: “After thoroughly examining the available and bankable technologies, we are now more convinced than ever that we have made the right choice for our project with the E-BioTfueL concept and the technology partners involved to provide cost-competitive SAF and naphtha to the market by 2030 and contribute to address climate change.”

Nadja Håkansson, CEO of thyssenkrupp Uhde: “We are proud to see how the E-BioTfueL concept – which includes our advanced PRENFLO® technology – has now turned into a first commercial Biomass-to-SAF application in the European Community. The collaboration with our French partners underscores our commitment to driving the green transformation and delivering sustainable value to our customers and stakeholders.”",https://www.chemengonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ce-sm-logo-400x400-sb.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 13:56:44.758560

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, shared her thoughts:

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

Later, Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, continued:

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping up SAF production is the common goal, and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonisation forward.”

What is expected from CADO ?

CADO is a not-for-profit Canadian corporation established in Montreal. As a founding member, IATA will provide technical assistance and operational services to CADO on a regular basis. The company is prepared to:

Organisations operating in or supporting the SAF value chain and also organisations or groups affiliated with SAF stakeholders.

States or pseudo-state actors who have direct stakes in the SAF Registry’s operations and profits.

Interest groups indirectly benefiting from deployment in sustainable aviation fuel.

About the SAF Registry

IATA is developing the SAF Registry as a global system to standardise and transparently record SAF transactions. The system ensures that the environmental value of SAF is accurately recorded and allocated in the SAF value chain for airlines and corporate buyers so they can meet regulatory obligations and take advantage of voluntary decarbonisation schemes.

The SAF Registry is designed to mitigate the obstacle of limited availability of SAF by aggregating airlines, SAF suppliers and manufacturers together regardless of location. It also enables corporate customers to contribute toward funding in-sector emissions reductions by co-funding decarbonisation.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will transition to a cost-recovery model.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tall27vc-web.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 12:56:10.280642

CADO’s Role and Membership

CADO is officially incorporated as a not-for-profit organization based in Montreal, Canada. As the founding member, IATA will continue to play an integral role in CADO’s operations, providing essential technical support and contributing to its ongoing development. Membership in CADO is open to a variety of organizations, including those directly involved in the SAF value chain, governmental bodies with an interest in SAF operations, and other groups indirectly benefiting from the broader environmental impacts of SAF in the aviation industry.

The SAF Registry: Tracking Sustainability in Aviation

The SAF Registry, which is poised for launch, will serve as a global platform to record and track SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent manner. This system aims to address the complexities associated with SAF supply, which is currently limited and geographically restricted. By connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, the registry will facilitate greater access to sustainable fuel options, regardless of location, and will enable airlines to track the environmental benefits of SAF as they move through the value chain.

Supporting Regulatory Compliance and Voluntary Sustainability Goals

In addition to supporting regulatory compliance, the SAF Registry will also allow airlines and corporate customers to claim emissions reductions against voluntary sustainability commitments. This feature is particularly valuable as companies seek to co-finance the cost of decarbonization and contribute to a more sustainable aviation sector.

Free Participation Until 2027

To ensure accessibility, participation in the SAF Registry will be free of charge until April 2027. After this period, the registry will transition to a cost-recovery model, ensuring its long-term sustainability while continuing to provide a vital service to the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

Conclusion: Empowering a Sustainable Aviation Future

By supporting the development of the SAF Registry and empowering a wide range of stakeholders, CADO plays a key role in the global push towards reducing aviation’s carbon footprint and advancing sustainable fuel solutions.

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO.

SAF Registry Run by Civil Aviation Decarbonization

Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has established the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) to manage the IATA-developed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry when it is released.

""CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate,"" said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

""The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry's commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonization forward,"" said Willie Walsh, IATA's Director General.

About CADO

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations. CADO membership is open to:

Use of SAF instead of conventional jet fuel could cut aviation carbon emissions by up to 80%. IATA’s SAF Registry will be a global system for the transparent and standardised recording of SAF transactions. This will ensure that SAF’s environmental benefits can be tracked across its value chain, enabling airlines and corporate customers to claim against both compulsory obligations and voluntary schemes. It will also connect airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, all across the world.

The industry may not yet be ready to take on hydrogen-powered aviation—but Airbus is clearly determined to help it take flight.","Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury has doubled down on his belief that hydrogen is the future of aviation, but he admits the path forward is more complex than initially anticipated.

Speaking at the Airbus Summit 2025, Faury reflected on the evolving trajectory of the aviation industry, which he described as entering its “fourth transformation.” He outlined how the industry had evolved from simply achieving flight to becoming safe, then affordable, and now sustainable.

Making aviation sustainable

“We want to make it sustainable,” said Faury. “Because of its success—being a mode of transport that is safe, that is affordable—the impact on the global CO₂ emissions is 2–3%. It’s a sort of victim of its success.”

One of the critical elements in that transformation, according to Faury, is hydrogen. “It’s a very personal conviction,” he stated. “Hydrogen has a role to play. It is the energy of the future.”

Airbus launched its ZEROe hydrogen aircraft project more than five years ago, aiming to pave the way toward zero-emission aviation. While technological progress has been encouraging, Faury shared an update, “We’ve learned that we can develop and manufacture a hydrogen plane that works—a commercial aeroplane that works. [But] the competitiveness of such a plane would not be good enough to compete with others.”

Is hydrogen the solution?

Key barriers remain, including a lack of regulatory support and the absence of a green hydrogen production ecosystem. “We don’t have the development of decarbonised hydrogen at scale for when we need the plane to enter into service,” Faury added.

Still, Airbus isn’t backing down. “We continue to believe in hydrogen. We’re absolutely convinced that hydrogen is an energy for the future of aviation,” he emphasised. “But there’s just more work to be done—more work for purpose, more work for the others around us to bring that energy to something that is at scale, that is competitive, and that will lead to success.”

As the aviation industry charts a course toward decarbonisation, Airbus is urging governments, industry partners, and innovators to accelerate the development of hydrogen infrastructure and regulatory frameworks.

IATA said that the establishment of the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) would “turbo-charge the imminent launch” of the SAF Registry, which will track the emissions reductions from the use of what the airline industry calls “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF).

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, added: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent and liquid global market for SAF.

“The industry’s commitment to build the registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigour.”

Such a cheap valuation often signals that investors might overlook the company, which presents a potential buying opportunity.

However, before betting on a stock, we need to check its fundamentals to justify its investment potential.

OMVKY’s Strategic Expansion in Sustainable Energy

OMV Aktiengesellschaft has demonstrated significant strategic advancements in its sustainability and energy transition efforts. The company achieved a major milestone with the Final Investment Decision (FID) for a 250,000 tons per annum Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) plant, along with two green hydrogen plants in Romania. This move positions OMV as a frontrunner in sustainable fuel production, aligning with the growing market demand for renewable energy sources.

Additionally, OMVKY constructed its first green hydrogen plant in Austria, setting the stage for a larger-scale operation in the future. These developments underline the company's commitment to sustainability and innovation.

OMVKY’s Commitment to Green Energy & Sustainable Innovation

The company also made strategic moves in the energy sector, divesting its exploration and production (E&P) assets in Malaysia to streamline its portfolio and concentrate on core markets. This restructuring effort was complemented by a significant gas discovery in the Norwegian Sea and exceptional progress on the Neptun Deep project, where all major execution contracts have been awarded, and 90% of the budget has been committed. OMV Petrom has initiated gas marketing activities, marking another important step in commercializing this venture. These efforts enhance OMVKY’s long-term energy supply security and profitability.

Another positive aspect is the company’s push toward renewable energy, intending to generate 3 to 4 terawatt-hours (TWh) per annum of renewable power by 2030. OMV Petrom has already secured approximately 2.4 TWh per year of prospective power production, demonstrating its commitment to expanding its footprint in the renewable energy sector. Furthermore, the company has initiated drilling for its first geothermal well in Austria, reinforcing its efforts in alternative energy development.

Time to Bet on OMVKY?

The integrated energy company boasts strong financials, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 24%, which is lower than the industry composite average of 27.8%. This solid balance sheet enables OMV to navigate a volatile business environment with resilience.

Electricity drove surge in energy demand in 2024: IEA

London, 24 March (Argus) — Electricity demand drove a jump in overall global energy consumption growth in 2024, lifting it well above the average pace of increase in recent years, energy watchdog the IEA said today. Global energy demand rose by 2.2pc in 2024 — higher than the average annual demand increase of 1.3pc between 2013 and 2023 — according to the Paris-base agency's Global Energy Review . Global electricity consumption rose by 4.3pc, driven by record-high temperatures that led to increased cooling demand, growing industrial consumption, the electrification of transport and from data centres and artificial intelligence, the IEA said. Renewables and nuclear covered the majority of growth in electricity demand, at 80pc, while supply of gas-fired power generation ""also increased steadily"", it said. New renewable power capacity installations reached around 700GW in 2024 — a new high — while renewable power sources and nuclear together made up 40pc of total generation in 2024, it said. Global gas demand rose by 2.7pc in 2024, with an increase in ""fast growing Asian markets"", the IEA said. It noted growth of more than 7pc and 10pc in China and India, respectively. But ""growth in global oil demand slowed markedly in 2024"", the organisation said. Oil demand rose by 0.8pc — compared with 1.9pc in 2023 — and oil's share of total energy demand fell below 30pc last year ""for the first time ever"". A rise in electric vehicle (EV) purchases was a key contributor to the drop in oil demand for road transport, and this offset ""a significant proportion"" of the rise in oil consumption for aviation and petrochemicals, the IEA said. The rate of increase in coal demand slowed to 1.1pc in 2024, half the pace seen in 2023. ""Intense heatwaves"" in China and India ""contributed more than 90pc of the total annual increase in coal consumption globally"", for cooling needs, the IEA found. Renewables limit rise in emissions The IEA repeatedly noted the significant effect that extreme weather in 2024 had on energy systems and on demand patterns. Last year was the hottest ever recorded, beating the previous record set in 2023. ""Weather effects contributed about 15pc of the overall increase in global energy demand"", the IEA said. Global cooling degree days were 6pc higher in 2024 on the year, and 20pc higher than the 2000-20 average, it said. But the ""continued rapid adoption of clean energy technologies"" restricted the rise in energy-related CO2 emissions, which fell to 0.8pc in 2024 from 1.2pc in 2023, the IEA said. Energy-related CO2 emissions still hit a record high of 37.8bn t in 2024, but the rise in emissions was lower than global GDP growth, it said. ""The majority of emissions growth in 2024 came from emerging and developing economies other than China,"" the IEA said. Emerging and developing economies accounted for more than 80pc of the increase in global energy demand last year, it said.

US strikes Houthis with eye on Iran — to what end?

Stoking regional tensions to get Tehran to the negotiating table appears unlikely to have Trump's desired outcome, write Nader Itayim and Bachar Halabi Dubai, 21 March (Argus) — As US president Donald Trump's administration intensifies its military campaign against Yemen's Houthis, it has issued yet another stark warning to Iran and its leadership — end support for the rebel group or face ""dire"" consequences. The ultimatum is in line with the ‘maximum pressure' approach Trump has adopted to force Iran back to the negotiating table. But success looks far from certain. This past week saw US forces carry out a series of air strikes against Houthi targets, soon after the rebel group said it would restart attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, the Bab el-Mandeb strait and Gulf of Aden after Tel Aviv ignored a Houthi warning to resume the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The Houthi threat since late 2023 has severely curtailed international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, impacting the global economy. The Trump administration says its campaign has set out to put an end to that. The US' ""economic and national security has been under attack by the Houthis for too long"", Washington says. And rising shipping rates, as a result, have probably increased global consumer goods inflation by 0.6-0.7pc, according to the White House. The diversion of oil and LNG flows has been stark (see charts). Trump's message to the Houthis is that their ""time is up"". Although Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, also carried out air strikes against the group, observers say the latest attacks are not just more of the same. ""Is this a different campaign? 100pc it is,"" says Mohammed al-Basha, founder of the US-based Basha Report security advisory. Some sites targeted in the Houthi-held capital Sana'a are ""a first"", he says, signalling that the Houthi leadership is now firmly in Washington's crosshairs for the first time since 2015, he says. The current campaign is also more proactive than the strikes that took place last year, says general Joseph Votel, a former commander of US Central Command, which is overseeing the attacks. ""Last year, our approach was more defensive, and focused on protecting ships passing through the area,"" he says. But this campaign is larger in scope, more geographically dispersed and more intense. Votel says the Trump campaign is more ""counter-terrorism focused"", which indicates a more targeted and sustained approach to degrade Houthi capabilities and put pressure on its network. Also, there is a subtle change in the strategic messaging, according to Votel. While the Biden administration mostly focused on preventing an expansion of the regional conflict, the Trump administration is making clear that its focus is on ""restoring freedom of commerce and navigation"". While slight, this change ""takes us from a defensive posture to an offensive one"", he says. Threats and opportunities Arguably, the biggest distinction between the two strategies is the degree to which Iran, the Houthis' main backer, appears to have featured in the administration's calculations before launching this latest campaign. ""The hundreds of attacks being made by [the] Houthis… all emanate from, and are created by, Iran,"" Trump wrote via his social media platform on day three of the strikes, by which point the Houthis had claimed two retaliatory attacks on the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea. ""Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of Iran, and Iran will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!"" This kind of tough-talking rhetoric is in keeping with Trump's strategy of applying pressure on Iran's leadership to the point that it has no choice but to negotiate the future of its nuclear programme, and ideally, more than that. ""It's very clear the US wants to see sweeping concessions from Iran on the nuclear file, on the regional proxy file, and probably the missile and drone programme,"" says Gregory Brew, senior analyst at US consultancy Eurasia Group. ""Trump ultimately wants a deal. But he also wants to look tough and push the Iranians into a deal that aligns with his maximalist view."" After Iran's other regional proxies — Gaza-based Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah — saw their capabilities heavily degraded at the hands of Israel last year, the Houthis are one of the last remaining pieces in what Tehran calls its regional ‘Axis of Resistance'. In a letter sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, earlier this month, Trump says he encouraged Iran's ultimate decision maker to ""make a deal"" or face military action. Iran has since confirmed receipt of the letter, but is yet to formally respond, with foreign minister Abbas Araqchi saying this week that its contents are still being evaluated. ""Trump's letter is mostly a threat, but he also claims it has opportunities. We are evaluating it and paying attention to all points,"" he says. Iran's response ""will not take long"", Araqchi says. But the mood music coming out of Tehran over the past two weeks has not been positive. ""You've had Khamenei's tough rhetoric, laying out a tough line for everybody that [they] are not going to talk to the US,"" Brew says. But ""Araqchi and others have clarified that what they are really pushing back against is the sense of talking under pressure. They don't want to appear as if they are succumbing to Trump's pressure. They do want to talk, but from a position of relative strength"". Carrot and multiple sticks So long as Washington continues to turn the sanctions screw on Iran — just this week the Treasury for the first time imposed sanctions on a small Chinese refiner over its purchases of Iranian crude — prospects for de-escalation, or nuclear diplomacy, look slim. This raises the question — what next? For now, Trump's inferred threats of military action against Iran look premature, says Arman Mahmoudian, a research fellow at the Global and National Security Institute, especially in response to Houthi actions. Trump seems to be ""employing a Reagan-era ‘peace-through-strength' strategy… focused on demonstrating force, particularly by targeting the Axis of Resistance, which is currently in a fragile position"", Mahmoudian says. ""By launching the strikes, Trump is signalling he has both the capability and willingness to escalate if necessary. That said, I feel his ultimate goal is negotiations, not full-scale war."" Brew agrees, describing the Houthis as ""an easy target"". They ""have been redesignated a terrorist organisation [by the US] and are in an entrenched position. So bombing them gives this administration the chance to look tough, and appear to be applying pressure on Iran, without having to take action directly"". But if Washington expects such military action against the Houthis to trigger a change in posture or behaviour from the Iranians, they might be disappointed. ""The Iranians won't really care if the Houthis are getting bombed. [The group has shown] over the years that they can absorb these kinds of attacks,"" Brew says. ""But also, Iran doesn't have the same influence over, or relationship with, the Houthis as it does Hezbollah or the Shia militias in Iraq."" The commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has suggested as much, insisting this week that the Houthis ""make their own strategic decisions"" and that Iran ""has no role"" in determining their policies or activities. With both sides seemingly keen to talk, a return to negotiations in the not-too-distant future cannot be ruled out. But the sudden escalation of tensions in the Mideast Gulf region, following the collapse of the ceasefire in Gaza, will almost certainly make things more difficult than they already were.

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonization forward,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

About CADO

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations. CADO membership is open to:

Organizations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain, or that represent any association or group of participants in the SAF value chain

States or quasi-state organizations with a direct interest in the operations and benefit of the SAF Registry

Related interest groups indirectly benefitting from SAF deployed in the aviation system

About the SAF Registry

IATA is developing the soon-to-be-launched SAF Registry as a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way. It ensures that the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked as they move across the SAF value chain and enable the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

The SAF Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply —which is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally —by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location. In addition, it gives access to airlines’ corporate customers to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonization.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost recovery basis.

To predict trends for the year ahead, travel companies often utilise vast amounts of data to identify pricing patterns and analyse traveller behaviour. Reports of late have listed more affordable airfare among their findings.

In December 2024, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) forecasted that the average return airfare in 2025 would drop by 1.8 per cent compared with 2024.

In another report by flight-tracking company Hopper, it found that long-haul flights have become more affordable. Its data indicated that flights between the United States and Asia , for instance, cost 11 per cent less in the first half of 2025 than in the same period in 2024.

In February, travel booking platform Expedia released its 2025 Air Hacks Report for Singapore, stating that average economy class ticket prices dropped by 12 per cent, while premium travel was 8 per cent cheaper in 2024 than in 2023.

Its findings were based on a comparison of average round-trip ticket prices for January to October in 2024 and the same period in 2023 , sourced from Airlines Reporting Corporation’s (ARC) global airline sales database.

American company ARC manages the world’s most comprehensive airline ticketing dataset, with information from over 12 billion annual passenger flights operated by more than 480 airlines worldwide, according to Iata.

Referencing the Expedia report, Mr James Marshall, vice-president of global air partnerships at Expedia, says: “The data we have gives us a good indication of how trends are going, and usually, we can expect such trends to continue.”

Fuel prices drop, flight options rise

Experts say prices are largely dictated by supply and demand. When airlines struggle to fill seats, they lower fares to attract passengers. Conversely, strong demand allows them to charge higher prices.

However, multiple other factors – fuel cost, aircraft availability, geopolitical tensions and seasonality – also shape pricing.

Mr Kadam Aggarwal, a partner at Asia-focused management consulting firm YCP Auctus who specialises in aviation and airports, forecasts that airfare will be cheaper in 2025 as a result of lower jet fuel prices.

“It is expected that ticket prices this year should be similar to 2019’s prices , seeing as average jet fuel prices – the most critical parameter driving airfare – are becoming very similar to 2019’s levels ,” he adds.

Iata predicts jet fuel will average US$87 (S$116) a barrel in 2025 – US$12 less than in 2024.

One key area to watch, however, is the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is roughly three times the cost of conventional jet fuel, and is likely to affect ticket affordability in the future.

Still in the nascent stages of adoption, SAF is an alternative fuel produced from non-petroleum sources, such as waste oil and agricultural waste. It remains expensive due to limited production capacity and high feedstock costs.

Post-pandemic, travellers are venturing farther and airlines are responding by opening new routes and increasing flight frequencies to popular destinations.

Mr Marshall says: “People realise they have more choices now and can shop around for good deals.”

Mr Alan Lim, a director of management consultancy Alton Aviation in Singapore, agrees. “The business model for low-cost carriers (LCCs) is to run as many flights as possible and try to keep costs down, which can have an impact on overall airfare.”

More than 100 airlines operate out of Changi Airport, of which around a fifth are LCCs.

Mr Kadam says both the airport’s extensive network and the presence of multiple LCCs drive up competition among airlines in Singapore.

“Compared with Western markets, South-east Asia has a dominance of low-cost carriers simply because its markets are more price-sensitive. LCCs have thrived a lot more here,” he adds.

In other words, as flight options increase, one of the ways airlines will have to vie for travellers’ dollars is by keeping airfare competitive.

How travel patterns affect airfare

Business travel influences airfare patterns, especially when it comes to identifying the cheapest months and days to book flights for leisure travellers.

Expedia’s 2025 Air Hacks Report found that February is the most expensive month to travel for Singapore travellers – likely due to the Chinese New Year holidays.

In comparison, June and July are the cheapest months to fly premium and economy classes respectively.

Mr Marshall says corporate and leisure travel create distinct booking patterns, which are important levers of how airfare will be calculated.

He notes that corporate travellers typically book premium seats, while economy seats are booked by a mix of both leisure and business travellers.

He hypothesises that in June – Singapore’s school holiday season – leisure travel increases and more economy seats are snapped up by families or larger groups travelling together.

As such, demand for premium class seats in June may be relatively lower than in other months, and airfare for those classes of travel dips.

In July, as leisure travel slows and corporate travel picks back up after the June holidays, bookings for premium classes will likely increase with less demand in economy, resulting in lower airfare for economy seats.

While travel reports offer valuable insights, airfare largely remains unpredictable. Alton Aviation’s Mr Lim advises travellers to stay flexible.

“Stick to the basics, such as avoiding travel on peak days and timings by flying mid-week and being flexible with your choice of airline,” he says. “With so many carriers flying out of Singapore, shopping around can often make a difference.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d1dafd144604541de042039f5fe1a287dc4dac22791736815d515c2925c37efb,N,,2025-03-24 07:56:07.218713

Valoriser le CO2 biogénique de Ryam

Il vise à produire chaque année jusqu’à 81 000 tonnes de carburant d’aviation durable, de l’e-Saf (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), appelé à remplacer le kérozène actuel fabriqué à partir d’énergies fossiles. L’unité sera installée sur le site landais de l’américain Ryam, qui dispose encore de 30 hectares disponibles. Cette plateforme est mondialement connue pour sa production de cellulose de spécialité. Cette production à partir de bois génère du CO2 biogénique. Le projet de Verso Energy consiste à récupérer ce CO2 biogénique dans les fumées, estimé à 334 000 tonnes par an. ReSTart permettrait d’éviter l’équivalent en émissions annuelles de 22 500 Français, estime Verso Energy.

""La capacité à financer ces projets découle directement de l’existence d’un marché, avec des clients prêts à contractualiser l’achat des volumes de e-SAF.""

En parallèle, Ryam pousserait le curseur de sa décarbonation. En avril 2024, le site a déjà lancé la fabrication de bioéthanol. Les deux entreprises sont aussi liées dans des expérimentations similaires aux États-Unis, sur le site de Ryam en Géorgie.

Ouverture de la concertation préalable

RTE, le Réseau de transport d’électricité, est aussi associé à ReSTart en tant que porteur de la partie raccordement électrique (via le poste électrique de Berge à Bégaar à environ 5 km, soit via celui de Cantegrit à Morcenx-la-Nouvelle à environ 20 km). C’est ensemble que RTE et Verso Energy ont entamé les démarches administratives. Celles-ci donnent lieu à une concertation préalable entre le 25 mars et le 19 juin. ""Pour être opérationnelle en 2030, l’usine devra avoir obtenu ses autorisations au plus tard fin 2026 pour permettre un début des travaux au plus tard mi-2027"", précise l’entreprise.

Fondée à Paris en 2021, Verso Energy (50 salariés) a des bureaux à Marseille, Bordeaux, Lyon et Toulouse, et porte simultanément des projets d’e-Saf similaires dans le Limousin (LiCHEN), en Seine-Maritime et Eure (DéZIR), dans les Vosges (EpHYNE). Ces projets sont développés avec une approche de standardisation et de réplicabilité : même conception, mêmes technologies, même taille standard, mêmes équipements… ""Ainsi, les coûts de développement, d’ingénierie et de construction de ces usines sont fortement optimisés"", explique l’entreprise.

I thank President Trump for recognizing the importance of homegrown Iowa biofuels and appreciate his commitment to our energy security.
Homegrown fuels like E-15 lower gas prices for our families, support our farm producers, and reduce our dependence on foreign energy from countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.
By converting agricultural biomass into airplane fuel, Iowa farmers and producers will benefit from new markets, and we can use domestic energy – instead of foreign oil – to power our planes.
Liquid fuels and homegrown energy will grow our economy, strengthen our energy security, and put American families and farmers first.","Domestic energy production is a critical component of both our short- and long-term economic growth, bolsters our national security, and strengthens our international competitiveness. From getting to work and heating and cooling homes to keeping the lights on and growing crops, our families, farmers, businesses, manufacturers, and many other sectors of our economy rely on reliable, affordable, and abundant sources of energy. President Trump recognized this reality when he declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office and later established a National Energy Dominance Council to explore and implement ways that we can increase domestic energy production and lower energy costs for American families and consumers.

In his declaration of a national energy emergency, President Trump explicitly noted what those of us in Iowa and across the Midwest have known for a long time – biofuels play a pivotal role in restoring American energy independence and supporting U.S. energy dominance. I thank President Trump for recognizing the importance of homegrown Iowa biofuels and appreciate his commitment to our energy security. Now, it is incumbent upon lawmakers to put these words into action. Representing the largest biofuel-producing congressional district in the nation, I have led and cosponsored several pieces of legislation to unleash the full potential of American biofuels and prioritize our energy independence.

First, I helped introduce the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act with my colleague from Nebraska, Rep. Adrian Smith, to make E-15 permanently available year-round at gas stations in all fifty states. Homegrown fuels like E-15 lower gas prices for our families, support our farm producers, and reduce our dependence on foreign energy from countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. This simple amendment to federal law would not cost taxpayers a single penny but would deliver fuel savings for drivers to the tune of nearly $21 billion every year and generate more than $66 billion to our Gross Domestic Product annually. Reducing gas prices for Iowans means that our families can save at the pump and invest their money in other ways.

Second, I recently introduced the COST Act, which would direct the Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office and U.S. Secretary of Energy to compare the financial and environmental costs of replacing the entire federal gasoline-powered vehicle fleet with either electric vehicles or E-85 capable flex fuel cars and trucks. Back in 2021, President Biden pledged to replace the entire federal fleet with electric vehicles – a decree that would have been extremely costly and inefficient. That’s why we need to study the full cost of making the entire federal fleet electric because I am confident that vehicles powered by biofuel blends would be much more cost-effective and reliable.

Furthermore, I appreciate President Trump for ending the Biden administration’s radical electric-vehicle mandate on our families, farmers, and businesses. Electric vehicles are expensive, unreliable, and unworkable, especially in rural communities. The components needed to make EV batteries are also largely sourced from China, and we should not be bankrolling the Chinese Communist Party’s mission to undermine the United States and hurt our economy. By promoting flex fuel vehicles, we can support Iowa’s farmers and biofuel producers, prioritize homegrown U.S. fuels over foreign batteries, and strengthen our strategic position against China.

Third, I helped introduce the Farm to Fly Act with my colleague from Ohio, Rep. Max Miller, to advance the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and promote the role that Iowa agriculture plays in developing this future fuel. This legislation would add a definition of SAF to USDA programs, advance SAF research and development, and promote the use of the GREET model. It would also direct the Secretary of Agriculture to work collaboratively within USDA and with other federal agencies to find ways to promote the commercial adoption of SAF. By converting agricultural biomass into airplane fuel, Iowa farmers and producers will benefit from new markets, and we can use domestic energy – instead of foreign oil – to power our planes.

Finally, I helped lead the Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act with my colleague from Iowa, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, to support the use of biodiesel and other biomass-based diesel for ships, boats, and other ocean-going vessels. Growing new markets for biofuels is crucial to increasing demand for Iowa agricultural goods and putting more money into the pockets of our producers. Just like we’re doing with jet fuel, we need to expand the use of renewable fuels across more transportation sectors, including boats and ships, to promote homegrown fuels and support our agricultural community.

As the only member of Congress serving on both the House Agriculture Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, I’ll continue to push for policies that open new markets for biofuels, lower energy costs for our families, and support our farmers, energy producers, and rural communities. Liquid fuels and homegrown energy will grow our economy, strengthen our energy security, and put American families and farmers first.

But speeding too far ahead of even the green-friendly European Union on so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could prompt carriers like easyJet EZJ, Wizz Air WIZZ and Ryanair RYAI to fly more elsewhere.
Using SAF, made from more sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and often blended with conventional jet fuel, can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80%.
Still, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
The EU and UK governments have aimed to tackle the demand side of the problem via so-called “mandates”: in 2025, 2% of jet fuel supplied at EU and UK airports must be SAF.","Britain has long punched above its weight in global aviation. The UK is home to cutting-edge technologies like Rolls-Royce engines and Airbus wings, and Heathrow is one of the world’s busiest airports – as proved last week when a power outage caused international travel upheaval. But speeding too far ahead of even the green-friendly European Union on so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could prompt carriers like easyJet EZJ, Wizz Air WIZZ and Ryanair RYAI to fly more elsewhere.

Decarbonising aviation, which accounts for around 2% of global carbon emissions, is a thornier problem than the electrification of cars. Getting an 80-tonne short-haul aircraft off the ground with existing battery technology is a fool’s errand. Using SAF, made from more sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and often blended with conventional jet fuel, can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80%.

Still, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). It’s also around three times as expensive as the conventional version, and while airlines want greater investment from energy majors to bring prices down, producers are reluctant to commit to higher output lest carriers spurn their pricey SAF. The EU and UK governments have aimed to tackle the demand side of the problem via so-called “mandates”: in 2025, 2% of jet fuel supplied at EU and UK airports must be SAF.

But it’s there that the flight paths begin to diverge. By 2030, the UK has a 10% SAF mandate, while the EU only has 6%. Moreover, the UK’s mandate increases linearly every year, whereas the EU has, on paper, a straightforward step up from 2% in 2029 to 6% in 2030.

UK-heavy carriers are therefore likely to be spending more on SAF than their European counterparts for the rest of the decade. That’s a competitive headwind in an industry that generally operates with tight profit margins – and in which fuel is usually the largest single expense. IATA estimated in December that global airlines would on average see net profit margins of just 3.6% in 2025.

Carriers could just lump part of the expense on to consumers – as with Deutsche Lufthansa’s LHA announcement of an “environmental cost surcharge” last year. But the industry is already battling stubbornly rising expenses elsewhere, from air traffic control fees to increased maintenance costs to emissions charges. In the UK, for all the fanfare around airport expansion, the government is also raising air passenger duty. There’s a limit to how much consumers will stomach.

As such, it’s quite possible carriers opt for a different solution. If flights that touch the UK incur a significantly higher cost, one simple workaround is to fly more within the EU. Unless Brussels wants to toughen up its own standards – or if the UK proves unsuccessful in its attempts to stimulate much more SAF production and help bring prices down – the likeliest outcome is fewer flights for holidaymaking Brits.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 07:56:35.904486

In 2024, revenue will reach nearly 123,000 billion VND

BSR has just announced its audited financial report with positive results such as net revenue from sales and service provision reaching 122,986 billion VND; payment to the State budget reaching 13,554.5 billion VND and profit after tax reaching 316.7 billion VND.

Although the results are somewhat lower than in 2023, BSR's revenue in 2024 is still significantly higher than in the previous period, far exceeding the plan set by the board of directors.

This is an encouraging result in the context of strong fluctuations in crude oil prices, leading to narrowing profit margins in the oil refining industry. Many oil refineries in the world and in Vietnam have been forced to restructure or suspend operations.

Faced with that challenge, BSR has proactively and drastically implemented solutions to respond to the very complex market developments to minimize losses as well as seize opportunities when the market shows positive signs; continue to improve management capacity, market forecasting ability and proactively propose solutions to adapt flexibly.

Crude oil tanker arrives at the SPM.

Over the past year, Dung Quat Oil Refinery has always operated safely, stably and continuously at optimal capacity. BSR has also conquered new operational limits, at times the plant operated at 118% capacity and achieved an output of more than 6.6 million tons of various types of gasoline and oil.

BSR's closing equity for fiscal year 2024 reached VND55,491.5 billion. Regarding investment, during the year, BSR continued to disburse investment for the Dung Quat Oil Refinery Upgrade and Expansion Project, the Project to add crude oil tanks to Dung Quat Oil Refinery and other projects with a total value of VND1,352.5 billion.

In 2025, BSR set a target of output of 6.69 million tons; revenue of 114.5 trillion VND; budget contribution of about 12,992 billion VND; estimated after-tax profit of about 746 billion VND; investment value of about 1,740 billion VND.

This target has been adjusted higher, based on the results exceeding expectations achieved in 2024. However, given concerns about the development of crude oil prices in the world, the profit target is still calculated cautiously. Compared to the implementation level in 2024, BSR's leadership still expects the enterprise to regain profit growth momentum in 2025.

Build multiple scenarios and synchronized solutions

BSR always focuses on forecasting to be proactive in production and business, ensuring flexible response and adaptation to market fluctuations. Previously, BSR's professional department assessed that 2025 would continue to be a challenging year for the market.

Dated Brent crude oil prices reversed and fell sharply below $70/barrel on March 5, 2025, compared to an average price of more than $79/barrel in January 2025, after the US announced many new policies.

In addition, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to increase production again from April 2025 to 138,000 barrels/day. Oil prices are also under downward pressure from geopolitical and economic factors, including increased economic tensions due to US tariff policies, the Russia-Ukraine peace process promoted by the US, and signs of cooling down in the Middle East.

Dung Quat Refinery is always operated safely, stably, and continuously at optimal capacity. At times, the refinery's capacity has reached 118%.

At the latest meeting of the Steering Committee for responding to the decline in crude oil prices, BSR General Director Nguyen Viet Thang directed the activation of production and business operations from VUCA to BANI, clearly analyzed and proposed 3 sets of scenarios for BSR: Real scenario, management scenario and forecast scenario so that any fluctuations in oil prices will have specific response solutions.

In addition, Mr. Thang also emphasized that BSR needs to take advantage of the price difference between input materials and output products, which is still at a good level, to increase the capacity of Dung Quat Refinery, first of all, increasing the capacity of some workshops with room; continue to maintain good relationships with customers, apply flexible sales policies, compete with imported goods, and maintain Dung Quat Refinery inventory at a stable level.

At the same time, BSR synchronously deploys solutions on production operations, business - regulation and investment - finance. In which, production operations are guaranteed to be safe, stable, and maintain high capacity.

Regarding business and regulation, continue to purchase crude oil to optimize capacity, maintain low inventory, urge customers to receive goods on schedule, and consider suitable warehouse rental options. Promote production of new products such as plastic pellets and intermediate petroleum. Regarding investment and finance, optimize cash flow and investment activities, ensuring strong financial resources for the company.

Regarding management, continue to review and improve production processes to increase efficiency and cut unnecessary costs. Complete the quality management system according to international standards, ensuring high-quality products.

With society continuing to value environmental concerns, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from non-petroleum feedstocks is currently one of the only promising solutions to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of the aviation industry. Although there are other alternatives such as hydrogen-powered or electric aircrafts, they face major challenges regarding safety and weight. This project aims to design an SAF production process that produces aviation grade fuel with lower lifetime carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel.

The proposed plant is in Cattaraugus County, New York, and involves converting woody biomass waste from industries such as the pulp and paper industry into synthetic paraffinic kerosene via the Fischer-Tropsch process (FT-SPK). This conversion was accomplished with a design of three main steps; gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and refining. The gasification stage involves converting woody biomass pellets into syngas, followed by purification and adjustment in a water-gas shift reactor. The syngas is then transformed into heavy FT liquid which is refined further in a hydrocracker and distilled into various products including SAF. The proposed production plant offers both profitability and potential emission reduction, with a Net Present Value (NPV) of $27.05 million suggesting viability for future iterations.

In 2024, 75% of the 766 aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend, and this is expected to increase soon, once aircraft deliveries using SAF begin at Mirabel later this year.
To achieve this, Airbus has signed agreements with SAF providers like TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016.
As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem.
Looking forward, Airbus plans to continue to increase the use of SAF in its own operations, with a target of at least 30% SAF in its global fuel mix by 2030.","What do Toulouse, Hamburg, Mobile, Tianjin and Mirabel have in common? All of these Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

Thanks to this development, by the end of 2025, all Airbus customers, regardless of where they are taking delivery of their aircraft, can do so with SAF on board, free of charge. In 2024, 75% of the 766 aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend, and this is expected to increase soon, once aircraft deliveries using SAF begin at Mirabel later this year.

SAF remains a key lever for the aviation industry’s decarbonisation goals. SAF is anticipated to provide the bulk of the emissions reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimating that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions required.

In recent years, Airbus has been increasing the percentage of SAF used in its own operations to 16%, which includes business travel, delivery flights (where a plane is delivered to the home base of the purchasing airline following the transfer of title), and transportation of aircraft parts between different production sites.

To achieve this, Airbus has signed agreements with SAF providers like TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. Thanks to a partnership signed in 2024, TotalEnergies supplies more than half the SAF to meet Airbus’ needs in Europe. We have also joined forces with airlines. Volotea, which operates a Hamburg-Toulouse flight for Airbus employees as part of our internal shuttle service, has been using a 34% SAF blend on this route since 2022. And following a successful pilot in 2023, since 2024 Air France-KLM and Airbus have had a “SAF fares agreement”, with Airbus purchasing SAF options for employee business travel connecting Paris with five locations: Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich and Toulouse.

Partnerships and pilots

Looking further afield, in 2024, Airbus launched a pilot scheme with easyJet, who operate flights on the Toulouse-Bristol route, a popular route for business travel due to the proximity to Airbus’ Toulouse and Filton sites. Running between November 2024 and January 2025, the scheme saw Airbus finance 106 tonnes of SAF, the equivalent amount of fuel necessary to run flights between Toulouse and Bristol on a 30% SAF blend during the period.

In January 2025, Airbus, Wizz Air and Moeve and Charleroi Airport completed a SAF operational trial. Airbus provided technical guidance and expertise during the trial, which saw Wizz Air operate more than 50 flights using a blend of SAF and traditional jet fuel. A survey was also completed during this period, which shone a light on passenger awareness of, and attitudes towards, low-carbon aviation including SAF.

Scaling the SAF ecosystem

Even though the quantity of SAF available has increased in recent years, demand remains suppressed due to the higher cost of SAF compared to kerosene – 2.8x according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. The industry has to address this disparity and reduce the price gap with traditional fuel.

Although Airbus is not a SAF producer, there is a role it can play. As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem. In 2024, Airbus invested in SAFFA, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund. SAFFA focuses on SAF that is eligible for RefuelEU Aviation or CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) certification, although the investments can take place across different production pathways and regions. SAFFA’s first investment, in US-based Crysalis Biosciences, will help the company produce low-carbon intensity SAF and biochemicals.

In 2024, Airbus also made an investment in sustainable aviation fuels producer and technology company LanzaJet. Airbus’ investment supports LanzaJet in scaling its SAF production process which uses ethanol, known as the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway. LanzaJet recently opened a new SAF plant in Soperton, Georgia, with the capacity to produce 9 million gallons of SAF each year.

“Unfortunately, there is a mismatch in our supply as we do not have enough local players positioned to capture these opportunities,” said Economy Minister Datuk Seri Rafizi Ramli during the launch of the National OGSE Industry Blueprint 2021-2030 Mid-Term Review (MTR).

“By 2030, (the ministry) aims to have 10 OGSE companies that have successfully expanded into the RE space. We want to show how innovative projects like plastic to fuel, can be integrated and diversify revenue streams,” he pointed out.

He further mentioned that the ministry’s second vision is to sale the local OGSE players to becoming regional champions, as 80% of the OGSE companies are SMEs.

Participants in the ‘regional champions programme’ needs to be mid-tier size with over RM50 million in revenue in order to quality, and they must have a positive profit-before-tax (PBT) over five years with no legal issues.

“The idea is to play an identification and matchmaking role of opportunities. We support the deal making process by enabling access to financing and marketing.

“This can be in the form of mergers and acquisitions, management buyouts or joint ventures (JVs). The point is to increase commercial activity and boost export revenues to at least 50%,” he explained.

The COVID-19 pandemic – Razifi believes – exposed many of the financial vulnerabilities within the OGSE industry, with companies finding themselves trapped in overspecialized business models, burdened by excessive debt and diminishing profit margins.

Geopolitical shocks from wars have also triggered significant oil price fluctuations, creating an uncertain landscape that compromised the security of supply chains.

“If we look at pre-pandemic levels, the industry was able to attract approved investments amounting to RM3.3 billion in 2019. By 2022, investments dropped to RM363 million (-89%),” Razifi noted, saying that the MTR comes at a critical juncture in OGSE’s history.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

INTERNATIONAL

Money for trees – Norway is providing NOK 70 mln ($7 mln) to strengthen Indigenous governance in the Colombian Amazon. The support aims to enhance the ability of Indigenous organisations to govern and protect their territories, which are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. The grant will be managed by the Amazon Conservation Team (ACT) in collaboration with Colombian Indigenous organisations. The funds will be channelled directly to Indigenous authorities for activities such as climate monitoring, territorial management, and community development. This initiative is part of Norway’s broader efforts to support Indigenous peoples as key stewards of tropical forests. It also aligns with Colombia’s commitments to reduce deforestation and strengthen Indigenous rights.

Auf Wiedersehen – Germany’s second chamber of parliament, the Bundesrat, has voted in favour of a spending package that loosens borrowing limits, allowing billions of euros of investments in defence, infrastructure, and climate change. The package includes €100 bln for climate action as part of a new €500 bln infrastructure fund, and a historic reform of the country’s debt brake, obtained by the Green Party in exchange for their support to pass the package in the outgoing Parliament. The amendment was backed in the Bundesrat with 53 out of 69 votes in favour, passing the 46-vote threshold, reports DW. Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Rhineland-Palatinate abstained, with abstentions counted as opposition votes, reported the national news outlet. This means expenditures on defence, cybersecurity, intelligence, and civil protection exceeding 1% of German GDP can now be financed with new debt. (DW)

GDP growth – Goldman Sachs Research raised its forecast for the euro zone’s real GDP growth this year to 0.8%, up from 0.7%, driven by a new fiscal plan in Germany and higher defense spending on the continent. The fiscal plan from Europe’s largest economy includes a €500 bln off-budget infrastructure and climate protection fund and increased defense spending, estimated to boost economic activity across the region. Some €100 bln of the fund will be earmarked for climate action. Further out, the economists increased their 2026 forecast for the currency area by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3%, and boosted the 2027 numbers by 0.3 percentage points to 1.6%.

CCS – Porthos, the EU’s flagship CO2 transport infrastructure project in the port of Rotterdam, is progressing as planned, according to the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA). “CINEA visited the section of the onshore pipeline, which is already mostly completed,” the EU agency reported on Mar. 19. The Porthos project aims to develop an open access, 33 km long, onshore pipeline to transport CO2 across borders between the ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Ghent. The captured CO2 will then be sent through a 20km offshore pipeline that will transport the compressed CO2 to depleted gas fields for storage in the Dutch section of the North Sea. “The designated site for the compressor station at Azieweg is also taking shape, with supporting infrastructure such as electrical buildings already in place, while the actual compressors will arrive later towards the end of the construction phase,” CINEA said. The offshore pipeline is still in its early stages, it added, but preparatory activities have already started. The project is expected to be fully operational and start operation “by 2026”, CINEA said.

England’s Western Forest – The UK government has announced plans to plant 20 mln trees and create 2,500 hectares of new woodland in the west of England as part of a ‘national forest’ drive. The new ‘Western Forest’ will consist of new and existing woodlands across Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, the Cotswolds, and the Mendips as well as in urban areas such as Bristol, Swindon, and Gloucester. It will be the first of three new national forests pledged by the government to help meet a legally-binding target of achieving 16.5% woodland cover in England by 2050. England’s woodland cover currently stands at 10%. Across the UK, the aim is for 30,000 ha of woodland to be planted every year, with latest annual figures showing about 21,000 ha were planted, with the vast majority in Scotland and just 5,500 ha in England. The Western Forest, funded by £7.5 mln of public money, will particularly target urban areas like Bristol, Swindon, and Gloucester. (BBC)

CBAM for textiles? – An anti-fast-fashion bill is expected to be discussed by the French Senate in the week of May 19th, following its postponement at the start of the year, which prompted widespread discontent with environmental organisations. Article 6 of the bill states that within six months of the law’s promulgation, the government shall submit to Parliament a report examining the opportunity of extending the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to textile products manufactured outside the EU’s territory. Doing so would subject textiles imported into the EU to a carbon emission tariff equivalent to that applied to European makers of the same items. The bill would aim to penalise fast-fashion products on the basis of their environmental impact as well as their commercial practices. The bill is suggesting that penalties be placed on fast-fashion products, and that part of the monies collected will be used to finance collection and recycling in non-EU countries.

What farmers want – In a recent policy brief, the OptFor-EU research project examines challenges and opportunities through expert surveys and stakeholder workshops in alignment with the EU’s Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the European Green Deal. It lists financial constraints, information gaps, competing social priorities, fragmented governance, and differing perspectives based on gender and experience as the main threats in achieving forest-based carbon removal. However, the policy brief suggests there are opportunities to enhance forest resilience through improved data sharing, policy coordination, and innovative tools such as decision support systems and digital monitoring technologies. Moving forward, it recommends stakeholders to reinforce strategic priorities, adopt climate-smart forestry practices, and strengthen financial sustainability to support long-term climate resilience.

Teaming up – The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, supported by the ASEAN Secretariat, held expert consultations on carbon markets with representatives from Russia and Southeast Asian countries this week, reported website TV BRICS. The summit emphasised carbon markets’ role in emissions reduction and energy transition and featured a session on Russian carbon markets, where representatives from the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Russian registry showcased the country’s climate projects. Experts from Myanmar, Malaysia, and Indonesia also shared regulatory developments and future plans for carbon markets, as per the reporting. The consultations were aimed at strengthening Russia–ASEAN collaboration, to foster joint climate initiatives and promote carbon trading across the region.

Brain drain gain – A group of 12 European countries is planning to attract researchers from the US in response to US government cuts to education and research funding. In a letter to EU Innovation Commissioner Ekaterina Zaharieva, the governments called for an “attractivity boom” to bring in talent affected by funding reductions and research interference. The letter, signed by France, Czechia, Austria, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Spain, Slovenia, Germany, Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania, urges the European Commission to take action to draw more researchers to the EU.

ASIA PACIFIC

To-do list – Government agencies in the Philippines are developing the Climate Finance Strategy (CFS) to help finance climate priorities, support active membership in the global multilateral funds, and scale up sustainable finance efforts through the Inter-Agency Task Force on Sustainable Finance (ITSF), according to the Philippine News Agency. The task force is also prioritising the crafting of a policy and legal framework for carbon markets and the potential for financing green projects. The country’s finance department is also coordinating with the World Bank for its support for a technical working group on carbon pricing instruments.

The governor speaks – The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended has advocated for creating a pool of bankable projects to increase the flow of climate finance. The Governor Sanjay Malhotra recently said that Indian banks and non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) have limited capacity and expertise which further limits their ability to assess and finance climate change mitigation projects well while increasing the risks associated with funding these projects. Having a pool or collection of financially viable and investment-ready projects can offer multiple benefits, said the governor, suggesting that experienced financial institutions that operate under RBI supervision can contribute to this pool of projects and exchange information, Mongabay reported.

Backwater credits – The Kochi Water Metro in the Indian state of Kerela, is eyeing a substantial additional revenue by monetising the carbon credits it earned through its contribution towards the reduction of GHG emissions, the New Indian Express reported. To facilitate this, the Kerala Water Metro (KWML) has floated a tender for the validation, registration, verification, issuance, and trading of carbon credits. Currently, the entity has deployed 18 ferries on five routes and the first phase of project proposes to connect 38 terminals on 15 identified routes spread across 78 km by operating a fleet of 78 fast, electrically-propelled hybrid ferries. The target is to achieve a reduction of 22,800 tonnes of CO2 emissions by the end of the first phase and the entity has already achieved nearly 20% of the target, KWML said. While the KMRL had entered into a pact with EKI Energy, India’s biggest developer, it has not yet materialised, the media outlet added.

Peak carbon – China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has added a batch of 27 regions to its pilot of cities and areas tasked with hitting peak carbon emissions early. The additions are primarily large industrial parks, including in Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, as well as in provinces such as Jiangsu, Jilin, and Zhejiang. Regional DRCs are now asked to help draw up plans for reaching the goals.

Guide – China’s Guangdong province has issued a notice to provide more clarity for emitters to surrender their emissions permits under the local scheme by July 20, following an allocation plan published earlier this month. Companies are allowed to use offsets issued under the national CCER scheme and Guangdong’s regional voluntary programmes for compliance purposes, with an upper limit of 10%. Priority should be given to credits generated from projects within the Guangdong region, according to the notice.

Jet lagging – Japan’s oil refiners want concrete regulations that are needed to push airlines to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and support supply chain development, the head of the industry lobby said last week. Japan targets 1.7 mln kl of SAF by 2030 to replace 10% of jet fuel with cleaner alternatives by 2030. While refiners face mandates, no binding rules exist for airlines. Petroleum Association of Japan President Shunichi Kito said both suppliers and consumers need regulations, urging cost-sharing and government support for SAF supply chains.

New market – Japanese sustainability solution provider Asuene has formed a business partnership with two Taiwanese companies, Shin Chang Trading and InSynerger, for its expansion in the neighbouring country, it announced Friday. The three companies will support clients in their decarbonisation and ESG efforts as environmental regulations in Taiwan are expected to be strengthened in the coming years.

Domestic expansion – Project developer Bywill has secured a new partnership with Ogaki Kyoritsu Bank and Gifu prefecture’s Kobe town to promote the creation of domestically issued J-Credits. Bywill has formed more than 100 similar partnerships with financial institutions and local governments across Japan over the past two years, company data showed.

Trump ‘hit list’ – The US DOE appears to be creating a “hit list” of clean energy projects awarded billions of dollars in government funding, according to sources who spoke to Politico. Journalists wrote Trump officials have requested the list by the end of the week, including projects under the IRA. Any programme or project that has spent less than 45% of its appropriated of awarded funding is required to be reviewed. Carbon Pulse reached out to the DOE for comment but did not receive a response.

Not on EDF’s watch – US environmental non-profit Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging the US EPA’s extension of the reporting deadline for the federal Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. The EPA filed the extension on Thursday, shifting the deadline for reporting year 2024 from Mar. 31 to May 30. The measure did not take any public comment. EDF alleged that the delay was unlawful and filed a petition for review in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The lawsuit is one of several that EDF has filed against the EPA under the Trump administration.

Big oil battle – A District of Columbia judge heard arguments on Thursday on whether Chevron and other major energy companies should be held financially responsible for climate change impacts. DC Superior Court Judge Yvonne Williams considered industry lawyers’ motions to dismiss the case, citing similar lawsuits dismissed in other state courts. Attorneys for oil companies argued that state courts are not the proper venue for such claims. If successful, the lawsuits could cost the fossil fuel industry hundreds of billions of dollars. Williams said she would issue a ruling in four to six weeks.

Rolling along – A proposed clean fuel standard is making its way through Hawaii legislature, according to bill filings published Thursday. SB 1120 was referred to the House Finance Committee after making its way through the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee. The bill text currently proposes a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2035, and an at least 50% reduction by 2050, both relative to 2019 levels.

ECCC boasts climate gains – The Canadian federal government released its 2025 National Inventory Report Friday, showing that national greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 dropped by 8.5% from 2005 levels, equivalent to nearly 700 MtCO2. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) suggests that this data shows that Canada’s climate and pollution policies are working. “This year’s final National Inventory Report shows that even as Canada’s economy has become stronger, and more sustainable, the emissions intensity of our economic growth has decreased by 34%,” the agency said in a press release Friday. “Canada’s emissions are now the lowest they have been in 27 ears, excluding the pandemic years, and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.”

Chemists weigh in – Canada’s Chemistry Industry Association (CIAC) has called for a review of industrial carbon pricing rules in light of ongoing trade and tariff tensions. While CIAC supports carbon pricing as a tool to drive emissions reductions and investment in low-carbon projects, it urged policymakers to reassess the system’s fit for energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries. The statement comes as Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, has suspended the federal consumer carbon tax but pledged to retain and improve industrial carbon pricing.

Canadian energy poverty – A study examining energy spending by Canadian households, and the extent of energy poverty across the country, has found 11% of households were energy poor in 2021 — when in–home energy expenditures, such as electricity and natural gas, and gasoline were included. The study, by right-leaning think tank Fraser Institute, defined energy poverty as spending 10% or more on energy expenditures. Regional disparities in energy poverty appear pronounced. In 2021, Atlantic Canada had the highest incidence of energy poverty at 24.6% of households, while British Columbia had the lowest in the country, at 8.1%.

Passage on pause – The Panama Canal Authority has yet to provide guidance on its Low-Carbon Transit Slot initiative, set to launch on Apr. 1. Initially announced in Aug. 2024 as part of efforts to decarbonise shipping and achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050, the programme aims to encourage energy efficiency measures and low-carbon technologies. The delay, announced in Nov. 2024, followed an analysis of eligibility criteria, including energy efficiency indicators, fuel types, and regional infrastructure availability.

New biochar system – French biochar developer NetZero has launched a new modular system for large-scale biochar production, which it said will halve land requirements and double output compared to its current technology. The company, a finalist in the XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition, said the patented ‘Gen2’ system was designed to accelerate deployment, lower costs, and improve performance by reducing the need for concrete and steel by 90% and 80% respectively. The first units will be deployed this year in biochar projects using coffee and sugarcane residues in Brazil. NetZero aims to reach 1 mln tonnes of CO2 removal annually by 2030.

Mangrove permanence – Land uplift and related sea level changes could reshape blue carbon ecosystems, affecting their carbon storage potential and restoration strategies, according to a recent study published in ScienceDirect. The research highlights how a 2004 tsunami-driven uplift in Indian island North Andaman degraded large areas of mangroves and led to vegetation shifts that altered carbon dynamics across the region. As sea levels permanently dropped, terrestrial forests replaced mangroves in areas where tidal flooding ceased, while mangroves migrated seaward, colonising former reef beds now exposed by the retreating coastline. Blue carbon projects should factor in long-term geomorphological changes when assessing carbon stocks and ecosystem resilience, as land movement can create new carbon sinks but also disrupt existing ones, the research concluded.

AVIATION

Verification for Dummies – ICAO has provided guidance on verification of CORSIA-eligible fuel claims, providing VVBs bodies with a structured framework for assessing aeroplane operators’ emissions reduction claims related to the use of CORSIA eligible fuels (CEFs). Developed by ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), the guidance supports the implementation of Annex 16, Volume IV, and ensures consistency and integrity in emissions reporting under the international aviation offsetting programme. Verification follows a six-step approach: confirming sustainability certification through Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) or Compliance (PoC); tracing documentation back to the last certified entity in the fuel supply chain; validating the operator’s monitoring and reporting systems; checking the Emissions Report and supplementary CEF template for accuracy; ensuring no double claiming of emissions reductions; and reporting any post-verification findings to the State. Claims lacking a verifiable PoS/PoC or traceability to certified entities must be excluded. A key focus is on preventing double claiming of emissions reductions, especially for Scope 1 emissions. Operators must declare participation in other GHG reduction schemes and confirm that no claims have been duplicated. Verification bodies must assess both documentation and internal processes to ensure compliance. Risks associated with non-certified fuel traders, fuel resale, or overlapping claims across schemes must be thoroughly evaluated. The guidance also acknowledges challenges such as documentation time lags and evolving reporting systems. It outlines a variety of supporting documents – mandatory and optional – that may be used to substantiate claims.

AND FINALLY…

Melting away – Glaciers across many regions in the world may not survive this century if current melting trends continue, posing a threat to the millions of people living downstream, UN climate experts warned on Thursday. Ahead of the the first World Day for Glaciers, experts said there have been irreversible changes within the past few years, with the period over 2022-24 experiencing the largest-ever three-year loss. For instance, in central Europe, almost 40% of the remaining ice has melted, they said. “If this continues at the current rate, glaciers will not survive this century in the Alps,” Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) at the University of Zurich, said in a statement.",https://carbon-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favicon.png,N,,2025-03-24 07:57:38.674728

Le croisement entre le développement des technologies des piles à combustible et la volonté mondiale de rendre le secteur de l’aviation plus durable crée un espace sur le marché pour les avions à hydrogène, qui constituent une approche pour rendre les voyages aériens plus durables. Les rapports d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts » et « Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2025-2035: Technologies, Players, Forecasts », se concentrent sur les technologies émergentes liées à la décarbonisation de l’industrie aéronautique.

Les projets d’Airbus en matière d’hydrogène

Airbus, l’un des principaux constructeurs d’avions opérant en Europe, s’était fixé pour objectif de commercialiser un avion fonctionnant à l’hydrogène d’ici le milieu des années 2030, ouvrant ainsi la voie à un transport aérien plus durable. Cependant, des informations récentes ont indiqué que cet objectif serait retardé en raison d’une sous-estimation du temps nécessaire à l’installation des infrastructures et des technologies requises pour lancer l’aviation à hydrogène.

La nouvelle date de lancement prévue pour le projet se situe désormais dans les années 2040, ce qui met en évidence les défis liés à cette nouvelle technologie, en particulier dans un secteur aussi vaste que l’industrie aéronautique. Bien que ce projet d’avion ne soit qu’une goutte d’eau dans l’océan des objectifs de décarbonisation, son lancement ouvrirait la voie à d’autres entreprises.

IDTechEx propose différentes approches pour une aviation durable

Le dernier rapport d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts », couvre le potentiel de diverses approches de la durabilité dans l’aviation, qui comprend les piles à hydrogène ainsi que la combustion d’hydrogène, les avions électriques à batterie, etc.

Le carburant d’aviation durable (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF) est actuellement la principale approche de la durabilité dans le secteur, en attendant que les piles à hydrogène puissent être adoptées. Le rapport d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2025-2035: Technologies, Players, Forecasts », considère en détail les SAF comme la prochaine grande tendance dans la décarbonisation de ce secteur, avec des exigences réglementaires dans de nombreuses régions pour la mise en œuvre de certains pourcentages de SAF parallèlement au kérosène traditionnel. Issu d’huiles de cuisson usagées et de graisses végétales plutôt que de sources pétrolières conventionnelles, le SAF, dont les processus de production réduisent les émissions de carbone, constitue une approche plus respectueuse de l’environnement pour alimenter les avions.

Alors que les avions à hydrogène sont de plus en plus encouragés, le SAF semble être la meilleure solution d’ores et déjà disponible. Virgin a été la première à faire voler un avion alimenté à 100 % en SAF de Londres Heathrow à New York JFK, soulignant ainsi les capacités du SAF à fonctionner aussi bien que le carburant ordinaire, malgré les coûts de production, comme le détaille le rapport d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2025-2035 : Technologies, Players, Forecasts ».

Coûts environnementaux des nouvelles technologies

Les coûts environnementaux de la production d’hydrogène font l’objet d’un débat qui, à court terme, peut sembler s’opposer aux incitations à en tirer profit à long terme. Comme pour toute nouvelle technologie nécessitant des infrastructures et des investissements pour décoller, il existe un compromis entre les coûts initiaux et les avantages de la mise en œuvre à long terme, qui peut également être considéré comme prévalant avec les SAF.

The Cessna Citation Longitude is the biggest Cessna jet ever made, more than 50% longer than the Citation II.
The Cessna 408 SkyCourier Cessna has produced the single-engine 208 Caravan since the 1980s.
Inside the 408 This Cessna plane features a Garmin G1000 NXI glass cockpit as standard, while 19 passengers can fit inside the passenger version.
The Cessna Citation Longitude Cessna is best known for its iconic 172 Skyhawk, a plane with a smaller wingspan than the original Wright Flyer.","Cessna is one of the great success stories in aviation. The Cessna 172 is the most produced aircraft ever made, and the company also produces the popular Cessna 182 Skylane, 206 Stationair, and the 208 Caravan. These planes are propellor aircraft used for personal transport and for utility work in the case of the 206 as well as the turboprop-driven 208.

Then, there's the latest Cessna 408 SkyCourier , the largest propellor-driven Cessna has ever made. With two turboprop engines and a passenger capacity of up to 19, this is a plane so big that Textron Aviation, Cessna's parent company, had to redesign its manufacturing plant to assemble the plane.

But also in the Cessna lineup are the Citation business jets. Introduced in 1972, the Citation series is one of the most successful business jet families in history. While most of these planes are small, light jets or very-light jets designed for short flights with a handful of passengers, the Cessna Citation Longitude is not.

The Cessna Citation Longitude is the biggest Cessna jet ever made, more than 50% longer than the Citation II. This and the SkyCourier are the biggest planes that Cessna has ever made from its two main types of aircraft. Today, we're going to explore Cessna's biggest propellor plane and its biggest jet aircraft.

The Cessna 408 SkyCourier

Cessna has produced the single-engine 208 Caravan since the 1980s. With over 3,000 units produced, the type has proved popular with militaries, air freight, and commuters. The Caravan has undergone numerous modifications to its basic design, and multiple variants have been developed. However, in 2017, Cessna unveiled a new entry into this market space.

At the request of FedEx Express, Cessna developed a clean-sheet design that would be both larger and more capable than the Caravan. Dubbed the Cessna 408 SkyCourier , nearly 50 have been constructed since the aircraft entered service in 2022, and Textron announced at the plane's launch that FedEx Express had ordered up to 100 examples to be used for its Feeder brand.

The Cessna 408 is nearly 20 ft (6 m) longer than the 208 Caravan, with a 20 ft (6 m) wider wingspan. Its Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) is more than twice that of the Caravan, and its two Pratt & Whitney Canada turboprops make nearly double the horsepower of the 208's single motor.

Flying with two engines as opposed to one makes the 408 far more capable and faster than the Caravan, all the while being operated by just a single pilot. Just like all Cessna propellor planes, the 408 SkyCourier features a high-wing design, and the plane is equipped with rugged fixed landing gear designed to tackle rough fields.

The 408 comes with many features to improve time efficiency, such as single-point refueling, which reduces turnaround time. The plane also comes in three versions, to capture different market segments.

A freighter version.

A passenger version for commuter airlines.

A ""combi"" variant that has nine seats in the front of the cabin and a cargo hold taking up the rear half of the aircraft.

Inside the 408

This Cessna plane features a Garmin G1000 NXI glass cockpit as standard, while 19 passengers can fit inside the passenger version. This plane is not pressurized, so while it can be flown up to 25,000 ft, most operators will typically cruise much lower.

Inside, the seats are removable in a process that can typically take less than an hour, permitting operators to use the plane for both passenger and cargo flights. The cabin is arranged in a three-abreast two-one layout and features a generous 32"" seat pitch. There's also enough headroom for most people to stand up straight, and the plane even features overhead bins, unlike the 208 Caravan.

The freighter version, meanwhile, features a huge cargo door with space inside the cabin for three LD3 containers. Cessna also offers a wide range of options to suit the needs of various customers, such as cargo nets and floor rollers.

The Cessna Citation Longitude

Cessna is best known for its iconic 172 Skyhawk, a plane with a smaller wingspan than the original Wright Flyer. But the company also produces the highly successful Citation business jet family. With thousands being delivered across 53 years and a dozen main variants, the Citation has brought Cessna great success over the years.

The Cessna Citation Longitude is the largest business jet ever made by the legendary company. Developed from the Citation Latitude, this all-aluminum plane was first announced in 2012 and entered service seven years later in 2019.

At 73 ft 2 in (22.3 m) long and weighing over 23,389 lb (10,609) empty, the Longitude is the longest, heaviest, and most capable aircraft that Cessna has ever made. Its two Honeywell turbofans can produce well over 7,000 lbs of thrust each, and the aircraft can fly a maximum distance of 3,500 NM (6,482 KM), meaning that it can operate short transatlantic flights, such as between London-City and Teterboro.

This jet actually has a narrower wingspan than the Cessna 408 SkyCourier, and its tail stands slightly below the 408. However, it has a wing area of 537 sq ft (49.9 meters squared), meaning that its wing is overall much bigger than the one on the SkyCourier. It was also given a low-wing design, which is typical of a jet aircraft.

Inside the Longitude

The Cessna 408 is a plane made for work. It was designed to carry paying passengers and containers for decades without compromising reliability, The Longitude is a different type of aircraft, designed with comfort in mind to appeal to wealthy buyers.

The Longitude can seat between eight and 12 people, which is less than the capacity of the 408. However, the SkyCourier is a utility plane first and foremost. The Cessna 408 in its passenger form essentially operates like a mini airliner, with rows of economy-style seats and overhead bins. It will carry passengers, cargo, or both across short distances, and it was designed to be both cheap to run and reliable.

The Longitude still features a row of seats, this time in a one-one layout, but these seats are designed with comfort and style in mind. The legroom is limitless, and the entire inch of the cabin can be customized to fit any customer's desires, such as changing the cabin sidewalls or adding a sofa.

Despite being powered by two noisy jet engines, passengers wouldn't be able to tell the difference, as the Longitude features one of the quietest cabins in its class. Onboard, passengers are also in for a more physically relaxing experience, as the Citation Longitude features an ambient cabin altitude of around 6,000 ft, similar to an Airbus A350 or Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Flight crews meanwhile, are treated to a Garmin G5000 avionics system, with five main screens and an optional Heads-Up Display (HUD).

Cessna: A never-ending story of success

These two planes are another example of the success that Cessna has enjoyed. The company has not only followed up on making a larger complement to the utility-focused Cessna 208, but they also continue to iterate on the Citation business jet, with the Longitude being the biggest version yet.

The company originally started out making small, piston-powered aircraft for general aviation, but then they expanded into the business jet market, and then they entered another new market with the 208 Caravan. Now, they continue to find tremendous success in both categories.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/artboard-16_9-5-3.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 07:57:47.719392

That consensus has translated to the commitment during the last COP conference to reach 5 per cent of SAF by 2030.
“At the moment it is very costly because supply is not enough, the price that is set for it is still very high.","SWITCHING to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 will be a costly marathon for airports.

But it is possible.

This is the view of Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific and Middle East director general Stefano Baronci, who stressed the need for vital stakeholder engagements in prioritising sustainable growth.

The airport sector, he said, is the first to commit to net zero emission, a target shared by other aviation stakeholders and formalised at the last ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) assembly.

“From an airport perspective, we have to make sure the service on the ground can reach that level of due diligence from an environmental perspective; and you do that through the electrification of the service,” Mr Baronci told this newspaper in an interview in Suva yesterday.

He cited examples like the use of hybrid or electrical vehicles on the ground, renewable energy and solar panels for the region.

“And then of course, you have to create the right dialogue with the airlines to planning long term on how to reduce emissions of the aircraft.

“This is certainly a much more difficult challenge to win because it requires tools like SAF.

“The supply is still not there to meet the demand. The cost is still too high, and again, this is where partnership with supplier industries and authorities will be essential.”

Mr Baronci, who is in Fiji attending the 3rd Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting at the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in Suva, said aviation stakeholders and authorities have been reaching a consensus, an area where industries, suppliers and authorities have to work together and prioritise their efforts.

That consensus has translated to the commitment during the last COP conference to reach 5 per cent of SAF by 2030.

“This is certainly a very important achievement,” he said. “As airports, we can do only to a certain extent but of course we have to create again the right environment, we have to prepare to install the right infrastructure when SAF will be ready.

“In my view it’s possible because it is the best way to reduce emissions. I don’t have the crystal ball for it but I think it requires the engagement of all.

“You need to work by adjusting your processes, by adjusting solutions, and this is what we have to commit to, all of us.

“At the moment it is very costly because supply is not enough, the price that is set for it is still very high.

The aspiration is that once the supply will be there, the cost will be lower and eventually will be economically sustainable.”

For the Pacific aviation sector to achieve this, he said coordination from the top was essential by having a policy framework, and to ensure to be able to monitor the price of SAF.

“We cannot play on our own, we cannot play in silos and this in my view is the most difficult part to manage but there is the commitment of the big airlines, the big airports of States to do so.”",https://www.fijitimes.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_4603-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 22:56:15.669805

“We’re proud to achieve our third consecutive month of industry-leading reliability, while scheduling and operating more daily flights on average than any other Australian carrier in February,” Mr Norman said.

“We’ve been working hard to improve our operational performance over the past 12 months, and achieving our strongest OTP of the past two years and exceeding the long-term average reflects this hard work.

“While factors like weather will sometimes require unplanned changes to our schedule, getting our guests to their destinations safely and on time is a priority.”
