So, I’ve always had a kind of interest in water treatment processes.
I really thought a career in the water sector could be rewarding and fulfilling.
There’s real global uncertainty in the future of sewage sludge management.","Principal bioresources process specialist, AtkinsRéalis

I GRADUATED with a master’s in chemical engineering from the University of Strathclyde in 2018. I’ve worked at Atkins -Réalis since graduating in a variety of roles in and around the water sector. I started with some drinking water work, then did some desalination work in the Middle East, and now currently my job title is principal bioresources process specialist. Essentially, I focus on how process technology can help tackle some of the water sector’s most pressing challenges associated with wastewater treatment and sewage sludge management.

What attracted you to the sector?

I always had a kind of natural pull towards water treatment. Even back at high school I did my advanced higher chemistry project looking at using roasted banana peel – which you might even now call biochar – as a means of removing heavy metals from water. And I did my master’s thesis in looking at selective recovery of copper from acid mine drainage. So, I’ve always had a kind of interest in water treatment processes. I really thought a career in the water sector could be rewarding and fulfilling. And I also always liked the idea that you could recover some value from waste.

What attracted you to your role?

My role really centres around looking at how process technologies can be utilised to best process sewage sludge, which can typically be the arrow out of the end of the wastewater treatment flow sheet. There’s real global uncertainty in the future of sewage sludge management. This is driven by challenges from public perception issues, contamination, through to things like microplastics and PFAS, process emissions and regulatory uncertainty. And at the same time, we’re wising up to the real energy and nutrient value in sewage sludge and looking at wastewater in general as a sort of feedstock for the circular economy. So, I was attracted to this role in the AtkinsRealis bioresources team, so I could be part of deploying some of the fascinating chemical engineering taking place in the sector.

What does your typical day or week involve?

I’ve got a real variety in my workdays, which I guess is a benefit to working for a consultancy. Often, you’re involved in quite different types of projects, and it makes for a really good way to build up a nice breadth of experience early in your career. Day to day, I manage projects with civil, mechanical, electrical, geotechnical and hydraulic engineers, speak with regulatory experts and work with other process engineers and design, and prepare and run a lot of workshops. I help to develop biosolids management strategies, which requires a bit of creativity, which is nice. I discuss technologies with vendors, which is always interesting, and get to be competitive when preparing proposals for winning work.

What's the most exciting development or opportunity in your field that you wish more people knew about?

One of my favourites, we’re looking at filtering out toilet paper or cellulose pulp from sewage. We’re interested in the downstream benefits of that process, what happens downstream at the wastewater treatment works when you take the cellulose pulp toilet paper out. We’re also looking at what we can do with that cellulose pulp, so one of the avenues is looking at fermentation of that into green chemicals. I’m also supporting on a project where we’re looking at turning a significant portion of the UK’s sewage sludge into jet fuel – that is actually a thing! There’s a process called hydrothermal liquefaction which breaks organic matter such as sewage sludge into a biocrude oil, which can then be refined into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). So, lots of cool things going on.

What IChemE resources do you recommend students use to help them take the first steps in their career

I generally found IChemE’s Chartership programme really useful in shaping the initial years of my career. It ensured I got a good broad range of technical and general experience. And it really helped me, with my mentor, sort out target areas of development. In addition, I’d also advocate for engaging with special interest groups (SIGs) and attending IChemE events. I think it’s a really great way to learn more but, importantly, expand your network, which is something I’ve found to be really vital in my career so far.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/22935/1012studenthero.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-10-02 17:56:59.143117

The company is gaining momentum thanks to strong demand in the U.S. and a new partnership with Boeing Defense, Space & Security.

Palantir’s data analytics and AI platforms are becoming more important. They impact both government and commercial markets. At the same time, investors remain focused on whether the AI company can balance growth with its high valuation.

From Data to Defense: Palantir’s Boeing Breakthrough

The company’s latest deal with Boeing is a key reason behind its recent stock rally. Boeing will integrate Palantir’s Foundry platform across its defense and space operations. Foundry will help Boeing manage data better, optimize supply chains, and make smarter decisions in its manufacturing facilities.

Steve Parker, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, noted:

“The game-changing capabilities this provides us … is it allows us to make decisions not in weeks, but in days and hours…This is really the AI synthesizing data, allowing us to make decisions.”

For Boeing, the partnership offers tools. These tools help cut costs from supply chain delays and production issues. For Palantir, it strengthens credibility with one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the world. This collaboration also shows how Palantir’s technology can move beyond government contracts into major commercial and industrial operations.

Palantir has been steadily growing its commercial business. Today, over 40% of its revenue comes from commercial clients. This is a shift from earlier years, when it focused almost entirely on government work. The Boeing partnership is expected to help drive more adoption of Palantir’s AI solutions across industries.

U.S. Market Momentum: Earnings on the Rise

Palantir’s financial performance in 2025 has been marked by rapid expansion in the U.S. market. In its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $884 million, beating analyst expectations.

U.S. commercial revenue grew 71% year over year, while U.S. government contracts rose 45%. These results show that Palantir is successfully expanding its reach in both defense and commercial sectors.

However, the picture is not equally strong across all regions. Palantir’s European commercial revenue fell by about 5%, suggesting weaker demand outside the U.S.

Even so, the company raised its full-year revenue forecast to nearly $3.9 billion, reflecting confidence in continued growth.

Investors have taken note of this momentum. Palantir shares have recovered from their late summer pullback, gaining nearly 18% and trading close to previous highs at $185. Analysts have set price targets that suggest further upside if the company can keep delivering growth.

AI in the Sky: Why Boeing Chose Palantir

The Boeing agreement shows how Palantir is placing itself at the heart of digital change in defense and aerospace. Boeing will use Palantir’s software to integrate data across its factories and programs. This could help the company predict supply chain issues, make decisions faster, and boost the readiness of its defense systems.

For Palantir, the partnership shows that its platforms can be applied to large-scale industrial problems. It may also open doors to further contracts with aerospace and defense companies worldwide. As more companies use AI-driven analytics, Palantir can grow in industries that need efficiency and security.

Mike Gallagher, Palantir’s head of defense, remarked on this partnership, saying:

“type of partnership that I think has the possibility to unlock transformation within the defense industrial base and enhance deterrence in the near term, not in a matter of distant decades.”

The deal also adds to Palantir’s credibility with investors. Palantir’s tech works well beyond government and niche markets. Their partnerships with big companies show this clearly. Instead, it is proving useful in some of the most complex and regulated industries.

Riding the Wave of Explosive Growth in AI and Data Analytics

The global data analytics software market is growing fast. In 2024, it was worth about $69 billion, and it’s expected to climb to $302 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~28%.

Meanwhile, the enterprise AI market could expand from around $97 billion in 2025 to $229.3 billion by 2030, growing at ~18.9 % per year.

These trends show strong demand for tools like Palantir’s platforms. As more companies adopt AI and analytics, Palantir may benefit from this rising tide of investment and interest.

Behind these financial and market momentum, the AI company is also paying attention to its sustainability commitments.

ESG and Emission Reduction: Palantir’s Net Zero Pathway

Palantir has committed to reaching net zero emissions across all scopes under its 2021 Climate Pledge. The company is working to cut emissions where possible and balance the rest with high-quality carbon offsets. This shows an effort to address both immediate impacts and long-term climate goals.

In 2019, Palantir set a baseline for its greenhouse gas emissions. By 2024, total emissions had risen slightly to about 23,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, a reduction of about 31% compared to the 2019 baseline. This increase of 1.7% from 2023 was due to a gradual return to business travel and operational activities. But overall emissions per employee have dropped 57% since 2019.

The company also achieved carbon neutrality for its UK operations in 2023, covering remaining emissions through offsets.

To support this progress, Palantir is taking these actions:

Invests in better measurement and reporting. This improves how the company tracks emissions from business travel, cloud computing, and employee commuting.

It uses energy-efficient data centers and optimizes software workloads to reduce cloud computing emissions.

For emissions it can’t fully cut, it buys verified offsets and uses sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for travel.

Overall, Palantir’s ESG strategy shows steady progress. While the reductions are gradual, the company is building systems to manage its footprint while aligning with broader net-zero goals.

Flying High or Overvalued? What’s Next for PLTR

Palantir’s path depends on its success in moving from government contracts to commercial industries. The Boeing partnership shows progress on this front, while strong U.S. demand continues to fuel revenue growth.

At the same time, investors remain aware of risks tied to valuation and uneven international performance. The company’s challenge will be to prove that it can replicate U.S. growth in other markets and continue delivering large-scale contracts.

If Palantir succeeds, it could strengthen its status as a top AI-driven software company. This would boost its influence in both public and private sectors. The coming quarters will reveal whether the Boeing deal and other partnerships translate into long-term performance.

As the company looks ahead, success will depend on expanding its global presence, managing valuation concerns, and delivering measurable results from its partnerships. For now, Palantir remains a key player to watch in the evolving world of AI and data analytics.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2556211139.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:57:31.422952

Green Taxi’s founder and chief executive David Valaer describes the Plano, Texas-based company’s technology as a retrofit allowing airlines to taxi jets using an electric motor in the main landing gear, powered by the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit (APU).

Valaer says the Zero Engine Taxi system could help airlines reduce fuel burn from running one or both engines at low thrust on taxiways. He also envisions ”faster, more efficient turns with reduced tug use” and reduced overall emissions.

The start-up claims the system could save commercial jet operators about $300,000 per aircraft annually through less fuel burn.

Delta confirmed the partnership with the electric taxi technology developer last month. It will initially see Delta use its operational experience to help Green Taxi optimise its system for regional aircraft.

But Delta says its big-picture vision for the system’s use ”extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline”.

”The Green Taxi partnership is another example of Delta’s approach to impact what it can control today while innovating future technologies like scaling sustainable aviation fuel and revolutionary fleet development,” the airline says.

Green Taxi Aerospace earlier this year launched a partnership with StandardAero aimed at US certification of the Zero Engine Taxi on Embraer 175s.

US regional carriers Republic Airways and SkyWest Airlines fly dozens of E175s on behalf of Delta under the Delta Connection brand.

Delta also recently added Dutch firm Maeve Aerospace to its technology incubator, with an an agreement to “advance development” of the start-up’s conceptual hybrid-electric Maeve Jet.

The Atlanta-based airline describes itself as Maeve’s “North American airline partner”, with plans to ”lend its operational expertise” in developing the regional aircraft.

The funding, awarded by the Department for Transport, will support a detailed feasibility study into creating Power-to-Liquid SAF, a next-generation fuel made using renewable electricity and captured carbon, at or near the airport.

The project was initiated by the University of Sheffield and is being supported by Leeds North West MP Katie White, who has helped bring together industry, academic and regional partners.

Over the next eight months, the study will explore how this clean fuel – which can be used in today’s aircraft without changing engines or infrastructure – could possibly be produced and deployed at scale from a Yorkshire base. If successful, it could lead to major investment and job creation in the region, with the final report due in 2026.

Unlike biofuels, Power-to-Liquid SAF doesn’t rely on crops or waste. Instead, it uses renewable electricity to convert water and recycled carbon into a synthetic jet fuel with a much lower carbon footprint – a technology widely seen as key to decarbonising long-haul flights.

Katie White MP said: “Leeds is built for this kind of innovation. We have the talent, the ambition, and a track record of turning green innovation into real-world impact. This funding is a crucial step towards making sustainable jet fuel a reality at Leeds Bradford.

“It’s about cutting emissions in one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, and creating the skilled jobs and investment that come with it. I’m proud to see our region leading the way.”

Professor Piers Forster, former Chair of the Climate Change Committee and Director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, said: “Aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise… current sustainable aviation fuels are made from waste fat or energy crops.

“They are not considered a long-term solution, as making our own would use more than 50% of UK farmland, which we need to grow our food. Instead, we will make a technological leap forward – generating fuels directly from renewable electricity, in a so-called “power to liquid approach.”

Vincent Hodder, CEO of Leeds Bradford Airport, said: “This initiative will strengthen our shared goal of accelerating the UK’s efforts to meet its net-zero emissions targets by 2050.

“Investment in decarbonising aviation will benefit not only our local community but also contribute to the broader national effort towards sustainable air travel and a greener future. We can’t wait to get started.”

Bombardier's Global 7500 Jet Soars to New Heights With its 150th Speed Record, Building on its Industry-Defining Record-Setting Performance Back to video

Article content

MONTRÉAL, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Bombardier today announced that its industry-defining Global 7500 business jet just notched a new performance milestone with its 150th speed record(1), the most ever set by a single business aircraft type. The latest achievements attained by this blazing fast business aircraft include key city pair speed records, such as Tokyo to Los Angeles, Toronto to Paris, New York to London and Hong Kong to Montreal. What’s more, the aircraft averaged a speed in excess of 1,000 km/hr on 20 of its record-setting missions, bringing passengers to their destinations in record time.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a lifelong family farmer and a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, led over 45 Senate and House colleagues in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize a rule on imported Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) and hold firm on the proposed biomass-based diesel volumes.

In their bipartisan, bicameral letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the members state such measures would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) continues to strengthen American energy security and support both American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically,” the members said.

In June, the EPA proposed record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in its Set 2 proposal and included a 50% reduction in RINs for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction).

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called ‘used cooking oil’ from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture and manufacturing,” the members continued.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal, saying it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation and manufacturing – particularly in rural communities.

Additional cosigners include Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Michael Rounds (R-S.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).

In the House, the letter was signed by Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Angie Craig (D-Minn.), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Derek Schmidt (R-Kan.), Brad Finstad (R-Minn.), Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.), Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), Don Bacon (R-Neb.), Tracey Mann (R-Kan.), Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), Max Miller (R-Ohio), James Baird (R-Ind.), Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.), James Comer (R-Ky.), Mike Bost (R-Ill.), David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), John Rose (R-Tenn.), Erin Houchin (R-Ind.), Mark Messmer (R-Ind.), Ron Estes (R-Kan.), Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.), Mark Alford (R-Mo.), Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Mich.), Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Rudy Yakym (R-Ind.), Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.), Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.).

Organizations endorsing the letter include the American Soybean Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Oilseed Processors Association and the National Sorghum Producers.

Grassley helped establish the RFS in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and has worked to ensure the executive branch implements the law as intended. In April, Grassley and Klobuchar urged the EPA to restore integrity, stability and growth to the RFS and the U.S. biofuel sector by raising RVO levels for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. The Biden-era EPA set RVOs at levels that fail to align with market conditions and production outlook, which has contributed to biodiesel plant closures in the Midwest.

The Honorable Lee M. Zeldin

Administrator

Environmental Protection Agency

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW

Washington, D.C. 20460

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We thank the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for proposing record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in the Set 2 proposal and for including a 50 percent reduction in Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction). The combination of the strong BBD volumes coupled with prioritizing U.S. feedstocks represents a commonsense approach that puts American farmers first, strengthens domestic biofuel markets, and delivers tangible economic benefits to rural communities.

Soybean oil may only represent 20 percent of the bean, but it accounts for more than half of its value in the U.S. market, and about half of that oil is used to make advanced biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. That means roughly a quarter of every bushel's value processed here in the U.S. is directly tied to biofuel demand. At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal: it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities where oilseed processing facilities are located. This is exactly the outcome Congress intended when it created and expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The Import RIN reduction also aligns with Congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called “used cooking oil” from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufacturing.

For these reasons, we urge EPA to finalize the Import RIN reduction as proposed and to hold firm on the biomass-based diesel volumes in the rule. Finalizing the proposal would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard delivers on its promises of strengthening U.S. energy security, supporting American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers, and keeping investment and jobs here at home.

More sensible New Yorkers did their best to avoid the melee, but New Private Markets dove right in last week and scurried from one event to another to get a sense of the mood at Climate Week, the first since Donald Trump began his second term as US president.

Trump, of course, delivered a characteristically long-winded and pugnacious speech on 23 September at the UN, labelling climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and criticising the organisation for raising the alarm about global warming.

“If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” he said.

Climate Week attendees put on a stoic face as Trump’s combative words hung over the proceedings, but many people present admitted that this year’s festivities had a more subdued tone, saying that the optimism and confidence of previous years had given way to a feeling of quiet resolve.

At the outset in the late 2000s, Climate Week was permeated by rampant optimism that change was afoot. That sense soon gave way to the realisation that a lot of hard work had to be done. This year the atmosphere was described by one prominent manager as “sober”.

As NPM heard from one institutional investor, Trump’s words put a damper on things, but climate investments continue as countries around the world make an inexorable, if halting, advance to a low-carbon economy. Earlier this year, for example, we documented how blue-state pensions were pushing on with climate investment plans.

In fact, as if to underscore the point, Net Zero Tracker released its annual report during Climate Week, revealing that the number of global organisations that have implemented net-zero targets continues to rise. And in the US, Net Zero Tracker found that company commitments to net-zero plans had grown 9 percent in the past year, including new commitments from eBay, Merck & Co and Goodyear.

Not everyone is impressed by commitments. One data centre developer we spoke to scoffed at the notion that companies were adopting new net-zero targets or even sticking to previously announced plans, at least in the technology sector. Tech titans may make all the right noises, they said, but their needs for new data centres to power the AI boom outweigh concerns for the environment. As Microsoft said in February: nearly five years after it announced its “moonshot” sustainability goals in 2020, “the moon has gotten further away”.

Among GPs, meanwhile, some fund managers insisted their firms were sticking to net-zero plans, while others were applying targets on a case-by-case basis.

One fund manager said that 80 percent of portfolio companies in his firm’s next fund will likely adhere to the Corporate Net-Zero Standard from the Science Based Targets Initiative.

Another said her firm had set a target for portfolio companies to reduce emissions by 15-25 percent, but only if it was economical, adding that it was not feasible for an airline, for example, to spend extra for sustainable aviation fuel. Yet another fund manager said their firm does not set specific goals for portfolio companies but does try to put them on a pathway to net zero.

A venture capital fund manager who makes the annual pilgrimage to Climate Week described the “atmospherics” as bad this year, but said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the turnout and encouraged that participants had “not just walked away”.

Perhaps they, like him, were drawn back by the prospects of outsized investment returns. Following a “supercycle” of climate technology investments in the past 10 years, the seeds of innovation are starting to sprout, he said, leading to a deal pipeline “unprecedented in terms of quality and quantity”.

Dealflow is up, valuations are down, and the market is still propelled by macroeconomic tailwinds from Europe, he said. “It is one of the most compelling times to invest capital.”",https://media.newprivatemarkets.com/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-53273228.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 12:56:54.477178

Under the terms of the EU and UK mandates, the fuel suppliers are the obligated parties and are liable for penalties if the 2% target is not met.
Airlines meanwhile, were less than 11% of respondents, exposed to SAF market dynamics but, in most cases, not obligated parties under the terms of the EU and UK SAF mandates.
The UK and EU have a clear SAF mandate, but in the US no mandate exists or is planned, and incentives have been patchy.
And elsewhere, while countries like Singapore and South Korea will introduce SAF mandates, many other states and regions lack clear plans to require or encourage SAF use.","It’s no surprise that the market survey revealed that interest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is most prevalent in the Americas and Europe. This is likely due to this year’s introduction of a 2% mandate in the EU and the UK, which is boosting demand, and the US growing its capacity which Fastmarkets predicts will double from 4 million tonnes in 2025 to 8 million tonnes in 2030.

But while these two regions were of interest to 65% of those surveyed, there is growing interest in developments in Latin America and Asia, with the former seeing key developments in places such as Brazil and the latter becoming a key current and future producer.

Government mandates and incentives were seen as the biggest factor driving SAF adoption, hardly surprising given that the UK and Europe led with the introduction of a 2% SAF blending mandate for 2025, which has cemented this region’s position as the primary demand base for sustainable aviation fuel.

Nevertheless, technological breakthroughs and cost reduction, followed by feedstock availability and sustainability, took the second and third spot respectively.

This was driven in part by concerns about the cost implications of novel production pathways such as alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) and power-to-liquid (PtL) technology, alongside restrictions on the use of certain feedstocks in SAF production and adoption in Europe, where only approved waste-based feedstocks are accepted.

Of the entities surveyed, fuel producers and suppliers were the most prevalent, more than 23% of those surveyed. Under the terms of the EU and UK mandates, the fuel suppliers are the obligated parties and are liable for penalties if the 2% target is not met.

But technology providers (15%) and investors and financiers (13%) were a sizeable portion of respondents with these firms playing a growing role in meeting the production challenges for SAF, with new technologies such as AtJ and PtL proving costly.

Airlines meanwhile, were less than 11% of respondents, exposed to SAF market dynamics but, in most cases, not obligated parties under the terms of the EU and UK SAF mandates.

Following on from the prior indicators, among all participants in the survey, the biggest hurdle to market and operational growth for SAF was indicated as regulatory uncertainty and inconsistency.

The UK and EU have a clear SAF mandate, but in the US no mandate exists or is planned, and incentives have been patchy. Furthermore, an extension of EU trade defence measures to cover US SAF will likely hamper future export potential.

And elsewhere, while countries like Singapore and South Korea will introduce SAF mandates, many other states and regions lack clear plans to require or encourage SAF use.

And beside production cost and financing issues, a lack of transparent pricing and market data was registered as a key point hindering operations and growth, highlighting the continued need for more pricing solutions.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2024/10/Ag_SAF_AerialPlaneRunway_Getty-72664754_Med.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 14:57:18.558719

IAG invests in OXCCU to accelerate SAF development

International Airlines Group (IAG) has joined the £20.75 million ($28 million) Series B funding round for OXCCU, a UK SAF innovator.

The round attracted new and existing investors, including Safran Corporate Ventures, Orlen and Aramco Ventures, among other backers.

IAG invested through IAGi Ventures, its corporate venturing arm, which committed up to €200 million over five years earlier this year. This represents the largest such investment pledge by a European airline group to date.

OXCCU, spun out of Oxford University, has created a patented process converting waste carbon gases and hydrogen into jet fuel hydrocarbons. The process removes a conventional step, reducing capital and operating costs while allowing use of varied carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen inputs.

The Series B funding will help OXCCU execute its scale-up strategy and accelerate commercialisation of its technology. The raise follows the opening of its first demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport last year. It will also support a larger facility, expected to be operational in 2026, advancing the UK’s SAF mandate and IAG’s decarbonisation goals.

Ignacio Tovar, IAG’s Director of Innovation, said the group focuses on backing companies with meaningful climate impact. He highlighted OXCCU’s technology as vital for scaling sustainable aviation. According to him, IAG helps partners grow faster by acting as early adopters, sharing expertise, and encouraging collaboration across its airline ecosystem.

IAG was the first airline group to pledge net zero by 2050. It also targets 10% SAF usage by 2030. In 2024, 1.9% of its fuel came from SAF, saving 469,000 tonnes of CO2, nearly double the previous year.

Please see the full report for details on all activities across Sustainability and Diversity & Inclusion in 2024.
It is a non-profit organisation committed to driving innovation and championing safety, sustainability and equality across motor sport and mobility.
Founded in 1904, with offices in Paris, London and Geneva, the FIA brings together 245 Member Organisations across five continents, representing millions of road users, motor sport professionals and volunteers.
It develops and enforces regulations for motor sport, including seven FIA World Championships, to ensure worldwide competitions are safe and fair for all.","The report shows the federation’s progress since the sustainability and D&I strategy was set out in 2020, and outlines its ongoing efforts to drive sustainable and inclusive practices across motorsport and mobility. It reaffirms the FIA’s commitment across both these areas, which remain a top priority for the FIA.

In environmental sustainability, highlights included:

Programmes with the wider community

The expansion of the Environmental Accreditation Programme during the year, which saw an 45% uptake increase from 2023

The launch of the Sustainable Fuel Certification Programme to guide responsible use of advanced fuels in competition

Investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel for the first time

€273,000 granted to sustainability programmes overall

FIA operations:

Maintained commitment to reduce absolute emissions by 2030

Carbon intensity measure fell by 7% year-on-year, despite an absolute emissions increase of 9%

This was against a backdrop of an increase in general activities, revenue and headcount

While the FIA recognises there is more to do, the above demonstrates a positive foundation to build from as it continues the push for decarbonisation and emissions reduction.

In D&I and social impact, highlights included:

Programmes with the wider community

Expansion of Girls on Track programme to new markets

The launch of two flagship initiatives:

FIA Women in Motorsport Mentoring Programme, which benefited 286 participants in 2024 across 79 countries, and has expanded to 445 participants so far 2025

CareerShift, which welcomed 50 students in its first year and has more than doubled participation since

Together, these programmes promote greater inclusivity within the sport by offering young people from different backgrounds and ethnicities the opportunity to connect with and learn from motorsport professionals across the career spectrum.

FIA people

32% of the FIA workface was female in 2024, with almost half of those women in senior roles

Headcount increased by 17% on prior year, with almost half of those new hires being women

The overall employee base comprised over 30 different nationalities across four regions

Alongside this growth trajectory, the FIA continued to improve gender equity practices through its EDGE certification, introduced more flexible working models for employees, and reviewed and improved recruitment and promotion polices and practices during the period

In June 2025 the FIA split its Sustainability and D&I function into two separate divisions, which now report into Willem Groenewald, Secretary General for Automobile Mobility and Sustainability, and Alessandra Malhamé, People, Workplace and D&I Senior Director, respectively. With this new structure in place, and at the mid-point of the 10-year strategy set out in 2020, the FIA will take this opportunity to review its approach to ensure it is driving impactful change against a clear strategy for both areas. A further update on this will be provided in due course.

Please see the full report for details on all activities across Sustainability and Diversity & Inclusion in 2024.

Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President of the FIA, said: “Five years into the FIA’s ambitious strategy, it is clear there is more to do. As we look to the future, I am confident the FIA will continue to play a leading role in facing the challenges ahead, which are significant. Together, with our Member Clubs, partners, and stakeholders, we will drive positive change, not just for performance, but for people, our communities, and our planet.”

Andrew Fraser, Chair, FIA Sustainability and D&I Committee, said: “We strengthened the FIA’s sustainability, diversity, and inclusion foundations to drive meaningful progress across sport and mobility during the year. While there is still more to do, we are determined to focus and lead. Together, these developments reflect our commitment to equipping our Members and the wider community with the tools, opportunities, and oversight needed to turn intent into lasting impact.”​

The plant represents an investment in the future of sustainable mobility and is a key part of Rivian's strategy to expand the adoption of EVs.

The project, which is expected to begin construction in 2026, cements a partnership with the state of Georgia to foster green technology and manufacturing.

“Our Georgia facility will support our global expansion and provide the scale necessary to get millions of future drivers in our incredible all-electric vehicles, both in the United States and overseas.”

The multi-billion-dollar investment is not only a step for Rivian but also a substantial development for the regional economy, framed within the context of the growing green sector.

The plant is expected to create 7,500 direct jobs by 2030. According to an analysis by IMPLAN, the project will also result in nearly 8,000 indirect jobs.

This influx of employment could generate more than US$1bn in labour income annually, supporting suppliers and local businesses in Jasper, Morgan, Newton and Walton Counties.

This development was marked by the attendance of state officials, including Georgia Governor Brian Kemp.

“Today is another milestone in bringing quality, good-paying jobs to Georgians in this part of the state,” says the Governor.

""With today’s groundbreaking, this company is further delivering on its commitment to the people of Georgia and the thousands of hardworking Americans who will work at this facility will see generational benefits for their families.”

This sentiment was echoed by Speaker of the House Jon Burns who noted the project will ""lay the foundation for billions in long-term economic benefits across our state"".

Environmental management in EV production

Rivian plans to build the facility in two phases, with each phase having the capacity to produce 200,000 units annually.

Once complete, the 400,000-unit total yearly capacity will be essential for supporting the sale of American-built EVs in international markets.

The scale of production is an important aspect of making EVs more accessible and accelerating the move away from fossil fuels.

What’s more, the aircraft averaged a speed in excess of 1,000 km/hr on 20 of its record-setting missions, bringing passengers to their destinations in record time.

Earlier achievements on the Global 7500 include the longest flight ever recorded in business aviation – an 8,225 nautical mile (15,232.7 km) flight from Sydney to Detroit – as well as the industry’s longest range non-stop mission from London City Airport to Los Angeles.

“The Global 7500 continues to redefine what is possible in business aviation,” said Jean-Christophe Gallagher, Executive Vice President, Aircraft Sales and Bombardier Defense. “Our customers count on us to deliver a business tool with the highest standards in luxury, speed and reliability, and the Global 7500 overachieves on all fronts. Many of these records have been set with passengers on board in varying conditions and airports, making these achievements even more meaningful and reaching this pinnacle more remarkable.”

Boasting a top speed of Mach 0.925 and a baseline range of 7,700 nautical miles (14,260 km), the Global 7500 sets a new benchmark for performance in the ultra-long-range category. With its unique Smooth Flĕx Wing, the aircraft generates exceptional lift on takeoff and approach, maximizing aerodynamic efficiency and enhancing safety, while delivering the industry’s smoothest ride. It also reduces fuel burn, lowers emissions and produces excellent short-field and high-speed performance – producing the perfect platform for our discerning customers.

The unique attributes of the Global 7500 aircraft will soon be enhanced with the introduction of the Global 8000 (2) aircraft. Bombardier’s flagship for a new era is anticipated to have an industry-leading range of 8,000 nautical miles (14,816 km) and a top speed of Mach 0.94, making it the ultimate all-in-one business aircraft. It will also feature an ultra-low cabin altitude that will redefine business aviation standards.

Bombardier’s nimble Global 8000 also possesses impressive runway performance comparable to a light jet. Its unique design and cutting-edge engineering provide customers with the ability to access smaller airports other aircraft in its category can’t reliably operate in.

Robert Abbot, Director of Airport Operations at Cranfield University, said: “Using the ULEMCo hydrogen tug is another step towards the net zero goal for aviation.
In the case of the hydrogen tug we’re pleased to support our colleagues at the National Flying Laboratory Centre (NFLC) who drove the project into life.
Additionally, Cranfield Airport has previously supported the first cross-channel hybrid electric flight and the world’s first hydrogen-electric passenger aircraft flight .","An airside hydrogen electric tug is now in operation at Cranfield Airport, in a significant development which is reducing carbon emissions and helping to prove hydrogen technologies in a working airport environment.

The tug is being used to manoeuvre aircraft and is being refuelled from an on-site HyQube hydrogen refueller, and in future it will be refuelled from a mobile hydrogen refueller truck, the HyTruck, supplied by Fuel Cell Systems. The facilities form part of the Cranfield Hydrogen Incubation Integrator, a hub of laboratories, test cells and hydrogen fuel supply technologies which will be the foundation to bringing about a step-change in the UK’s hydrogen R&D capability.

Built by the Ultra Low Emission Mileage Company Ltd (ULEMCo) the tug is an ex-RAF Medium Aircraft Tow Tractor that has been converted from diesel to electric hybrid running with a 100% hydrogen zero emission combustion engine. That means a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions and other air pollutants as an essential part of airport operations.

Robert Abbot, Director of Airport Operations at Cranfield University, said: “Using the ULEMCo hydrogen tug is another step towards the net zero goal for aviation. It’s easy to forget that airports aren’t just about the planes, and all of the vehicles used on site produce emissions that need to be reduced. In the case of the hydrogen tug we’re pleased to support our colleagues at the National Flying Laboratory Centre (NFLC) who drove the project into life.

“At Cranfield Airport we’re always aiming to be at the forefront when it comes to decarbonisation, whether that’s the hydrogen tug, moving to electrification for Executive Handling Vehicles or offering sustainable aviation fuel as a refuelling option. We’re continually exploring ways to make our operation more sustainable.”

Robert Harrison, Head of the NFLC, said: “The ULEMCo hydrogen tug is an important part of the NFLC’s drive to demonstrate sustainable aviation. Combined with the use of sustainable aviation fuel for the aircraft, and our electric Ground Power Unit, we’re using all available technologies to support airborne teaching and research with sustainability foremost in our minds.”

Tom Budd, Associate Professor of Airport Decarbonisation, who was closely involved with Project Acorn, a hydrogen refuelling trial at Bristol Airport , says that the development is “a significant step forward for airport operations.”

Both Cranfield University’s National Flying Laboratory Centre (NFLC) and the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) already use sustainable aviation fuel for certain flights , which can reduce emissions by up to 35%. Additionally, Cranfield Airport has previously supported the first cross-channel hybrid electric flight and the world’s first hydrogen-electric passenger aircraft flight .",https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/~/media/brand/androidicon192x192.png,N,,2025-10-02 07:56:14.130242

""Green hydrogen is a key component of our Strategy 2030 as a means of decarbonizing our fuel production and a key to OMV's responsible transformation"".

OMV awarded Germany's Siemens Energy AG the engineering, procurement and construction contract, including the supply of the plant's electrolysis technology. OMV contracted Vienna-ased STRABAG AG for the civil construction work.

On April 30 OMV announced the start of production at its first commercial-scale green hydrogen facility, built with a capacity of 1,500 MMtpa at the Schwechat refinery. The plant uses a 10-MW PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyzer powered by hydro, solar and wind energy.

The process avoids up to 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions a year, equivalent to the CO2 consumption of 2,000 persons per year based on a European Union average, according to OMV.

Output from the hydrogen plant will be used to decarbonize the refinery and produce more sustainable fuels and chemicals including sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel, OMV said.

Also on April 30 OMV and Abu Dhabi Future Energy Co PJSC (Masdar) said they had signed a letter of intent to collaborate on producing green hydrogen and derivatives.

Semielliptical Modification of the Symmetrical Dolphin 0006 Airfoil

Abstract

The original Dolphin airfoil family, invented by Iosif Taposu, has greatly influenced the development and modifications of airfoils. This innovation has led to creating a family of seven hybrid Dolphin airfoils. In this paper, a new symmetrical hybrid semi-elliptical Dolphin airfoil is presented. Using the semi-elliptical modification method, also known as the natural optimization method, a novel airfoil, designated as the hybrid Dolphin 0006 M4 airfoil, was obtained. This modification method involves reshaping the sharp leading edge of the original Dolphin airfoils, resulting in a complete redesign in the nose domain. Numerical calculations of the original Dolphin airfoils for subsonic flow regimes and Reynolds numbers around 6.0 x 106, along with standard roughness, have shown significant flow separation occurring in the leading edge zone even at small angles of attack. As a result, around 30% of the leading edge zone had to be remodeled to preserve aerodynamic efficiency. The fourth and final modification of the airfoil resulted in the Dolphin 0006 M4, selected as the final name of the airfoil. Results demonstrate that the modified hybrid Dolphin 0006 M4 shows improved aerodynamic efficiency when compared to its geometrical counterparts, the NACA 0006 and the Original Dolphin 0006 airfoils. This airfoil is suitable for general aviation applications, and potentially UAVs, alongside other airfoils from the hybrid Dolphin airfoil family created by the authors of this paper. This symmetrical airfoil of small 6% thickness ratio would primarily be aimed for the tail surfaces of flying vehicles aimed for high speed cruise regimes.

Prioritizing Feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production: An AHP-Based Approach

Abstract

As the aviation industry seeks to reduce its carbon footprint, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) have emerged as a critical solution for achieving sustainability goals. The selection of appropriate feedstocks for SAF production is pivotal, given the diverse options available and their varying impacts on sustainability, cost, and scalability. This study aims to prioritize feedstocks for SAF production using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a well-established multi-criteria decision-making method. The feedstocks analyzed include waste oils and fats, municipal solid waste, cellulosic waste, cover crops, non-biogenic alternative fuels, jatropha, halophytes, and algae. The AHP framework was used to structure the decision-making process by organizing the feedstocks into a hierarchy, with the goal of identifying the most suitable option at the top level. Criteria such as environmental impact, economic viability, and technological maturity were considered in pairwise comparisons to determine the relative importance of each feedstock. The results reveal that Waste Oils and Fats (0.32), Municipal Solid Waste (0.24), and Cellulosic Waste (0.20) are the top feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. These feedstocks stand out due to their high sustainability potential and scalability. Their common strengths include efficient resource use and significant environmental benefits, making them key options for advancing SAF production. This study provides a systematic approach to feedstock selection, aiding the aviation industry in making informed decisions that align with sustainability objectives and the scaling of SAF production.

Fast Response Aerodynamic Multihole Probe – Mechanism for Calibration and Possibilities for Measurements

Abstract

Simultaneous measurements of 3D velocity field and pressure is of great importance. Complex air flows exist in nature, as well as in numerous technical systems. These flows exhibit high levels of turbulence, requiring high sampling rates for accurate measurement. Analyzing such flows is possible using optical methods (laser Doppler velocimetry or particle image velocimetry), hot-wire anemometry or spatial probes. The advantage of multihole probes is simultaneous measurement of 3D velocity field and pressure.

The problem with optical methods is that they require laboratory conditions and they are not often used, except in special well prepared cases, on-site.Their advantage lies in non-invasiveness, high sampling rates and precision. On the other hand, standard spatial multiholeprobes are not suitable for measuring flows with high levels of turbulence. Newer generations of the multiholeprobes are capable of these measurements with fewer drawbacks. Integrating fast pressure transducers into the probe handles has enabled high sampling rates. These probes are known as FRAP (Fast Response Aerodynamic Probe).

In this paper is presented five hole FRAP, mechanism and installation for its calibration. The developed half-automatic mechanism for pitch-yaw calibration in the Laboratory of the Hydraulic Machinery and Energy Systems Department, at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering is introduced. Calibration is performed by placing the probe in a known flow field in the nozzle of the wind tunnel with low level of turbulence (less than 2%). Specified pitch-yaw calibration angles should cover all the angles of attack that will encounter during application.

Investigating the Ability of Turbulence Models to Predict Stall

Abstract

A detailed numerical study of the flows around the airfoil NACA 23012 near stall, at angles-of-attack ranging between 12.4° and 16.2°, Mach number M = 0.18 and Reynolds number Re = 1.8 million, was conducted by Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations closed by the commonly employed Menter’s k–ω shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model in contrast to the wall-modelled large eddy simulation (WMLES). All these flow simulations were performed in ANSYS FLUENT on the same, sufficiently refined computational mesh with dimensionless wall distance y + ≈ 30. The comparison of the obtained numerical and available experimental results points to the inability of RANS modeling to adequately capture the flow in the post-stall region whereas it performs satisfactorily in the attached, pre-stall region. Although relative errors of lift and drag coefficients remain within an acceptable range, the numerical stall seems delayed or not predicted at all. On the other hand, WMLES manages to reproduce the expected trend of aerodynamic coefficients, while the actual numerical values appear underrated in comparison to the measured values. Both modeling approaches are critically evaluated with regard to the flow separation phenomenon appearing at airfoils at high angles-of-attack and some conclusions are provided.

Abstract

The purpose of this study is to reveal the importance of a sustainable maintenance management that will support the effective, efficient and safe flights of aircraft and the provision of airworthiness conditions in order for businesses to be permanent in the sector and continue their aviation activities despite the increasing competition conditions in the aviation sector. The full fulfillment of the airworthiness condition is possible with an effective maintenance management system. Sustainable maintenance management focuses on optimizing maintenance processes by considering the social, economic and environmental responsibilities of businesses. In this context, the Corporate Social Responsibility approach emerges as an inseparable part of the sustainable maintenance management approach. Aviation businesses should not only consider their own commercial interests but also their responsibilities towards the environment and society while continuing their activities. In this study, sustainable maintenance management is discussed under three main headings: sustainable human resources management, sustainable material management and sustainable waste management. The need for qualified maintenance personnel in the aviation sector continues to be an important problem for growing aviation businesses. In terms of material management, the long-lasting, efficient and environmentally friendly use of materials is among the main priorities of manufacturers in line with sustainability goals. Sustainable waste management includes the disposal of oil, hydraulic fluids, tires and other consumables resulting from aircraft maintenance without harming the environment or recycling them into the economy. In the conclusion of the study, it was concluded that sustainability-oriented maintenance management practices would provide cost advantages to aviation companies and provide high social prestige.

Towards Realistic Urban Environment-Based UAV Simulations

Abstract

Up to date information about road surface conditions is a valuable asset that is globally relevant. An efficient system that can collect road surface data allows for targeted and timely use of resources in case of various road surface related problems. The most prevalent use cases are road maintenance planning, emergency repairs and weather effects including floods or snow. Using the data can also benefit road users through enhancing route planning. This study relates to the concept of utilizing a network of UAVs for road surface data provision. While UAVs are more than capable of collecting road surface data, developing a complete system, that can do so safely and efficiently is challenging. To aid the development of such a system, this study focuses on virtualization opportunities through urban environment modelling. Virtually representing road networks in a relevant environment enables more efficient development of the system by reducing cost, risk and greatly improving mission availability and execution performance. The presented methodology is capable of rapid model generation of arbitrary urban regions based on GIS data at a medium fidelity level. The various road surface features (potholes in this example) can be injected into this model and can be detected with UAVs using the Gazebo SITL simulation environment and a computer vision recognition system. The proposed approach demonstrates the viability of further system development within a virtual environment.

Safety of e-VTOL Aircraft Operations in the Context of Maintenance and Engineering Approach

Abstract

Urban air mobility operations using electric-Vertical Take-Off and landing (e-VTOL) vehicles intended for air transportation of passengers and mail within metropolitan areas. Several original aircraft manufacturers and new start-up entities have developed hundreds of e-VTOL aircraft models with various concepts and design architectures. The public expects these air vehicles to have lower operating costs, be less noisy, and be more accessible. Alongside with operational integration of the airspace and the air traffic management system, ground infrastructure development, implementation of vertiports to support the operations, and reliability of communication, navigation, and surveillance systems, this study presents an identification and discussion of future maintenance-related safety challenges. The study reveals that at the stage of initial operations, the most important components vulnerable to failure are the electronic speed controller, elements of battery system, motors, and propellers. Therefore, the original equipment manufacturers intending to obtain type certificates for their e-VTOL aircraft must establish sufficient, reliable Maintenance Planning Document (Maintenance Program) and training programs to adequately mitigate the safety issue. Applying a comprehensive approach and a detailed reliability analysis of safety precautions for e-VTOL aircraft in the context of maintenance and engineering contributes to preventing technical errors and reaching the goal of preserving airworthiness.

Probabilistic-Adaptive Kalman Filtering for Fault-Tolerant Estimation of UAV States

Abstract

A probabilistic-adaptive Kalman filter (pAKF) algorithm for the fault tolerant estimation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) dynamics in the presence of measurement faults is proposed. The proposed pAKF based on the evaluation of the posterior probability of the normal operation of the system, given for the current measurement. This probability is proposed to calculate via the posterior probability density of the normalized innovation sequence at the current estimation step. As a result, faults in the estimation system are corrected by the system, without affecting the good estimation behaviour. The developed pAKF algorithm is applied for the fault tolerant estimation of the UAV dynamics. The proposed pAKF algorithm is tested for the two different measurement malfunction scenarios; continuous bias at measurements and measurement noise increment.

ADS-B System Implementation in Civil Aviation: Benefits and Cyber Security Risks

Abstract

A giant step in the modernization and improvement of the quality of aviation operations is the introduction of the aviation system that relies on satellite positioning technology - Automatic Dependent Surveillance − Broadcast (ADS−B. It operates in two modes: ADS-B Out and ADS-B In. ADS-B Out, the core function for communication between the aircraft and air traffic control (ATC), has become a mandatory global standard. ADS-B In, an optional service, allows the aircraft to receive and display detailed information broadcast by other aircraft in the vicinity. ADS-B is designed with the latest technology, making it suitable for retrofitting on aircraft currently in operation. However, ADS–B transmits information over open and unencrypted protocols, so it can be easily compromised using existing hardware and software: ADS–B can be exposed to different types of cyber-attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing. According to ICAO assessments, the risk of a successful cyber-attack resulting in the loss of human life is relatively low compared to other types of terrorist attacks. However, recent incidents have shown a rising number of cyber disruptions affecting airline operations. While these incidents may seem minor, they are occurring with increasing frequency and could lead to more severe consequences.

Analysis of the Possibility of Measuring the Velocity Field Inside an Axial Fan Impeller Using PIV

Abstract

Although extremely important in the world of science, turbulence is one of the least described physical phenomena. In the world of turbomachinery, it represents an area of great importance to researchers in academia and industry worldwide. Turbulent swirling structures occur inside the fan’s impeller, as well as on its discharge and suction sides. To describe this phenomenon, it is necessary to measure the velocity field in the areas of interest. Various measurement methods are used for this, but PIV and LDA stand out as the most modern non-invasive methods. Taking into account that the mentioned flow must be considered as three dimensional, composed form three components it further complicates the measurement. From a technical point of view, the conduction of these experiments represents a very complex and challenging task. This is a great challenge, especially for the measurements inside the impeller.

The jet fuel infrastructure is a critical element in the complex supply chain dominated by vertically integrated fuel suppliers.
Jet fuel supply chain in Australia The Australian jet fuel supply chain is complex and comprises both off- and on-airport infrastructure, including JUHI and pipelines on airport land leased by airport operators from the Commonwealth.","The Labor Government's announcement of a record $1.1 billion investment in the low carbon liquid fuel industry signals the importance of opening access to jet fuel infrastructure to facilitate the reduction of carbon emissions in the aviation industry.

To capitalise on this investment, airport operators may consider the benefits of owning and operating their joint user hydrant infrastructure (JUHI). Transferring JUHI ownership to airport operators involves more than simply an asset sale agreement – a new ecosystem of interconnecting contracts and an open access model for its use must be created.

Current fuel setting

Climate change and industry's desire to reduce carbon emissions is reshaping global aviation. Airlines have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and identified that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is essential to achieving this goal. In Australia, SAF will be required for two-thirds of domestic flights and all international flights to meet the net-zero goal; as electrification and hydrogen offer medium-term solutions for short flights, SAF will be required for flights over 1000km.

While today SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of aviation fuel consumed, the aviation industry is working to ensure that the foundations are in place to enable adequate SAF supply at Australian airports by 2050. One of the key foundations is open access to jet fuel infrastructure. Any restrictions to access in the jet fuel supply chain in Australia may pose barriers to SAF supply and lessen competition between suppliers. In this article, we highlight how Australian airports are opening access to jet fuel infrastructure and the legal issues to consider in these transactions.

Sustainable aviation fuel: the local industry

SAFs are fuels used in commercial aviation which can reduce CO2 emissions by 80%. It contains the same hydrocarbons as fossil-based jet fuel, but the hydrocarbons are derived from sustainable sources. While fossil fuels add to the overall level of CO2 by emitting carbon, SAF recycles the CO2 which had been absorbed by the biomass used in the feedstock. At this stage however SAFs are more expensive to produce and limited in their availability compared to conventional jet fuel.

Recent developments in the local SAF industry include:

Qantas has committed to using 10% SAF in its fuel mix by 2030, and in May this year accepted delivery of Australia's largest SAF import with nearly two million litres arriving in Sydney.

Between March and July 2025, Viva Energy supplied Virgin Australia with blended SAF (consisting of conventional Jet-A1 and a 30-40% synthetic blend made from waste and residue feedstocks) for flights departing from Proserpine, Queensland.

IFM Investors, GrainCorp and Ampol have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to assess the feasibility of a renewable fuel facility, including SAF, at Ampol's Lytton refinery in Brisbane. This project will explore the production of SAF from Australian feedstock and reduce Australia's dependence on overseas fuel imports.

Two of these projects (among others) are supported by the Government's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative.

A necessary ingredient in the industry's success is SAF suppliers having access to jet fuel infrastructure to supply their customers. The jet fuel infrastructure is a critical element in the complex supply chain dominated by vertically integrated fuel suppliers.

Jet fuel supply chain in Australia

The Australian jet fuel supply chain is complex and comprises both off- and on-airport infrastructure, including JUHI and pipelines on airport land leased by airport operators from the Commonwealth. Jet fuel is typically shipped from an overseas refinery, transported to a local refinery by tanker or pipeline, then pumped into the fuel tanks at the JUHI facility via a pipeline owned and operated by a fuel supplier.

JUHI owners are often vertically integrated fuel suppliers involved in an unincorporated joint venture which owns and operates the JUHI. Often the only means by which a new entrant can supply fuel to an airline is to purchase an equity stake in a JUHI joint venture.

Australian airport operators have traditionally not owned or operated the JUHI, but since 2020 the position has begun to change. Below is a snapshot of the fuel infrastructure ownership at major Australian airports:",https://www.claytonutz.com/cfimages/Infrastructure_707x501px copy.webp//public,N,,2025-10-01 21:56:10.046524

If the shutdown persists, work related to federal data reporting, rulemakings and other regulatory initiatives could face delays.

Ahead of the shutdown, many federal agencies published contingency plans that provide insight on how work at those agencies may be impacted in the short term.

The U.S. Department of Treasury indicated the Internal Revenue Service will continue to operate for five days following the lapse in appropriations but has not provided guidance on how a longer-term shutdown might impact operations. Treasury and the IRS are the agencies tasked with issuing guidance for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit. That guidance is currently scheduled to be issued in May 2026. It is unclear if a long-term government shutdown would impact the agency’s projected timeline.

The USDA is expected to furlough 42,256 of its 85,907 employees, equating to more than 49% of the agency’s workforce. Data products and website updates offered by the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service and Foreign Agricultural Service are among agency activities that are expected to cease during the funding lapse. NASS publishes a variety of reports of interest to the U.S. biofuels industry, including monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report, which provides forecasts for corn use in ethanol production and soybean oil use in biofuel production; the monthly Crop Production report, which includes data on corn and soybean production; and the Crop Progress and Condition report, which provides weekly data on the condition of U.S. corn and soybean crops. FAS also publishes a variety of data of interest to bioenergy producers, including monthly export data on ethanol, distillers grains, biodiesel and wood pellets. FAS’s Global Agricultural Information Network also publishes numerous reports that provide insight on foreign markets for biofuels and wood pellets.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration has posted an announcement to its website reporting that it will continue normal publication schedules and data collection “until further notice.” The EIA publishes weekly data on ethanol production, stocks, imports and exports, as well as monthly data on biodiesel and renewable diesel production, biofuel capacity, and feedstock consumption. The EIA also publishes monthly data on wood pellet production, prices, exports, feedstock and stocks.

The U.S. EPA’s contingency plan for a government shutdown indicates the agency will furlough 13,432 of its 15,166 employees, a number that equates to nearly 89% of the agency’s workforce. Numerous agency activities are expected to cease during the funding lapse, including website updates and the issuance of new guidance, regulations and policies, unless necessary for exempted or excepted activities. The EPA publishes monthly data on the generation of renewable identification numbers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard, as well as data on small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions. The agency is also in process of developing rulemakings to set 2026 and 2027 RFS renewable volume obligations (RVOs) and potentially reallocate waived SRE volumes. The RFS rulemaking is currently expected to be finalized in October or November. A long-term government shutdown could impact the timeline for release of the RFS rule and delay the release of monthly RFS-related data.

Government shutdowns are not uncommon. Most recently, the government shutdown for 35 days in late 2018 and early 2019. One thing that is uncommon regarding the current government shutdown is that the White House has signaled its intent to make some layoffs permanent in the event of an extended shutdown.

The White House Office of Management and Budget recently circulated a memo to federal agencies directing them “to use this opportunity to consider Reduction in Force (RIF) notices for all employees in programs, projects, or activities (PPAs) that satisfy all three of the following conditions: (1) discretionary funding lapses on October 1, 2025; (2) another source of funding, such as H.R. 1 (Public Law 119-21) is not currently available; and (3) the PPA is not consistent with the President’s priorities.”

“RIF notices will be in addition to any furlough notices provided due to the lapse in appropriation,” the notice continued. “RIF notices should be issued to all employees working on the relevant PPA, regardless of whether the employee is excepted or furloughed during the lapse in appropriations.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that plans for permanent layoffs are underway during an Oct. 1 press conference. “There are unfortunate consequences to a government shutdown, and the federal government is not receiving any cash at the moment,” she said. “So, the Office of Management and budget has been tasked with looking over the receipts and looking over the budget of the entire federal bureaucracy and…determining what needs to continue to go out the door and what can we continue to keep running and what unfortunately is going to have to come to and end. So, those decisions are being made. And, unfortunately, layoffs are very likely…are going to be a part of that.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2012/11/CapitalOutside_13529376078789.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 20:57:01.904792

XCF Global Inc., a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), announces that it has signed a letter of intent (LOI) with Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator, through its subsidiary New Rise Renewables Reno LLC to explore deploying Posh Energy's flex-fuel gensets at the New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's flex-fuel gensets are expected to be installed at New Rise Reno to convert byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into clean, renewable electricity. Its proprietary reforming and fuel cell platform can process propane-rich byproduct streams and transform them into zero-carbon electricity. In the coming weeks, XCF and Posh plan to publish a white paper outlining how Flex-Fuel Gensets can transform byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into scalable sources of renewable electricity.

By integrating Posh's Flex-Fuel Gensets, XCF expects to unlock a combination of tax incentives that enhances both facility economics and sustainability metrics. Hydrogen produced by the system is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, while electricity generated from that hydrogen is expected to produce renewable energy credits (RECs). When used to power on-site operations, the RECs can be retained and retired to lower the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno's SAF and renewable diesel, thereby boosting the value of the 45Z and LCFS credits.

Alternatively, the electricity and RECs can be sold into the Nevada power grid to serve the growing clean energy demands of the region's expanding data center hub. Located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where some of the world's largest technology companies operate major facilities, New Rise Reno could supply renewable power through wheeling arrangements that help operators meet both regulatory requirements and corporate sustainability goals.

The project is expected to be rolled out in two phases:

Pilot Deployment: Installation of a 100-kW Flex-Fuel Genset to validate performance using New Rise Reno's byproduct streams.

Modular Scale-Up: Expansion of the project through a modular approach targeting a total capacity of up to 10-MW, providing significant upside in both credit capture and revenue growth.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented, ""XCF's mission to lead the transition to carbon-neutral aviation will be achieved not only by producing SAF, but by reducing carbon emissions throughout the supply chain to create a future-proof energy ecosystem. Teaming up with Posh Energy highlights how next-generation fuels and power can converge to deliver impact at scale. Converting byproducts into renewable electricity strengthens our sustainability profile while unlocking new revenue streams that enhance profitability, growth, and long-term shareholder value.""

Wesley Zheng, co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy commented, ""Posh Energy's Flex-Fuel Gensets are designed to convert challenging, non-standard fuel streams into reliable renewable power. Working with XCF at New Rise Reno gives us a first-of-its-kind opportunity to demonstrate how our platform can help decarbonize industrial facilities while supplying clean energy to meet the rising demand from grids and data centers.""

The LOI is non-binding, and project execution remains subject to mutual due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

With the construction of SAF, Limax Logistics LLC is making a major contribution in the transition to greener fuels.

Jeroen Kensmil, Team Leader PID, and Pieter Fontein, Sales Manager at Limax Logistics LLC, explain. Their main focus is the Operation and Business Development of the PID (Petrochemical Industrial Distillation). The PID installation distills (separates) products based on temperature and pressure.

An additional distillation unit called Unit 4 should be added by the end of next year. With these PID Units, Limax Logistics LLC is fully engaged in the energy transition and contributing positively to the major climate challenges. Through distillation, SAF can be produced from hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) from customers. Uniquely, Limax Logistics LLC has its own research facilities. Kensmil: “Customers can send in their samples and we can accurately determine how much SAF can be produced from their product. This is how we add value to our customers ’products.”

“Limax Logistics LLC will be able to facilitate part of the rising global demand for SAF ”

Limax Logistics LLC is very well aware that the world needs to become more sustainable at a rapid pace, and that is certainly a challenge for the aviation industry. With the development of Unit 4, Limax Logistics LLC will be able to facilitate part of the rising global demand for SAF. Within Europe, there is a proposal to achieve a compulsory SAF proportion of 2% in jet fuel for all flights within and departing from Europe. “This is the opportunity for Limax Logistics LLC to be there on time and anticipate this development,” agrees Fontein. “Demand will only increase.”

“With this project we will increase our production capacity ”

CTB is looking forward to this summer. Kensmil: “With this project we will increase our production capacity from 130 thousand tons to almost half a million tons of SAF feedstock per year. All of that simply here in the Botlek.” Kensmil adds: “That does something to you. When an aircraft flies over, there ’s a great chance that it’s partly powered by sustainable fuel produced at our terminal.”",https://limaxlogistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/about-1.png,N,,2025-10-02 03:56:22.577065

For years, Bombardier’s Challenger 3500 has dominated the super midsize business jet market, winning over fractional ownership fleets, corporate operators, and private owners alike. Its blend of range, cabin comfort, and sustainability credentials has made it the benchmark since its 2021 debut.

Now Gulfstream has responded with the G300 — not a headline-grabbing flagship, but a carefully judged move to defend its flank.

The G300 replaces Gulfstream’s long-serving G280, bringing the super midsize jet in line with the company’s modern portfolio. More than a technical upgrade, it’s a brand reset: dropping the “280” moniker that dated back to the Israel Aerospace Galaxy and repositioning the aircraft against Bombardier’s Challenger 3500.

What’s changed from the G280 to the new G300?

For years, the G280 carried the flag in the super midsize category, while Gulfstream’s development focus shifted to its larger G500, G600, and G700 families. With the G300, the company is modernising its midsize offering and bringing the branding in line with the rest of the portfolio.

Compared to the G280, the G300 offers a quieter, more connected cabin, with Gulfstream’s latest interior design language, including larger oval windows, advanced cabin management systems, and improved ergonomics.

The flight deck benefits from updated avionics and enhanced connectivity, while efficiency refinements allow for lower emissions and full compatibility with sustainable aviation fuel.

Perhaps most importantly, the new name aligns the aircraft with Gulfstream’s broader family branding, a deliberate move to retire the “280” badge and reposition the jet directly against Bombardier’s Challenger 3500.

Bombardier Challenger 3500 vs Gulfstream G300

The heart of the story is the comparison with Bombardier’s Challenger 3500. On paper, both jets target the same high-value niche:

Performance: The Challenger 3500 offers a range of around 3,400 nm, while the G300 is expected to post comparable figures, balancing transcontinental reach with midsize efficiency.

Cabin: Bombardier has leaned on luxury — sustainable materials, advanced seating, cabin automation. Gulfstream’s counter emphasises quietness, connectivity, and signature oval windows for a lighter, more open cabin environment.

Sustainability: Both aircraft are marketed as SAF-ready, with Bombardier making carbon neutrality a key talking point. Gulfstream is highlighting efficiency gains without over-promising.

Positioning: The Challenger 3500 has become the darling of NetJets and other fractional players. The G300 will likely appeal to Gulfstream’s loyal base while giving operators fresh reasons not to defect to Bombardier.

This is not an arms race of range or speed, but of refinement — small margins that matter greatly to buyers in the segment.

More than conquest sales, the G300 looks like a retention tool. Gulfstream has hundreds of customers operating G200s and G280s. Without the G300, many of those owners risked migrating to Bombardier for their next aircraft. Now, Gulfstream has a mid-tier offering that keeps them in the family.

The biggest wildcard will be fractional ownership. NetJets is historically a key Gulfstream partner, but has leaned heavily into Bombardier in the midsize space. If the G300 can secure fleet deals here, it could quickly reshape the balance of power.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gulfstream-G300.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 16:57:49.451173

In order to make ethanol for SAF commercially viable, ethanol producers need carbon capture and sequestration at ethanol plants and climate smart agriculture.","The sustainable aviation fuel industry’s biggest players gathered in Minnesota last week to confront the sector’s steep challenges and chart its path forward. At the North American SAF Conference and Expo, held Sept. 22-24 in Minneapolis, more than 300 attendees and 35 exhibitors underscored their commitment to overcoming high costs, limited supply and policy uncertainty in pursuit of aviation’s decarbonization goals. Despite hurdles ranging from high costs to policy uncertainty, the event drew 300 attendees and 35 exhibitors—stakeholders united by a shared commitment to advancing the industry’s ambitious decarbonization goals.

Steve Csonka, executive director of the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative—the event co-organizer, along with SAF Magazine—took to the stage to moderate the leading panel of the show, “The Outlook for American Industry & Agriculture to Participate in Domestic and International SAF Markets.” The panel featured Jim Hileman, vice president and chief engineer, sustainability and future mobility with Boeing; Bruce Fleming, CEO of Montana Renewables; Monte Shaw, executive director with the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association; and Chris Cassidy, national business renewable energy advisor with the United States Department of Agriculture.

During the panel discussion, Hileman highlighted Boeing’s commitment to decarbonization goals. He explained that there are two ways to reduce CO2 emissions in an aircraft. The first is to make sure that the airplane maximizes fuel efficiency. “At Boeing, making safe aircraft as efficient as possible is job number one,” he said. “The second part of decarbonization is about the fuel tank’s contents, using renewable jet-range molecules. Now, the challenge is to get renewables in the tank at a low cost in large volumes.”

Hileman added that in 2026, Boeing intends to have 100% SAF drop-in approval for its planes. He also explained the value of Boeing’s Cascade information tool, which is used to inform policymakers in the U.S. and abroad about the opportunities that are available to reduce aviation emissions. The tool was used in conversation between Boeing and the German government about the challenges facing hydrogen and power-to-liquid fuels mandates. “I highly recommend you go check that out to,” he said. “Because we don’t have hydrogen trees, we do have a lot of agricultural products though.”

Fleming updated the assembly on the state of Montana Renewables 180 MMgy SAF facility, commissioned in 2022. He explained that this facility’s volume is only a small amount of the global volume objectives around SAF, but said he believes that it’s the last SAF plant that’s going to be built until something changes. Around the world, the number of SAF mandates is multiplying, but supply isn’t keeping pace, which could lead to a price short, making the price of SAF go to “infinity,” he said.

However, Fleming said that he remains bullish on SAF due to the potential for human creativity to rise to the challenge in the face of SAF mandates around the world. Montana Renewables’ facility is feedstock agnostic and holds a symbiotic relationship with the ethanol industry because of the low carbon intensity that distillers corn oil ethanol plants provide, Fleming explained.

Due to the expensive nature of SAF projects, long-term, consistent policy and regulations are crucial to continued growth. “We’ve got collectively supportive policy, but we do not have integrated, coherent policy,” he said.

Fleming praised the Greater MSP Partnership’s efforts to build a SAF value chain by pulling stakeholders together locally, contrasting it with the “central planning mentality” employed by regulators, which he said has not kept pace with human creativity.

In his remarks, Shaw discussed the trade and supply dynamics behind corn production, making a case as to why and how there is ample supply for the purpose of alcohol-to-jet fuel. American farmers have been overproducing for the market for many years, he said. Since 1980, the corn yield trend line shows that farmers have produced corn at an increasing rate, nearly four times more than demand growth, not including demand from biofuels. The 1980’s farm crisis was a result of this oversupply, and this year is the worst farm harvest economy that the Midwest has seen in roughly 40 years, as U.S. farmers experience a massive corn crop. This corn needs somewhere to go, Shaw said, and market opportunities such as SAF could help bring prosperity to the Midwest.

Shaw also delved into how innovations are driving up the volume of corn available in the U.S., even as the acreage used for farming in the Midwest decreases. Over the next 20 years, U.S. farmers will produce 5 billion bushels of corn each year that don’t exist this year, he said. Many different feedstocks will be needed to meet SAF goals, he added, but corn could make up 10 to 30 billion gallons of the market. In order to make ethanol for SAF commercially viable, ethanol producers need carbon capture and sequestration at ethanol plants and climate smart agriculture.

In regard to policy, Shaw said the perception he received from Congressional leaders and staffers on Capitol Hill is that 45Z SAF credit value reduction—from $1.75 per gallon to $1 per gallon—within the One Big Beautiful Bill was largely on account of SAF stakeholders not being on the same page—many presented different strategies, he said, and indirect land use change was seen as a priority by agricultural groups’ advocacy.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SAF_Conference_Photo2025_9ca03d1f32.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 15:56:10.593875

Ltd., a global leader in digital modular blending solutions for SAF, have today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to form a strategic global partnership. This collaboration is designed to directly address a major hurdle facing the aviation industry: the inefficiencies in the SAF supply chain and blending process.

The core of the non-binding MOU is the co-development of an end-to-end solution aimed at enabling the ready uplift of SAF at a global scale. Currently, most SAF blending occurs far upstream at production facilities, which severely limits flexibility and scalability for airlines. Downstream infrastructure, such as airport terminals, often lacks the sophisticated and certified equipment required for precise blending. The partnership intends to eliminate this bottleneck by combining XCF's expertise in SAF production infrastructure with FlyORO's patented AlphaLite™ modular blending technology.

The AlphaLite™ system is engineered for flexible, low-CAPEX deployment either on-airport or pre-airport, bringing the critical blending step closer to the point of use. This strategic decentralization aims to create a more cost-effective, compliant, and highly scalable integration of SAF into the existing global aviation fuel system.

""This partnership has the potential to rewire how the aviation industry thinks about SAF deployment,"" commented Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global. ""Blending isn’t just a technical step, it’s a critical piece of the infrastructure puzzle that determines how fast SAF can scale. By combining FlyORO’s cutting-edge blending technology with XCF’s global strategy, we’re creating a pathway to accelerate adoption, reduce costs, and unlock new growth opportunities.""

The collaboration is critically timed to meet the rapidly accelerating global demand for SAF. Projections indicate that the global SAF market is expected to exceed $25 billion by 2030, with worldwide volume demand surpassing 5.5 billion gallons. This explosive growth underscores the urgency for next-generation logistics and infrastructure solutions. FlyORO’s AlphaLite™ system is described as a low-CAPEX, innovative, and flexible technology that will be critical in bridging the gap between SAF production sites and the airports and fleets that require it.

Damian McLoughlin, Chief Commercial Officer of FlyORO, echoed this sentiment, stating, ""FlyORO was founded with the mission to eliminate barriers to SAF adoption. Our modular AlphaLite™ system makes blending more flexible, scalable, and affordable. Working with XCF, we can expand this vision globally, bringing smarter logistics and faster SAF deployment to airports and airlines around the world.""",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-01 17:56:45.519963

Johnson Matthey, a global leader in sustainable chemistry, is driving the scale-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technologies worldwide through innovative platforms like FT CANS™, co-developed with bp, and its HyCOgen™ technology for efficient syngas production. ChemAnalyst spoke with Alberto Giovanzana about the company’s strategy to enhance SAF production from diverse feedstocks, support greenfield projects and retrofits, collaborate with partners such as Honeywell and GIDARA Energy, and expand its role in adjacent low-carbon fuels like renewable diesel, e-fuels, and hydrogen to accelerate aviation decarbonisation globally.

Complete Interview with Alberto Giovanzana

To begin, could you introduce yourself and explain Johnson Matthey’s role in scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technologies globally?

Alberto Giovanzana: I am Alberto Giovanzana, Managing Director Licensing at Johnson Matthey. Johnson Matthey has a two-century legacy of using advanced chemistry and process innovation to solve global challenges. Today, one of the most urgent is aviation decarbonisation. The aviation sector contributes around 2–2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and without meaningful action, this proportion could grow sharply as other industries decarbonise.

We are supporting the scale-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technologies globally, with a focus on two complementary platforms: the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) CANS™ technology, co-developed with bp, and Johnson Matthey’s HyCOgen™ technology, which improves syngas production efficiency by capturing and recycling CO2. Together, these processes make SAF production more efficient, more flexible, and more scalable. Our technologies are already being deployed in large-scale projects in the US and beyond.

FT CANS™ technology is recognized as a breakthrough. How does it improve the Fischer-Tropsch process for SAF in terms of efficiency and scalability?

Alberto Giovanzana: Traditional FT systems have long faced challenges in terms of catalyst degradation, heat management, product purity and limited selectivity, which made smaller-scale deployment difficult. FT CANS™ technology was designed specifically to overcome these hurdles.

• Thermal management: The advanced catalyst carriers in the FT CANS technology ensure efficient heat removal during the highly exothermic FT reaction. This prevents hotspots that damage catalysts, thereby extending operational life.

• Catalyst selectivity: The catalyst formulations are precisely engineered, enabling higher selectivity to long-chain hydrocarbons suitable for SAF while minimising unwanted by-products.

• Scalability: The modular reactor design allows flexibility in deployment scale to maximise the use of eligible carbon feedstocks.

The result is a reliable, economically viable FT system that produces high purity synthetic crude suitable for upgrading and blending to produce ASTM-certified SAF.

With FT CANS already deployed in projects such as by USA BioEnergy and DG Fuels, what tangible benefits are project developers seeing in terms of yields, costs, and reliability?

Alberto Giovanzana : We are seeing clear, measurable benefits from real-world projects:

• USA BioEnergy (Bon Wier, Texas): The facility plans to process around one million tonnes of responsibly sourced forest thinnings each year into 65 million gallons of transportation fuels, including SAF, while capturing over 50 million tonnes of CO2 over its lifetime. This demonstrates both carbon efficiency and large-scale feasibility.

• DG Fuels (Louisiana, Nebraska and Minnesota): These projects, worth billions of dollars in investment, intend to use local agricultural residues under long-term supply agreements. This illustrates how the FT CANS process can be rooted in regional feedstock ecosystems, creating supply chain resilience while also supporting rural economies.

Developers benefit from higher yields, lower costs per gallon, and strong operational reliability thanks to integration with downstream upgrading technologies which Johnson Matthey facilitates through non-exclusive partnerships with upgrading technology providers.

SAF production depends on diverse feedstocks. How does FT CANS manage variability—from forestry residues to municipal waste—while ensuring consistent output quality that meets ASTM standards?

Alberto Giovanzana : Aviation requires fuels that meet stringent ASTM standards. The FT CANS flowsheet achieves this by leveraging a syngas platform which decouples fuel production from feedstock, enabling the use of a wide range of eligible waste- and biomass-derived feedstocks.

FT CANS technology converts syngas into hydrocarbons. Feedstocks include forestry residues, municipal solid waste, agricultural by-products, and even captured CO2 combined with renewable hydrogen. Plants are designed around local feedstocks, with long-term agreements in place, which ensures:

• Consistent quality of SAF via syngas, regardless of input material.

• Traceability and security, with less exposure to global commodity markets.

• This versatility is critical for scaling SAF globally, as it allows regions to build energy security around their own resources.

Scaling SAF is essential to meet IATA’s 2050 net-zero targets. How does FT CANS enable both greenfield projects and retrofits to expand quickly and economically?

Alberto Giovanzana: IATA’s net-zero 2050 roadmap depends heavily on SAF deployment. FT CANS technology helps achieve this by being both compact and modular, allowing rapid roll-out in multiple settings:

• Greenfield projects, where entirely new facilities can be built around local biomass or waste streams.

• Retrofits, where existing infrastructure such as refineries or industrial complexes can integrate FT units to produce SAF alongside other outputs.

HEFA- or HVO-based fuels are recognised to be limited by the availability of lipid feedstocks. By comparison, FT offers a more scalable pathway by tapping into a diverse range of abundant waste resources, which can be used to make syngas.

Feedstock supply and logistics remain a bottleneck. What role is Johnson Matthey playing in supporting developers to secure sustainable, cost-effective feedstock at commercial scale?

Alberto Giovanzana: Feedstock availability is one of the defining challenges of scaling SAF. Johnson Matthey is working with developers to:

• Maximise feedstock conversion potential, optimising processes to local conditions.

• Integrate carbon capture and utilisation, making use of CO2 as a feedstock through HyCOgen™ technology.

• Build partnerships, such as the SAF Technology Alliance with, GIDARA Energy, Johnson Matthey, Honeywell, and Samsung E&A, which is designed to help drive the end-to-end production of SAF from biomass and municipal waste.

As per your PR, Honeywell recently announced its intention to acquire Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business segment, while also collaborating with JM on SAF projects like Bon Wier. How do you view this dual dynamic shaping catalyst innovation, integration, and competitive positioning in SAF markets?

Alberto Giovanzana: Honeywell’s recent announcement of its intention to acquire Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business is completely distinct from the announcement about Johnson Matthey’s SAF customer projects. Discussions on the USA BioEnergy project were part of ordinary working discussions between Honeywell and Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business.

SAF projects such as USA BioEnergy and DG Fuels continue to build on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed between Johnson Matthey and Honeywell UOP in 2024, offering an end-to-end solution for businesses developing alternative fuels from a wide range of feedstocks including municipal solid waste, residual biomass, biogas, and CO2 (captured and renewable).

Looking beyond SAF, how does Johnson Matthey see opportunities in adjacent fuels such as renewable diesel, e-fuels, or hydrogen to complement aviation decarbonisation?

Alberto Giovanzana : Johnson Matthey sees opportunities across renewable diesel, hydrogen, and e-fuels. These can work alongside SAF to decarbonise other transport sectors, build energy resilience, and strengthen the broader net-zero ecosystem. Importantly, FT provides a platform technology capable of producing not just SAF but also renewable diesel, naphtha, and other fuels from the same feedstock base.

Finally, what are Johnson Matthey’s next strategic steps—whether through R&D, global collaborations, or scaling deployments—to reinforce its leadership in sustainable fuels?

Alberto Giovanzana: We will continue to invest in:

• R&D to further enhance catalyst resilience and reactor performance.

• Global collaborations such as the SAF Technology Alliance.

• Scaling deployments through existing partnerships and with leading developers worldwide.

• By combining our science with strategic partnerships, Johnson Matthey is committed to reinforcing its leadership in sustainable fuels and helping aviation achieve its decarbonisation goals.

ChemAnalyst Insights on Jet Kerosene

Jet kerosene is a traditional aviation fuel derived from petroleum, whereas Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a bio-based alternative engineered as a “drop-in” replacement. SAF can be blended with conventional kerosene and used in current aircraft and infrastructure without any modifications. The key connection between the two is that SAF serves as a partial substitute for jet kerosene, helping to lower the aviation industry’s carbon emissions by recycling atmospheric CO2 through feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste.

Jet kerosene spot prices in North America remained relatively muted during the second quarter of 2025, reflecting limited market momentum compared to the previous year. Despite some strength in crude oil prices, jet fuel rates stayed largely subdued due to ample refinery output, high inventory levels, and measured airline purchasing.

In June, the spot price index saw a modest month-over-month increase, driven by seasonal demand and speculative buying, although market fundamentals remained soft. Airline fuel consumption throughout the quarter stayed below prior-year levels, with usage declining in April despite rising passenger traffic, and fuel costs per gallon falling compared to March.

Supply conditions continued to support the market. Gulf Coast refiners reported stable operations without significant disruptions, while steady import flows, particularly from Nigeria’s Dangote refinery and Russia, helped maintain supply balance.

Industry attention is increasingly shifting toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Although availability is still limited, upcoming policy mandates and ESG compliance goals are gradually influencing procurement strategies, creating structural pressure on conventional jet fuel demand.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-01 14:57:45.465494

Typically, 70% of U.S. soybean exports to China move from November through April. At the moment, prices are not the only issue. Chinese buyers -- much like 2018-19 -- have been told simply not to make offers on U.S. soybeans.

""They have said we're being told we cannot buy your beans,"" said John Newton, executive head for Terrain Ag, and a former economist for the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee.

Seth Meyer, USDA's chief economist, said the lack of Chinese purchases will require U.S. producers to export throughout the full marketing year instead of front-loading exports in the first half of the year. ""The Chinese are not buying from us, and they're only buying from the Brazilians; both we and the Brazilians now need to spread out our export program to all year,"" Meyer said.

Stephen Nicholson, global strategist for Grains & Oilseeds at Rabobank, said China eventually will return to the U.S. market when prices are low enough.

""If they're nothing, they are pragmatic. They will come back to the U.S., because that's where the cheapest price is going to be,"" Nicholson said.

Newton, Meyer and Nicholson each spoke last week on a panel at an Ag Outlook Forum in Kansas City, Missouri.

A day later, Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at Stone X, was on a panel at the inaugural (Barry) Flinchbaugh Forum in Manhattan, Kansas. Suderman said negotiations over rare earth minerals -- an area where China dominates -- takes precedent over ""almost everything else."" To reach a deal, Suderman said, ""We need China and the United States in the same room and right now we are having trouble getting them in the same room for sustained talks.""

Still, Suderman also questioned whether the U.S. would remain a long-term agricultural seller to China. He pointed to Chinese President Xi Jinping's goals of undermining both the U.S. economy and political stability. The two countries' different value systems will eventually lead to more clashes as Xi looks to achieve his goals, Suderman said.

""At some point we were going to lose China as a customer simply for those reasons,"" he said.

BRAZILIAN COMPETITION GROWS

Brazil has increased its soybean production by 52 million metric tons (1.9 billion bushels) just since 2020 when the U.S. and China ended their tariff war and signed the Phase One trade agreement.

The competition with Brazil will only continue. Brazil has millions of acres of grasslands that can continue to be converted to cropland and then produce multiple crops per year. The country also has a cheap currency that allows its producers to remain competitive.

Brazil is aggressively expanding its biofuels capacity as well, Suderman noted.

""We've heard about sustainable aviation fuel, but while we're sitting around talking about it here in the United States, Brazil has decided they are going to beat us and become the world's sustainable aviation capital.""

INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS AN ADVANTAGE

One of the problems Brazil continues to face is long wait times at ports. This could be one reason China also begins looking at buying from the U.S. again.

""That's the big advantage the U.S. has is there is a logistics issue that will move stuff out the door faster than what Brazil could do,"" Nicholson said in Kansas City.

U.S. railroad and highway infrastructure add to the U.S. shipping advantage, said Mike Seyfert, president and CEO of the National Grain and Feed Association, at the Flinchbaugh Forum.

""The biggest competitive advantage the U.S. has right now is the strength and the reliability and the resilience of that transportation system. But I worry that we're getting close to a tipping point if we don't make the investments we need to make in those systems compared to what we're seeing from our competitors,"" Seyfert said.

He pointed to billions of dollars in infrastructure going into Brazil and other South American ports. Most of that investment has been coming from China.

""There is concrete and steel going into the ground in terms of port development, railroad development, road development in Brazil around the clock,"" Seyfert said.

Meanwhile, locks and dams on the Mississippi River built in the 1930s continue to operate without needed upgrades. About 60% of exports go out of the Gulf of Mexico and nearly two-thirds of those commodities get to port by barges. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included roughly $16 billion to upgrade locks and dams, but those projects will take years.

MARKET RATHER THAN PAYMENTS

Government payments also do not make up for that lost demand.

""American farmers do not want to depend on the government for some type of assistance check in order to stay in business,"" Ragland said. ""Those situations are a Band-Aid on a wound. They never make us profitable, they never make us whole and often they don't 100% get into the hands of those who need it most due to various issues.""

China bought one-third of the U.S. soybean crop before the 2018-19 trade war. China's market share of U.S. beans has dropped to about 25% -- before being locked out of the market so far this harvest.

Looking at other prospective markets, Ragland said creating domestic markets such as sustainable aviation fuel will take years to effectively ramp up demand -- and that could focus more on corn demand than soybeans.

""I'm all for SAF and it certainly could help us, but SAF can't possible come along fast enough to fix this problem ... SAF has a lot of potential long term, but there's still a lot that has to be figured out within agriculture and within the biofuels community.""

EYES ON SOYBEANS

The Wall Street Journal editorial board on Monday weighed into the ""collateral damage"" of soybean farmers in the trade dispute with China, noting ""Whoever claimed trade wars are easy to win clearly wasn't an American farmer."" The op-ed pointed out U.S. farmers and Chinese consumers both lose right now, and U.S. taxpayers could be faced with providing farmers with more financial support.

On a lighter note, DTN Political Correspondent Jerry Hagstrom wrote in his newsletter, the Hagstrom Report, about a weekend trip to Massachusetts for a theater festival.

""When I traveled here this weekend to visit friends, I expected to be asked questions about the kinds of things that concern people in a liberal, resort community: farmers markets, food stamps, conservation, programs to support small farmers, such as farm to school sales.

""But to my shock, in bars, restaurants, at a party for an artist and on the sidelines of performances at the Tennessee Williams Theater Festival, when people found out I was an agriculture reporter, they asked what the soybean farmers are going to do if they can't sell soybeans to China,"" Hagstrom wrote.

The company is also constructing its second demonstration plant, OX2, which is scheduled to become fully operational in 2026.

The announcement arrives amid growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. Policies such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU are driving the push for SAF adoption, but high production costs remain a significant obstacle.

“In a market where investors are cautious and selective, this funding round validates the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the challenge we are tackling,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “It demonstrates that investors recognize the potential of genuinely innovative technologies.”

OXCCU’s approach addresses cost barriers by streamlining SAF production. Unlike conventional methods requiring reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps, OXCCU’s patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct conversion of gaseous waste carbon into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons through a single exothermic reaction. This not only reduces capital and operating expenses but also lowers the carbon intensity of the produced fuel.

The catalyst is highly versatile, processing a wide range of input gases including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. It can convert various feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, or pure carbon dioxide combined with hydrogen, providing flexibility for different production environments.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG, emphasized the strategic importance of the investment: “Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 requires sustainable aviation fuel. Our partnership with OXCCU supports our goal of sourcing 10% of our fuel from SAF by 2030 and developing next-generation fuels.”

Ireneusz Fafara, President of ORLEN, added: “Investing in technologies like OXCCU allows us to scale SAF production and strengthen our market position while progressing toward carbon neutrality.”

Nathalie Stubler, Safran Chief Sustainability Officer, highlighted the importance of supporting industrial scale-up for promising SAF technologies, while Daniel Goldman, Managing Partner at Clean Energy Ventures, praised OXCCU’s rapid transition from lab to commercial demonstration, enabling affordable SAF production.

Dr. Robert Trezona, Partner at IP Group, remarked that the round represents a major milestone for climate innovation in the UK, turning high-quality science into impactful global solutions.

OXCCU’s technology not only addresses aviation decarbonization but also has broader applications in chemicals and plastics. “The urgent need for climate solutions makes SAF crucial,” concluded Symes. “We are tackling the cost challenge head-on with our technology.”",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-01 11:57:12.594117

Green Refineries Market Revenue and Trends 2025 to 2033

The global green refineries markets role of green refineries in achieving net-zero emissions targets, emphasizing their contribution to sustainable energy systems. The market is expanding because of the increasing global mandates for net-zero carbon emissions, stringent fuel quality regulations, and growing corporate and consumer demand for sustainable, low-carbon fuels.

What are the Key Factors Driving the Growth of the Green Refineries Market?

Multiple interconnected factors are propelling the growth of the market for green refineries. Regulatory mandates, particularly in the EU, US, and Asia, promote renewable fuel standards and stricter emissions evaluations, making green refining more appealing. Innovations in feedstocks, combined with a maturing supply chain, particularly for used cooking oil (UCO), waste fats, and agricultural residues, offer reduced costs and improved sustainability. Technological advancements in hydroprocessing, hydrotreating, and catalytic systems boost renewable yields, operational efficiency, and emissions profiles.

Simultaneously, corporate ESG policies and investor influence encourage oil & gas, as well as refining companies, to decarbonize their operations. The overarching demand for fuels, particularly in transportation and aviation, coupled with international regulatory agreements, decisively favors renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), and low-carbon drop-in fuels, resulting in increased investment in green refineries.

Segment Insights:

By feedstock, the used cooking oil segment dominated the market in 2024 due to its wide availability, relatively low cost, and improved carbon intensity as compared to virgin oils.

By process technology, the hydroprocessing segment led the market with the largest share in 2024. This is mainly due to its critical role in producing ultra-low sulfur fuels and renewable diesel from bio-based feedstocks, aligning with stringent environmental regulations.

By product type, the renewable diesel segment dominated the market, as it serves as a drop-in substitute to conventional diesel, with lower emissions and compatibility with existing fuel infrastructure.

By application, the transportation fuel segment dominated the market in 2024 due to its immediate scalability and compatibility with existing infrastructure, allowing for rapid decarbonization without the need for new hardware.

By end-user, the oil & gas companies segment dominated the market in 2024 due to their ownership of refining assets and vertical integration, allowing them to invest in and convert existing refining assets to produce renewable fuels.

Regional Insights:

Europe registered dominance in the green refineries market by capturing the largest share in 2024. This is mainly due to its robust legislative framework, including the Renewable Energy Directive, clean fuel mandates, and carbon pricing, which encourages significant investment in sustainable refining projects. Furthermore, major industry players such as Neste, Shell, and Total Energies are expanding their capacity or adapting existing facilities to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from waste feedstocks.

Asia Pacific is expected to experience rapid growth in the coming years, driven by increasing energy demands, concerns over air pollution, and government initiatives aimed at achieving carbon neutrality. Countries like Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and Australia are actively implementing mandates, offering incentives, and investing in infrastructure to support green feedstocks, hydrogen, and renewable-based refining processes.

The Asia–Pacific aviation market is expanding at breakneck speed. Rising middle classes, booming intra-regional tourism, and surging freight demand all point to more flights, bigger hubs, and rising emissions. Aviation has become the beating heart of regional integration — but it also represents a growing climate challenge.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is emerging as the most practical lever to square the circle. Yet supply is tight, costs remain high, and investors still need stronger policy signals. The question is how to reconcile rapid growth with credible decarbonization — without triggering ticket-price shocks or stalling aviation’s momentum.

Manufacturing: From Stopgaps to the Endgame

Near-term: Mature and proven Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) offer an approach to get early SAF volumes online. But the process which uses waste oils and animal fats, is in the view of many (Apeiron Included) neither scalable, nor sustainable.

Informed industry advocates see HEFA as a bridge, not the destination.

Medium-term: Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Fischer–Tropsch (FT) technologies hold more promise. By converting agricultural residues and municipal solid waste (MSW), they align with Asia’s resource profile — especially megacities that already struggle with waste management. Apeiron Energy are key advocates of MSW to SPK, its innovative, scalable, and with a global abundant feedstock.

Long-term: The ambition rests on e-SAF, or power-to-liquid fuels, synthesized from green hydrogen and captured CO₂. This is the gold standard: scalable, low-carbon, and globally fungible. But it hinges on two things: abundant, cheap renewable power, and commoditized hydrogen and CO₂ supply chains. In other words, Asia’s hydrogen economy will decide the region’s SAF destiny.

Policy Innovation: A Region in Motion

Governments are no longer standing still. Five markets illustrate the trend:

Singapore: Mandating 1% SAF on all departing flights by 2026, rising to 3–5% by 2030, with a passenger levy and centralized procurement.

Japan: Targeting up to 10% SAF by 2030, backed by price-gap mechanisms and clearer refinery obligations.

China: Developing industrial-scale projects that could serve both domestic and export demand.

India: Staging a blending pathway starting at 1% in the late 2020s, reaching 5% by 2030.

South Korea: Expected to begin with a 1% blend by 2027, reflecting a “start low, scale steadily” philosophy.

Australia has also entered the frame, publishing Refined Ambitions — roadmap for low-carbon liquid fuels.

Policy Design: Ambition Meets Bankability

Governments face a three-way trade-off:

Environmental credibility.

Economic competitiveness.

Social acceptability.

A workable policy stack can deliver balance:

Soft-start mandates with incremental rises (1% to 10%) to avoid sudden shocks.

Ticket levies to create a pooled fund for SAF purchase guarantees or contracts-for-difference (CfDs).

Producer de-risking tools — CfDs, low-interest loans, accelerated depreciation, and feedstock subsidies.

Flexible compliance mechanisms like book-and-claim, underpinned by mutual recognition of sustainability certifications.

Infrastructure: The Hidden Enabler

SAF must move seamlessly from plant to plane. That requires:

Blending facilities and hydrant system upgrades at major airports.

Intermodal pipelines and QA labs to lower handling costs.

A pan-Asia certificate registry, aligned with CORSIA, to let carriers arbitrage supply and pool demand across borders.

Demand Shaping: Keeping Fares in Check

Unchecked mandates risk ticket-price spikes. Consumers and business cannot and will not accept ticket price shocks. To avoid backlash, governments should pair mandates with:

Corporate and cargo pooled procurement.

Premium SAF options for business travellers.

Caps on levies tied to class of travel and route length.

Transparent disclosure, showing passengers how their contribution funds decarbonization.

Industrial Upside: Beyond Aviation

SAF offers more than climate compliance. MSW-to-fuel (particular reference to PtL) unlocks waste management jobs. Refinery conversions create short-term construction employment. e-SAF catalyses renewables, electrolyser manufacturing, and CO₂ capture.

In short, SAF is not just a decarbonization tool — it is a long-term industrial strategy.

The APAC Roadmap:

Pragmatic, Ambitious, Innovative.

Asia–Pacific could be considered as behind Europe and North America on SAF adoption. But that does not need to be the case. The region has the feedstock base, the demand at considerable scale, and the policy momentum to leapfrog.

The pragmatic path forward is iterative:

Start small, with modest mandates and transparent levies.

Deploy mature technologies like HEFA and co-processing first.

Build registry and logistics systems for regional efficiency.

Invest now in hydrogen and renewables to prepare for e-SAF.

Summary

Asia–Pacific SAF Playbook

Short-term: Existing & Mature Technologies for quick wins.

Medium-term: FT (potentially ATJ) from residues and MSW.

Long-term: e-SAF, dependent on hydrogen & CO₂ scalability.

Policy: Soft start mandates, levies, CfDs, book-and-claim.

Infrastructure: Blending upgrades, regional registry.

Demand shaping: Corporate procurement & levy fairness.

Industrial upside: Waste jobs, refinery retrofits, green hydrogen growth.

Conclusion

Three words define the Pan-Asia SAF approach: Pragmatic. Ambitious. Innovative.

The region’s aviation sector cannot pause growth. But with credible mandates, bankable finance mechanisms, and cooperative regional frameworks, Asia–Pacific can grow and decarbonize simultaneously.

The next five years will be critical in determining whether North America can scale SAF production to meet its targets for 2030 and beyond.
SAF North America Congress is designed to make those meetings possible - bringing together the leaders of aviation, energy, technology, and finance to align strategies, forge partnerships, and move the SAF agenda forward.
By enabling high-value face-to-face connections, we aim to ensure that North America not only meets its SAF ambitions but sets a global standard for innovation and collaboration.
North America has the resources, the policy support, and the entrepreneurial drive to lead, but its success will depend on the strength of its partnerships.","Over the past few years, North America has emerged as one of the most dynamic regions in the global sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market. Federal policies like tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, and growing state-level commitments have accelerated SAF development and deployment. Airlines have made historic offtake agreements, while energy majors and technology developers are investing billions into new production pathways.

Despite this momentum, challenges remain. The cost gap with conventional jet fuel continues to be significant, supply volumes are still a fraction of what is needed, and the race is on to secure reliable feedstock. At the same time, new technology pathways - from alcohol-to-jet to power-to-liquids - are moving closer to commercial readiness. The next five years will be critical in determining whether North America can scale SAF production to meet its targets for 2030 and beyond.

In this context, collaboration is no longer optional; it is essential.

Collaboration as the Catalyst for Scale-Up

The SAF value chain is complex, spanning agriculture, refining, technology development, logistics, and aviation operations. Unlike conventional fuels, no single entity can succeed in isolation. Joint ventures, co-investment structures, and long-term offtake agreements are increasingly necessary to distribute risk and align incentives.

While information on technology readiness, policy frameworks, and market developments is readily available, the translation of this knowledge into actionable partnerships depends on trust and shared objectives. These are most effectively established through direct, face-to-face engagement.

Over the past several years, our events have reflected the evolution of this industry. In the early days, attendees came primarily to “get to know the players” - to understand who was entering the market and what they were bringing to the table. Those meetings planted the seeds of partnerships that have since grown into joint ventures, supply agreements, and investment commitments.

Now, as the market matures, the emphasis has shifted. The need is less about introductions and more about strengthening ongoing relationships, advancing commercial agreements, and tackling shared challenges head-on.

That is where face-to-face meetings deliver their greatest value: creating space for candid conversations, alignment of objectives, and the type of collaborative problem-solving that accelerates real-world outcomes.

Creating Spaces for Connection

Our conferences are no longer just networking platforms; they have become catalysts for industry growth. Delegates come not only to exchange insights but also to move projects forward.

We recognize that senior executives’ time is scarce and valuable. Large conferences can make it difficult to connect with the right person, and busy schedules often mean missed opportunities. That is why we are introducing a new AI-powered Matchmaking App at our upcoming Houston event.

This tool is designed to remove the friction of networking. By connecting directly with LinkedIn, it maps your existing network, identifies relevant new contacts, and suggests high-quality connections based on your business priorities and interests. The result: no wasted time, fewer missed opportunities, and more productive conversations with the people who can genuinely advance your objectives.

For delegates, this means walking into the conference with a clear roadmap of who to meet, when to meet them, and why those meetings matter. In an industry as competitive and fast-moving as SAF, this level of efficiency and precision can make the difference between exploring opportunities and closing deals.

Looking Ahead: Building the Future of SAF Together

The reality is that growth in the SAF market depends on the individuals and companies shaping its future. Progress will be driven by those willing to connect, collaborate, and commit to long-term solutions. And that progress happens fastest when the right people are in the same room.

SAF North America Congress is designed to make those meetings possible - bringing together the leaders of aviation, energy, technology, and finance to align strategies, forge partnerships, and move the SAF agenda forward. By enabling high-value face-to-face connections, we aim to ensure that North America not only meets its SAF ambitions but sets a global standard for innovation and collaboration.

Conclusion

Sustainable aviation is no longer an abstract ambition—it is a fast-moving, competitive market that will define the future of global mobility. North America has the resources, the policy support, and the entrepreneurial drive to lead, but its success will depend on the strength of its partnerships.

At SAF North America Congress, we are proud to provide a platform where those connections can be made - where a handshake can open the door to the next generation of SAF projects, and where collaboration today will shape aviation for decades to come.

The company announced on Tuesday that it will soon begin shipping CO2 from the first of 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa through the repurposed 392-mile pipeline.

The former natural gas pipeline will transport the carbon dioxide across Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming to a sequestration site.

As the first of its kind to begin operation, the project is part of a national effort to reduce carbon emissions and make corn-based ethanol more environmentally friendly for new markets, like sustainable aviation fuel.

In conjunction with the launch, Tallgrass announced an initial donation of $500,000 to the new “Trailblazer Community Investment Fund,” managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation.

The company projects distributing more than $7 million over the next decade to support over 230 community organisations, with funds targeted for local early childhood centres, elder care facilities, and food pantries.

“It’s important to us to strategically invest back into the communities that have supported the project’s development,” said Kyle Quackenbush, Tallgrass segment president.

The investment fund was the result of negotiations with the environmental group Bold Nebraska, a former opponent of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline.

Jane Kleeb, the group’s founder, hailed the agreement as a new blueprint for infrastructure projects, stating that “rural communities deserve to benefit from the projects that impact them.”

Jeff Yost, president and CEO of the Nebraska Community Foundation, also praised the effort.

“I see these guys doing it for the right reasons,” Yost said of the pipeline company’s commitment, which is in addition to lease payments to landowners and spending more than $450,000 on disaster response training for local fire and rescue departments.

Financial Health Analysis

Despite its innovative approach, XCF Global's financial metrics reveal areas of concern:

Revenue Growth: Currently, the company reports zero revenue growth, indicating a nascent stage in its business operations.

Profitability: The EPS stands at -0.02, reflecting ongoing investments and development costs.

Margins: Operating, net, and gross margins are all reported at zero, highlighting the early-stage nature of XCF's business model.

Balance sheet analysis shows a lack of traditional financial strength metrics, such as current ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, which are not available. This absence of data suggests a need for cautious optimism regarding financial stability.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Current trading metrics provide limited insight due to the absence of traditional valuation ratios such as P/E, P/S, and P/B. However, technical indicators offer some perspective:

RSI (14): 30.32, indicating the stock may be oversold.

Moving Averages: The SMA-20 is at 1.36, and the SMA-50 is at 1.39, suggesting a bearish trend.

Institutional ownership is minimal at 1.42%, with no reported insider activity, which could imply limited market confidence or awareness at this stage.

Risk Assessment

Several risk factors are associated with XCF Global's current financial and market position:

Financial Health Grades: The Altman Z-Score and other financial health indicators are unavailable, which limits the ability to assess bankruptcy risk.

Sector-Specific Risks: As a player in the Utilities sector, XCF faces regulatory and technological adoption challenges.

Today, Alaska Airlines is investing in a sustainable and innovative future for aviation through Alaska Star Ventures, its venture capital arm.

“Rather than being bystanders, we want to make sure Alaska Airlines is part of driving meaningful changes in aviation,” he said.
A few companies in Alaska Star Ventures’ portfolio: Alaska Star Ventures is also creating technology companies through its partnership with UP.Labs.","At Alaska Airlines, elevating the future of travel means getting in on the ground floor of innovation.

Thirty years ago, Alaska Airlines revolutionized the passenger experience when it became the first airline to offer online ticketing. Alaska was also the first airline to use GPS to guide airplanes, and more recently, Alaska’s flight-operations teams were among the first to use artificial intelligence software to chart more efficient flight paths — conserving fuel and saving time for travelers.

Today, Alaska Airlines is investing in a sustainable and innovative future for aviation through Alaska Star Ventures, its venture capital arm. Alaska Star Ventures partners with and invests in startups whose technologies aim to increase operational efficiency and even change the shape of aircraft.

“We have a very rich history in innovation, and it’s truly disruptive innovation,” said Pasha Saleh, who has followed Alaska Airlines’ technology advances since he was a teen working toward his pilot’s license. Now, after a long career as a commercial pilot, Saleh leads Alaska’s corporate development through Alaska Star Ventures. “Rather than being bystanders, we want to make sure Alaska Airlines is part of driving meaningful changes in aviation,” he said.

A few companies in Alaska Star Ventures’ portfolio:

Alaska Star Ventures is also creating technology companies through its partnership with UP.Labs. The first new company, Odysee, launched last fall; its technology will leverage AI to optimize schedule plans to help put aircraft in the right place at the right time, improving reliability across flight operations. A second startup will be announced this year, and a third company is in development.

“All the companies we look at are developing technology that's completely disruptive to what we could figure out on our own,” Saleh said. Alaska Airlines’ in-house teams focus on continually improving the guest experience through innovations such as streamlining the check-in process, while the venture capital partnerships focus on technology advances outside the airline’s core expertise, with time horizons ranging from one year to 10 years.

“Passengers can be sure that because of the investments we're making, their trip is going to be safer, and it's going to be less prone to delays or misconnections,” Saleh said. “It's not on our shoulders to invent the future, but we want to find the smart people doing it, and give them the resources — not just financially, but also to train them on our problems and work with them to develop solutions first for our benefit, and for the airline industry, as well.”

One big challenge Alaska Airlines has taken on is the need to make air travel a more sustainable business. Alaska’s goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, and much of the technology Alaska Star Ventures invests in is designed to make progress toward that goal. “Our customers really care — and we really care — about being stewards of the environment and the pristine places in our country that we fly to,” Saleh said.

“Alaska Airlines is going to remain on the forefront of this innovation, like we have been with so many things in the past,” said Saleh, who suggested the name Alaska Star Ventures to honor the company’s history of innovation with a nod to one of its earliest names: Alaska Star Airlines.

“As an airplane geek growing up, I would read about this company (Alaska Airlines) that was associated with some of the great innovations in aviation,” Saleh said. “For me, it is super exciting and humbling to be adding to that journey.”

(""FlyORO""), a global leader in digital modular blending solutions for SAF, today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"").

Under the MOU, XCF and FlyORO will explore the creation of a global partnership to help solve one of aviation's biggest bottlenecks: SAF supply chain and blending inefficiencies. As most blending occurs upstream at production facilities, there are limitations to flexibility and scalability. Midstream and downstream infrastructure such as terminals or airports often lack the equipment and certification processes needed for blending. Together, XCF and FlyORO intend to co-develop an end-to-end solution to enable the ready uplift of SAF. By combining XCF's expertise in SAF production infrastructure with FlyORO's patented modular blending technology - AlphaLite™ - designed for flexible deployment either on-airport or pre-airport, the collaboration aims to support cost-effective, compliant, and scalable SAF integration into the global aviation fuel system.

The urgency to deploy scalable SAF infrastructure has never been greater. By 2030, the global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons. As this demand accelerates, next-generation blending solutions such as FlyORO's AlphaLite™ system, an innovative, flexible, and low-CAPEX technology, will be critical to bridging production with airports and fleets worldwide.

This potential partnership aligns directly with XCF's international expansion strategy announced in June 2025, under which the company is pursuing a capital-efficient, modular approach to global SAF deployment through regionally tailored partnerships. The potential collaboration with FlyORO would be expected to strengthen XCF's ability to deliver end-to-end SAF solutions, from production through blending and distribution, across the world.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""This partnership has the potential to rewire how the aviation industry thinks about SAF deployment. Blending isn't just a technical step, it's a critical piece of the infrastructure puzzle that determines how fast SAF can scale. By combining FlyORO's cutting-edge blending technology with XCF's global strategy, we're creating a pathway to accelerate adoption, reduce costs, and unlock new growth opportunities for investors and stakeholders alike.""

Damian Mc Loughlin, Chief Commercial Officer of FlyORO commented:

""FlyORO was founded with the mission to eliminate barriers to SAF adoption. Our modular AlphaLite™ system makes blending more flexible, scalable, and affordable. Working with XCF, we can expand this vision globally, bringing smarter logistics and faster SAF deployment to airports and airlines around the world.""

The non-binding MOU reflects a shared vision to accelerate SAF adoption and position both companies as leaders in clean aviation infrastructure. Execution is subject to due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Under the MOU, XCF and FlyORO will explore the creation of a global partnership to help solve one of aviation's biggest bottlenecks: SAF supply chain and blending inefficiencies. As most blending occurs upstream at production facilities, there are limitations to flexibility and scalability.

Together, XCF and FlyORO intend to co-develop an end-to-end solution to enable the ready uplift of SAF. By combining XCF's expertise in SAF production infrastructure with FlyORO's patented modular blending technology - AlphaLite™ - designed for flexible deployment either on-airport or pre-airport, the collaboration aims to support cost-effective, compliant, and scalable SAF integration into the global aviation fuel system.

The urgency to deploy scalable SAF infrastructure has never been greater. By 2030, the global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons. As this demand accelerates, next-generation blending solutions such as FlyORO's AlphaLite™ system, an innovative, flexible, and low-CAPEX technology, will be critical to bridging production with airports and fleets worldwide.

This potential partnership aligns directly with XCF's international expansion strategy announced in June 2025, under which the company is pursuing a capital-efficient, modular approach to global SAF deployment through regionally tailored partnerships. The potential collaboration with FlyORO would be expected to strengthen XCF's ability to deliver end-to-end SAF solutions, from production through blending and distribution, across the world.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""This partnership has the potential to rewire how the aviation industry thinks about SAF deployment. Blending isn't just a technical step, it's a critical piece of the infrastructure puzzle that determines how fast SAF can scale. By combining FlyORO's cutting-edge blending technology with XCF's global strategy, we're creating a pathway to accelerate adoption, reduce costs, and unlock new growth opportunities for investors and stakeholders alike.""

Damian Mc Loughlin, Chief Commercial Officer of FlyORO commented:

This project, which would constitute an investment of over €100 million, is framed within the company’s strategy to lead the energy transition in Spain and Europe, by driving infrastructure adapted to new energy vectors.

The project is conceived as an energy transition terminal, designed to progressively adapt to market developments, regulation and industrial demand, and will be equipped to operate with both conventional products and sustainable fuels, such as renewable ammonia, captured CO2, green methanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and other biofuels.

The plans incorporate the development of a plant designed under strict criteria of safety, energy efficiency, automation, and environmental sustainability. It will be distributed across two separate but connected sites, with a total capacity of approximately 165 000 m3 across 22 tanks (atmospheric, cryogenic, and pressurised) equipped to store hydrocarbons, chemical products, ammonia, and CO2.

The proposal would include an Iberian gauge railway loading bay with a direct connection to the national network, the connection of the terminal to two berths for ships via a network of high-capacity pipes and pumps, and loading islands for tanker trucks, in addition to all auxiliary operating and safety systems.

The planned activities include the storage, blending, and dispatch of a wide range of products, like biodiesel, hydro biodiesel (HVO), bioethanol, methanol, naphtha, SAF, and raw materials for biofuels and traditional hydrocarbons. It also provides for the blending of these products, and multimodal distribution.

In the case of cryogenic CO2 , plans provide for reception and storage in pressurised and refrigerated conditions, and dispatch by land and maritime transport, with the possibility of a future connection by pipeline. With regard to ammonia, reception by the same routes is under study, as is the possibility of temporary reception in cryogenic tanks and subsequent distribution by different forms of transport.

This flexible and integrated multimodal logistics infrastructure will facilitate the optimisation of the regional logistics system, improve operating efficiency, and guarantee a secure and sustainable energy supply for Galicia and the northwest of the Iberian peninsula. Given the complexity of the planned infrastructure, and the types of products to be stored, a scaled implementation is planned, with operations forecast to begin in 2029.

This future terminal would turn the Port of A Coruña into a leading logistics hub at national and European level, due to its strategic location on routes to Northern Europe, America, the south of the continent, and the Middle East.

Jorge Guillén, Aviation & Spain Network Lead, commented: “This initiative reflects Exolum’s firm commitment to the development of new logistics infrastructure in Spain, to tackle the challenges and opportunities of the energy transition. The Outer Port of A Coruña offers exceptional operating conditions, with a privileged location, maritime access, and a multimodal connection that makes it the ideal location of projects like this one. Exolum is confident this installation will contribute to the competitiveness of the industry and the Galician economy, fostering the creation of qualified jobs in the construction and operation phase and attracting industrial investment linked to the decarbonisation of the sector and green molecules.”",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/spain-flag-02.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 08:56:27.577541

“From the skills workforce perspective, there's a huge gap.","From wind power and hydrogen to decarbonised aviation, projects aimed at making that happen were front and centre at IMechE Focus: Sustainability and Decarbonisation (8-12 September), a webinar series sharing cutting edge expertise from industry and academia.

Here are key messages from three of the six sessions.

‘Radical’ solutions needed for aviation emissions

In 2019, air transport was responsible for about 900 megatonnes (million tonnes) of carbon emissions. That represents 2.1% of CO2 emissions from all human sources, said Dr Ken Hart from the University of Hertfordshire, speaking at Aero 2050 – Flying More Sustainably.

That amount could skyrocket due to increased demand, however, despite gradual improvements to fuel efficiency. “We’ve got to do something more radical,” said Dr Hart, who shared analysis of trends up to 2050.

Greener energy sources could include batteries, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but each have their own drawbacks, from low energy density and feedstock availability to storage challenges.

With supply unlikely to meet demand by 2050, Dr Hart suggested that engineers aim even higher. “You're going to need aircraft configured with a variety of fuels, propulsion systems, and that will depend on the distance they're flying and how many people they carry,” he said.

“Those fuels will consist of battery-electric, hybrid – which is a mixture of hydrogen, perhaps, and battery-electric, or battery-electric and standard gas turbines – and the sustainable aviation fuel.

“So the key challenge is really a development certification of new aircraft fuels and propulsion systems, and the production of these sustainable fuels in quantities needed to meet the future demand.”

It’s time to build the hydrogen workforce

The hydrogen economy of the future could have a huge number of jobs, according to George Jenkins, project leader for the Hydrogen Skills Alliance (HSA) – but they might not fall into simple categories. “When we talk about hydrogen, we're not just talking about one specific sector that needs focusing on. It really is a huge mix,” he said.

Other challenges include uncertainty around the total workforce demand and how the technology will evolve. “We still don't know 100% how current roles are going to be impacted,” Jenkins said. “Additionally, there's a huge amount of competition for the sorts of skillsets that people working in hydrogen might need; competition from other sectors, from oil and gas, from wind.”

One thing is clear, however – a skilled workforce will be needed. Earlier this year, the HSA launched a strategic plan with four main points. “Firstly, we need to understand what the problem is, what the likely demand is, what's already out there. We then need to maximise what's already there.” The next steps are analysing gaps in provision and developing a new curriculum, followed by positioning hydrogen as an aspirational career destination.

The alliance is starting to make that happen with the development of a new framework, which breaks down the roles that might be affected by hydrogen, such as aerospace engineers. The organisation conducted research with industry to understand the roles and the skills they will need in future. That can then be used by industry to understand what should be included in qualifications.

The HSA is also launching the Hydrogen Skills Accelerator programme in the South West and North West of England, which aims to develop open-source training content for the UK hydrogen workforce.

It’s not going to be easy – but there are opportunities to take

Skills gaps, investment uncertainty, policy implementation – industrial decarbonisation is far from easy. A cross-industry panel explored those challenges, and how they might be tackled through effective use of industrial clusters, sector coupling and new technologies.

“Collectively, all the developers, investors and government policymakers need to create a friendly and also high-growth opportunity environment for the workforce, allow them to stay in the energy transition sector and support long-term growth,” said Dr Shengke Zhi from AtkinsRéalis.

“From the skills workforce perspective, there's a huge gap. So that also means an opportunity for all people – if you have transferable skills, if you have aspirations supporting energy transition, we can guarantee there is a big opportunity for you. You can then have a long-term career in the energy transition market.”

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, October 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- • Contrails cause 1-2% of global warming and therefore both organizations are now urging all

commercial airlines to immediately publish their own transparent contrail analysis reports.

• VICTOR and 4AIR are also calling for improvements in flight path planning and Air Traffic Control

protocols, which could reduce the overall impact of contrails

In partnership with 4AIR, Victor, a global leader in on-demand aircraft charter, today announces the

results of its inaugural 2025 Annual Contrails Report, further verifying the impact of contrails on global

warming, as both organisations continue to raise awareness of the CO2 and non-CO2 impact of business

aviation on climate change and urge all commercial airlines to immediately publish their own

transparent contrail analysis reports.

Contrails are long thin lines of cloud, usually seen behind an aircraft and are a product of aircraft engine

emissions interacting with the right combination of temperature and humidity in the upper atmosphere.

Depending on the location and time of day, long-lasting or “big-hit” contrails can have an outsized

warming impact, trapping and absorbing heat that otherwise would radiate back into space. Research

conducted by the European Commission indicates that contrails and non-CO₂ emissions are currently

responsible for about twice as much warming as the CO2 emitted by aviation. Recent estimates from the

University of Cambridge Aviation Impact Accelerator, show that contrails cause about the same amount

of warming each year as all the CO₂ emitted by all flights from 1945 to 2018.

Toby Edwards, co-CEO at Victor stated: “One misconception is that private jets fly above contrail regions,

our report proves this isn’t always the case. We want our private jet clients to have the option to avoid

contrail formation by choosing progressive operators that are proactively making small adjustments to

their flight paths to avoid contrail-forming regions, thereby lowering their environmental

impact. Operators that are working on contrail avoidance using smart flight management software,

which is already readily available, would be transparently recommended to clients. Such an offering

would be a natural extension to our existing product, which includes aircraft estimate fuel-burn data and

Neste sustainable aviation fuel.”

Victor’s transparent Contrails Report, the first of its kind from a private jet charter broker, and set to be

republished annually, analysed 2,987 flights across a mixed fleet worldwide. The findings revealed that

just 1% of contrails accounted for 48% of total warming impact, highlighting how a small number of

high-impact contrails are disproportionately responsible for climate effects, which demonstrates that

meaningful change is achievable by targeting specific flight profiles.

A similar previous study by 4AIR also showed the concentration of a majority of the contrail impact

emerging from a small minority of flights, underscoring the opportunity to cut climate impact

substantially by addressing just a fraction of flights.

Results from the comprehensive analysis by 4AIR, who used the open-source Contrail Cirrus Prediction

model from Contrails.org and hindcast weather data plus ADSB data within a flight, shines the spotlight

on the non-CO2 impact of Victor’s charter flights and highlights the alarming impact of contrails by the

growing commercial airline sector, reinforcing calls to accelerate the deployment of known mitigation

techniques that could quickly reduce these effects.

Kennedy Ricci, President of 4AIR points out this is an industry wide aviation issue, not isolated to

business aviation. “Avoiding atmospheric regions likely to create big hit contrails represents a very large

opportunity to reduce the impact from aviation. But effectively mitigating these regions will require proactive flight planning by operators as well as coordination with Air Traffic Control. As we look at meeting aviation’s climate goals, it is critical to raise awareness of both the impact and opportunity of non-CO2 impacts and encourage operators to understand their contrail footprint”.

The PC-12 PRO is the latest version of the world’s best-selling single-engine turboprop in its category.","The Pilatus Advanced Cockpit Environment ACE, based on the Garmin G3000 Prime, is at the heart of the new PC-12 PRO.

Following on from the launch of the new model in spring 2025, the very first customer, Dion Weisler, recently took delivery of his brand-new aircraft and personally flew it home from Switzerland to Australia.

Weisler, former CEO of HP Inc., has relied on the Most Advanced Single for many years: the PC-12 PRO is his fourth PC-12. Having previously owned a PC-12 NG and two PC-12 NGXs, his move to the PC-12 PRO is a clear sign of his long-standing faith in one of the best-performing aircraft in its category.

“To me as a pilot, you rely on two things in particular: there’s the airplane, and then there’s the pilot. And if something happens to the pilot, what are your options? In the PC-12 PRO, you’ve got the new ‘Safety Autoland’ emergency function — which I think is absolutely invaluable. It keeps my family, my friends and anyone else on board safe. If something happens to me, this system automatically takes control to get the aircraft back on the ground at the nearest airport. You can’t put a price on that additional peace of mind,” said Weisler.

Weisler couldn’t pass up the opportunity to fly his PC-12 PRO back to Australia himself, together with one of the Pilatus pilots. The total flight time of 41 hours was split across six days, which saw them leave from Switzerland, and fly via Crete, Egypt, Oman, India, Malaysia, Bali, and Darwin, before arriving “home” in Adelaide, South Australia.

“It was an incredible learning opportunity to fly your own aircraft home over such a vast distance with a factory pilot sitting right seat. In addition to visiting all these amazing countries, it really allowed me to consolidate the crossover training within the new Garmin cockpit environment, and have someone right there to ask any questions about anything that popped up. I am thrilled to own this new intuitive and highly innovative aircraft, and look forward to flying many missions in the future with it.”

“Every decision behind the PC-12 PRO was driven by one question: How do we create more value for our customers? From enhanced cockpit technologies to refined comfort and performance, the PC-12 PRO reflects the voices of those who fly it. It is the result of listening, learning, and delivering – a new aircraft shaped entirely around the people at the heart of Pilatus,” said André Zimmermann, vice-president, Business Aviation.

The PC-12 PRO is the latest version of the world’s best-selling single-engine turboprop in its category.

Equipped with the Garmin G3000 Prime and a completely redesigned cockpit which includes five high-resolution touchscreen displays, it offers state-of-the-art technology and comfort, coupled with a suite of new safety features which includes Safety Autoland. In a nutshell, it is The Most Advanced Single.

In a single-engine aircraft, a proven engine is the most important component. Fortunately, the PC-12 PRO is equipped with the latest version of the most reliable aircraft engine ever produced – the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6.

With over 60,000 engines in use and over 400 million flight hours, the PT6 family of engines has an unrivalled track record. The PT6 engine has already been successfully tested in over 11 million flight hours with the PC-12. Like its predecessor, the PC-12 PRO is also capable of operating with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which enables more sustainable flying at a consistently high level of performance.

In combination with the fully automatic Electronic Propeller and Engine Control System (EPECS), the digital thrust control – or autothrottle system – reduces pilot workload, increases fuel efficiency, ensures a smoother flight experience and protects against engine overload.

The round saw participation from new investors including Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), and Hostplus, alongside continued support from Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

The funds will support OXCCU’s commercialization efforts, expand operations, and advance the next phase of its technology scale-up. This follows the 2024 launch of its OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport, with the second demonstration plant, OX2, expected to be fully operational in 2026.

“The successful funding shows that investors are backing technologies with real potential to make a difference,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “Our goal is to make SAF more affordable and accessible, helping the aviation sector decarbonize at scale.”

OXCCU’s patented iron-based catalyst simplifies SAF production by converting gaseous waste carbon directly into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons in a single reaction, eliminating costly intermediate steps. The technology works with a range of input gases, including reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and carbon dioxide with hydrogen, lowering both operating costs and carbon intensity.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG, highlighted the strategic importance of the investment: “Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 requires new fuels. This investment in OXCCU supports our commitment to meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030 and helps develop next-generation fuels.”

Ireneusz Fafara, President of ORLEN, added: “Supporting OXCCU aligns with our goal of becoming a leading SAF producer in Europe by 2035. Their technology helps us produce renewable fuels and move toward carbon neutrality.”

Nathalie Stubler, Chief Sustainability Officer at Safran, said: “We support scaling promising SAF technologies alongside our own decarbonization efforts in engines and aircraft systems.”

Daniel Goldman of Clean Energy Ventures noted OXCCU’s rapid progress: “In just a few years, OXCCU has gone from lab to commercial demonstration, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost.”

Dr. Robert Trezona from IP Group added: “This funding is a milestone for the SAF sector and demonstrates the UK’s ability to turn world-class science into solutions that decarbonize aviation while creating jobs.”

OXCCU’s technology also has potential applications beyond aviation, including the production of chemicals and plastics. Symes emphasized the urgency: “The climate challenge is increasing.

There is an additional pyrolysis oil capacity of more than 300,000 tonnes/year under construction or undergoing commissioning.","The second half of 2025 could see renewed investment in chemical recycling after the EU set out its approach to mass-balance accounting in early July. But what effect will these new rules actually have in practice, and is there still room for additional changes? ICIS’ Mark Victory tells us more.

The EU has proposed a fuel-exempt approach to pyrolysis oil, and a consultation period on these proposals ended on 19 August.

The Commission is currently conducting a review before presenting a final draft to its technical, with the aim of adopting the proposals under an implementing decision in Autumn 2025. The extent of any changes to the SUPD proposals resulting from the consultation is currently unclear.

The lack of clarity over the EU’s approach had delayed some investment decisions in 2024 and H1 2025.

Nevertheless, while this goes some way to clarifying one of the key regulatory uncertainties facing the market, there remain areas of legislative doubt that continue to negatively impact demand and investment decisions. These include:

Definitions of waste and recycling under Directive 2008/98/EC - also known as the Waste Framework Directive – which forms the basis of the majority of EU recycling legislation definitions

The End-of-life Vehicles Regulation (ELVR) and whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards proposed targets, and what those proposed targets will be

Whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) targets

This was underscored on 5 August by OMV, whose CEO told ICIS that it needs a more secure regulatory environment before it is willing to risk further investment in scaling up its chemical recycling facilities.

With Europe the first region to detail its approach to mass-balance accounting, there are also concerns over the impact of a fuel-exempt approach on cost-competitiveness with other regions – should they adopt more lenient mass-balance accounting practices such as free-allocation – along with the negative impact on profitability domestically compared with a free-allocation approach.

Legislation surrounding renewable fuels, meanwhile, enjoys greater clarity, and targets under legislation such as the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) III and the Fit for 55 package are encouraging the use of pyrolysis oil as fuel (under the Fit for 55 package fuel derived from plastic waste can count towards targets such as those for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) provided it meets certain criteria such as demonstrating emissions reduction).

This continues to encourage tyre-based pyrolysis oil producers to separate out bio-attributed content and polymer content in pyrolysis oil production, with bio-attributed content attracting premiums compared with polymer-derived tyre-based pyrolysis oil. This is a trend expected to continue in H2 2025 and further in to the mid term.

The wider investment climate remains challenging, particularly given the consolidation of cracker volumes in Europe. Nevertheless, despite both regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainty, investment into pyrolysis oil continues, and brand owners still see pyrolysis oil as a key solution for mass-scale food-contact recycled packaging.

Prices have proved resilient so far in 2025 to the wider macroeconomic malaise afflicting the European chemical sector – particularly for plastic-derived grades - which is at least in part due to structural shortages.

Pyrolysis is expected to be the world’s largest chemical recycling technology by capacity. Europe has a current plastic-derived pyrolysis oil installed input capacity of approximately 150,000 tonnes/year, according to the ICIS Recycling Supply Tracker - Chemical. There is an additional pyrolysis oil capacity of more than 300,000 tonnes/year under construction or undergoing commissioning.

A number of pyrolysis oil plant start-ups have faced delays in 2023-2025 as a result of:

Access to suitable quality waste

Challenges managing the variability of feedstock properties

Delays in environmental permits

Longer than expected commissioning phases for process optimization

Negative macroeconomic conditions creating financing challenges and changing cost structures

This has created a challenge for upstream recycled agglomerate players. Many waste managers have added agglomeration capacity in recent years with a view to serving the burgeoning pyrolysis oil market.

Nevertheless, plant start-up delays has meant the while agglomeration capacity has come onstream, the pyrolysis oil capacity this feedstock was intended to serve has not. This has meant a reduction in investment in agglomeration, and some lines being idled.

There are concerns that this could create challenges for the pyrolysis oil industry as it grows, with access to sufficient high quality waste continuing to be seen as one of the core potential barriers to market scale.

Players continue to expect demand to scale up for pyrolysis oil – particularly plastic-derived grades – in the next 12-24 months, but expect a more rapid increase in supply and demand from 2027-2028 as players gear up to meet voluntary and regulatory recycling targets for 2030.

The super-midsize jet is priced at about $19.5 million and is expected to take its first flight in 2027, with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 25 certification and entry into service targeted for 2030.

At the event, Otto unveiled a full-scale mockup of the Phantom 3500, which the company says will reduce fuel burn by more than 60 percent compared with traditional designs. The clean-sheet jet utilizes laminar-flow aerodynamics and all-carbon-fiber composites to enhance efficiency and lower costs.

""Business jets have long relied on derivative designs built from traditional aluminum structures, aerodynamics, and manufacturing techniques from decades past,"" said Paul Touw, CEO of Otto Aerospace. ""Freed from legacy systems and guided by a true clean-sheet, ultra-efficient vision for the future, we rethink everything to unlock performance gains once thought impossible.""

When powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Otto says the Phantom 3500 will cut emissions by more than 90 percent while lowering fuel costs by 40 percent. At a cruise speed of 590 mph, the company says that the aircraft achieves CO2 emissions per seat mile nearly equal to electric vehicles traveling at 55 mph, while flying at altitudes where contrails rarely form.

The jet will also feature ultra-wide passenger windows, spanning 72 inches, made possible by the company’s SuperNatural Vision technology. The windows are designed to be lighter, quieter, safer, and more energy efficient.","https://img.militaryaerospace.com/files/base/ebm/mae/image/2025/09/68dc22a75bf65d42cc820b82-ottoatup.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-01 06:56:31.585489

This new capital will enable OXCCU to accelerate its commercialisation efforts, expand its operations, and advance its next phase of technology scale-up. It builds on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Its second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale. OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said: ""We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

Immingham site to be flagship SAF Plant

Altalto is based in North Lincolnshire. They aim to transform waste into sustainable, advanced biofuels. They use a mix of commercial and household waste to produce clean biofuels that reduce greenhouse emissions.

The award will enable Altalto to integrate two technologies into its waste-to-SAF process.

The first is NEXTCHEM’s NX Circular gasification: a process which converts waste materials into a synthesis gas. The other is NX CPO, a catalytic process which provides a low-carbon solution to producing synthetic gas.

The integration of new technology will make the Immingham plant the most advanced SAF site in the UK.

Altalto has reported that it will produce 30 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel each year. This achievement will support the UK in achieving its SAF mandate. The mandate requires 10% of jet fuels to have sustainable origins by 2030.

Who are Altalto?

Altalto has developed a plan for the UK’s first commercial waste-to-sustainable fuel plant. The plant, once fully operational will take over 500,000 tonnes of household and commercial waste and convert it into 60 million litres of sustainable fuel each year. This will replace the current disposal process of sending to landfill or incineration.

Altalto combine several technologies in an effort to deliver a more cost-effective supply of sustainable energy. There is a focus on the product being acceptable for use for long-haul air travel due to the reliance on liquid fuels.

The new plant will save 80,000 tonnes of CO2 waste per year, reducing greenhouse gases. It will also bring 100 long term employment opportunities to the local area.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/home-image-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 06:56:57.804791

There is a need to develop tools that make it easier to use the climate budget in practice.","Can the Armed Forces carry out the military buildup in the “Defence Pledge” long-term plan while cutting greenhouse gas emissions? If strong climate measures are not implemented, emissions will more than double during the long-term planning period. However, with robust measures, much of the increase can be avoided, even as the Armed Forces grow significantly.

Climate change is a serious threat to the Armed Forces and NATO, so the Armed Forces have a vested interest in reducing emissions as much as possible. Moreover, climate measures can contribute to increased combat capability and improved adaption to future combat environments – if done correctly. For example, climate-friendly energy and fuel technologies may enhance the Armed Forces’ energy and supply security. At the same time, it must be assessed whether new vulnerabilities and risks arise. Climate-adapted defensive forces could save operational costs related to fuel and climate taxes, especially in the long term. However, that path may be more expensive in the short and medium term. Therefore, thorough assessments of possible climate measures in the Armed Forces are needed, where climate impact, economics, and operational capability are considered together. A climate budget can support this.

A climate budget is a management tool for cutting emissions. It is reminiscent of a financial budget, but instead of money, it deals with emissions – and how to reach specific climate goals. The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) has been tasked with developing a climate budget for the defence sector, and this report documents our initial results.

However, creating such a climate budget is not enough. The knowledge FFI has gathered here – and will continue to gather in the coming years – will only contribute to a real green transition if followed up with decisions and actions.

In this report, we have modelled the Armed Forces’ future greenhouse gas emissions. Both direct and indirect emissions could increase significantly if no measures are taken. We have thus examined three initiatives to reduce these emissions: 1) the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), 2) climate assessments in the concept phase, and 3) zero-emission technology on new standard vessels. All three measures can lead to significant emission reductions, and we recommend the sector proceed with them. Nevertheless, these will not be sufficient to meet the sector’s own climate goals. Additional measures will be needed.

We also present a selection of success criteria for implementing a climate budget in the defence sector. These include integrating climate efforts more closely into investment and budgeting processes, creating ownership and anchoring, ensuring sufficient resources and organization, and building competence and communication.

Finally, we point to areas that require further work. The projections can be improved. There is a need to develop tools that make it easier to use the climate budget in practice. FFI is planning a study on how SAF can strengthen supply preparedness, and we aim to delve deeper into climate-economic issues that may be relevant for the defence sector.",https://www.ffi.no/en/publications-archive/er-det-mulig-a-ruste-opp-forsvaret-pa-en-klimavennlig-mate-forsvarssektorens-klimabudsjett-2025/_/image/81842178-6336-4e3b-8aa5-9d84a92041ca:4dc6adec38f0d7aed0fc61b0513eefb79a74b502/block-1200-630/FFI_SEO-bilde_m%C3%B8rk.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 06:57:07.976682

The Department for Transport (DfT) has provided £1.5m for a feasibility study looking at whether sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from elements of carbon dioxide and water could be manufactured at the Yeadon-based airport.

SAFs are man-made alternatives to fossil fuels and are typically created from plant oils or household waste.

The eight-month study will look at whether the the energy, known as Electrolysis Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF), could be made and then used at LBA to power aircraft.

The study is being delivered by the University of Sheffield in partnership with the airport and with support from academics at the University of Leeds.

While SAFs still release carbon when burned by aircraft, as the fuel is recycled it will not be adding to the overall load of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

LBA Chief Executive Vincent Hodder said: ""I know this sounds like science fiction, but it is just science.

""The only ingredients that go into eSAF are electricity, water and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

""All of that is available locally and then all we have to do is transport the liquid to the aircraft and you've got a completely circular carbon movement.""

Leeds North West MP Katie White, who campaigned for the study, said: ""This funding is a crucial step towards making sustainable jet fuel a reality at Leeds Bradford.

""It's about cutting emissions in one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, and creating the skilled jobs and investment that come with it.

""I'm proud to see our region leading the way.""

If the study is deemed a success, a production facility powered by green electricity could be built at the airport to extract carbon elements from the air alongside hydrogen elements from water. These would then be recombined to create the eSAF.

Transport and Environment, a campaign group which lobbies for clean energy and fuel, has welcomed the news but warned there was a ""mountain to climb"" to ""create enough SAF to satisfy the UK aviation industry"".

Roger Tyers, the group's UK aviation policy manager, said: ""We think this is the future for aviation but these kind of fuels are still in their infancy.

""The tech is proven but we don't have any being developed on a large commercial scale yet.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/93b4/live/48ec56c0-995a-11f0-af33-e32b3939e8ca.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 06:57:15.322675

Sheldon Hee, IATA Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific, emphasised that aviation contributes approximately US$14.4 billion (RM68.1 billion) annually and supports over 650,000 jobs, including 100,000 direct aviation roles.

Hee stressed the importance of policies that avoid negative impacts on airlines and passengers, particularly concerning taxes, levies, and security-related fees beyond border controls.

Malaysia’s position as an international travel hub relies on maintaining efficiency and competitiveness, while higher operating costs could harm airlines, travellers, and Malaysia’s global connectivity.

A positive development noted by Hee is the recent introduction of the first locally blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). IATA is in discussions with the government about establishing a robust SAF policy by 2027 to align with global carbon reduction efforts in aviation.

As part of its engagement with policymakers, IATA has submitted six proposals for Budget 2026. These include calls for stable and predictable policies to support renewable energy and fuel production, transparency in SAF pricing, and mechanisms to ensure airlines can reliably claim environmental benefits from using SAF.

The association also urged the government to avoid introducing a SAF mandate as a stand-alone measure without incentives to help bridge the price gap with conventional fuel. In addition, it recommended recognising global SAF accounting and reporting standards to support market access and participation in international SAF trade.

Looking ahead, Hee said Malaysia stands to benefit from the Asia Pacific region’s projected rapid aviation growth over the next 20 years, provided that the right policies are in place.

He highlighted digitalisation as a key area for improvement, with IATA’s ONE ID system for passengers and ONE Record for cargo offering opportunities to improve efficiency and productivity.

ONE ID aims to streamline travel through identity management and biometric recognition, while ONE Record provides a unified view of shipments through shared data and digital logistics.

Hee underscored the need for training incentives to develop the skilled workforce required for future industry demands. Aviation not only generates direct employment but also supports wider economic activities such as tourism, trade, and investment. He pointed out that each flight connecting Malaysia to the world contributes to the country’s economic opportunities.

Concluding, Hee reaffirmed IATA’s readiness to collaborate with the government to ensure Budget 2026 policies fully unlock Malaysia’s international aviation potential. The budget is scheduled to be presented by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim in Parliament on October 10.

With this latest milestone, LanzaJet continues to lead the scale-up of sustainable fuels globally as it combines technological innovation, operating experience, and deep partnerships to decarbonize aviation at pace.","LanzaJet Inc., a leading next-gen fuels technology company and producer of sustainable fuels, has been awarded more than $13 million (£10 million) from the U.K. Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to accelerate development of Project Speedbird, a major sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) biorefinery in Teesside, U.K., being developed primarily for LanzaJet investor and SAF customer British Airways.

The award will support the next phase of work on Project Speedbird as it progresses into front-end engineering design (FEED), marking a key milestone in the creation of one of the U.K.’s first commercial-scale ethanol-to-SAF production facilities using waste-based feedstocks. Among the projects selected in this round of the AFF, Speedbird received the largest award, underscoring LanzaJet’s advancement in the SAF industry, the maturity of the project, and the U.K.’s commitment to moving beyond pilots toward industrial deployment.

Project Speedbird is set to transform the aviation sector by producing SAF from low-carbon ethanol using LanzaJet’s patented and fully integrated Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. The LanzaJet solution incorporates Technip Energies’ Hummingbird® ethanol-to-ethylene technology, which Project Speedbird has licensed, and which is deployed at commercial demonstration scale for the first time at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia, USA.

Once Project Speedbird is operational, the facility is expected to produce over 30 million gallons (approximately 90 kilotons) of sustainable fuels from low-carbon ethanol each year, significantly reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil jet fuel.

“We’ve maintained a long-held belief that creating a new industry requires partnership across the public and private sectors. We’re proud to collaborate with the U.K. Department for Transport to advance Project Speedbird as a leading project catalyzing SAF development in the U.K.,” said Jimmy Samartzis, CEO at LanzaJet. ​“This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet as a leading SAF company, in our ATJ technology, and in the critical role of ethanol-to-SAF in delivering economic growth, creating jobs, and decarbonizing air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the U.K. and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region. We thank the U.K. Department for Transport for its leadership and vision in accelerating the transition to net-zero aviation.”

The project aligns with the U.K. Government’s SAF mandate, which requires 10% of jet fuel used in the U.K. to come from sustainable sources by 2030.

Located in the heart of Teesside, the LanzaJet plant will also deliver significant regional benefits – creating hundreds of jobs, boosting the local economy, and contributing to the region’s position as a clean energy hub. By anchoring the project in Teesside, LanzaJet is helping to build out a broader ecosystem for sustainable fuels, one that connects local feedstock providers, renewable energy producers, and storage and distribution partners. In doing so, the project supports the U.K.’s broader net-zero strategy and the Government’s ambition for the country to become a global SAF leader.

A UK-based climate technology firm has secured $28 million in Series B funding to commercialize a novel process for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The core development is a patented iron-based catalyst that converts waste carbon dioxide (CO2) and green hydrogen directly into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons in a single exothermic reaction. This breakthrough simplifies the complex e-fuel production supply chain by eliminating costly intermediate steps, immediately lowering the capital and operating expenditure required to scale production. The successful funding round validates a critical pathway for the aviation sector, which is currently struggling to meet decarbonization targets, with the resulting fuel offering up to an 85% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Context

The informed professional has consistently wondered → What is the true cost of e-fuels, and can they be produced at a scale that matters? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is seen as the only viable near-term solution for aviation decarbonization, yet high production costs and feedstock scarcity have kept its adoption rate low, accounting for only 0.7% of total airline fuel consumption. The industry consensus has been that without a major technological or policy intervention to drive down the cost of synthesis, mandated targets would remain out of reach.

Analysis

This development is driven by a technological breakthrough in catalysis. Traditional e-fuel production pathways require multiple energy-intensive chemical steps, such as the reverse water gas shift or the creation of e-methanol as an intermediate product. The new patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet fuel from the two core building blocks → waste CO2 and green hydrogen → in one reactor. Think of this catalyst as a shortcut that bypasses two expensive toll booths on the fuel production highway.

This simplification reduces the required equipment footprint and energy input, which is the primary cause of the high cost of e-fuels. Manufacturers are expected to react by accelerating partnerships and offtake agreements with companies that can demonstrate a clear, cost-competitive path to meeting the growing regulatory and corporate demand for SAF.

Outlook

This development implies that the cost curve for e-fuels will bend downward faster than previously modeled, making SAF a more competitive commodity. The next simple thing to watch for is the operational status of the company’s second demonstration plant, OX2, which is expected to be fully operational in 2026. A successful demonstration at this larger scale will signal that the technology is moving from lab-validated to commercially de-risked, which will trigger a wave of new, large-scale offtake agreements and final investment decisions for full commercial plants.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Allium-Inflorescence-Morphology-Supporting-Pollinator-Biodiversity-Sustainable-Agroecosystem-Functionality.jpeg,N,,2025-10-01 02:56:13.462066

The company is also pushing a climate narrative, designing the aircraft to fly at altitudes where contrails are less likely and using Williams engines compatible with 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel.","The private aviation world has a new disruptor, and it doesn’t have windows. Texas-based Otto Aerospace’s Phantom 3500, backed by a substantial 300-aircraft order from Flexjet, is betting that passengers will trade their porthole views for panoramic digital screens and fuel savings that could make flying private more affordable than business class.

At first glance, the idea sounds like science fiction. A business jet with no traditional windows, its fuselage wrapped in smooth composite skin, cameras feeding live footage to six-foot-wide displays lining the cabin walls. CEO Paul Touw calls the experience “surreal,” promising passengers can “look at the entire world around you,” including the curvature of Earth at cruise altitude.

The company has branded this setup “SuperNatural Vision,” and while it might take some convincing for travelers used to pressing their noses against Gulfstream glass, there’s serious engineering behind the spectacle.

The real story is efficiency. According to the WSJ, Otto claims the Phantom 3500 will burn 60% less fuel than comparable midsize jets. That’s not a modest improvement, it’s a generational leap. The secret lies in laminar flow aerodynamics. Without window cutouts interrupting the fuselage, air slides smoothly over the carbon-fiber skin. Add smaller engines made possible by reduced fuel needs, and Otto argues it can deliver 3,200 to 3,500 nautical miles of range, 590 mph cruise speeds, and access to short runways, all at a target list price of $19.5 million. That undercuts super-midsize incumbents and threatens high-end light jets on total ownership costs.

Flexjet’s massive order, one of the largest firm commitments in business aviation history, signals this isn’t just vaporware. The Ohio-based fractional ownership giant, fresh off an $800 million capital raise led by L Catterton, is positioning the Phantom 3500 as a core platform for its fleet. Chairman Kenn Ricci frames the bet as “introducing tomorrow’s standards,” and with 300 aircraft on order, Flexjet is clearly banking that tomorrow arrives soon.

The timeline is aggressive but not fantasy. Otto has unveiled a full-scale mockup, first flight is targeted for 2027, and deliveries should begin around 2030. Manufacturing will happen at a one-million-square-foot smart factory at Jacksonville’s Cecil Airport, backed by $515 million in state incentives. The supply chain reads like a who’s who of aerospace: Leonardo for composites, Williams International for engines, Garmin for avionics, Mecaer for landing gear. Leadership includes former Boeing Chairman Dennis Muilenburg and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the board, lending heavyweight credibility to what could otherwise appear to be startup moonshot territory.

Regulations won’t block the concept either. FAA Part 25 certification doesn’t mandate passenger windows, though emergency exits need viewing capability. Otto will install small traditional windows at exits and build redundancy into the camera system. The company is also pushing a climate narrative, designing the aircraft to fly at altitudes where contrails are less likely and using Williams engines compatible with 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel. Otto claims a 90% carbon dioxide reduction with SAF and up to 97% total warming impact reduction when contrail avoidance is factored in.",https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/otto-aerospaces-phantom-3500.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 16:57:02.923322

Masdar plans to apply the UAE's experience in producing sustainable aviation fuel to Azerbaijan, Murad Sadigov, head of the Masdar representative office in Azerbaijan, said at the Baku Climate Action Week (BCAW2025), Trend reports.

The evolution of sustainable energy modalities in Azerbaijan transcends mere export initiatives, concurrently striving to enhance the robustness and dependability of the national energy infrastructure.

In his perspective, the primary objective transcends merely addressing inefficiencies within the energy infrastructure; it also encompasses the development of a robust and dependable framework. ""The volatility of energy resources renders them devoid of intrinsic value; conversely, the reliability of energy systems is paramount,"" he asserted.

Consequently, the energy strategy was formulated to facilitate stakeholder engagement with the grid infrastructure while concurrently upholding a robust and reliable energy provision.

Sadigov highlighted the criticality of deploying energy storage architectures, optimizing balancing mechanisms, and integrating diverse renewable energy portfolios, while underscoring the significance of continuous investigation into offshore wind energy technologies and green hydrogen innovations.

He pointed out that Masdar is actively investing in green hydrogen production and is already implementing a pilot project to produce sustainable aviation fuel in the UAE, a project the company plans to apply in Azerbaijan.

Masdar has also launched the largest '24-hour generation' project-a combination of solar power (5.5 GW) and storage systems (19 GWh)-under construction in the UAE.

The company intends to implement similar solutions in Azerbaijan on a smaller scale.

""Such technological challenges make it possible to bring renewable energy as close as possible to commercial generation. This is made possible by the support of the Azerbaijani government and the availability of qualified personnel, as the country has always been a leading energy hub and is currently transferring innovations to the renewable energy sector,"" Sadigov explained.

He also noted that the Azerbaijani government is investing in grid modernization and recently announced the construction of two large storage systems to control frequency and energy flows, which will increase grid resilience and reliability.

As Sadigov puts it, Azerbaijan's sights are set on the horizon, reaching for the stars and aiming to do much more than just send green energy across to Europe.

""We have also witnessed the signing of agreements with Central Asia. This is a step toward the formation of a large-scale energy network that will ensure stability throughout the region. Azerbaijan is becoming the heart of an energy hub that will play a key role in the energy transition not only for the Caucasus but for all of Eurasia,"" he added.",https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-09/30/TNA_6a8dbimage_story.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 16:57:17.303481

London, 29 September 2025 - International Airlines Group (IAG) has participated in the £20.75 million ($28 million) Series B funding round for OXCCU, a UK-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) innovator. IAG has been joined by new and existing investors including Safran Corporate Ventures, Orlen and Aramco Ventures, among others.

IAG invested in OXCCU through IAGi Ventures, its dedicated corporate venturing arm, which earlier this year announced an investment commitment of up to €200 million over five years – the largest by a European airline group. OXCCU exemplifies the type of high-potential company IAG is seeking to support through IAGi Ventures.

Spun out of Oxford University, OXCCU has developed a novel, patented process which directly converts gaseous waste carbon and hydrogen into jet fuel range hydrocarbons. This process eliminates a key step required in conventional methods with the potential to reduce both capital and operating costs. It can operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions giving it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks into SAF.

The Series B fundraise will enable OXCCU to deliver on its scale-up strategy and accelerate the commercialisation of its technology. It follows the opening of their first demonstration plant1 at London Oxford Airport last year, and will support the development of a larger-scale facility expected to be operational in 2026. OXCCU’s facilities could play a crucial role in helping meet the UK’s SAF mandate and IAG’s decarbonisation goals.

“We’re focused on backing companies whose technologies have the potential to deliver meaningful impact and we’re excited to be supporting OXCCU as it embarks on the next stage of its scale-up journey,” said Ignacio Tovar, IAG Director of Innovation. “By leveraging our industry expertise, acting as early adopters, and fostering collaboration across our airlines and broader partner ecosystem, we help the companies we back to scale faster.”

IAG was the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050 and has a goal of meeting 10% of fuel needs with SAF by 2030. In 2024, 1.9% of IAG’s total fuel used was SAF, saving 469,000 tonnes of CO2, up almost 200% versus 2023.

The EU could further consider a percentage for clean innovation in defence, scaling already existing programmes, such as those of the EDA.","This op-ed was originally published in The Brussels Times on 29 September, 2025.

In twenty years, future generations may ask why European NATO members failed to use this period of astronomical defence spending to advance broader goals — including the energy transition. After all, there is a precedent.

On the eve of World War I, Winston Churchill led the British Navy away from burning coal to burning oil. The move, considered bold by many, ultimately benefited the British fleet by making its ships faster, quieter and safer, ushering in a new era of oil.

Historically, defence innovation has been beneficial for advancements in other sectors, too. GPS and the microwave, two technologies now acknowledged as indispensable, were initially developed for military purposes, before later being adopted for commercial use.

Semiconductors, biotech and cybersecurity are other examples of transformative innovations that originated in the defence sector but have since contributed to societal development.

Defence spending as a missed opportunity

The 5% spending target, agreed by NATO member states this summer in The Hague, therefore risks becoming a missed opportunity to address non-military, yet equally critical, issues. This isn’t about using electric tanks or solar-powered missiles by tomorrow; it is about shoring up the continent’s long-term energy resilience through clean innovation.

The security imperative is clear. Supply chains for fossil fuels have already proven to be an operational vulnerability for militaries. Sustaining fuel supplies and their storage was one of Russia’s weaknesses in 2022.

For NATO troops, the logistics of securing and protecting diesel supplies during combat proved a challenge in Afghanistan and Iraq, with many lives being lost.

On top of that, Europe’s domestic liquid fuel refining capacity has been steadily declining. Relying on even more fuel imports to meet militaries’ growing demand in the coming years poses significant security risks, as highlighted by Europe’s most recent energy crisis.

How the defence sector can reshape Europe's energy future

Any decision to invest in fossil-based infrastructure and fuel sources is thus strategically short-sighted. So how then could European NATO members optimise their spending? So-called dual-use technologies are a good place to start.

Research into sustainable fuels, for instance, shows that they could be cheaper, safer, quieter and less visible on foreign radars. The Netherlands, a frontrunner in the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity, just published its National SAF Roadmap to scale the production of SAF’s by 2035. Increasing demand by the Royal Netherlands Air Force, who already operated F-16 jets on SAF as early as 2019, could significantly boost this ramp-up in the decade ahead.

Elsewhere, the development of ultra-lightweight materials could help to reduce tank weight – a growing challenge for modern military logistics – which would be a boost for energy efficiency. At the same time, these materials might be adapted for commercial heavy-duty vehicles and aviation to facilitate the use of biofuels and electrification.

Another example might be the development of an integrated smart grid and battery storage system to help remote military bases withstand significant energy vulnerabilities. In civilian spaces, these kinds of micro-systems could also be deployed in natural disaster zones during power outages. It’s a clear ‘win-win’, given the environmental challenges that are already straining armed forces and public communities alike.

This will not be straightforward, but there is a path to take. To begin with, European policy makers must focus on reducing our fossil fuel dependency and carbon footprint. By directing resources, including some of NATO’s 5% pledge, toward clean innovation, militaries can herald a more strategic approach which strengthens Europe’s collective deterrence and its energy security.

An EU toolbox for clean defence

Attempts to build bridges between energy, climate and defence stakeholders will be key. Fortunately, work is already well underway: The continuation of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS), an EU-funded initiative run by the European Defence Agency (EDA) until 2028 is one such example and something which can be built on.

Attracting investments in clean innovation is another important step in putting the European Defence Industrial Strategy (EDIS) and its key piece of regulation, the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP), into practice.

To support this, defence procurement criteria could include a life-cycle assessment of the costs of new defence systems with a premium on the costs of imported fossil fuels. This would likely lower the costs of military equipment that could be powered by more sustainable fuels in the long run. The planned amendment of the regulation on defence and sensitive security procurement, as recently proposed by the European Commission, could include such rules.

The EU could further consider a percentage for clean innovation in defence, scaling already existing programmes, such as those of the EDA. Research and development through the European Defence Fund might also be connected to Horizon Europe, which has a long tradition of funding innovation in clean technologies.

In addition, akin to industrial alliances such as the European Battery Alliance and the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, a new public-private coalition could be set up to strengthen industry collaboration around dual-use innovation.

Future-proofing Europe’s defence

Lowering the military’s reliance on oil and gas will not be simple, and concerns about new insecurities linked to the raw materials needed for clean technologies are valid. Yet these challenges cannot justify short-sighted choices. Europe must avoid reactive decisions today that would lock its militaries into new fossil fuel dependencies tomorrow. The EU should invest not only in stronger defence capabilities but also in more sustainable, future-proof ones.

Ambitious Agenda Despite heavy investment, the Japanese aerospace industry faces sizable obstacles.","After decades of economic stagnation, Japan is betting big on growth in the aerospace industry, particularly the new space sector.

At the center of that gambit is the Japanese government’s ¥1 trillion ($6.8 billion) Space Strategy Fund, a decadelong effort that kicked off in 2024 that the country hopes will transform its industry.

JAXA works to become more entrepreneurial, innovative and strategic

The country proceeds on hydrogen as others retreat

Tokyo wants to double the size of the Japanese domestic space market, to ¥8 trillion (about $54 billion) from ¥4 trillion in 2020 by the early 2030s. By then, Japan wants to launch some 30 rockets into space each year and have more than 30 new satellite services on offering—everything from communications constellations to robotic spacecraft.

Japan’s Space Strategy Fund is the country’s largest dedicated technology development program for aerospace. Although spending from the fund will fluctuate annually, the average amounts to ¥100 billion per year—about 65% of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) budget in 2025.

Yet the Space Strategy Fund is by no means the country’s only initiative. The Japanese government and industry are retooling across aerospace in anticipation that next-generation technologies could allow the country to seize a greater share of the market.

As Airbus and Boeing put off investments into a next-generation airliner, the Japanese government has launched a hydrogen-powered effort to grab a larger share of that market. The country’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) is making considerable investments in advanced composite structures that could be used for a blended wing body, as well as fuel cells and hydrogen-burning turbines. Japan also is working to develop cheaper sustainable aviation fuel and create a hydrogen supply chain.

In the automotive field, several of Japan’s large automakers are expanding their involvement in aerospace, aiming to evolve into mobility companies. For example, Toyota is lending its manufacturing expertise and making grants to U.S.-based Joby Aviation, an electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) aircraft developer. Honda is developing its own hybrid eVTOL, too.

Part of the thinking is that Japanese excellence in automotive manufacturing—the sort that perfected lean manufacturing and produces millions of cars annually—can boost the country’s prospects in the nascent space and eVTOL sectors.

Honda surprised the space industry in June when it launched a small reusable rocket to an altitude of nearly 900 m (2,950 ft.) and landed it successfully back on the ground. The rocket was developed in secret, after a brief press announcement about the effort in 2021. Guidance and control systems for the rocket came from Honda’s autonomous driving development project.

Whereas other countries’ automakers see battery-electric powertrains as the future of cars, Japan has not given up on hydrogen fuel cells. In partnership with JAXA, Toyota is developing a large, inhabitable, regenerative, fuel-cell-powered lunar rover, the Lunar Cruiser. And in April, American Honda Motor Co. announced plans to test an electrolysis system onboard the International Space Station, part of its own potential lunar regenerative fuel cell system.

Japan’s longstanding interest in developing hydrogen-powered vehicles is often linked by industry observers to the country’s lack of hydrocarbon fuels. There is also concern that manufacturing cars with electric batteries, which have fewer components, would mean less work for automotive workers and suppliers—a serious concern in Japan, where social cohesion is paramount.

Doubling Down

The Space Strategy Fund is a sort of doubling down by the Japanese government on the new space sector. The Japanese government launched a ¥100 billion, five-year support package in 2018 for new space startups. Seven years later, the country boasts more than 100 space startups.

JAXA has a separate budget, but the agency runs the Space Strategy Fund on behalf of three core Japanese ministries, including the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (known as METI). Despite its name, the fund is not an investment vehicle for taking equity stakes; it makes grants to companies.

The multiple government ministries behind the fund are also indicative of broad consensus within the Japanese government that the space industry cannot be ignored.

“The importance of space assets is expanding,” says Maruoka Shingo, advisor to the director of the Space Strategy Fund. “People’s [day-to-day] living is supported by space assets.”

Tokyo also sees launch capacity, satellite communications and navigation as national assets, he adds.

“The underlying objective is about building a Japanese domestic space market, creating the opportunity that certain payloads can be bought domestically and not have to be imported,” says Rainer Horn, partner and managing director of consultancy Novaspace.

JAXA selected Phase 1 projects for grants from the Space Strategy Fund in November, some 52 projects spread across 22 technology themes.

“These themes are decided by the government cabinet office,” says Ina Koji, manager of the strategic planning division within the Space Strategy Fund Department of JAXA. “They are the command and control.”

JAXA advises and selects companies based on those policy goals, Koji tells Aviation Week.

In Phase 1, three themes stand out for receiving considerable investment: commercial satellite constellations, high-resolution and high-frequency optical observation satellite systems and regenerative fuel-cell systems.

Submissions for Phase 2 were due in September, and rocket components, orbital transfer vehicles and satellite-based optical data relays were earmarked for the biggest grants.

The Space Strategy Fund is also part of a larger push by the Japanese government to evolve JAXA beyond its traditional research role. In recent years, JAXA has launched a series of parallel funds, incubators, tech transfer, co-development and small business research and development initiatives designed to help startups at each stage of their development.

Horn sees an effort to change the culture of JAXA.

“They want JAXA engineers to think beyond JAXA, to see where they can be useful in either joint projects or to learn from the interaction [with startups]—to get a bit more of a commercial spirit,” he says.

Ambitious Agenda

Despite heavy investment, the Japanese aerospace industry faces sizable obstacles. Japan is a relatively small market compared with China, the European Union or the U.S. And in some areas, domestic Japanese companies are playing catch-up to rivals that have a big lead, such as SpaceX, which dominates the launch vehicle service and broadband internet satellite constellation markets.

This latest push is by no means guaranteed to succeed. The glaring cautionary tale is Japan’s last ¥1 trillion aerospace development project: the SpaceJet program.

SpaceJet, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ ambitious effort to develop a regional airliner, was shut down in 2023 after a 15-year effort. The program was fighting an uphill battle from the beginning, looking to enter a lucrative U.S. market where it would have had to elbow out incumbents, such as Embraer. Expensive mistakes helped sink the effort, as the airliner’s original design was too big to meet U.S. scope-clause requirements and added to redevelopment costs.

At least initially this time, Japanese government ministries and companies are mostly avoiding head-to-head competition with international rivals in foreign markets. They are opting to carve out local niches, take a complementary role in another country’s program or grab a share of not-yet-cemented markets, such as space or advanced air mobility.

For example, Interstellar Technologies aims to serve the small satellite launch market for the Japanese government, as well as commercial satellite operators in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. NEDO’s Next-Generation Aircraft program does not necessarily aim to take the lead on developing a future airliner, but the effort intends to position Japanese industry to take a bigger slice of critical composite structures work and engine manufacturing.

For small-satellite developer ArkEdge Space, a Japan-focused strategy means serving the country’s needs as a maritime nation by developing satellites with payloads such as next-generation maritime communication systems and hyperspectral sensors for maritime observation.

“Japan is just one single country. It is difficult to develop the space utilization industry, so we have to work with Pacific Ocean countries and also some [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries,” ArkEdge CEO Takayoshi Fukuyo tells Aviation Week. “We have to think strategically about which areas we can develop.”

For its part, SkyDrive has partnered with Suzuki Motor Corp. to develop an eVTOL that is considerably smaller than the aircraft of U.S. rivals Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation. Both American companies are developing aircraft to carry four passengers on fixed shuttle runs from city centers to airports, but SkyDrive’s SD-05 eVTOL carries two passengers and one pilot. That smaller, lightweight configuration is intended to enable a conventional taxi business carrying passengers on hops between unreinforced landing pads on high-rise buildings and railway stations. Japan’s urban rail networks are tightly integrated, with door-to-door travel times that often rival or beat car journeys. SkyDrive, of Toyota City, Japan, has formed strategic partnerships with prominent Japanese rail operators.

Many new aerospace technologies have dual uses and are also boosted by government spending, especially Japan’s Defense Ministry, whose budget has grown 67% over the past four years to ¥8.7 trillion in fiscal 2025. The space-related items in this year’s fiscal budget amounted to ¥79 billion

Space Compass, a joint venture between terrestrial telecommunications company NTT and satellite communications company SKY Perfect JSAT, is developing a geostationary-Earth-orbit laser communications relay satellite network. It received a defense ministry contract in April to demonstrate relaying space domain awareness data from geostationary Earth orbit.

As other countries are developing rival offerings and chasing SpaceX’s Starlink low-Earth-orbit broadband constellation, Japan is working on alternative technologies. Space Compass is partnered with Airbus subsidiary AALTO, operator of the solar-powered Zephyr High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS), to supply broadband from the stratosphere. The partners are targeting a launch of commercial service for a HAPS-based cellular network in 2026. Phase 2 of the project includes integrating a satellite backhaul system for areas where terrestrial gateways cannot be installed.

Telecommunications company SoftBank also plans to launch a HAPS smartphone network in Japan in 2026 with a “pre-commercial” service that is slated to be supported by a stratospheric airship built by Sceye of New Mexico, SoftBank said in June. The company also has a partnership to use AeroVironment’s fixed-wing, solar-powered HAPS Sunglider aircraft.

This 21st-century aerospace push by the Japanese government in some ways follows the industrial policy of “Japan Inc.,” a 20th-century coordinated development effort among the country’s ministries, banks and corporations that led to a post-World War II economic boom known as “The Japanese Economic Miracle.” That model produced world leaders in the automotive, electronic, machine tool, shipbuilding and heavy industries, among other sectors.

While Tokyo was attempting to catch up and leapfrog foreign rivals in its original “Japan Inc.” industrial policy—a much lower-risk strategy because the technological trail had been blazed by others—its latest push is into the great unknown of emerging technologies, some of which are destined to fail.

Yet wide-ranging investments into new aerospace technologies sets recent Japanese government policy apart, not just from the past, but from other governments. For example, European governments are not betting so boldly, says Horn, Novaspace’s managing director. “The Japanese are very courageous,” he adds.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-09-30 12:57:30.851233

A new single-step catalytic process is poised to unlock commercially viable Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by converting waste carbon and hydrogen directly into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons. This innovation, developed by an Oxford University spin-out, replaces the complex, multi-step chemical processes currently used by competitors, which are the primary reason SAF remains prohibitively expensive. The simplified reaction eliminates costly intermediate steps, directly addressing the high production cost that has stalled widespread adoption. The technology’s potential for scale and cost reduction was validated by a recent £20.75 million Series B funding round, attracting major strategic investors from the aviation and energy sectors.

Context

The informed professional has long wondered if the aviation industry could ever truly decarbonize without massive government subsidies or crippling ticket price increases. The core challenge has always been the “SAF cost premium” → sustainable fuels are chemically and functionally ready, but their complex production pathways → often involving multiple high-energy conversion steps → make them three to five times more expensive than traditional kerosene. The industry needed a fundamental engineering breakthrough to simplify the process and bring the cost down to a commercially competitive level.

Analysis

This innovation is a direct response to the market’s need for radical cost compression in SAF production. The scientific discovery is a patented iron-based catalyst that acts as a multi-functional agent. In simple terms, traditional SAF production is like a complex assembly line with three separate machines → one to clean the input, one to convert it into an intermediate chemical, and a third to turn that chemical into jet fuel. This new catalyst combines all three functions into a single, efficient reactor.

Think of this new process like an all-in-one kitchen appliance that takes raw ingredients (waste carbon) and produces the final meal (jet fuel) in one go, drastically cutting down on equipment, energy, and time. This core dynamic shifts the economic model of SAF from a niche, high-cost product to a potential commodity.

Outlook

The critical factor to watch is the performance and cost data from the OX2 demonstration plant, expected to be fully operational by 2026. If this plant can consistently produce SAF at a cost that is significantly lower than current multi-step processes, it will trigger a massive shift in the industry. Look for major long-term licensing agreements with large energy or chemical producers, which would confirm the technology’s path to industrial scale and its ability to truly challenge the incumbent cost structure of fossil jet fuel.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Aviation-Infrastructure-Transformation-Towards-Net-Zero-Emissions-and-Resource-Stewardship.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 13:56:13.368349

Leaders from some of the companies at the forefront of these efforts, including Gevo, Helion Energy, Hydrostor, LandGate, and the Smart Electric Power Alliance, also shared their perspectives on the topic.

Chris Phebus, CTO of long-duration energy storage company Hydrostor, addressed the importance of his sector. Through the company’s advanced compressed air energy storage solution, it can inject its compressed air into hard rock anywhere in the world and then deploy that energy when needed by tapping into the heat from the compression process or by pumping water up from its caverns. The company’s first four gigawatt-hour plant is operating in Ontario, and multiple other sites are in development for additional jurisdictions.

Phebus explained that the energy transition represents a period of immense technological innovation and advancement for the clean energy industry, driven by coalescing trends such as onshored manufacturing and the race for artificial intelligence, following decades of stagnant growth. “We’ve seen a lot of renewables come into the market, and those renewables create a lot of intermittent energy, and that creates the requirement, really, for storage,” he explained. He said that he sees Hydrostor as part of the solution for maintaining the grid balance during this time of transition and added, “You have to have long-duration energy storage to make them affordable and take advantage of the full capability that you’ve put into these markets.” However, Phebus voiced the need for policymaker support to continue moving forward: “These are mega projects. We need your support to put them in the ground. We are ready to go. We’re shovel-ready. We want to build these.”

Next, Lindsay Fitzgerald, Chief Advocacy and Communications Officer at Gevo, discussed how her company is changing the world with its cost-competitive renewable fuels and carbon abatement solutions. For example, she highlighted the company’s low-carbon ethanol production with on-site carbon capture and storage in Iowa, as well as efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from that ethanol in North Dakota and South Dakota. She highlighted how the timing is important: “We’re seeing a decline in ethanol needs, and we’re seeing an increase in the demand for jet fuel. We’re all still flying, but guess what? We’re not building any new refineries, so that means we’re not refining any new jet fuel.” Instead of importing it, we can utilize the country’s existing ethanol infrastructure to produce SAF and potentially even export it, thereby supporting farmers through co-products that are all monetized: the fuel itself, protein for animal feed, and carbon from fermentation that can be sequestered.

Fitzgerald acknowledged several helpful policy levers, particularly the Section 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. However, she added that it is all still new and needs time: “You don’t build a whole new facility from scratch, or add on to an existing ethanol facility overnight. So this takes time. It takes some policy stability. Don’t put something in place and then a year later change it because no one’s responded. There hasn’t been time to respond to that yet.” In terms of company priorities, Gevo is working with farmers to help them figure out what regenerative practices they can employ on their land: “That’s a way to impact their bottom line, but that also means that they’re supplying us with corn that comes in with a lower carbon intensity,” which translates into lower-carbon-intensity fuel for Gevo. The company is also aware that it needs to portray its industry in a better light for global policy, because other countries “have this vision of agriculture from a dust bowl time, that is not agriculture today… And so there’s this huge educational push that we have to do as a country, as a group, to say our ag is not what you think it is. It’s not terrible, it’s wonderful.”

Jackie Siebens, vice president of public affairs at fusion company Helion Energy, explained her company’s mission to deploy commercial fusion to the grid as soon as possible. As a larger energy industry, “we have to move to a place where we’re building generation facilities like airplanes, not like airports,” she proclaimed. Helion has completed seven working fusion prototypes in twelve years, with the latest, Polaris, demonstrating electricity production from fusion for the first time. The company also signed the world’s first power purchase agreement for fusion energy with Microsoft, with plans to start delivering energy in 2028. Siebens noted that the company has successfully built numerous fusion machines in a remarkably short time period, even though it usually takes years to obtain design certification from a regulator, mainly because fusion creates far less radiation than fission processes. Therefore, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission classifies it using a different framework, which is also used for industrial and hospital equipment.

However, there is still a need to reach scale. “We want to make sure that we’re building fusion here, and that it’s America that’s reaping the economic and strategic benefits from this technology,” she said, pointing to how we lost the lead on both solar and chips and commenting, “We’re talking about losing the strategic advantage of this century if we do that with fusion.” On the same day as this panel, Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), and Don Beyer (D-VA) introduced the Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act to expand the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit to include fusion energy components. “We are beyond excited about this,” Siebens said, because as the paradigm shifts from academic to commercial, “we need the government to come with us” by taking “proactive measures like making sure that manufacturing tax credits are available to the suppliers in this country for fusion, so that we can scale as we work towards demonstration.”

Alessandra Millican, managing director of energy and infrastructure at LandGate, then took to the stage to describe how her data and analytics company uses thousands of data points on every parcel of land in the U.S. to determine what type of energy generation it is best suited for. “So we basically take what used to be a very laborious, monotonous, time-consuming process and put it in one place,” Millican described. Digital modernization is more important than ever, and “what I’ve loved about transitioning to renewable energy is that almost every company embraces technology and embraces ‘Hey, how can we do things better?” she reflected.

At the same time, the data center gold rush is also a race for real estate, and “a lot of the project developers that I’ve had the pleasure of working with have seen just their projects die death by a thousand cuts” from planning and permitting processes. Millican highlighted grid modernization and interconnection reform as the two most significant challenges for the country to address right now. A lot of those projects get killed at state boundaries, but “if you’re an electron, you don’t care where state boundaries are.” So, she proposed, “If we gave FERC the authority to nationally regulate that process, that would help out. Same thing with permitting.” Solutions to address local opposition involve “looking at those communities and coming up with some sort of standardization, or, ‘Hey, let’s benefit the entire community here,’” rather than choosing to pay only some community members over their neighbors.

Finally, Lesley Jantarasami, vice president of research and industry strategy at the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA), brought a wider lens of focus to the conversation, coming from a national nonprofit working with all segments of the power industry. She acknowledged that SEPA members and the industry at large are seeking solutions and innovations that can help advance the deployment of clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy. In the next five years, they are most excited about long-duration energy storage, the opportunity to bring renewable and geothermal energy resources online, and the opportunity to use technologies and software solutions “to get more out of the existing system” by harnessing distributed energy resources and aggregating small sources of energy into virtual power plants. While artificial intelligence is contributing to increased energy usage, Jantarasami also acknowledged that “it’s also part of the solution set.” For example, she highlighted Google’s partnership with PJM Interconnection to implement AI solutions on the power grid.

Jantarasami emphasized the importance of policy engagement for the country to move forward: “I think interconnection queues are a great example of why it’s so important to have this engagement at every level of policy, where federal, down to state and regional levels, are thinking through, ‘How do we get more electricity on the grid?’ ‘How do we ensure that the system as a whole is moving forward?’” While she recognized the uncertainty and long runway times for the deployment of new clean energy, she also pointed out that, particularly on the state level, “we’re still seeing a lot of progress, having a lot of interest in pushing forward on low emissions, decarbonized energy.” She listed policy tools such as clean energy standards, renewable portfolio standards, and energy efficiency resource standards, as well as energy storage targets in certain jurisdictions. According to Jantarasami, some of this process involves policymakers “getting comfort and familiarity with what these technologies can offer,” and then enabling “real-world pilots that show and demonstrate the benefits of these things, so that more regulators are comfortable with approving those types of projects.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1723839316249-1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 11:56:39.148734

Otto plans to build the plane at a new high-tech factory it intends to build in Jacksonville, Florida, supported by a $515 million incentive package from the state of Florida.

Reality check: It's taken nearly two decades for Otto to perfect the design of the clean-sheet aircraft, which features super-efficient, laminar-flow aerodynamics and precision carbon-fiber composites.

But its first flight won't occur until 2027 and it still needs FAA certification.

The big picture: Otto is one of dozens of ambitious mobility companies participating in at the UP.Summit, an invite-only gathering of 350 entrepreneurs and investors in Bentonville, Arkansas.

The event is a mix of dreamers, scientists and financiers with a shared mission to make transportation cleaner, faster, safer and cheaper — whether it's on the ground, in the air, at sea or in space.

Now in its eighth year, the private event is hosted by investment firm UP.Partners, Walmart scions Steuart and Tom Walton, and businessman Ross Perot Jr.

What to watch: Aviation is on the cusp of the biggest transformation since the introduction of the jet engine, which revolutionized air travel.

OXCCU, an Oxford University spin-out focused on the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from waste carbon, has successfully concluded an oversubscribed Series B funding round, securing £20.75 million ($28 million). This substantial capital injection is earmarked to accelerate the commercialization of its proprietary technology, expand operational capacities, and advance the next phase of its technology scale-up. The funding round saw participation from new strategic investors including Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, and International Airlines Group (IAG) through its corporate venturing arm, IAGi Ventures. Existing investors such as Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, and Eni Next also reiterated their support.

Deconstructing the Investment and Its Strategic Rationale

The oversubscribed nature of the Series B round underscores robust investor confidence in OXCCU's innovative approach to SAF production, particularly within a challenging capital market environment. This investment is not merely financial but strategically motivated by the aviation and energy sectors' imperative to decarbonize.

IAG's investment aligns directly with its ambitious goal to meet 10% of its fuel needs with SAF by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Similarly, Orlen VC's participation supports Orlen's ambition to become a leading SAF producer in Europe by 2035, targeting an annual production of 70,000 tons. Safran Corporate Ventures also invested, reinforcing Safran's commitment to aviation decarbonization, with goals to reduce its carbon footprint by 50% by 2025 and produce 100,000 tons of SAF annually by 2030.

Publicly traded early-stage science investor IP Group Plc (LSE: IPO) contributed £4 million to this round, now holding an undiluted beneficial stake of 15.2% in OXCCU. Following the announcement, IP Group Plc's stock recorded a +2.10% increase, reflecting positive market sentiment towards its strategic investments in climate technology.

OXCCU's Single-Step Process Aims to Transform SAF Production Economics

OXCCU's core technology utilizes a patented iron-based catalyst to directly synthesize jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon, including CO2 and green hydrogen, in a single exothermic reaction. This one-step conversion process is designed to bypass complex, energy-intensive multi-step methods, such as Reverse Water-Gas Shift (RWGS) and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis, which are traditionally associated with high capital and operating costs.

According to OXCCU, this streamlined approach can reduce fuel costs per tonne by approximately 25% and capital costs by about 50% compared to conventional SAF production methods. The company launched its OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. The new funding will support the development of its second demonstration plant, OX2, which is projected to be fully operational by 2026.

Broader Market Implications: Accelerating Aviation Decarbonization

The significant investment in OXCCU underscores the growing urgency and demand for scalable SAF solutions. While SAF is recognized as a critical tool for decarbonizing aviation, its current adoption remains low, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) anticipating that SAF production will account for only 0.7% of airlines' total fuel consumption in 2025.

However, the global SAF market is projected for exponential growth, expanding from an estimated USD 882.13 million in 2024 to USD 64,187.6 million by 2033. This growth is propelled by increasing regulatory mandates, including the UK SAF mandate, ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, and the U.S. Department of Energy's ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge."" By offering a potentially cost-competitive solution, OXCCU is strategically positioned to address a major barrier to widespread SAF adoption: high production costs.

Expert Perspectives on the Future of Sustainable Aviation

Industry leaders emphasize the critical role of innovative technologies in scaling SAF production.

""In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,"" stated Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. He added, ""What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.""

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG, highlighted the airline group's proactive stance:

""We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to 10% SAF by 2030 and we are developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.""

Outlook: Scaling Sustainable Solutions for the Aviation Sector

With the OX2 plant expected to be fully operational by 2026, OXCCU aims to have its first commercial plants running by the late 2020s, potentially making SAF available to aircraft operators as early as 2028 or 2029, contingent on establishing necessary partnerships for licensed production and distribution. While the company's technology promises to significantly reduce production costs, the final cost of Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF remains sensitive to the price of green hydrogen, a key input.",https://static.edgen.tech/news/images/dc1434c7375434282b48110106f4faa5.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 12:57:35.977350

In addition to the 2050 goal, the law also set a binding EU climate goal to reduce net GHG by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. More recently, the EU has committed to set a new 2035 GHG emissions reduction goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 66.25% to 72.5%, and the European Commission has proposed a new target, currently being debated by lawmakers, to reduce emissions by 90% by 2040.

The new report indicated strong progress towards the EU’s interim climate goal, with GHG emissions falling by 37% since 1990, despite 60% GDP growth over the same period, and with the pace of annual emissions reductions in the EU doubling since 2005.

The report cites significant shifts in the energy mix in Europe as a key source of the EU’s emission reduction progress, with the share of renewable energy sources doubling since 2005, and almost a quarter of final energy use in 2023 coming from renewable sources, 45% of all electricity used in the EU now generated by renewables, while fossil fuel use, and coal in particular, has declined.

Despite the energy transition progress, however, the report noted that roughly three-quarters of all EU GHG emissions come from burning fossil fuels for energy, and that that fossil fuels remain the dominant source of energy in Europe at almost 70% of EU gross available energy use in 2023, signaling a need for further investment to accelerate the deployment of renewables, and to drive large-scale electrification and switch industrial processes to cleaner fuels to substitute fossil fuel-based materials with renewable materials.

The report also indicated uneven progress by sector on GHG emissions reduction, finding that while energy supply emissions have declined by 49% since 2005, and industry emissions by 36%, domestic transport emissions have only come down by 6%, and agriculture sector emissions by 7%. While domestic transport emissions reductions are anticipated to accelerate over the next few years, agriculture emissions are expected to remain nearly flat through 2030, according to the report.

Despite the progress in reducing emissions, the report found that the EU faces significant and growing economic risks from climate change, noting that weather and climate-related events caused more than €738 billion in losses from 1980 to 2023, including over €162 billion in the last three years. The report cited estimates that climate impacts could cut EU GDP by 7% by the end of the century, with estimated losses of €2.4 trillion from 2031 to 2050 if warming surpasses 1.5°C, and highlighting high-exposure sectors such as agriculture, forestry, mining and quarrying, and construction.

The report also indicated that progress is lagging in some areas, including finding that the state of biodiversity in Europe is declining, with 81% of habitats in a poor or bad state, and describing the near-term future outlook for biodiversity as “bleak,” with previous targets for ecosystems not being met, and pressures on ecosystems remaining high.

Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, Teresa Ribera, said:

“This report is a stark reminder that Europe must stay the course and even accelerate our climate and environmental ambitions. Recent extreme weather events show how fragile our prosperity and security become when nature is degraded, and climate impacts intensify. Delaying or postponing our climate targets would only increase costs, deepen inequalities, and weaken our resilience. Protecting nature is not a cost. It is an investment in competitiveness, resilience and the well-being of our citizens. By scaling up action now, we can build a cleaner, fairer and more resilient Europe for future generations.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EU-environment-report-2025.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 11:57:39.085972

ICAO ACT-SAF refers to the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Assistance, Capacity-building, and Training for SAF.

At a conservative estimate, India could produce more than 14 million tonnes of SAF annually from feedstocks such as sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, and municipal solid waste. At the higher end, production could exceed 33 million tonnes per year.

“The low-end estimate of SAF production is enough to supply up to 70 percent SAF blends into all jet fuel used in India, with additional volumes available for export,” the study said. It added that India’s geographic location positions it well for exporting SAF to Southeast Asia and Europe.

The study highlighted that alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) technology offers the largest opportunity for SAF production in India and that SAF will play a key role in decarbonising the country’s growing civil aviation sector.

However, the report noted that the lack of supportive policies in India makes investment in SAF facilities uneconomical. Providing financial assistance through grants and loan guarantees could lower the initial cost of first-of-a-kind facilities and create a more favourable investment environment.

“A combination of policies targeting different challenges in the SAF supply chain can help spread the higher cost of SAF blending and use,” the study said. Long-term mandates, firm offtake agreements, and a stable policy framework are essential to de-risk investment and encourage SAF consumption.

Additionally, biodiesel meets established fuel standards and can be blended easily with petroleum diesel, requiring no major engine modifications. Its lower production cost and faster commercialization have made it more accessible than other advanced fuels.

Feedstock Analysis

Fuels Produced from Lignocellulosic Biomass Led the Second-Generation Biofuel Market.

On the basis of feedstock, the second-generation biofuel market is segmented into lignocellulosic biomass, agricultural residues, forest residues, municipal solid waste (MSW), and others. Lignocellulosic biomass fuels dominated the market in 2024 with a market share of 35.6%. Second-generation biofuels are mostly produced from lignocellulosic biomass because it offers a more consistent, energy-dense, and abundant source of non-food organic material compared to agricultural residues, forest residues, or municipal solid waste (MSW).

Lignocellulosic biomass, such as dedicated energy crops like switchgrass, miscanthus, or fast-growing trees, is specifically cultivated or harvested for biofuel production, ensuring better control over quality and supply. In contrast, agricultural and forest residues are seasonal and scattered, making collection and transport more challenging, while MSW is highly heterogeneous and often contaminated, requiring complex sorting and pretreatment. This makes lignocellulosic biomass a more reliable and scalable feedstock for biofuel production.

Drivers

Demand for Climate Change Mitigation Drives the Second-Generation Biofuel Market.

The growing demand for effective climate change mitigation strategies is a key driver of the second-generation biofuel market. Unlike first-generation biofuels, which are produced from food crops such as corn and sugarcane, second-generation biofuels are derived from non-food lignocellulosic biomass such as agricultural residues, forest waste, and dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus.

This reduces competition for food resources and lowers greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Burning one gallon of gasoline produces approximately 8.89 kilograms of CO2, the primary greenhouse gas from fuel combustion. Depending on the type of advanced biofuel used, the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by 40-85% compared to gasoline. For instance, in the best-case scenario, cellulosic ethanol can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 86% compared to gasoline. Countries such as the United States, China, India, and Brazil are investing heavily in biorefineries that convert waste biomass into sustainable fuels.

Restraints

Limited Availability of Feedstock and Operational Challenge of Scaling Up Might Hamper the Growth of the Market.

Despite its potential, the second-generation biofuel market faces significant challenges related to feedstock availability and the complexities of scaling up production. Lignocellulosic biomass, such as agricultural residues, forestry waste, and dedicated energy crops, is not always readily available in sufficient quantities at consistent quality. Seasonal variability, logistical constraints, and competition with other uses such as animal bedding or soil enhancement limit its accessibility.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, although over 1 billion tons of biomass are theoretically available annually in the United States, only a fraction is economically collectible due to infrastructure and transportation issues. Additionally, scaling up from pilot to commercial-scale bio-refineries presents technical and operational hurdles, including maintaining process efficiency, ensuring reliable enzyme performance at scale, and managing large volumes of heterogeneous feedstock. These issues could slow the market’s progress without targeted solutions.

Opportunity

Policy Frameworks Create Opportunities in the Second-Generation Biofuel Market.

Supportive policy frameworks play a crucial role in creating opportunities for the development and deployment of second-generation biofuels. Governments around the world are implementing mandates, subsidies, and regulatory incentives to encourage the production of low-carbon fuels from non-food biomass. For instance, the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) sets targets for renewable energy in transport, specifically promoting the use of advanced biofuels derived from agricultural and forestry residues.

Similarly, according to the IEA, meeting net-zero goals by 2050 would require biofuels to account for nearly 30% of total transport energy. The support policies vary by fuel, sector, and country, but often include a combination of mandates, GHG performance criteria, and direct production and CAPEX investment incentives. For instance, in September 2025, the federal government of Canada announced plans to invest CA$370 million in biofuel production incentives. These policy-driven initiatives are vital for scaling sustainable fuel alternatives.

Trends

Focus on Technological Advancements.

Technological advancements continue to be a key trend shaping the second-generation biofuel market, enabling more efficient and cost-effective production. For instance, the use of algae for producing bio-oils and renewable diesel. Industries in the aviation and marine sectors are recognizing the potential of algae-based fuels, as they solve a major problem of feedstock availability. Similarly, innovations in pretreatment processes, such as pyrolysis, have significantly improved the breakdown of organic waste into bio-oil, biochar, and gases rich in carbon monoxide and hydrogen. These outputs serve as building blocks for various end products, such as liquid transportation fuels and green chemicals.

Furthermore, startups and biotech giants alike are employing synthetic biology to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The approach is trying to develop microbes and enzymes that can efficiently convert biomass and waste materials into advanced biofuels. Moreover, emerging technologies like consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) integrate enzyme production, hydrolysis, and fermentation into a single step, streamlining the biofuel production chain. These innovations are essential to improving scalability and commercial viability in the second-generation biofuel sector.

Geopolitical Impact Analysis

Geopolitical Tensions Leading to Supply Chain Disruptions in the Second-Generation Biofuel Market.

Geopolitical tensions can significantly impact the second-generation biofuel market by disrupting supply chains, altering trade policies, and shifting energy security priorities. Conflicts or diplomatic strains can hinder the global movement of critical components such as enzymes, catalysts, or specialized machinery required for bio-refinery operations.

For instance, amidst the Israel-Iran conflict, in the Middle East, low sulfur gas oil (LSGO) prices surged from US$84/mt to US$716/mt, reflecting broader energy market volatility stemming from the conflict.

Similarly, used cooking oil (UCO) markets displayed regional variations, with Netherlands EXW prices holding steady at EUR 1,033/mt while Chinese FOB prices moderated to US$990/mt from US$1,000/mt. However, current US import tariffs of 55% on Chinese goods create significant cost barriers for UCO imports. On the other hand, global instability can redirect public funds away from renewable energy initiatives toward immediate defense or humanitarian needs. For instance, the Russia-Ukraine conflict disrupted agricultural output and trade in Europe, affecting biomass availability like wheat straw, a key feedstock for second-generation biofuels in the region.

Regional Analysis

North America was the Largest Market for Second-Generation Biofuel in 2024.

North America held the major share of the global second-generation biofuel market, valued at around US$5.34 billion, commanding an estimated 38.7% of the total revenue share. The U.S. and Brazil produced 80% of the total ethanol produced globally. The region has emerged as the largest market for biofuels, largely due to strong policy support, technological leadership, and abundant biomass resources. The United States, in particular, has implemented comprehensive regulations such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates that the transportation fuel sold in the United States contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels.

According to IEA, in 2023, ethanol production reached 116 billion liters, which was around 70% of liquid biofuels, and the U.S. and Brazil, combined, produced 80% of it.

Additionally, the country produces large quantities of agricultural residues with estimates around over 140 million dry tons per year from major crops alone, including corn stover and wheat straw, that serve as key feedstocks for lignocellulosic biofuel production. Similarly, leading bio-refineries such as POET-DSM’s Project LIBERTY in Iowa and DuPont’s Nevada plant in Iowa, although closed, have played a pioneering role in commercializing cellulosic ethanol.

Furthermore, Canada is advancing in the sector, with supportive federal and provincial clean fuel standards encouraging the development of low-carbon fuel alternatives. The combination of favorable policy frameworks, research & development investment, and feedstock availability positions North America at the forefront of second-generation biofuel innovation and adoption.

Creativity and efficiency are becoming the new operating models for economic and community development, defining which regions will lead in the next chapter of the energy transition.

This was made clear earlier this month at the International Economic Development Council (IEDC) conference in Detroit, where RMI convened a panel of leaders to explore how US regions can capture advanced energy opportunities as federal support wanes but energy demand heats up. The discussion built on RMI’s recent insights, Scaling Clean Energy with Regional Financing Ecosystems, which highlights how capital providers with a stake in local economic development pursue aligned goals, but too often in silos.

Panelists included Scott Beckerman, Senior Vice President and Director of Corporate Sustainability at Comerica; Martha Campbell, Chief Program Officer at Michigan Saves; John Moon, President of LISC Green LLC; and Amanda Taylor, Vice President of Business Investment at Greater MSP Partnership.

The panel discussion elevated three lessons on this moment and what lies ahead for economic development leaders.

Lesson 1: Today’s strong pipelines require new strategies to overcome uncertainty

In recent years, unprecedented federal incentives have revealed a strong pipeline of clean energy projects across the United States. John Moon shared that LISC used an interest form for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to measure demand and identified nearly $1 billion in potential projects, with around $150 million ready to move this year. Even without GGRF grants, LISC plans to deploy $100 million in sustainable finance over the next three years– but reaching the lowest-income communities without concessional capital will be difficult and dependent on strong city and state incentives.

Michigan Saves faces a similar challenge. Over 15 years, the green bank has enabled more than $600 million in residential energy efficiency loans by leveraging loan-loss reserves to attract private capital. A GGRF subaward would have enabled an expansion into direct commercial lending. With those funds on hold, Michigan Saves is working to raise private capital and sharpen its value proposition to compete without subsidies.

Panelists cautioned that today’s strong project pipeline faces uncertainty from expiring solar and wind tax credits and impending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations. Developers and capital providers nationwide are scrambling to complete or safe harbor projects, but what comes next is less clear. Technologies whose credits have longer runway, such as geothermal and storage, could emerge stronger.

Lesson 2: Competitiveness will be shaped by demand

Policy-driven uncertainty isn’t the only factor shaping market outlook. Rising energy demand, grid needs, and long interconnection queues will be just as decisive. Globally, AI is accelerating the need for electricity and water for data centers. In the United States, meeting that demand is vital to maintaining resilient, competitive economies. If investment lags, businesses and households will face higher costs and reliability risks.

As Beckerman observed, banks don’t like uncertainty, yet it has defined 2025. Comerica initially entered clean energy financing because the deals were sound business opportunities, not pure sustainability plays. That still holds true. “We’ll be forced to deploy our creativity,” he said, emphasizing that while capital stacks may evolve, advanced and clean energy projects will continue — driven both by investors’ pressure on global companies to decarbonize and by the sheer growth in energy needs.

The Minneapolis–Saint Paul region offers an example of how local leaders can respond strategically to corporate demand. After hearing airline CEOs express interest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the region began building a value chain that connects feedstock, technology providers, and buyers. As Taylor advised, economic developers should listen closely to what Fortune 500 companies need, and work collaboratively across their region to align solutions with local strengths. That alignment of corporate demand with regional capabilities positions places to compete globally.

Lesson 3: Regions must balance short-term competitiveness with long-term resilience

Economic developers must act as the “strategic brains” of their regions, helping communities balance near-term competitiveness with long-term resilience. Campbell suggested a dual-track strategy: on the one hand, expansively pursuing growth opportunities by attracting foreign direct investment, scaling advanced and cleantech energy clusters, and aligning with global megatrends; at the same time, planning for long-term shifts by hedging against worst-case scenarios such as slowing population growth, and by rethinking infrastructure and city design for sustainable growth.

Panelists acknowledged the challenge of holding near-term needs together while advancing a long-term vision like decarbonization. Data centers illustrate this tension in real-time, as communities wrestle with how to weigh potential tax revenue against impacts on power and water systems. More constructive approaches to data center development are possible, including negotiating with companies to secure workforce training programs, infrastructure investment, or other commitments that build long-term resilience alongside competitiveness.

From uncertainty to regional leadership

The panel discussion in Detroit underscored that while federal uncertainty looms, the regions best positioned to thrive are those building robust financing ecosystems by designing public incentives to attract private dollars, aligning with corporate demand, building coalitions to de-risk projects, and sharpening strategies to deliver dollars more efficiently.

Clean and advanced energy projects will continue. The real question is which regions will rise to meet the moment, using creativity not only to attract investment but also to secure durable, inclusive benefits for their communities.

How is your region preparing to step up in the face of shifting federal support?",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iStock-134104261-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 07:57:53.758676

The GPS-CSIR-NCL collaboration offers a powerful home-grown solution that could redefine sustainable aviation fuel production in India and beyond.","GPS Renewables, a leading global full-stack renewable oil and gas company specializing in climate-positive biofuel solutions, has partnered with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) to develop a first-of-its-kind commercial-scale technology for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ethanol. The same breakthrough technology can also convert methanol into SAF. This expands its potential applications.

Transforming Ethanol into Jet Fuel with Breakthrough Catalytic Technology

As part of this strategic collaboration, GPS Renewables will invest in scaling up a technology that CSIR-NCL developed using a patented catalyst. This catalyst joins small molecules, such as ethylene and other olefins, in a one-step oligomerization process to form larger hydrocarbons that mimic the properties of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).

While several research groups have demonstrated the ethanol-to-jet fuel process at the laboratory level, commercial-scale production has remained out of reach — until now. With a licensed technology from CSIR-NCL, GPS Renewables will engineer a commercial-scale SAF plant under the project brand “NG SAF.” As part of the agreement, GPS holds exclusive rights to commercialize this technology, marking a major milestone in India’s clean aviation fuel landscape.

Addressing Feedstock Challenges with a Home-Grown Alternative

Currently, producers make most commercial SAF using the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway, relying on feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats. However, in India, the lack of an organized UCO collection system poses major challenges to scaling SAF production through the HEFA route. Additionally, FSSAI restrictions on importing UCO further limit production.

This is where the NG SAF initiative offers a transformative alternative. By using ethanol derived from 2G biomass — a key product of India’s agri-biomass ecosystem — the new technology provides a sustainable, scalable, and indigenous pathway to SAF production. This solution is not only aligned with India’s biofuel strategy but also critical to meeting its aviation sector’s decarbonization goals.

Gomatam Ravi, CTO, GPS Renewables, expressed, “We are thrilled to partner with CSIR-NCL to build an indigenous and breakthrough SAF technology that can position India as a leader in SAF production. At GPS, we have always prioritized technology that can fast-track India’s transition to clean energy, and this collaboration reflects that commitment. While many have demonstrated the process at lab scale, none have succeeded in producing SAF from ethanol at an industrial scale. With NG SAF, we aim to change that. We are confident that with our expertise in scaling cleantech solutions and CSIR-NCL’s scientific backing, we can deliver an indigenous and industrially viable SAF solution to the world.”

Dr. Ashish Lele, Director, CSIR-NCL, highlighted, “One of our core strengths at CSIR-NCL lies in working closely with industry leaders to transform disruptive ideas into commercially deployable solutions. Scientific research, when coupled with industry collaboration, can create promising solutions to address global challenges. This indigenous technology, named NG SAF, based on CSIR-NCL’s patented oligomerization process, can be a game-changer to decarbonize the aviation sector. GPS Renewables’ proven track record and extensive experience in clean fuels make them an ideal partner to take this innovation from the lab to the market.”

Building a World-Class Team to Deliver NG SAF

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","The IATA has published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use.

The study, in partnership with Worley Consulting, also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely:

The slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources. Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Competition with other potential users of the same feedstock. Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritized.

Airlines will need 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps. This can be achieved from two main sources:

Biomass: This has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades.

Power-to-liquid (PtL): This will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximizing the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

In all cases, to maximize SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonization. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Key findings from the report include:

There are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonize aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

With the right policies and investments, more than 300 Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200 Mt from e-SAF.

The main challenges are:

Enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry.

Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL, including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure which are all required as part of the PtL production method.

Achieving coordinated government policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities.

Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialization, and align their business strategies with global decarbonization goals.

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonization. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.",https://www.4hoteliers.com/ogm/4Hoteliers_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 02:56:32.742761

The initiative, branded NG SAF, also holds potential for producing SAF from methanol.

As part of the collaboration, GPS Renewables will invest in developing technology based on a patented catalyst from CSIR-NCL, enabling the one-step oligomerisation of ethylene and other olefins. This process joins small molecules to form larger ones that replicate aviation turbine fuel. While the ethanol-to-jet pathway has been demonstrated at the lab scale globally, no company has yet succeeded in scaling it for industrial production. GPS Renewables now holds the exclusive commercialisation rights to CSIR-NCL’s process.

Currently, commercial SAF production primarily relies on the HEFA pathway (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), utilising feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO) or animal fats. However, India’s lack of an organised UCO collection system and restrictions on UCO imports limit the viability of HEFA in the country. The NG SAF project aims to leverage ethanol derived from 2G biomass – a key output of India’s agri-biomass ecosystem – to build a scalable and indigenous SAF solution.

Gomatam Ravi, CTO of GPS Renewables, said, “We are thrilled to partner with CSIR-NCL to build an indigenous and breakthrough SAF technology that can position India as a leader in SAF production. While many have demonstrated the process at lab scale, none have succeeded in producing SAF from ethanol at an industrial scale. With NG SAF, we aim to change that.”

Ashish Lele, Director of CSIR-NCL, added, “This indigenous technology, based on our patented oligomerisation process, can be a game-changer to decarbonize the aviation sector. Scientific research, when coupled with industry collaboration, can deliver solutions to global challenges.”

Mainak Chakraborty, Co-Founder and CEO of GPS Renewables, underscored the strength of the team driving NG SAF, which includes industry veterans such as Dr. Anjan Ray, former Director of the Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dr. Arvind Lali of ICT Mumbai, and several experts from global engineering majors like Petrofac, Petronas, and L&T.

They join a strong base of existing investors, including Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

Founded out of the University of Oxford, OXCCU has developed a catalytic process that converts carbon dioxide and hydrogen into hydrocarbons that can be blended into jet fuel. The company says its approach reduces both the cost and complexity of producing SAF, which remains one of the most expensive and supply-constrained decarbonization solutions in aviation.

The funding will be used to expand pilot projects, scale its proprietary technology, and advance certification pathways for commercial adoption. Aviation accounts for roughly 2–3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and regulators in both Europe and the U.S. are pushing for higher SAF blending mandates over the coming decade. However, production costs have hindered broader uptake, creating opportunities for new entrants like OXCCU.

OXCCU’s new investor base shows a growing interest in SAF innovation from both industrial players and airlines seeking to meet net-zero commitments. Safran, a leading aerospace supplier, and IAG, parent company of British Airways and Iberia, represent potential downstream partners in adoption.

PA Consulting’s latest global report, Cacophony to Symphony: Successfully scaling sustainable aviation fuel, draws on insights from nearly 600 senior leaders across airlines, airports, investors, producers, regulators, and policymakers. The findings show that only 19% of U.S. stakeholders are actively using or investing in SAF – 4% below the global average – but U.S. respondents are among the most confident in SAF’s potential to decarbonize aviation and drive job creation.

Other key findings from the report include:

· SAF is seen as achieving more than just sustainability goals – 59% of investors, airlines, and airport respondents see SAF as critical to national energy security.

· Most airports lack a clear path to sustainability – 53% of U.S. airport respondents don’t have a SAF strategy and almost half (47%) haven’t drawn up a net zero roadmap.

· The industry is united behind the promise of SAF – 93%of U.S. respondents cite SAF as essential to aviation’s decarbonization efforts but only 34%believe widespread adoption will be achieved by 2030.

· Infrastructure remains the biggest hurdle – 83% of U.S. respondents cite lack of infrastructure for SAF distribution and storage as a major barrier, significantly higher than global peers.

The U.S. is not alone in these challenges, and globally, more targeted and faster measures could help overcome key barriers and unlock SAF’s full potential. Emerging policy frameworks, regional SAF hubs, and private sector momentum are contributing to confidence in SAF’s scalability.

Kata Cserep, global aviation lead at PA Consulting, said, “There’s a quiet confidence building across the U.S. aviation industry that SAF is more than just a climate solution – it's an economic opportunity. This optimism is well-founded, as SAF has the potential to transform aviation and unlock regional economic growth. But belief must be matched by bold, coordinated action. Unlocking the full potential of SAF demands greater collaboration and investment across the entire ecosystem – from policymakers, investors and producers through to airlines, airports and regulators.”
