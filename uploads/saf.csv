Abstract

Addressing the urgent need to decarbonise aviation and valorise agricultural waste, this paper investigates the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from corn stover. A preliminary evaluation based on a literature review indicates that among various conversion technologies, fast pyrolysis (FP) emerged as the most promising option, offering the highest fuel yield (22.5%) among various pathways, a competitive potential minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of 1.78 USD/L, and significant greenhouse gas savings of up to 76%. Leveraging Aspen Plus simulation, SAF production via FP was rigorously designed and optimised, focusing on the heat integration strategy within the process to minimise utility consumption and ultimately the total cost. Consequently, the produced fuel exceeded the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) limit for the final boiling point, rendering it unsuitable as a standalone jet fuel. Nevertheless, it achieves regulatory compliance when blended at a rate of up to 10% with conventional jet fuel, marking a practical route for early adoption. Energy optimisation through pinch analysis integrated four hot–cold stream pairs, eliminating external heating, reducing cooling needs by 55%, and improving sustainability and efficiency. Economic analysis revealed that while heat integration slashed utility costs by 84%, the MFSP only decreased slightly from 2.35 USD/L to 2.29 USD/L due to unchanging material costs. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that hydrogen, catalyst, and feedstock pricing are the most influential variables, suggesting targeted reductions could push the MFSP below 2 USD/L. In summary, this work underscores the technical and economic viability of corn stover-derived SAF, providing a promising pathway for sustainable aviation and waste valorisation. While current limitations restrict fuel quality during full substitution, the results affirm the feasibility of SAF blending and present a scalable, low-carbon pathway for future development.

1. Introduction

Fossil fuels have dominated global energy systems for over two centuries, providing accessible and economical energy sources. However, their pervasive utilisation has precipitated significant environmental degradation through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and pollutants affecting terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric systems.

The 2015 Paris Agreement established critical climate targets: limiting global temperature increases to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to restrict warming to 1.5 °C. However, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)’s State of the Global Climate reported that 2024 was the first full year with a global average temperature more than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels (1850–1900), which made it the hottest year in the 175 years of recorded data [1]. Current global warming is already fuelling more dangerous heatwaves, extreme rainfall, severe droughts, melting of glaciers, and rising sea levels. With projections of annual global temperatures for 2025 to 2029 estimated to range from 1.2 °C to 1.9 °C above the 1850–1900 average, urgent actions must be taken to combat escalating global warming [1].

Despite the overwhelming global temperature rise, global efforts to mitigate GHG emissions are accelerating, driven by international agreements, technological innovations, and increased public awareness [2]. Among all sectors, the aviation industry is considered the hardest to decarbonise due to its reliance on high-temperature processes and energy-dense fuels. The aviation sector faces immense pressure to decarbonise, as it contributes approximately 2.5% of global GHG emissions annually [3], with its projected growth posing significant challenges for global emission reduction targets. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) target to achieve net-zero CO2 in the aviation sector by 2050 calls for rigorous transformative shifts in energy production and consumption patterns for this hard-to-abate sector [4]. Unlike other transport sectors, direct electrification and hydrogen propulsion remain largely impractical for long-haul flights, making Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a critical pathway to achieving net-zero emissions.

Bioenergy systems like SAF production from biomass offer promising pathways to decarbonise the aviation sector by providing renewable alternatives to conventional jet fuels while also mitigating the global waste accumulation problem. Within this context, the type and source of biomass, together with the production pathway, largely determine the real sustainability of SAFs. Hence, careful selection of the feedstock and pathway is required to optimise the system to achieve its full potential.

Various feedstocks have been explored for SAF production, and they are broadly categorised into four generations based on the type of feedstock used for their production. Mainly leveraging their abundance, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability, this study focused on second-generation biofuel feedstocks, which are produced from non-food-based feedstocks (e.g., municipal solid waste (MSW) and agricultural residues), as opposed to the first, third, and fourth generations, which compete with food supplies (e.g., food crops), face scarcity and scalability challenges (e.g., oils and microalgae), and are genetically engineered (e.g., electro-biofuels), respectively. While second-generation biofuel feedstocks like MSW and food waste present unique advantages, agricultural residues appear promising due to their abundance, low cost, and minimal land-use change impact.

Agricultural waste is an abundant waste, with approximately 5 billion tons of residues generated annually [5]. Its generation peaks during harvest seasons, but decentralised production and competing uses, such as animal feed or bedding, limit its availability for bioenergy. Processes like shredding or grinding reduce the size and bulk density of the feedstock, making it easier to transport [6]. While its abundance is unmatched, efficient collection and storage systems are critical to overcoming logistical challenges, mainly during its seasonal production.

Common residues like corn stover (CS), rice straw (RS), wheat straw (WS), and sugarcane bagasse (SB) were prioritised for biofuel production in this study due to their high abundance and consistent availability globally. For instance, CS is a widely available agricultural residue in the United States, accounting for millions of tons annually, while RS and WS dominate in Asia and Europe, respectively, due to extensive rice and wheat cultivation [7] and SB is highly concentrated in sugar-producing regions such as Brazil and India [8]. Moreover, their utilisation reduces environmental issues such as open-field burning of RS and WS, which contributes significantly to air pollution [9]. SB and CS are particularly advantageous due to their relatively centralised availability, which minimises logistical challenges [10]. Additionally, the high biofuel potential of these residues, as demonstrated by the efficiencies of their conversions to SAF, makes them promising [11].

Although SB, RS, WS, and CS are comparable in terms of availability, the cost-effectiveness of acquisition, and overall sustainability, based on their compositions and physical properties [12,13,14,15], CS and SB are the top candidates for SAF production feedstock owing to their energy density and conversion efficiency potential (i.e., high hemicellulose contents, volatile matter contents, and H/C ratios and low ash contents). However, CS is prioritised since the preliminary selection of a feedstock and a process design is a research-based process and research on SAF production from CS is significantly more abundant compared to SB, covering a wide array of conversion processes such as gasification and Fischer–Tropsch (G-FT) synthesis, FP, and alcohol to jet (ATJ), highlighting its versatility. Additionally, techno-economic analyses of CS-based SAF show strong potential for integration with existing agricultural infrastructure [16]. In contrast, while SB is well-studied for biochemical conversions, studies focusing on SAF pathways are limited to fermentation-based ATJ pathways due to its high cellulose content and compatibility with sugarcane processing facilities. Therefore, with significant untapped potential for biofuel production to produce SAF, abundant research availability, and favourable integration feasibility, CS emerged as the most attractive feedstock option for SAF production in this study.

Several thermochemical and biochemical routes have been investigated for converting CS to SAF, including G-FT synthesis, ATJ, and FP. G-FT converts biomass into synthesis gas (syngas: CO + H2) via gasification, followed by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis to make liquid hydrocarbons, including jet fuel [17]. Meanwhile, the ATJ process converts biomass-derived alcohols (ethanol, butanol, and isobutanol) into jet-range hydrocarbons through dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation [18]. Finally, FP involves rapidly heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to decompose it into a mixture of vapours and char. Some of the vapours then condense into bio-oil, which is further upgraded into aviation fuel [19].

Based on a preliminary evaluation of the fuel yields, environmental impacts, economic viability, and technology readiness of the routes from the literature review, FP emerged as a more attractive pathway for SAF production from CS compared to the other two pathways. FP offers the highest fuel yield (22.5% compared to 19.7% and 0.9% for ATJ and G-FT, respectively) among the three pathways, signifying efficient biomass conversion into bio-oil for SAF production [17,18,20,21]. Moreover, a cost reduction opportunities study by Tanzil et al. reported that FP stands out as the most cost-effective pathway, as its MFSP can reach as low as 1.78 USD/Liter when costs are optimised, compared to 2.31 USD/Liter and 1.94 USD/Liter for ATJ and G-FT, respectively [21]. Additionally, FP demonstrates a moderate environmental impact with 68–76% GHG savings, making it a viable option for reducing emissions [22]. Finally, although FP and G-FT are comparable in terms of resource availability, while ATJ is more limited in this regard, FP currently lags behind G-FT in terms of its Fuel Readiness Level (FRL), as its resulting fuel remains in the developmental stage. In contrast, G-FT is nearing commercial maturity. Nonetheless, considering FP’s overall potential and ongoing advancements toward increasing its FRL, it emerged as the most promising pathway for producing SAF from CS.

While the technical feasibility of producing SAF from various feedstocks is gaining traction, comprehensive techno-economic analyses, particularly for processing CS via FP, remain crucial for commercial deployment. This study aimed to address this gap by comprehensively designing the process, optimising the process by leveraging a heat integration strategy to minimise utility consumption using Aspen Plus, evaluating its economic viability, and identifying key parameters for scalability, thereby providing valuable insights into the potential of this pathway for SAF production.

2. Methodology

Process design and optimisation for SAF production from CS were carried out according to the steps in Figure 1, and Aspen Plus V12.1 commercial software was used to model the process [23].

2.1. Process Development

A process flow diagram of the FP is presented in Figure 2. The process is divided into four stages: pretreatment of CS, FP of CS, hydrotreatment of bio-oil, and separation of biofuels. Before the biomass undergoes fast pyrolysis, the feedstock needs to be pretreated by grinding it into smaller pieces (0.3 mm) and drying it to reduce moisture, ensuring optimal conditions and efficiency during the FP process.

The FP reactor, which is a fluidised bed reactor, is operating at 500 °C and 101 kPa [20], with nitrogen extracted from the atmosphere, without an additional purchase, as the carrier gas. The products of FP are mainly categorised into three phases, bio-oil, biogas, and biochar, where the main bio-oil compounds are made up of alcohols, esters, acids, phenolics, furans, aromatics, and ketones, while the biogas mainly consists of CO, CO2, H2, methane, and ethylene.

The FP products are sent to a cyclone that is operating at 500 °C and 100 kPa to separate the biochar from the vapour products [19]. The vapour products, which consist of bio-oil and biogas, are condensed at 25 °C to retrieve the condensable part (bio-oil) and further separated through a flash drum and a liquid–liquid separator to achieve high-purity bio-oil.

The separated bio-oil is sent to two-stage hydrotreatment reactors with the reactors operating at 220 °C and 400 °C (at 10.7 MPa), respectively [19,20]. Low-temperature hydrotreatment can be utilised to pretreat unstable bio-oil, targeting the reduction of highly reactive oxygenated compounds before undergoing complete deoxygenation under more intense hydrotreatment conditions.

Finally, the product of the hydrotreatment, upgraded oil ranging from C6 to C18, is separated into its respective fuel types (Naphtha, SAF, and heavy oils) with a flash drum, a liquid–liquid separator, and two serial distillation columns.

2.2. Building the Process Model

2.2.1. Selecting the Thermodynamic Model

The commercial software Aspen Plus [23] was used to simulate the entire process. The NRTL thermodynamic model was used, as it is well-suited for systems such as pyrolysis vapour condensation, which generally function at moderate to low temperatures (ranging from 120 °C down to ice-trap conditions). Furthermore, bio-oil is commonly classified as a highly polar solution, where the presence of electrolytes is typically insignificant. Ultimately, the experimental results obtained by Liu and Wang’s research team showed good agreement with the predictions of the NRTL model, confirming its accuracy in representing the interactions during this process [19].

2.2.2. Feedstock Characterisation

The CS feedstock was modelled via non-conventional components using ultimate and proximate analysis data obtained from a Vario-Micro CHN elemental analyser (Elementar, Rhein-Main-Gebiet, Germany) and the DIN 51718 [24], DIN 51720 [25], and DIN 51719 [26] standard methods reported by A. Elsagan et al., as presented in Table 1 [13]. Additionally, Aspen Plus V12.1, the software used to simulate the process that facilitates accurate component property predictions via databank access, does not have unified molecular formula data for biomass. Hence, MIXCINC (Mixed, Conventional Inert Solid and Non-Conventional Stream) was used as the global stream class. The enthalpy and the density were the two attributes of the non-conventional components calculated via HCOALGEN and DCOALIGT models, respectively. HCOALGEN and DGOALIGT are built-in Aspen Plus property models used to estimate the thermodynamic properties of the feedstock based on its elemental composition. A plant capacity of 600 tonnes/day of CS feedstock was selected based on typical scales for commercial biofuel production.

2.2.3. Fast Pyrolysis (FP) Process Modelling

The FP process was modelled based on the design parameters from Liu and Wang presented in Table 2, assuming the operating conditions of the process are similar since the type of feedstock used shares many similarities with CS [19]. Although Liu and Wang simulated the process for rice husks, the design parameters were applicable, while the feedstock-specific yields of the products were adapted to represent the use of CS. An RYield unit was used to simulate FP of CS as a feedstock and the specific product yield with CS as the feedstock, which were obtained from the work by Howe et al. [20].

The components and composition of the products of FP, namely bio-oil, biogas, and biochar, were assumed to be represented by a pseudo-component approach, as detailed in Table 3. The original yield data was sourced from Heng et al. and adjusted so that the yield of each product type summed to 100%, simplifying the input for the Aspen Plus RYield simulation based on the percentages of the CS bio-oil, biogas, and biochar [20,27]. Bio-oil mainly comprises alcohols, esters, acids, phenolics, furans, aromatics, and ketones, while biogas mainly consists of CO, CO2, H2, methane, and ethylene. Biochar cannot be modelled with chemical compounds due to a lack of unified molecular formula data. Hence, it is modelled by its ultimate analysis data, which are presented in Table 3.

2.2.4. Hydrotreatment (Bio-Oil Upgrading) Modelling

A model simulating hydrotreatment of bio-oil from pine was reported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the compounds, model, and yields used in that report are assumed to be applicable to modelling hydrotreatment of CS based on the following reasoning [28]. Based on an elemental study of hydrotreated oils from pine plants and CS by Howe et al., it is reported that both upgraded oils’ elemental compositions vary minimally—despite dissimilar feedstocks—suggesting similar final yields [20]. This is because although pine and CS differ in their raw compositions, the pyrolysis and subsequent hydrotreatment steps standardise their outputs, leading to bio-oils with similar elemental compositions. This outcome is driven by the chemical goals of the upgrading process (e.g., hydrodeoxygenation, hydrogenation, etc.), rather than the feedstock characteristics [29]. The two-stage hydrotreatment units were simulated using RYield with the design parameters in Table 4.

2.2.5. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Separation Modelling

The distillation section was modelled according to the design parameters reported by the NREL [28]. However, the objective of this study was to separate the products to obtain biodiesel. Therefore, the parameters were adjusted to fit the objective of the current work, which was to separate SAF (Table 5). The parameters were optimised to achieve maximum separation of hydrocarbons ranging from C7 to C17 for SAF.

2.3. Process Optimisation via Heat Integration

Leveraging Aspen Plus simulation, SAF production via FP was rigorously optimised, focusing on the heat integration strategy within the process with the aim to minimise utility consumption and ultimately the operating and total costs. Heat integration was applied via pinch analysis. This involved recovering heat from hot process streams to meet the energy demands of cold streams within the same system. For instance, the bio-oil stream was heated to 400 °C before entering the hydrotreatment reactor to match its operating conditions.

Pinch analysis was employed to develop a heat exchanger network (HEN) strategy. This method does not account for phase changes in a process, as it assumes a constant heat flux [31]. As a result, it may underestimate or overestimate heat transfer requirements, leading to suboptimal HEN design. Research by Liporace et al. found that failing to account for phase changes can lead to errors in the determination of pinch points, which affect overall utility consumption [32]. Despite this limitation, streams undergoing phase changes were incorporated into the analysis to optimise heat integration. While the presence of non-constant heat flux in these streams may introduce some inaccuracies, this analysis still serves as a useful tool for identifying potential matches and estimating heat transfer between streams.

According to the process flow sheet presented in Figure 3, in total two hot streams and four cold streams were identified, as presented in Table 6.

2.4. Economic Evaluation of Process

An economic evaluation of the SAF production process was essential for assessing its financial feasibility and the MFSP required to achieve a break-even point. This methodology involved calculating the total process cost, which consists of both capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX), as well as estimating potential income from biofuel sales. This approach provided a comprehensive economic assessment, allowing for cost optimisation and strategic pricing decisions to enhance the project’s viability.

The annual OPEX comprised both fixed and variable operating expenses. The fixed OPEX covered equipment and labour costs (Table 7), which remained constant regardless of the production volume. Additionally, 16% of the labour cost was factored into the fixed costs, covering employee benefits. On the other hand, the variable OPEX fluctuated based on the production volume. Table 8 outlines the variable operating costs, which included the feedstock (factored as an acquisition cost), catalysts, and hydrogen gas for reactions. These expenses were determined by process consumption and the market price. Meanwhile, the costs of the utilities (electricity, steam, and cooling water) were obtained from the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (APEA) in Aspen Plus V12.1 and were generated based on the process flows [23].

The CAPEX accounted for the initial investment in infrastructure, equipment, and installation. This cost primarily depended on assumptions and estimations that were based on the Inside Battery Limits (ISBL) cost, which was the total cost of the equipment and its installation. The equipment and installation costs were generated and obtained from the APEA for both cases, the base case and the optimised (heat-integrated) case, as listed in Table 9, since different equipment was used in these cases. Equipment costs that were not generated by the APEA and were not reliable were estimated based on market prices.

Consequently, using the ISBL cost as the base value, the total capital investment (TCI) for the project could be calculated using various reasonable assumptions listed in Table 10 [19]. The TCI was determined by combining fixed capital investment (FCI), working capital (WC), and land costs. The total direct cost (TDC) consisted of the ISBL cost, along with additional expenses such as a warehouse (5.7% of the ISBL cost), site development (12.9% of the ISBL cost), and additional piping (6.4% of the ISBL cost). The total indirect cost (TIC) accounted for engineering and supervision (13.7% of the TDC) and construction expenses (34% of the TDC). Adding the TDC and TIC resulted in the total direct and indirect cost (TDIC), which formed the basis for FCI. FCI also included off-site battery limits (OSBLs), contractor costs (5% of the TDIC), and contingency (10% of the TDIC) to cover unforeseen expenses. Additionally, WC was set at 10% of FCI, ensuring sufficient funds for operational needs, while the land cost was estimated at 5% of the ISBL cost. Ultimately, the total CAPEX was derived from the sum of FCI, WC, and land expenses, providing a comprehensive estimate of project investment.

Furthermore, other financial assumptions are listed in Table 11 based on typical scales for a general production plant [19]. The economic analysis was conducted assuming the plant would operate for 8088 h per year. The project was partially financed with a loan covering 60% of the total investment, carrying an interest rate of 6% over a five-year term. While the general plant and steam plant had lifespans of 7 and 20 years, respectively, an 8-year linear depreciation period was derived from a weighted average of general and steam plant lifespans, where the general plant constituted most of the investment. This resulted in a depreciation period that leaned closer to the general plant’s 7-year life while still accounting for the longer life of the steam plant. The construction phase was planned for three years, with investment distributed over time: 30% spent in year 2, another 30% in year 1, and the remaining 40% in year 0 for final payments and test runs. To assess financial feasibility, the analysis applied a discount rate of 10%, ensuring future cash flows were appropriately valued. Additionally, an income tax rate of 30% was considered, which impacted net profitability. These financial parameters provided a structured framework for evaluating project viability, loan repayment schedules, and cost recovery strategies.

3. Results and Discussion

Based on the methodology described in Section 2 for building the Aspen Plus model of the process, Figure 3 presents the Aspen Plus model of the conversion of CS to SAF through FP and hydrotreatment.

3.1. Aspen Plus Model Validation

The primary objective of model validation was to ensure that the simulation results accurately reflect real-world production of SAF. In this study, the hydrotreatment process was modelled using Aspen Plus V12.1, where the reactor was simulated using RYield based on product yields obtained from the literature. As the yield data itself was derived from existing studies, directly comparing the simulation yields with those reported in the literature would have been redundant and not meaningful for validation purposes.

Therefore, to establish the validity of the model, the simulation results were compared to the elemental composition of the final product, SAF (hydrotreated CS bio-oil), reported in the literature, as presented in Table 12. This approach ensured that the model accurately produces SAF with the same composition of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur contents rather than merely reproducing yield data. By doing so, it provided an independent validation method that focused on composition accuracy, which was critical for evaluating the quality and suitability of the SAF for downstream applications.

The comparison between the simulation results and those from the literature in Table 12 demonstrates good agreement. The minor discrepancies between the simulated elemental composition and that from the literature are attributed to differences in process assumptions and model scope. The simulation assumes more efficient hydrotreatment, resulting in near-complete deoxygenation and a slightly higher hydrogen content. The trace sulphur in the simulation may originate from conservative assumptions related to gas clean-up, whereas the literature likely reports post-polishing data with sulphur below detection levels. Despite these minor differences, the close agreement in the carbon and hydrogen contents validates the reliability of the simulation model for predicting SAF composition and the following discussion of the results derived from it.

3.2. An Evaluation of the Properties of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The Aspen Plus simulation results yielded a comprehensive breakdown of the chemical composition of the SAF, including the proportions of paraffins, naphthene, aromatics, oxygenates, and other relevant components, as presented in Table 13. The system was simulated via a steady-state deterministic method using fixed inputs with no variation or uncertainty. Therefore, the results represent a single point of operation.

The critical outcome of the simulation of SAF production from CS was the final composition of the SAF product. To assess its suitability, the properties of the SAF were instead validated based on the final composition of the SAF by comparing the simulation composition with the compositions of jet fuels reported in the literature (100% waste wood-derived (WWD) SAF and 100% conventional jet fuel) [33]. This approach was logical and scientifically sound because the chemical composition directly influences the physical properties and performance characteristics of a fuel. The properties presented in Table 14 reflect the combustion performance, efficiency, fluidity, cold-temperature pumpability performance, and stability of the fuel, which are crucial to characterise the quality of jet fuel.

Upon comparing the composition of the simulation results with two reference fuel compositions (100% WWD SAF and 100% conventional jet fuel) in Table 15, it was observed that the product composition fell within the range between the two reference fuels. Such an outcome indicates that the chemical properties of the produced SAF are between those of the WWD SAF and the petroleum-based fuel.

Therefore, the results indicate that the most practical application of the SAF would be as a blended fuel that could be mixed with conventional jet fuel to form an SAF blend that meets the necessary ASTM standards for aviation fuel. A study by Jeon et al. suggests that a 10% SAF blend with conventional jet fuel offers the optimal jet fuel quality that achieves all ASTM standards, with a final boiling point (FBP) of 299.5 °C [33]. An aviation fuel blend review by Lau et al. confirms the relevancy of the proposed blend, as a blend percentage of 10% is also recommended for SAF produced from Jatropha plants, Babassu seeds, palm kernels, and Lignin-based plants [35]. A low-percentage blend is expected for SAF derived from lignocellulosic biomass, as it tends to have a higher oxygen content and more complex aromatic structures compared to SAF produced from oilseed crops like Canola and Camelina, which comply with the standards as 20% and 50% blends, respectively [35].

3.3. Energy Savings Analysis

From the pinch analysis, four streams were matched to maximise the heat recovery in the system, and the results are reported in Table 16 and Figure 4.

Each heat source available provides heat to more than one heat-sink stream. On that account, pairing hot streams with cold streams that require higher outlet temperatures needs to be prioritised to avoid outlet temperature cross. As a result, H1 and H2 integrate with C1 and C4 first, respectively, before directing their excess heat to the other two cold streams.

When the heat integration network obtained from the pinch analysis was applied in the Aspen Plus simulation, it was observed that the total cooling utility requirement (8092.12 kW) was slightly higher than the result from the pinch analysis (7967.59 kW). This discrepancy primarily arose because Aspen Plus is capable of accurately modelling phase transitions, including the latent heat that occurs during condensation or vaporisation. Unlike pinch analysis, which assumes constant heat flux, Aspen Plus dynamically calculates the enthalpy changes during phase transformations. This results in a more realistic estimation of the cooling duty.

Despite the discrepancy between the cooling utility requirements obtained from pinch analysis and Aspen Plus simulation, pinch analysis remains an effective and practical method for estimating and designing HENs. The discrepancy observed is relatively small, indicating that pinch analysis still serves as a reliable guide for preliminary HEN design and effectively identifies pinch points and heat recovery potentials, making it useful for conceptual design.

After heat integration optimisation, the utility requirements were significantly reduced from 9701 kW to none for the heating utility and from 17668 kW to 7967 kW for the cooling utility. These remarkable reductions indicate that 9701 kW of energy was successfully integrated between the hot and cold streams, achieving 100% energy savings for the heating utility and 55% savings for the cooling utility.

Consequently, the need for heating utilities such as high-pressure steam and fired heat was eliminated. Additionally, the significant reduction in cooling demand minimised the reliance on cooling utilities. As a result, the types of utilities required were reduced from high-pressure steam, fired heat, cooling water, and refrigerant to just cooling water and refrigerant.

3.4. Economic Analysis

The results of an economic analysis that included the CAPEX and the OPEX for both the base case and the optimised case (after heat integration) are presented in Table 17.

The analysis suggests that the material costs were the dominant contributors to the OPEX in both cases, driven by feedstock acquisition, hydrogen, and catalyst costs, while utility costs were minimal. Despite an 84% reduction in utility costs through optimisation, the overall impact on the total OPEX was negligible due to unchanged material costs.

For the CAPEX, the FCI remained the largest component. Optimisation led to a 12% reduction in the total CAPEX, but its impact was limited relative to the total costs.

Overall, based on the 600 tonnes/day plant capacity and annual SAF production of 32.5 Liters/year, the MFSPs for the base and optimised cases were calculated to be 2.35 USD/Liter and 2.29 USD/Liter, respectively. The MFSP decreased slightly by 6 cents/Liter when optimisation was applied, reflecting a modest economic improvement primarily constrained by high material costs.

Figure 5 shows the cost distribution between the main steps in SAF production, pyrolysis, hydrotreatment, and separation, where the credits of the feedstock and the product are not included in the distribution. The results indicate that the equipment costs involved for all steps are minimal when compared to the operating costs. For pyrolysis, since nitrogen is extracted from the atmosphere without an additional purchase, the operating cost mainly comes from the utilities. The hydrotreatment operating cost is significantly larger than those of the other two steps due to additional hydrogen and catalyst sourcing, which are the main drivers of the material costs. Finally, the separation of SAF has the lowest operating cost due to its moderate operating temperatures compared to the other units used in the other two steps.

The results of a sensitivity analysis of the cost variables that have the greatest impact on the MFSP are presented in Figure 6. The nominal value of the MFSP is 2.35 USD/Liter, and the possible ranges of the MFSP shown take both cases into account, where the base case represents the maximum value and the optimised case represents the minimum value.

The sensitivity analysis highlights that material-related cost variables have the largest influence on the MFSP. In the original case, conservative assumptions were made by selecting the highest hydrogen cost (7 USD/kg), the shortest catalyst life (1 year), and the highest feedstock cost (0.10 USD/kg), which collectively contributed to a higher MFSP.

However, the analysis implies that optimising these material costs can significantly lower the MFSP. If the hydrogen cost is reduced to 3 USD/kg, the catalyst life is extended to 3 years, and the feedstock cost is lowered to 0.08 USD/kg, the combined effect can bring the MFSP below 2 USD/L, as shown by the lower bounds of the sensitivity bars, which is consistent with the range reported by Tanzil et al. [21]. This suggests that targeted cost reductions for key input materials—whether through improved sourcing, catalyst durability, or feedstock agreements—have the potential to substantially improve the economic feasibility of the fuel production process.

In contrast, the discount rate and payback period have a smaller influence on the MFSP. The original case uses a 10% discount rate and an 8-year payback period. These assumptions position the MFSP closer to the midpoints of their respective sensitivity ranges, indicating that changes in capital recovery conditions are less critical than variations in material costs.

To conclude, this section demonstrates the technical feasibility of producing SAF from CS via FP, followed by hydrotreatment and separation, with Aspen Plus simulations indicating realistic fuel outputs. While the standalone SAF does not meet ASTM standards due to its high FBP, a 10% blend with conventional jet fuel is compliant, highlighting its potential as a transitional solution. Process optimisation through heat integration yielded full heating utility savings and significant cooling savings of 55%, enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability. Economic analysis revealed that while heat integration slashed utility costs by 84%, the MFSP only decreased slightly from 2.35 USD/L to 2.29 USD/L due to unchanging material costs, which were identified as the primary cost drivers. However, sensitivity analysis shows that further cost reductions for feedstock, hydrogen, and catalysts could make SAF more economically competitive.

4. Conclusions

Through an analysis of GHG emissions across various sectors, the aviation industry was recognised as one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise due to its dependence on high-energy-density fuels and limited alternatives. Simultaneously, the waste management sector was highlighted for substantial GHG emissions from landfills and its potential for valorisation. Utilising the strategic intersection between aviation and waste management, production of SAF from waste feedstocks presents dual benefits. This approach not only mitigates emissions from aviation but also addresses the environmental impact of waste accumulation.

Comprehensive process design of SAF production from CS via FP was implemented in Aspen Plus, which included pyrolysis, hydrotreatment, and separation as the main steps. The results from the simulation indicate that the produced fuel is realistic but does not comply with ASTM specifications as a standalone jet fuel, as it exceeds the final boiling point (FBP) limit. A 10% SAF blend with conventional jet fuel is suggested to enhance fuel quality and satisfy all ASTM requirements. This limitation is expected, as the technology for SAF production from lignocellulosic biomass is relatively young, particularly upgrading oil through hydrotreatment. Nevertheless, the ability to produce an SAF that meets standards in a 10% blend is a promising step forward, offering a transitional pathway toward increased SAF adoption as the technology matures and scalability improves.

To further optimise the process, a heat integration strategy was implemented by combining four pairs of hot and cold streams. This resulted in 100% energy savings for the heating utility and 55% savings for the cooling utility while eliminating the need for high-pressure steam and fired heat in the utility system. Simultaneously, this reduced the reliance on external utilities by maximising heat recovery within the system, making the process more sustainable environmentally and economically.

An economic evaluation was conducted to determine the value of the product. Among the key findings, material costs—particularly those related to hydrogen, catalysts, and feedstock—are the dominant drivers of SAF production economics, significantly influencing the MFSP. Despite the reduction in utility costs, high material costs limited economic improvement, as the MFSP was only reduced from 2.35 USD/L to 2.29 USD/L. However, a sensitivity analysis revealed that targeted cost reductions in material pricing could reduce the MFSP below 2 USD/L, indicating strong potential for economic competitiveness. Although the price of SAF is not yet competitive with conventional jet fuel, its significant advantage in reducing carbon emissions presents a compelling value proposition and serves as a key driver for its adoption.

Overall, the aim of this study to seek sustainable pathways for the transition to a low-carbon energy system while addressing the gap in the technical feasibility of SAF production, particularly for CS via FP, by utilising a waste resource to produce high-value biofuel via an optimised process was achieved. While further improvements are needed to reach its full potential, this work represents a meaningful step forward in advancing sustainable biofuel development.

5. Future Outlook

From the process perspective, the final SAF product from this study exhibits an FBP exceeding the ASTM standard, limiting its direct use as a standalone jet fuel. It is only suitable for use as a blend component, with blends up to 10% in conventional jet fuel meeting standard requirements. Future work should focus on exploring strategies to reduce the FBP of the upgraded oil, such as optimising the hydrotreatment conditions, integrating additional upgrading steps, or tailoring the catalyst selection. Furthermore, the current upgrading process loses carbon as CO2 and CO while removing oxygen, which reduces its efficiency and releases GHGs, indicating the need for technologies that remove oxygen as H2O. These efforts could enable more sustainable production of an SAF that fully complies with ASTM standards for higher blend ratios, and eventually, use as a standalone jet fuel.

From the sustainability perspective, future work should focus on improving supply chains, catalyst life, and feedstock agreements to enhance viability. Additionally, the high hydrogen demand during hydrotreatment remains a critical limitation, indicating the need for process intensification to reduce hydrogen consumption. Finally, future work should also incorporate environmental assessments, such as life cycle analysis (LCA), to quantify the GHG emissions associated with the SAF production process. This would provide critical insight into how effective the pathway is in achieving its intended goal of transitioning to a low-carbon energy system. Evaluating the overall sustainability of the process will help validate its environmental benefits and identify further opportunities for improvement.

Since commencing operations in June 1990, Emirates has carried over 10 million passengers on more than 65,000 flights between Singapore and Dubai.

Throughout the years, Emirates has become a preferred choice for travellers heading from Singapore to Dubai and beyond. The most popular outbound destinations in the last year ending March 2025 include London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Paris, Manchester, Rome, Amsterdam, Jeddah, Madrid, Istanbul, Frankfurt, and Munich.

Emirates currently operates four daily flights between Singapore and Dubai with a mix of Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s, as well as a non-stop daily service connecting Singapore with Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Emirates’ Country Manager for Singapore & Brunei, Rashed Alfajeer, said: “We’ve come a long way in our Singapore operations, from carrying just over 12,000 passengers on a daily flight between Singapore and Dubai in 1990, to connecting over 800,000 travellers between the two gateways on four daily services in the last financial year. The past 35 years have been marked by remarkable growth for Emirates, further supported by strong and reliable partnerships we’ve established with local entities. As we look ahead, we remain committed to serving the Singaporean market with our best-in-class products and world-class service, while exploring innovative solutions to provide industry-leading customer-centric experiences.”

In June 2023, Emirates launched its Premium Economy cabin on the Singapore-Dubai route, making Singapore the first market in Southeast Asia to receive this iconic and highly appreciated product. Offering more space, comfort, and premium touches, Emirates’ Premium Economy has become a standout choice for passengers seeking an elevated travel experience.

To date, Emirates has welcomed over 87,000 passengers in this cabin class from Singapore. The industry recognition speaks volumes, too, with Emirates’ Premium Economy having won ‘Best Premium Economy Class’ at the 2024 Business Traveller Asia-Pacific Awards and ‘Best Premium Economy Class Airline in the Middle East’ at the 2024 Skytrax World Airline Awards.

In May 2024, Emirates resumed its daily Phnom Penh service via Singapore, linking the two trade and leisure centres in the region with a conveniently timed schedule. Over the past year, the service has connected nearly 66,000 passengers between the two gateways, with over 60% of them having started their journey in Singapore.

In June 2024, Emirates powered flights departing Changi Airport with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as part of its fuel agreement with Neste, marking its inaugural SAF investment in Asia. Approximately 3.3 million litres of blended SAF — which reduces lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel—was integrated and used over a few weeks.

Reinforcing its long-term commitment to Singapore, Emirates also opened its first Emirates World retail store in Singapore on 6 May 2025. Strategically located at Odeon 333, just across from the iconic Raffles Hotel, the new store offers personalised travel planning and expert advice from dedicated consultants. The space is designed to be experiential and immersive, featuring interactive installations and the airline’s First-Class Suite on display.

To mark Emirates’ 35th anniversary in Singapore, the airline is offering special fares on bookings made until 30 June 2025, for travel through 30 November 2025.

While everyday people are urged to recycle and drive less, some of the world's wealthiest are burning thousands of gallons of jet fuel for weekend trips.

That's what's sparking frustration online after a post on the ""r/TimotheeChalametDaily"" subreddit revealed that the actor and girlfriend Kylie Jenner ""took her private jet to Puerto Rico for some alone time.""

Celebrities' private jet usage has been heavily scrutinized over the last few years. Kylie Jenner herself came under fire in 2022 for taking a 17-minute flight across Los Angeles County. Around the same time, Taylor Swift topped a list of celebrity private jet users, with her aircraft logging more than 170 flights in under seven months.

This moment reignited that ire. ""Celebrities are the real reason for climate change. One private jet does more damage in a single year than if you were to drive multiple cars at the same time non stop for a year,"" one commenter wrote.

""Fun fact, celebrities like this produce more pollution in [90] minutes than you in your whole life span!!"" another added.

They're not far off. A single private jet flight can emit two metric tons of carbon dioxide per hour, according to Transport & Environment. That's more than the average person emits in a year.

These trips may look like luxury, but to many, they symbolize the unchecked emissions of the ultra-wealthy. ""Time to ban private jets,"" one commenter said, echoing a growing movement calling for stricter regulation of high-polluting travel.

Organizations like Possible and Stay Grounded are advocating for taxes on private air travel, while some European countries are considering restrictions or bans on short-haul private flights. Investing in high-speed rail, electrified regional air travel, and sustainable aviation fuel can also help, but only if the wealthiest flyers are held accountable.

Because when private luxury comes at the cost of a livable planet, it's not just a personal choice; it's everyone's problem.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kylie-Jennerimage-reckHMYgyU6LOB96p.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 22:58:38.958206

YPF está llamada a liderar la industria para que la Argentina exporte U$S 30 mil millones en 2031.","En milésimas de segundos recorre su pasado y cae en la cuenta de que la última vez que estuvo en Córdoba fue cuando tenía 16 años y vino a jugar un torneo de tenis. “Creo que lo gané, no me acuerdo”, dice entre risas.

Horacio Marín, el presidente y CEO de YPF, es frontal, casi sin filtros. Tanto que a veces parece que hasta se muerde la boca para frenar un pico de verborragia. Algo aprendió cuando se filtró una expresión suya sobre el debut de Franco Colapinto en la actual temporada de la Fórmula 1 con Alpine.

En su celular mirá el minuto a minuto del precio del petróleo y del valor de la acción de la compañía, pero también sabe cuántos litros de combustible se despachan y hasta cuántas hamburguesas se facturan en las tiendas de las estaciones de servicio de la marca.

“El mes pasado vendimos 502 mil, somos los segundos hamburgueseros de la Argentina. Yo lo quiero cagar (sic) a McDonald’s, pero todavía estamos lejos”, bromea. Aunque desafía que eso podría ocurrir dentro de cuatro años.

Lo de cuatro no es antojadizo. Es un número clave. Un plan 4x4, que en la cresta se traduce como la meta de cuadruplicar el valor de la empresa en cuatro años. “No te pongas adelante, porque si me querés sacar del objetivo, te paso por arriba”, afirma. La frase lo define.

Ese fue el Marín puro que pasó por el 16º Congreso Córdoba del Instituto Argentino de Ejecutivos de Finanzas (Iaef) y con quien La Voz mantuvo antes una entrevista exclusiva para entender cómo piensa la persona que está sacudiendo todos los eslabones de YPF.

–Avanzan en el plan de microprecios en las estaciones de servicio. ¿Córdoba está en la fase piloto?

–No, no está en el plan piloto; son cinco estaciones (N.d.R.: tres en Buenos Aires, una en Rosario y otra en Mendoza). Podemos ver distintos precios en distintos horarios, pero la idea conceptual es que por cada litro que yo vendo a las 3 de la mañana, a las 6 de la tarde vendo 40. No hace falta hacer cuentas para entender que YPF pierde dinero durante la noche, pero es un servicio esencial. Entonces, lo que uno tiene que hacer es ver cómo bajar esa pérdida y ver si logra rentabilidad nocturna. Hay una posibilidad en Argentina, como en todo el mundo, de autoabastecimiento. Y eso baja los costos nocturnos. Una manera de ir cambiando la forma de pensar de los consumidores, para que vean que somos honestos con ellos, es que si yo les pido que hagan autoabastecimiento y tengo una ganancia mayor, compartirla.

–¿Cómo es la estación de servicio del futuro?

–La veo con un Full (la tienda que la petrolera tiene en cada estación) extraordinario, con más productos regionales, que en Córdoba se vendan productos típicos y en el norte, otros. La veo con autoservicio en los momentos que perdemos y dar mejoras en precios, y que, en los horarios pico, trata de bajar los tiempos de carga, pero dejar autoservicio, que tiene que tener un precio de nafta menor que el otro. Y otra cosa que estamos haciendo es que haya una experiencia del cliente muy importante.

–¿Todo a través de la aplicación?

–Que tengas la aplicación y si querés comprar acciones de YPF las puedas comprar, una aplicación con una experiencia muy grande, no solamente nuestros productos, sino que te ayude a pagar los impuestos, un montón de cosas.

–Eso es disruptivo para nuestro mercado.

–Todo es disruptivo, pero estamos en YPF y tenemos que trabajar para cumplir esas palabras.

–¿Cuánto tiempo durará la fase piloto?

–Como es muy disruptiva, hay que tener mucho cuidado en los primeros días, porque es posible que haya mucha gente que la utilice y hay que encontrar los niveles estacionarios.

–¿Pero el esquema estará funcionando en Córdoba en julio?

–Bueno, veremos. Te digo que estamos viendo cosas que no te quiero adelantar, pero que van a sorprender…

–¿Qué inversión demandó el centro de datos de tiempo real?

–No te lo voy a decir por la competencia, pero no son números fuera de juego. Realmente me llama la atención que no se haya hecho antes, y no es el único. Estamos terminando el cuarto; el primero fue el de Vaca Muerta, que es extraordinario.

–Otras compañías movieron precios cuando subió el valor del petróleo. ¿Están pensando en un ajuste en julio?

–Estamos viendo, lo decidiremos en los próximos días.

–¿Está atrasado el precio de la nafta?

–Poco. Muy poco.

–¿Qué es muy poco?

–No te lo voy a decir porque en estos días, no sé, sábado o domingo, decidiremos el precio. Está muy volátil el valor del barril.

–Cambio el foco. Un eje del plan estratégico es salir de los campos maduros. ¿Cuándo termina esa etapa?

–Te diría que está finalizada. Falta un área de Río Negro que ya está, la tienen que aprobar en la Legislatura, pero está terminada. Mendoza, Neuquén, Chubut están terminados. En Santa Cruz, también. Y la única que nos falta, en la que estamos haciendo el mismo modelo que en Santa Cruz, es Tierra del Fuego, donde estamos muy adelantados y deberíamos llegar a un acuerdo. El objetivo es que, el 1º de enero de 2026, YPF sea una compañía netamente no convencional.

–¿Por qué salen también de Manantiales Behr, donde no pierden plata?

–Es cierto que Manantiales Behr (Chubut) no da pérdida, pero tiene un costo operativo de más de U$S 20 por barril, cuando en Vaca Muerta es de U$S 5. Y un inversor de YPF quiere que inviertas en otro lado. No es que se vayan a quedar sin trabajo ni mucho menos. Es un área excelente, tiene futuro, tiene terciaria, pero no tiene mucha lógica que YPF siga en las (áreas) convencionales. YPF está llamada a liderar la industria para que la Argentina exporte U$S 30 mil millones en 2031. Ese es el punto focal y esas áreas no son para lograr eso.

–En muchas industrias hay renegociaciones de contratos con los proveedores para bajar costos. ¿Están en lo mismo?

–A las grandes les estamos diciendo: “Vení, porque estás cobrando caro”.

–¿Cuánto más caro?

–Hay distintos números. Hay de 40%, hay más, hay de todo tipo, porque estabas como en otro país. En cuanto al upstream, en Neuquén estamos trabajando con un modelo disruptivo, que se llama Toyota Well, que es aplicar lo que ustedes en Córdoba saben muy bien, que son las eficiencias de la industria automotriz en la industria de oil & gas.

–Le escuché una comparación entre los costos para producir acá y los de Permian. ¿Cuál es la diferencia hoy?

–Lo debería volver a calcular, porque hay algunas empresas grandes que ya nos están dando un precio más lógico para lo que es hoy Argentina y lo que es YPF. El problema es que las compañías de servicio nos toman como una compañía estatal, te cobran mucho y eso es lo que estoy tratando de romper. Pero los números son parecidos. Ahora, no sólo es por la diferencia de costo unitario.

–El costo pozo.

–Claro, el costo unitario termina llevando al costo pozo. Hay una parte que es costo unitario y hay otra, sin entrar en cosas particulares, pues no quiero herir ninguna susceptibilidad, que yo llamo costo argentino. Te lo voy a poner en números que no son correctos, sino para que sea fácil de entender: si yo pongo una herramienta que en Permian (cuenca no convencional en Estados Unidos) sale 100 y acá la pongo en Neuquén, y, sacándole el transporte, podés llegar a incrementar 50, 60 y hasta 70%.

–Mucho…

–Y eso para Vaca Muerta y para GNL (gas natural licuado) es determinante, porque competimos con Estados Unidos.

–Pasemos en limpio lo de GNL. ¿En qué fase están?

–Son tres. En la uno estamos con Pan American (PAE), Pampa Energía, Harbour Energy y Golar. Es un alquiler. A finales de julio tenemos que hacer el FID (decisión final de inversión), pero lo del segundo barco te diría que está cerrado y hay que empezar a hacer un gasoducto rápidamente. Eso empezará a exportar a fines de 2027 y a fines de 2028 llegaría el otro barco.

–¿Y con la italiana ENI?

–Con ENI firmamos en Roma un head of agreement, que son 34 hojas que dicen todos los pasos que vamos a hacer para llegar al final investment decision. Nuestro objetivo es que eso ocurra en la primera quincena de enero (2026). Después de eso, creemos que dentro de tres años y medio estaría el primer barco, y, a los seis meses, el otro barco, y creo que hay altísimas probabilidades de que se logre. Estaríamos completando el consorcio con una empresa que no la puedo comentar y puede que entre otra con un porcentaje menor, una argentina muy posiblemente, para completar el consorcio.

–¿Y con Shell?

–Con Shell estamos trabajando de forma extraordinaria, estoy muy contento. Nos vamos a juntar en julio para ver todos los temas y cerrar. Puede ser que el FID sea a fines del año que viene. Y con eso cumplo mi promesa personal de lograr los objetivos a 2031 e irme de YPF. No irme porque me quiera ir, sino por haber cumplido todo el ciclo de desarrollo de hidrocarburos. Y, por supuesto, estamos trabajando en nuevas energías también para 2030.

–¿Y con YPF Luz?

–Es una excelente compañía que genera electricidad. Somos la segunda empresa en generación de renovables de la Argentina, vamos a llegar a un giga (GW).

–Sorprendió cuando hablaron del uranio en Chubut. ¿Hay un compromiso político?

–No, no. Venimos trabajando en Chubut, se me acercaron. Siempre estoy coordinando con un experto como Demián Reidel (presidente de Nucleoeléctrica, la compañía a cargo de la operación de las tres centrales nucleares). Coincido con él y con su visión, porque la energía nuclear es algo del futuro muy importante y me parece brillante tratar de explotar uranio para generar, si Argentina tiene la tecnología, los reactores modulares y tratar de que en la Argentina haya data centers mundiales muy grandes y exportar energía a través de internet. Me parece una idea brillante y lo vamos a intentar con Demián.

–¿Cómo le explicaría a un ciudadano de a pie lo que va a implicar Vaca Muerta directa e indirectamente?

–Lo primero que le digo es que en 2031 le vamos a dejar, por lo menos, un campo adicional (en referencia al aporte del sector agropecuario). Vamos a tener inversiones realmente gigantes y Argentina será un exportador neto, tanto de petróleo como de gas, y habrá mucho trabajo. Por supuesto que habrá mucho en Neuquén; YPF va a invertir de U$S 6 mil millones a U$S 7 mil millones de dólares por año. Y eso tendrá un gran efecto multiplicador, también para Córdoba. Yo hice un solo desarrollo grande de gas (N.d.R.: Fortín de Piedra, en Vaca Muerta, con Tecpetrol) en el que trabajaron mil pymes de toda la Argentina. Lo tenemos mapeado. Imaginate lo que va a hacer esto. Y otra cosa: la contribución de la energía ayuda mucho al país a salir adelante para que luego entren otras industrias que tardan más en poder desarrollarse. Es un cebador natural económico para el país y para el trabajo.

–¿Y eso se traducirá en menores tarifas de energía, en general?

–Sí, por supuesto. A ver, el precio de la nafta es un valor internacional, el petróleo es una commodity, y si vos tratás de subsidiar petróleo o planchar el precio, ya sabés lo que pasó, no hay inversión. En gas, que no es commodity, cuando Argentina evolucione con el GNL, está claro que el precio interno será menor o igual. Con este proyecto aseguramos que haya energía barata. Habrá muchísimas posibilidades de desarrollo para las industrias.

–¿Y qué oportunidades hay en la cadena de valor para proveedores desde Córdoba?

–Para mí es gigante. Te lo digo simple, la cantidad de pozos que tiene YPF para perforar en toda la historia de Vaca Muerta son más de 15 mil. (Hay oportunidades para) todas las pymes, las empresas de metalmecánica, porque no viene todo de afuera, lo que vienen son herramientas de mucha tecnología. Cuando YPF llegue al pico, tiene que invertir billones de dólares por año para mantener la producción.

–Córdoba es la principal productora de maíz. ¿Miran algo en biocombustibles?

–Bueno, el biotanol es obligatorio en los cortes. Estamos cerca de generar YPF Bio, pero para exportar combustible para la aviación.

–El SAF (por las siglas en inglés de “sustainable aviation fuel”).

–Exacto. Tenemos una refinería básicamente abandonada en Santa Fe y llegamos a un acuerdo con una empresa que hace biocombustible. Quiero que operen ellos, que son los que saben de biocombustibles.

Pour en limiter l’impact environnemental, Jetfly propose d’acheter des carburants durables et, si possible, de partager les vols.

La Belgique est un pays plutôt ouvert aux avions d’affaires. On recense une petite centaine d’appareils, généralement utilisés par des entreprises et des particuliers – souvent entrepreneurs – qui apprécient la flexibilité de ce moyen de transport évitant les aérogares surpeuplés et les longues files d’attente. Une demi-heure après avoir garé la voiture, l’avion privé décolle de la zone d’aviation générale de Zaventem, d’Antwerpen-Deurne, de Kortrijk- Wevelgem ou de Brussels South Charleroi Airport.

Depuis octobre dernier, une société luxembourgeoise, Jetfly, propose des avions en propriété partagée sur le marché belge. “Nous avions déjà quelques clients gérés depuis Luxembourg”, précise Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore, qui développe le marché belge depuis la fin 2024. Jetfly compte actuellement 14 clients en Belgique, sur un total de 550 clients pour le groupe.

Le Pilatus à hélice, l’avion d’affaires le plus utilisé

La société Jetfly s’est concentrée sur les avions d’affaires fabriqués par le Suisse Pilatus. Le fabricant, connu pour ses avions d’entraînement capables d’atterrir sur des glaciers, s’est assuré un beau succès avec des petits avions d’affaires. Une niche dans laquelle s’est engouffrée Jetfly. Le modèle le plus vendu est le mono turbine PC-12, qui peut transporter six à huit passagers à plus de 500 km/h sur une distance qui peut dépasser les 2.000 km. Pour ceux qui veulent aller plus vite, Jetfly propose un biréacteur Pilatus PC-24 de huit places, volant à plus de 800 km/h, jusqu’à 3.300 km.

On est loin des avions d’affaires transatlantiques, des Falcon et des Gulfstream qui illustrent généralement les articles et les reportages télé sur ce type d’avionsl.

Ces avions couvrent en fait une bonne part des besoins. En Belgique comme en Europe, l’avion d’affaires le plus utilisé, selon l’association européenne du secteur (EBAA), est le mono turbine Pilatus PC-12. Il ne s’agit donc pas d’un jet, mais d’un avion à hélice à coût raisonnable, pouvant se poser sur des pistes en herbe. Il ne lui faut que 650 mètres de gazon pour atterrir, ce qui lui permet de se poser à des endroits inaccessibles aux jets privés : aéroclubs, altiport de Courchevel ou Spa la Sauvenière. “Cela lui permet d’atteindre des lieux éloignés des aéroports, explique Marion Fabiani, sales director pour la France et Monaco. Nous comptons des clients qui ont des équipes de motos ou de voitures, qui peuvent alors se poser très près des circuits de course. Des entrepreneurs de la distribution peuvent faire le tour, sur une journée, de plusieurs implantations situées dans des zones sans aéroports proches.”

La propriété partagée, mode d’emploi

La formule développée par Jetfly, depuis sa création en 2009, est la propriété partagée. “Nous proposons des parts dans un avion, à partir de 1/16e“, précise Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore. Pour un PC-12, cela représente un investissement de 500.000 dollars. S’ajoutent ensuite des frais de gestion qui incluent les assurances, la maintenance et les réparations, proportionnels au nombre d’heures de vol annuelles souscrites. Pour une part de 1/16e, cela peut aller de 15 à 35 heures de vol. Les vols sont réservés jusqu’à 24 heures à l’avance, et il reste à payer les frais de pilote et de vol (4.500 à 5.000 euros/heure pour un PC-12).

Jetfly commande l’avion et en vend les parts avant la livraison. Le contrat porte sur 10 ans, après quoi l’avion est revendu. “Les PC-12 gardent plutôt bien leur valeur : 40 et 50% de la valeur d’achat après 10 ans”, indique Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore. Il est possible de revendre la part après cinq ans.

Les clients sont directement (co)propriétaires de l’avion. Il ne figure pas dans le bilan de Jetfly, qui assure le service depuis l’achat, la vente des avions, leur maintenance, leur exploitation et la gestion des vols. Étant en copropriété, les avions ne sont pas personnalisables par les clients. Mais ils ne manquent pas pour autant de cachet, puisque leur intérieur et la livrée ont été conçus par Philippe Starck.

Les clients ne voyagent pas forcément avec “leur” avion. Jetfly attribue l’avion le plus proche du copropriétaire pour le jour de la réservation.

L’approche de la propriété partagée est très populaire aux États-Unis, où NetJets domine le marché avec des avions à réaction et est aussi actif en Europe. Jetfly, qui emploie 500 personnes, dont 250 pilotes, et réalise un chiffre d’affaires annuel de 200 millions d’euros, s’est concentrée sur l’Europe et les Pilatus. Elle assure la maintenance et la formation des pilotes et gère la plus grande flotte d’affaires d’Europe, avec 25 PC-12 et 12 PC-24 en copropriété. Les vols les plus fréquents en Belgique vont vers le Bourget (Paris), Genève, Nice ou Cannes-Mandelieu. Beaucoup de vols sont courts (Luxembourg).

Jetfly est dirigée par un tandem français, Cédric Lescop et Maxime Bouchard, respectivement CEO et CFO. L’actionnaire majoritaire est Jean-Pierre Millet, descendant du fondateur des vêtements sportifs Millet, et fondateur de Carlyle en Europe. En plus des avions en copropriété, la société assure aussi la gestion d’avions Pilatus pour le compte de personnes propriétaires à 100%.

Carburant durable

Les clients peuvent opter pour l’achat de carburant durable (Sustainable Aviation Fuel ou SAF), et ainsi réduire les émissions des vols, sujet délicat dans le monde des avions privés. Les avions peuvent voler avec un maximum de 50% de SAF, fabriqué par Neste à Rotterdam, à base d’huile de friture et de déchets animaux, réduisant ainsi jusqu’à 80% les émissions de CO2.

Comme ce carburant est plus cher que le kérosène, il faut rajouter 175 euros de l’heure de vol pour un Pilatus PC-12, ou 190 euros pour un jet PC-24. Acheter 100% de SAF coûte 345 euros par heure pour un PC-12. Le vol du client ne sera pas forcément réalisé avec du SAF, mais la quantité acquise sera achetée et utilisée par les autres avions Jetfly.

Vols à vide gratuits

Les perspectives de voir des avions zéro émission, volant à l’hydrogène ou en motorisation électrique, sont encore hypothétiques. La compagnie belge ASL vient d’annoncer l’achat d’un Microliner (fabriqué par Væridon), avion électrique d’affaires à neuf places parcourant 300 à 400 kilomètres. Le premier vol du prototype est prévu en 2027, et sa mise en service pourrait intervenir en 2030. Jetfly reste encore en retrait sur ce genre de projet qui doit encore faire ses preuves.

Le PC-12 reste l’un des avions d’affaires le plus propre. Jetfly estime réduire les émissions (et les coûts) en limitant les repositionnements des avions entre deux vols réservés et en favorisant l’utilisation des vols à vide. “Les clients peuvent profiter des trajets à vide gratuitement pour eux ou des personnes qu’ils désignent”, indique Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore. Ils peuvent aussi accepter de partager le coût d’un vol en proposant des sièges sur un vol qu’ils ont réservé.","https://img.static-rmg.be/a/view/q75/w1600/h836/f50.00,50.00/7266860/img-2509-jpg.jpg",N,,2025-06-28 20:57:46.686988

Isola Moses | ConsumerConnect

Sequel to decades of silence when the unique aircraft operations were rested, iconic Concorde is about to return to become the world’s leading supersonic passenger aircraft once again.

Concorde is preparing to return to commercial skies by 2026, marking 50 years since its first historic flight.

ConsumerConnect learnt Fly-Concorde Limited aims to relaunch “supersonic passenger service” from the United States (US), under a groundbreaking aviation policy shift.

US President Donald Trump, June 6, 2025, at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD), through an Executive Order (EO), signed the “Concorde Bill”, lifting the long-standing ban on supersonic flight over land, Aviation A2Z report.

It is noted that the American country’s aviation regulatory reversal has unlocked a new era of innovation in high-speed, sustainable air travel.

Positioning US leadership in next-generation aerospace innovation, sustainability

The recent Executive Order has cleared the American regulatory airspace that had long blocked overland supersonic travel due to sonic boom and environmental concerns, report stated.

It was learnt the new aviation legislation positions the US as a leader in next-generation aerospace innovation and sustainability.

Some features of new Concorde

The new Concorde will remain true to its iconic silhouette, but will be 50 percent lighter and use advanced composite materials and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), cutting emissions by 80 percent, according to report.

The jet also will cruise at 60,000 feet, significantly higher than conventional commercial jets, while operating faster, quieter, and cleaner than the original.

The interior will reflect minimalist Japanese aesthetics, developed by leading sustainable architects.

Every feature, from cabin design to propulsion systems, will incorporate cutting-edge aerospace technologies rooted in decades of research and development.

On leadership, legacy and supersonic breakthroughs

Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Founder of The Concorde Co., based in Washington State, in the US is at the helm of this supersonic revival, report noted.

Armed with a triple Ph.D from Oxford and expert physicist, Dr. Churchill is credited with solving the long-standing sonic boom challenge.

His patented Sonic Boom Suppression technology, granted in May 2025, enables Concorde to fly overland without disturbing ground-level communities.

Dr. Churchill is a direct descendant of Sir Winston Churchill, whose original Concorde initiative was launched as a post-World War II peace project.

Interestingly, his legacy continues through the rebirth of this aviation legend, targeted for launch on its 50th Anniversary.

Patricia Bader-Johnston, Vice-President and Chief Development Officer at Fly-Concorde Limited, was reported to have emphasised the aircraft’s broader vision.

Bader-Johnston said: “Concorde is set to become the global benchmark for sonic boom suppression and sustainability.”

Financial innovation

Besides the unique features of its new aircraft, Fly-Concorde is also innovating on the financial front.

The company has introduced Concorde Coin (CSSC), a stablecoin backed by Concorde’s aviation assets and operations.

It is also stated that with Blockchain technology gaining global traction, CSSC is designed to attract investors aligned with futuristic, environmentally responsible air travel ventures.

This digital currency initiative aims to fund development while enabling broader engagement in Concorde’s mission, report said.

Value of new Concorde brand

The move reflects growing synergy between aerospace advancement and decentralised finance.

Globally recognised as a pinnacle of aviation excellence, the Concorde brand is now valued at approximately $50 billion. The upcoming relaunch aims to restore its reputation as the epitome of luxury air travel, now aligned with modern values of environmental stewardship, digital innovation, and safety.

History of supersonic era

The Concorde, a joint marvel by British Airways (BA) and Air France (AF), revolutionised high-speed air travel with its supersonic performance. Operating primarily between London Heathrow (LHR), Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), and New York John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK), Concorde represented the peak of technological ambition in commercial aviation.

The aircraft’s inaugural transatlantic flight occurred on September 26, 1973, marking a new era of rapid travel.

Despite initial global fascination, the Concorde’s commercial future was constrained by high operational costs, limited routes, and its eventual involvement in a fatal accident in 2000.

Birth of a supersonic dream

It is recalled that Concorde’s development began with the 1962 treaty between France and the UK, aiming to share the cost and innovation challenges of producing a supersonic transport (SST).

British Aerospace and Aérospatiale collaborated on the aircraft’s frame, while Rolls-Royce and SNECMA developed its powerful Olympus 593 engines.

This cooperation marked a defining moment in European aerospace engineering, report noted.

After its maiden flight on March 2, 1969, the Concorde entered commercial service on January 21, 1976.

British Airways (BA) initially operated the London (LHR) to Bahrain route, and Air France (AF) flew from Paris (CDG) to Rio de Janeiro (GIG).

Shortly after, both airlines launched regular services to Washington Dulles (IAD) and New York JFK (JFK), offering transatlantic flights in under three and a half hours.

Although capable of cruising at Mach 2.04 (2,179 km/h), the Concorde was never economically viable.

Only 14 production aircraft entered commercial service, with persistent financial losses leading to route reductions until JFK remained the only regular destination.

The aircraft’s sonic boom and high noise levels also restricted route expansion.

The Tupolev Tu-144, the world’s first supersonic transport (SST) aircraft, was a milestone in Soviet aerospace engineering. Designed by legendary aircraft designer Andrey N. Tupolev and his son Alexey, the Tu-144 symbolised the USSR’s ambition to lead in high-speed aviation during the Cold War era.

First flown in December 1968 and surpassing Mach 1 in June 1969, the Tu-144 predated Concorde’s first supersonic flight.

It was publicly unveiled in Moscow in May 1970 and stood as a technological marvel with futuristic design elements and record-breaking performance.

Despite its technical achievements, the Tu-144’s career was marred by high-profile incidents, according to him.",https://consumerconnectng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/facebook.png,N,,2025-06-28 16:01:24.164336

Operational Flexibility: The airline's ability to adjust capacity, routes, and costs in real time gives it a moat against competitors.","Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ: ALGT) has emerged as a beacon of resilience in the airline sector, defying macroeconomic headwinds with its disciplined operational strategy and low-cost model. Despite a 4.5-percentage-point decline in load factor during May 2025, the company's 9.2% year-over-year passenger growth and aggressive capacity expansion highlight its ability to navigate turbulent markets. By prioritizing flexibility in route networks and fuel-cost management, Allegiant is positioning itself for sustainable growth even as peers struggle.

Traffic Metrics Signal Strategic Growth, Not Weakness

Allegiant's May 2025 traffic report reveals a deliberate strategy to scale capacity while maintaining operational control. Scheduled-service passengers rose to 1.545 million, a 9.2% increase, while available seat miles (ASM) jumped 16.3% to 1.73 billion. This expansion outpaced demand, resulting in a load factor drop to 80.3% from 84.8% in 2024. However, the decline is less a sign of weakening demand than a calculated move to secure long-term market share in leisure travel.

The airline's focus on peak travel periods—where load factors remain strong—offset softer demand in off-peak months. For instance, March 2025's traffic revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) nearly matched prior-year levels, demonstrating demand resilience during key vacation seasons. Meanwhile, fixed-fee contracts and non-revenue repositioning flights, which dilute system-wide load factor metrics, are strategically managed to expand routes without sacrificing profitability.

Fuel Costs Under Control Amid Volatility

Fuel remains the airline's largest cost, but Allegiant's operational agility has softened the blow. May's average fuel cost fell to $2.37 per gallon, down from April's $2.51 and a key contributor to Q1's $1.81 EPS beat (vs. a $1.70 forecast). The company's fuel hedging and route optimization—prioritizing shorter, high-demand routes—have insulated it from broader market volatility.

This dual focus on cost discipline and peak-demand capture has enabled Allegiant to maintain margins despite rising fuel prices. Q1 operating margins rose 3 percentage points, a testament to its ability to balance growth and expense control.

Strategic Capacity Adjustments Mitigate Risk

Allegiant's decision to trim annual capacity growth from 17% to 13% reflects its flexibility in responding to macroeconomic uncertainty. By scaling back non-peak flights and focusing on high-yield routes, the airline avoids overextending itself during demand lulls. This approach contrasts sharply with competitors who have struggled with overcapacity and margin pressure.

The airline's low-cost structure—with base fares below half the national average—also acts as a shield against economic downturns. Price-sensitive travelers flock to Allegiant's nonstop flights to vacation destinations, a niche the company has dominated for decades.

Investment Thesis: GF Value's 64% Upside and Long-Term Potential

Despite withdrawing 2025 full-year EPS guidance, Allegiant's Q1 outperformance and peak-season strength justify optimism. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, while neutral on near-term risks, maintain a $56 price target—implying a 64% upside from current levels (assuming a mid-June 2025 price of ~$34). This reflects confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on leisure travel's recovery post-pandemic.

Investors should focus on Allegiant's two-pronged advantage:

1. Operational Flexibility: The airline's ability to adjust capacity, routes, and costs in real time gives it a moat against competitors.

2. Demand Stickiness: Its focus on small-city leisure markets—where alternatives are scarce—ensures a loyal customer base even during economic slowdowns.

Risks and Considerations

Economic Sensitivity: A prolonged recession could dampen leisure travel, though Allegiant's low fares may mitigate this.

YYC AeroNex, a new aviation innovation hub launched by the Calgary Airport Authority, is positioning Calgary as a central node in global air transport connectivity by addressing a long-standing technology and infrastructure gap in Canada’s aviation sector.

With a focus on advanced maintenance, sustainable fuels, and workforce development, the hub is set to transform how Canadian airlines operate and compete internationally.

“Today, Canadian airlines must send their planes or engines out of the country for maintenance checks. That takes time, increases costs, and creates more emissions,” Rob Bachart, Chief Real Estate Officer, Calgary Airport Authority, told Cities Today. “YYC AeroNex is building the infrastructure Canadian carriers need right here in Calgary.”

At the heart of the project is a C$120 million (US$87.5 million) Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility developed in partnership with Lufthansa Technik, which includes Canada’s only engine test cell of its kind. It also incorporates space to support sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, creating new technological capabilities for the country’s air sector.

“This helps reduce turnaround times on aircraft, reduce emissions, and lowers operating costs, helping Canadian carriers remain competitive,” Bachart said.

YYC AeroNex is being established with the backing of C$172 million in financing from the Canada Infrastructure Bank and an equal amount from commercial lenders. Bachart emphasised that innovation and talent development were key factors in attracting Lufthansa Technik to Calgary.

“Lufthansa Technik was looking for a North American location that would support innovation, talent development, and long-term operational growth,” he explained. “Calgary stood out because of our strong ecosystem, access to skilled labour and growing cargo and passenger traffic.”

The hub will also serve as a platform for developing emerging aviation technologies through partnerships with post-secondary institutions. “We’re partnering with post-secondary institutions to develop specialised programmes that support long-term careers in industry sectors such as maintenance, engineering, and emerging technologies like sustainable fuels,” Bachart said.

All four initial YYC AeroNex projects are expected to be operational by 2029. Their collective impact on Canada’s aviation ecosystem will be measured through collaboration with government, industry, and academic partners.

“This net new benefit to the airport and region will be measured periodically to help articulate the success of our efforts,” said Bachart. “YYC AeroNex isn’t just about infrastructure–it’s about building a future-focused ecosystem that supports innovation, attracts investment, and secures Canada’s place in the next era of global aviation.”

Investment Takeaway Alliance's sale to Avian is a shrewd move that balances immediate financial relief with long-term growth.","Alliance Aviation Services (ASX:AQZ) has taken a bold step toward reshaping its financial and operational future with the sale of its Embraer E190-E1 inventory to Avian Inventory Management for $32.5 million. This transaction isn't merely a balance sheet cleanup—it's a strategic pivot that could position the company to capitalize on the expanding regional aviation market while reducing risks tied to inventory management. For investors, this deal highlights a playbook for unlocking liquidity and streamlining operations in a sector still recovering from pandemic disruptions.

The Deal: Cash Now, Growth Later

The sale of inventory—a critical but often overlooked asset in aviation—serves two primary goals: reducing debt and freeing cash for reinvestment. Alliance will use the $32.5 million cash infusion to lower its net debt, a move that could improve its credit metrics and reduce borrowing costs. Crucially, the transaction excludes engines and other high-value components, meaning Alliance retains control over the most critical parts of its aircraft.

The timing of this deal is also strategic. Alliance is transitioning to an all-Embraer fleet, replacing older Fokker aircraft. By outsourcing inventory management to Avian—a leader in Embraer parts—the company can focus on scaling its operations without the burden of maintaining a complex supply chain. This shift aligns with a broader industry trend toward outsourcing non-core functions to specialized partners, a practice that has boosted efficiency for airlines like airBaltic and LHT.

Operational Efficiency: Letting Go to Grow

Avian's expertise in managing Embraer inventory isn't just a cost-saving measure; it's a competitive advantage. By consolidating parts in Brisbane and leveraging Avian's global network, Alliance ensures faster access to spare components, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. This is particularly important as the company expands its fleet: operational reliability is key to winning contracts in the Asia-Pacific region, where demand for regional flights is surging.

Moreover, the partnership creates a win-win scenario. Avian gains its first airline customer, expanding its reach into the Asia-Pacific, while Alliance avoids the capital expenditure required to build its own inventory infrastructure. This synergy could also lead to lower long-term costs for Alliance, as Avian's scale likely offers better pricing and procurement terms.

The Financial Case for Investors

The immediate financial impact is clear: lower debt, higher liquidity, and a leaner balance sheet. But the longer-term benefits are equally compelling. By reducing inventory holdings, Alliance can redirect resources to fleet expansion, route development, and service quality—factors that drive revenue growth.

Investors should watch for how this move impacts Alliance's capital allocation. With less debt, the company could reinvest in new aircraft, technology, or acquisitions—or return cash to shareholders via dividends or buybacks. The market's reaction will hinge on whether this deal is seen as a defensive move to shore up liquidity or an offensive play to seize market share. Early signs are positive: the transaction was finalized quickly, and both companies emphasized its strategic alignment with growth objectives.

Risks and Considerations

No deal is without risks. Overreliance on a single inventory partner could expose Alliance to supply chain disruptions if Avian faces operational issues. Additionally, the Embraer fleet transition carries execution risks, as managing a homogeneous fleet requires precise scheduling and maintenance. Finally, the aviation sector remains sensitive to macroeconomic factors like fuel prices and travel demand.

Investment Takeaway

Alliance's sale to Avian is a shrewd move that balances immediate financial relief with long-term growth. For investors, this reduces near-term risks while positioning the company to capitalize on the post-pandemic rebound in regional travel. The stock could be attractive for those seeking a play on Asia-Pacific aviation growth, though caution is warranted until fleet expansion plans crystallize.

In a sector where liquidity and operational agility are critical, this deal shows how smaller players can outmaneuver larger competitors by partnering with niche specialists. Alliance's ability to focus on its core business—flying planes—while offloading inventory management could be a template for others. For now, the $32.5 million check is more than just cash on the books: it's a down payment on the future.",,N,,2025-06-28 15:02:42.849514

Carbon Sequestration: The Riverbank project, designed to sequester 1.4 million tons of CO₂ annually, adds another layer of decarbonization revenue through carbon credits.","The recent CARB approvals for Aemetis Biogas's seven dairy digesters mark a pivotal moment for the company's financial trajectory and strategic positioning in the renewable natural gas (RNG) sector. With carbon intensity scores ranging from -327 to -419, these projects qualify for LCFS credits that will double Aemetis's Q1 2025 revenue—a near-term catalyst that underscores the company's shift from regulatory uncertainty to tangible, high-margin earnings. This article explores how these approvals, coupled with upcoming projects and an attractive valuation, position Aemetis as a compelling investment in the decarbonization boom.

The LCFS Credit Catalyst: Doubling Revenue and Unlocking Liquidity

The CARB-approved pathways for the seven digesters—effective retroactively from January 1, 2025—mean Aemetis can now claim LCFS credits at an average carbon intensity of -384, compared to the temporary -150 baseline. This shift alone increases LCFS credit revenue by 100–120%, translating to an estimated $6 million annually at current prices. For Q1 2025 alone, this retroactive approval adds a significant one-time boost to cash flow, while setting a baseline for sustained growth as more digesters come online.

The timing aligns perfectly with California's LCFS program, which requires fuel suppliers to meet stringent carbon-reduction targets. With Aemetis's projects already producing 550,000 MMBtu/year of RNG (scalable to 1.6 million MMBtu/year by full capacity), the company is primed to capitalize on upcoming LCFS regulatory changes—including potential credit multipliers that could amplify values by 300%—as early as 2026. This regulatory tailwind, combined with its 11 operational digesters and a four-dairy cluster nearing completion, reinforces Aemetis's leadership in the RNG space.

Growth Drivers: Scaling Capacity and Diversifying Revenue

Beyond LCFS credits, Aemetis is advancing projects that amplify its revenue streams:

1. RNG Pipeline Expansion: The $27 million Centuri expansion will expand its biogas pipeline network to 60 miles, connecting more dairies to the Keyes facility and unlocking $70 million+ in tax credit sales from Section 45Z and 48 credits.

2. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Plant: With critical permits secured, the 78-million-gallon-per-year SAF plant—set to start production in 2026—will diversify revenue while targeting the high-demand aviation sector.

3. Carbon Sequestration: The Riverbank project, designed to sequester 1.4 million tons of CO₂ annually, adds another layer of decarbonization revenue through carbon credits.

These initiatives, combined with the Keyes ethanol plant's $32 million/year cash flow boost from mechanical vapor recompression upgrades, create a robust, multi-year growth pipeline.

Valuation and Investment Thesis: A Buy at Current Levels

Despite recent stock momentum (up 10.6% year-to-date), Aemetis remains undervalued relative to its peers. With Ascendiant Capital's $20 price target (implying 50% upside from current levels) and a market cap of $300 million, the stock offers asymmetric reward potential. Key valuation metrics:

- 2025E EBITDA: Estimated at $25 million (excluding LCFS upside).

- Debt-to-Equity: Managed at $125 million total debt, including USDA-backed loans, with no near-term repayment pressure.

Risks and Considerations

Regulatory Delays: While CARB approvals are on track, delays in LCFS program updates or India's biodiesel mandates (a secondary market) could temporarily stall momentum.

Execution Risk: Scaling RNG and SAF production requires capital discipline; the $27M Centuri expansion and SAF plant's permitting history are critical watchpoints.

As the era of deregulation saw airlines in the US falling like dominoes, so did Pan Am.
Lufthansa,Korean Air, and Air China are among the few airlines that purchased passenger outfitted 747-8s.
Today, these air carriers have added more and more long-haul twinjets to their respective fleets on the same routes once dominated by 747s.
When the Boeing 747 was originally developed in the 1960s, fuel prices were far lower than they are now.","The overwhelming majority of the 155 double-decker 747-8s that Boeing made were put into service as cargo freighters, and the few passenger carriers that did go into service were all sold to carriers overseas. The Boeing 747 is a legendary plane in American aviation history, and some of the most revered names in the airline business flew it as their flagship for many years. If the jumbo jet was the central figure in American flying culture, why did its final version fail to sell to any domestic carriers?

The 747 made history when it debuted, airlines clamored to get their own, and the many air carriers of the United States put them into service on their most high-profile routes as soon as they arrived on the flightline. The -8 was produced between 2008 and 2023, a 15-year manufacturing run. In all that time, not one ever rolled out of the factory doors in a US airline’s livery. The cause simply came down to economics, as twinjets like Boeing’s 777 offered a more profitable option. The last 747-8 ever made was a cargo hauler, handed over to Atlas Air.

Pan Am And Its Last 747s

Pan Am was famed for its glamorous service, and a large part of that luxurious travel experience was provided by the 747. Pan Am was the launch customer when Boeing first introduced the 747, but the airline didn’t survive long enough to see the final model take flight. As the era of deregulation saw airlines in the US falling like dominoes, so did Pan Am. The once great Pan American World Airways declared bankruptcy in 1991.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said the Persian Gulf crisis has caused Pan Am's fuel expenses to rise by $150 million over the months leading to the company’s shutdown. He claimed that both leisure and business travel were impacted by the economic downturn. Additionally, a hijacking that ended in the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in 1988 had caused a ""heavy toll on our cash flow,"" as he said.

Many attribute at least some of the cause for Pan Am’s insolvency to the airline’s reluctance to part ways with the jumbo jet. The “Queen of the Skies,” as the 747 was often called, was intertwined with Pan Am’s brand identity and company culture, which made it difficult for the company’s leadership to chart a new course without it. Pan Am also faced a lawsuit of $300 million, after its 747 was bombed and was subject to multiple safety fines imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Last Of A Dying Breed: The 747-8’s Fate

Today, a handful of 747-8I models still cruise the skies, hauling international travelers around the globe. The “I” in 747-8I stands for “intercontinental,” and that’s exactly the kind of flying most of the remaining jumbos are doing today. They are all eventually slated to be replaced by Boeing’s new 777X or Airbus A350 widebody twinjets, but for now, at least, the iconic double-deckers are still gracing our sky as they soar between continents.

Lufthansa,Korean Air, and Air China are among the few airlines that purchased passenger outfitted 747-8s. The routes they employed the colossal jets on were niche and limited. Today, these air carriers have added more and more long-haul twinjets to their respective fleets on the same routes once dominated by 747s.

The freighter variant of the 747 has always been an extremely popular aircraft for cargo haulers like Atlas Air, National, and Cargolux are among the top carriers to employ the “-8F.” The cargo variant of the superjumbo has always been a great success and will likely continue to serve until the airframes age out and reach the end of their usable lives.

The A380: Different Plane, Same Story

In a distinctly parallel story, Airbus’ super-jumbo A380 made its debut decades later than the 747, but the European-made double-decker actually ended production before the last 747-8 was built. The manufacturing run lasted from 2003 to 2001 and while it found immense success with some carriers like Emirates Airlines, the general commercial aviation market was not overwhelmingly receptive.

Airbus recognized the less-than-stellar demand for the super-sized airliner and pivoted to double down on widebody twinjets like its A350 series. The maker has not ruled out reopening production for a new A380neo model, but has repeatedly stated that unless a case can be made for sufficient sales appetite, there is simply no justification for the investment in retooling a new plant. Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders said in 2019:

“As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years…The A380 is not only an outstanding engineering and industrial achievement. Passengers all over the world love to fly on this great aircraft. Hence today’s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide. But, keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators.”

Unlike the 747, the A380 never became a popular freighter jet as its cabin decks were found to be prohibitively expensive to reinforce for cargo hauling duties. That contributed to the lack of sales demand and relatively short production period by comparison to the 747 family, which yielded a number of variants and specialized versions, including the famous US Air Force’s “Air Force One,” the most VIP of all executive jets.

The Writing On The Wall: Twinjet Economics

The heyday of four-engined commercial airlines had already sunset by the time the 747-8 began to roll off the assembly line. When the Boeing 747 was originally developed in the 1960s, fuel prices were far lower than they are now. But since then, fuel costs have increased dramatically and have grown more erratic. Global geopolitical events and a declining supply are partly to blame for the rise in oil and jet fuel costs all over the globe.

The fuel efficiency of the 747-8I can be estimated at around 0.142 miles per gallon based on a wide variety of factors. By comparison, a Boeing 777 series widebody twinjet operates with roughly 0.2 to 0.3 miles per gallon. That’s about double the fuel efficiency of the bigger, four-engined jumbo, and with figures like that, it’s easy to see why the 747 has fallen out of favor. Similar developments have befallen other four-engine aircraft, including the Airbus A340and A380.

The A340 was never able to achieve the dazzling commercial success of the A330, its twin-engined sibling, as MSN remarked in a special report. This higher fuel use affects the bottom line as well as the environment. Significant greenhouse gas emissions, like CO2, are produced when aviation fuel is burned. Since these gases have a stronger warming effect at altitude than at sea level, their impact on the ecosystem may be considerably more severe due to the high altitude where they are released.

The Rise Of Widebody Twinjets

The world of commercial aviation is famous for razor-thin margins and unforgiving economics, demanding extreme efficiency in every aspect of operations, but the bottom line is always most sensitive to the costs of jet fuel. The simple fact of the matter is that stretched twinjets are better on gas than quadjet leviathans like the 747 and A380.

Even the trijet design was unable to compete with the fuel efficiency and reliable economic performance that modern twinjet airliners have shown. Trijets never showed consistent and clear fuel consumption advantages versus twins, and then there was the extra maintenance cost of having another engine to service. US carriers moved away from trijets around the same time as the 747, and despite lingering on in cargo roles similarly to the superjumbo, none are still in production today.

Will Jumbo Jets Ever Return?

Emirates, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is famous for its world-leading fleet of jumbo A380s, and cargo variants of the 747 are still very active in the air freight industry, with their owners and operators praising them for their immense capacity. That doesn’t appear to be enough to inspire a new drive for the next-generation of double-decker superjumbos.

Emirates received its first A350 recently, and the proportion of twinjets on freight duty has been steadily increasing for years. It seems unlikely for a string resurge given the global focus on sustainability, fuel efficiency, and the recent improvements in both widebody and narrowbody range. Airbus’ A321XLR and A350-1000 are selling exceptionally well to customers that operate routes akin to the 747’s previous domain. The 777X is highly anticipated by previous 747 customers like Lufthansa and United.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/order.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 12:06:33.404891

A major issue with this style of airline promotion is the risk that they grate against stated sustainability goals and mission statements.
“After all, there will be many people competing to win the 5 million miles, and all but three of them will see their efforts in vain.""","Earlier this week, JetBlue launched one of the quirkiest promotions by a U.S. airline in years: a loyalty challenge that rewards customers who visit 25 JetBlue destinations by the end of 2025 with coveted perks through 2050.

To mark its 25th anniversary, the “25 for 25” campaign offers members of its TrueBlue loyalty program a quarter-century of Mosaic 1 status – part of JetBlue’s elite tier – plus up to 350,000 bonus points. Members who hit 15 destinations earn 150,000 points; 20 destinations bring an additional 200,000 points; and those who hit the full 25 unlock the status windfall.

Ed Pouthier, the carrier’s VP of loyalty and personalization describes the promotion as “a thank you to the customers who’ve helped us reach 25 years of incredible growth.”

While headline-making in the United States, JetBlue’s campaign is just the latest in a global wave of high-concept airline marketing stunts.

Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways launched “The Extraordinary Challenge” at the end of May. It is offering Etihad Guest members the chance to win up to 5 million miles by flying to each of the airline’s 15 new destinations. The first to complete the challenge will win 5 million points; the second, 3 million; and the third, 1 million.

In marketing materials, the UAE carrier says that 5 million Etihad Guest miles “can equate to over 500 Economy flights, or more than 70 trips in Business, or more than 40 unforgettable journeys in First.”

To qualify, participants must fly to or from all of the following destinations by May 25, 2026: Addis Ababa, Algiers, Atlanta, Chiang Mai, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Krabi, Medan, Peshawar, Phnom Penh, Prague, Sochi, Taipei, Tunis, and Warsaw. Service to some of these destinations doesn’t start until later this year.

Getting Creative, But At What Cost?

“Like all companies, airline marketing campaigns have had to get creative to break through and grab people's attention, especially when the subject is somewhat mundane like new seat upholstery or new destinations,” says Scott Keyes of Going (formerly Scott’s Cheap Flights). “But Etihad's campaign of offering 5 million miles to one winner is perhaps the most audacious and attention-grabbing attempt I've seen for a new route announcement.”

Chelsea Curran, director of integrated PR, destinations, resorts, and experiences, at Crowe PR, offered additional behind-the-scenes insight about the latest campaigns and similar stunts.

“We’ve seen airlines, hotels, and hospitality brands jump on PR stunts for years designed to help them spark global attention,” she says. “These are geared towards doing more than just going viral: They are well designed to help generate long-lasting buzz, deepen brand understanding, and engage and inspire conversations amongst travelers with the Etihad brand at the forefront.”

Another high-profile example comes from the Scandinavian carrier SAS. Last year, it ran a campaign that rewarded members of its EuroBonus loyalty program by turning them into “points millionaires.” To be eligible for the prize, members had to fly with 15 out of 17 SkyTeam alliance airlines. The contest period took place from October 8 to December 31, 2024. Despite having less than three months to fly with 15 global airlines, 940 of the 42,700 participants were successful.

Of course, there’s the bottom line to keep in mind, but these campaigns can be a relative bargain for airlines. The cost of a stunt like this to Etihad is “trivial, of course,” says Keyes. “They can print as many miles as they want, and even assuming a generous 1-cent-per-mile accounting cost, the prize is equivalent to $50,000, a rounding error in an airline's marketing budget.""

Sustainability Questions

For all of the recent hype, is it a simple case of back to the future? The hyper-competitive period following airline deregulation in the 1980s was full of wacky campaigns.

However, unlike the 1980s, the socially conscious modern air traveler has an additional angle to consider. A major issue with this style of airline promotion is the risk that they grate against stated sustainability goals and mission statements.

Skift called in generative AI to create the best itinerary to visit each of the cities in Etihad’s Extraordinary Challenge. The brief was to use flights connecting through the carrier’s Abu Dhabi hub as sparingly as possible. Our prompt allowed other airlines to directly connect each destination as long as Etihad flights were used for at least one flight in or out.

According to its calculations, flying to and from each of these cities in the most efficient manner possible would add up to about 85,563 miles (137,700 km) in the air. That would generate around 30.3 tons (27.5 tonnes) of CO₂ per passenger, around twice the average annual individual carbon footprint.

Depending on how many people enter the competition, it’s a challenge that could leave quite a mark. Etihad won Environmental Airline of the Year in 2023 and the airline plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Etihad declined to comment when approached by Skift for this story.

Who Pays the Price?

There’s also the human factor. While it might not cost airlines much to facilitate the stunts or their prizes, it can be contestants who shoulder the cost instead.

“There's concern among some about the amount of wasted travel hours and additional emissions that [the Etihad] competition entails,” says Keyes. “After all, there will be many people competing to win the 5 million miles, and all but three of them will see their efforts in vain.""

The recent SAS and JetBlue promotions differ in that there is no limit to the number of successful participants.

However, travel that’s consumption-focused and performative (staying somewhere only long enough to say you’ve been there, “doing it for the ‘gram”) is the antithesis of sustainable travel, which prioritizes slow travel, reducing carbon footprint, and forming meaningful connections on the ground.

“Given travelers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, are seeking more meaningful, slower trips versus globe-hopping on long, non-stop journeys, this stunt can feel at odds with the rising call for more sustainable and responsible travel,” Curran adds.

For its part, JetBlue told Skift: ""As a primarily leisure airline, this promotion is designed to celebrate exploration, encouraging customers to connect with friends and family across our network, or visit destinations they may not have discovered yet.

""Importantly, the promotion is built around our regularly scheduled flights, not added capacity or special charters created solely for the program,"" a spokesperson added.

Despite the campaign still being in its first week, JetBlue reports ""great enthusiasm,"" with more than 650 bookings already made through a dedicated promotion landing page.

The Russian Factor

An additional consideration for the Etihad competition in particular is accessibility. While the airline says the competition is “offering anyone the chance to participate and win,” the required stop in Sochi, Russia, might deter some. This could be because of visa restrictions, safety concerns given the conflict in Ukraine, or the questionable morality of flying into a country at war to win loyalty points.

“Whether intentional or not, the fact that one of the required stops is in Russia effectively excludes most American and Western European travelers from participating,” says Keyes.

In the near term, is there a way forward for attention-grabbing airline PR stunts? Curran suggests initiatives that align more toward sustainable travel while still creating buzz.

“This might include challenges that entice travelers to show off their low-carbon travel, creating immersive experiences in local communities or slow travel itineraries that help travelers experience longer, more meaningful trips,” she notes. “In a crowded market, we’ll continue to see travel brands push boundaries and the key to ensuring these will be successful is to anchor them in purpose and your brand mission, not just promotion.”","https://skift.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/passport-2714675_1920-e1723317743201.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-06-28 13:07:25.511196

Aemetis, Inc. (AMTX), a leader in renewable natural gas (RNG) and renewable fuel production, has secured California Air Resources Board (CARB) approval for seven provisional pathways under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). These pathways, which will be effective from January 1, 2025, boast an average carbon intensity of -384, with individual scores ranging from -327 to -419. Such significant negative carbon intensity values imply that the pathways remove more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit, enhancing the project's appeal under California's LCFS market.

The approval allows Aemetis to significantly increase its LCFS credit generation by approximately 100% for the seven digesters, translating into immediate potential revenue growth. Currently, the company operates eleven digesters with an additional four-dairy cluster digester nearing completion, positioning Aemetis for further pathway approvals as LCFS regulatory amendments progress this year.

Aemetis is also advancing its renewable energy portfolio with various ongoing projects. These include the planned construction of new dairy digesters aimed at producing over 1 million MMBtu per year of renewable natural gas, and a sustainable aviation fuel plant with an annual capacity of 78 million gallons, already equipped with necessary permits. Additionally, upgrades to the Keyes ethanol plant are projected to generate $32 million of increased annual cash flow starting in 2026.

An ABF spokesperson said: “We are extremely pleased to be entering the next phase of formal negotiations with Government over the future of Vivergo.
“We believe it is a very positive signal that Government recognises the strategic importance of a domestic bioethanol industry, and is serious about working with the sector to find a sustainable long-term future.

But the firm, which is owned by Associated British Foods (ABF), said it is simultaneously beginning consultation with staff to wind down the plant, which employs more than 160 people, due to the uncertain situation – a process which could see production stop before September 13, if support is not provided.

An ABF spokesperson said: “We are extremely pleased to be entering the next phase of formal negotiations with Government over the future of Vivergo.

“We believe it is a very positive signal that Government recognises the strategic importance of a domestic bioethanol industry, and is serious about working with the sector to find a sustainable long-term future.

“We look forward to engaging intensively and constructively with ministers over the coming weeks.”

The statement added: “ABF cannot continue to absorb losses at the plant. That is why a timely solution is vital.

“Our clear preference is to find that solution through this process and to get back to running a business that can thrive in the long term.”

The firm said that “in parallel” it has entered into a consultation process with staff, which it said was a necessary step as there is no guarantee that the negotiations with Government will be successful.

It said: “Our employees are our most important consideration, and we will engage with them properly and transparently about the future.

“Consultation is not a fixed outcome, and closure is not a certainty.

“The outcome depends on the progress we are able to make through negotiations with the Government.”

Last month, Vivergo wrote to the wheat farmers who supply it, telling them it will have to close unless there is quick Government intervention.

It said the removal of a 19 per cent tariff on US ethanol imports, which formed part of the recent UK-US trade deal, was the “final blow”.

The bioethanol industry says the deal has made it impossible to compete with heavily subsidised American products.

Vivergo said the Hull plant can produce up to 420 million litres of bioethanol from wheat sourced from thousands of UK farms.

It described bioethanol production as “a key national strategic asset” which helps reduce emissions from petrol and is expected to be a key component in sustainable aircraft fuel in the future.

The firm said it has just signed a £1.25bn memorandum of understanding with Meld Energy to anchor a “world-class” Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at the site.

It said the “potential ahead is enormous”, adding that “there is a real opportunity for Hull to be home to one of Britain’s most exciting clean fuel clusters”.

The plant is also the UK’s largest single production site for animal feed and the company says it indirectly supports about 4,000 jobs in the Humber and Lincolnshire region.

Following ABF’s announcement of a potential shutdown by mid-September, a Government spokesperson said on Thursday: “We recognise this is a concerning time for workers and their families and it is disappointing to see this announcement after we entered into negotiations with the company on financial support yesterday.

“We will continue to take proactive steps to address the long-standing challenges the company faces and remain committed to working closely with them throughout this period to present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods.”

The Government said the bioethanol industry has been facing significant challenges for some time and officials and ministers have met with Ensus and Vivergo consistently over the last few months to address the challenges.

The Senate's proposed tax and budget reconciliation legislation would modify the '45Z' Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to restore tax parity between sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other advanced biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel effective Oct. 1, 2025. Modifying '45Z' to be technology-neutral marks a critical step in revitalizing U.S. biofuel production, which has dropped sharply since the credit took effect in January.

""We give the Senate a lot of credit for reconfiguring '45Z' to be truly technology neutral. SAF should be incentivized at the same rate as all other biofuels. An equal incentive – 'parity' – will result in more gallons of biofuel being produced and consumed, all at a lower cost for taxpayers,"" said David Fialkov, Executive Vice President of Government Affairs for NATSO and SIGMA. ""Importantly, this provision reduces the overall cost of the '45Z' tax credit while also incentivizing more over the road fuel production – helping to lower prices for consumers. A win for everyone.""

""A level playing field for sustainable aviation fuels versus over-the-road biofuels is critical to restoring the biodiesel market,"" said Matt Durand, NACS Deputy General Counsel. ""Today, the biodiesel market is failing due to tax policy. Unless we act to ensure biodiesel is no longer disadvantaged, the market may never recover. NACS strongly supports the Section '45Z' parity proposal and urges the Senate to retain it.""

The Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided a higher tax credit of up to $1.75 for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. The higher aviation fuel tax credit signed into law by President Biden, coupled with the expiration of the Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit at the end of 2024, has decimated America's advanced biofuel supply chains.

Equal tax treatment between alternative biofuels represents a significant step toward the much-needed certainty that will encourage biofuel production and consumption. SAF is more costly than biodiesel and renewable diesel and results in the production of less gallons of overall fuel. Under the Senate legislation, SAF would have access to the same credit as all other fuels and producers will be able to gravitate toward the most efficient fuels in the market.

Lake Powell is at 34% capacity, according to David Simeral, a scientist with the Desert Research Institute.
Projections show Lake Mead remaining just above 1,050 feet by later this year, so it would not set a new record low this year.""
Lake Mead and Lake Powell are by far the two largest reservoirs on the Colorado River.""","After a brief reprieve in 2023 and early 2024, a long-simmering water crisis in the West is back with a vengeance, impacting massive water reservoirs, drought conditions and wildfire concerns.

In fact, according to a recent report from environmental firm AEM, the western United States faces ""a rapidly worsening drought crisis, with affected areas nearly tripling compared to last year.""

""The drought in the West is a real concern,"" said AEM senior meteorologist James Aman in an e-mail to USA TODAY. ""Over the past few weeks, drought has worsened in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and northern Utah,"" he said.

Overall, the recent western drought was at its worst in late 2021, when nearly 94% of the West was in drought, before easing in 2023-24. It is now at 58%.

Of particular concern in the Southwest are the giant reservoirs of the Colorado River basin, Lakes Mead and Powell, which remain far below capacity.

The Colorado River and the two reservoirs have been in crisis because of a multidecade drought in the West intensified by climate change, rising demand and overuse. The river also serves Mexico and more than two dozen Native American tribes, produces hydropower, and supplies water to farms that grow most of the nation’s winter vegetables.

The report shows that both Mead and Powell, crucial reservoirs that provide drinking water for 40 million Americans, have ""reached alarmingly low levels, holding just one-third of their usual capacity. This shortage poses significant challenges to agriculture, urban water supplies, and industries reliant on consistent water availability,"" according to the report.

This is up from a low point in 2022, when they were 25% full, but still far from their historic highs of the early 2000s, when they were 95% full.

What's the latest on Lakes Mead and Powell? Could they drop to record low levels this year?

The two reservoirs are located in the Southwest, with huge Lake Mead primarily in Nevada and Powell located along the Utah-Arizona border.

Aman said that ""in historical terms, current water levels at Lake Powell and Lake Mead remain very low. Lake Mead is currently at only 31% of capacity,"" he said.

Lake Powell is at 34% capacity, according to David Simeral, a scientist with the Desert Research Institute.

Lake Mead and Lake Powell did see water levels increase a bit early this summer, as spring snowmelt worked its way down the Colorado River system, according to Aman.

""However, as the summer progresses, lake-levels will begin to decrease,"" he said. ""Water levels are projected to continue falling through the end of this year. The lowest level ever recorded at Lake Mead was 1,041 feet in July 2022 (lowest level since the reservoir started filling in the 1930s). Projections show Lake Mead remaining just above 1,050 feet by later this year, so it would not set a new record low this year.""

However, long-range projections show even lower water levels by later 2026, with some chance of reaching near the record low, Aman said.

The two reservoirs are vital for water supply in the West, according to Aman: ""Seven states use Colorado River for parts of their water supply (Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and California). Just over 50% is used for farm irrigation, and almost 20% is used for drinking water. Lake Mead and Lake Powell are by far the two largest reservoirs on the Colorado River.""

KDSK-TV reported that the Colorado River, which connects the two lakes, provides drinking water for major cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix, as well as 90% of Las Vegas's drinking water.

Expanding drought in the West

Just one year ago, only 18% of the western U.S. was in a drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. As of this week's monitor, that number is up to 58%.

This significant drought expansion ""raises serious concerns about water availability, agricultural productivity, wildfire threats, and infrastructure stability across the region,"" the AEM report said.

The latest medium and long-range outlooks from the National Weather Service (NWS) Climate Prediction Center (CPC) indicate below-normal precipitation in the area for the next several months, according to Aman.

Additionally, hotter-than-normal temperatures are expected across the Rockies, Pacific Northwest, and the Upper Midwest, exacerbating drought conditions and placing significant stress on regional electric grids, the AEM report stated.

Some good news

However, there is some good news in one part of the West: ""An active North American monsoon is anticipated to continue through all of July and possibly into August,"" Aman told USA TODAY. ""This is likely to bring above-normal rain and thunderstorms to parts of the Southwest U.S. We agree with the NWS CPC outlooks that show above-normal precipitation is likely across Arizona and New Mexico, and perhaps into southeast Utah and western Colorado through all of July.""

He added that parts of the Southwest have very deep drought, so just a single summer of above-normal rainfall won't be enough to eliminate drought in these areas.

Wildfire worries

The severe drought conditions are further intensifying wildfire risks in the West, particularly around the July 4th holiday, historically associated with increased wildfire activity, the AEM report said. Areas such as California, the Great Basin, and the northern Rockies are projected to face above-normal fire potential throughout the summer months, further straining firefighting resources and endangering communities.

Canada is also facing extreme fire danger across western provinces, with burned acreage already triple the seasonal average.

“This summer will bring a dangerous combination of heat, dryness, and fuel buildup that elevates wildfire risks across North America,” said Aman. “We’re already seeing an above-average number of wildfires in the U.S., with similar trends north of the border.”

Why might July 4 be especially dangerous for wildfires?

""There is a huge spike in the number of human-caused wildfires in the United States around the 4th of July holiday, related to the improper use of fireworks,"" Aman told USA TODAY.

""When plotted on a map, the highest concentration of wildfires caused by fireworks occurs in the western half of the U.S., mainly in national parks, national forests, and certain other rural areas. Other smaller clusters of wildfires caused by fireworks are seen around some large U.S. cities, and in national parks and forests in the eastern U.S.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3_HFArw9yA.wok5_g.PvsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/9ff8c15258316a53cee4cb87b1d7201a,N,,2025-06-28 13:07:35.125737

This project is expected to create jobs and provide support to the regional biomass and timber industries across Southeast Texas and western Louisiana.

Landmark Supply Agreement Secured

USA Bioenergy, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, has reached a notable milestone by signing a long-term agreement with LP Corporation to supply wood biomass for the plant located in Bon Wier, Newton County. The deal commits up to 2.2 million tons of wood biomass over an initial 20-year period. This partnership is important for securing stable feedstock supply essential for financing and building the facility.

Focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The primary product of the bioenergy plant will be Sustainable Aviation Fuel, commonly referred to as SAF or bio-jetfuel. SAF is a renewable, lower-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, aimed at reducing the environmental impact of the airline industry. The plant’s operation will contribute to efforts promoting cleaner, sustainable fuels within the transportation sector.

Economic and Environmental Impact

The bioenergy project is expected to have an impact on the local economy. The construction phase is estimated to generate approximately 500 jobs, while the operational phase is projected to create around 140 permanent positions. In addition to job creation, the plant will provide steady demand for wood biomass, supporting the logging and timber industries.

Project Background and Development

USA Bioenergy acquired more than 1,600 acres of land and buildings previously owned by the Louisiana Pacific Corporation in Bon Wier. The site was once a large plywood mill, which closed in 2002. The redevelopment of this site into a bioenergy facility represents an effort to utilize existing industrial infrastructure.

Next Steps and Timeline

Engineering and detailed planning for the project are expected to progress through the remainder of the year. The company has secured financing and reportedly holds a contract with Southwest Airlines, indicating commercial interest in SAF. The estimated investment in the plant is $1.7 billion, reflecting the scale of the project.

Concorde, a joint project devised, developed and manufactured by the British and French aviation industries, made it’s maiden voyage in 1969. Easily identified by its iconic, ogival delta-shaped wings and streamlined, drooping nose cone, the aircraft was an aerodynamic work of art.

It had a takeoff speed of 250 mph (402 km/h) and an average cruising speed of 1,350 mph (2,173 km/h) - way faster than any of today’s modern commercial aircraft.

It had the capability to fly at twice the speed of sound - carrying a full capacity of 92 to 128 passengers from London to New York in under three hours - the same journey, a direct flight from Heathrow to JFK today takes around seven and a half hours. Only 20 aircraft were ever made, operated by British Airways and Air France, and not all of them were for commercial use. So why did Concorde disappear?

Concorde grounded after horrific crash

Concorde was taken out of service in October 2023 as a result of the findings of the inquest into the Air France Flight 4590 disaster of July 2000.

Flight 4590 took off from Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport shortly before 5 p.m. on 25 July 2000. Just as it reached it’s takeoff speed (V2), the plane ran over a piece of metal debris - a titanium strip which had fallen off a Continental Airlines DC 10 which had used the same runway moments earlier.

A catastrophic event which punctured one of the tyres on Flight 4590‘s left-sided landing gear, sending fragments hurtling at high speed towards the planes fuel tanks, housed under the wings. It caused engine failure and a fire, as leaking fuel was ignited. Flight 4590 crashed 121 seconds after takeoff, killing all onboard (100 passengers and nine crew) as well as four on the ground.

The crash was Concorde’s only major incident involving fatalities in almost a quarter of a century of commercial service. Most of the remaining aircraft, including the prototypes, were preserved and are on display across Europe and North America.

Plans for a new supersonic commercial aircraft

Apart from the Air France crash, Concorde’s safety record was exemplary. During the past 50 years, there have been several petitions to see a return to overland supersonic flight, which was banned by many countries - including the United States, in 1973, due to sonic boom and environmental concerns.

However, after the latest developments, the return of commercial supersonic flight could soon become a reality. US president Donald Trump signed executive order 14304, on June 6, 2025, overturning “outdated and overly restrictive regulations” to clear regulatory airspace for supersonic travel over land.

""Advances in aerospace engineering, materials science, and noise reduction now make supersonic flight not just possible, but safe, sustainable, and commercially viable,“ the order, entitled: Leading The World in Supersonic Flight, explains.

The order also mandates the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to coordinate research and development through the National Science and Technology Council, with the aim of reinstating the US as the world leader in next-generation aerospace innovation and sustainability.

New Concorde in the pipeline

The design flaws that contributed to the Flight 4590 crash were outlined in the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) investigation report published on issued on 16 January 2002. Changes includes strengthening the lining of fuel tanks, safer electronics housing and burst-resistant tires.

Fly-Concorde plan to construct a new Concorde, which will retain it’s original shape but will be 50% lighter thanks to the latest, thermal resistant, carbon fiber composite materials. The new model will be more environmentally-friendly, running on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which will cut emissions by 80%.

It will also cruise at 60,000 feet - a higher altitude than most conventional commercial aircraft (38,000 feet). The new Fly-Concorde jet will be able to transport passengers from London to New York in just two hours, and Paris to Riyadh in 1 hour 43 minutes (instead of 5 hours 10 minutes, while operating faster, quieter, and cleaner than the original Concorde. The first flights have been penciled in for January 2026.

Environment

Last week as global aviation executives gathered in Paris for the bi-annual Paris Air Show, while sustainability was on every lip at Le Bourget airport, most did not have a lot to show for what they had done in the decade since global community reached a so-called historic agreement in Paris a decade earlier, to save the world from climate change, with the Paris Climate Agreement. A decade on, almost on every single count, the world as a whole is completely out of step with what is needed and what was indeed promised at the same grounds of Le Bourget in December 2015.

The champagne flutes have barely been cleared from the chalets at Le Bourget. The roar of the latest fighter jets and sleek airliners still echoes in the memories of attendees. The Paris Air Show 2025, aviation’s glittering biennial showcase, concluded with the usual fanfare celebrating human ingenuity and global connection. Yet, this year’s spectacle unfolded under a starkly different shadow, the looming 10th anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement, signed at the same hallowed grounds of Le Bourget in December 2015.

The dissonance is deafening. While the world pledged to hold global warming “well below 2°C,” the aviation industry, basking in its post-pandemic resurgence, has been taking the world on an accelerated flight towards a climate crash.

The Soaring Contradiction: Growth versus goals

In 2015, aviation accounted for roughly 2-3 pc of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. A significant, but seemingly manageable, slice of the pie. The optimism of Paris suggested technology and cooperation could tame this sector. A decade on, the reality is starkly different.

Despite efficiency gains, total aviation CO2 emissions have surged. Pre-pandemic levels were breached rapidly. In 2024, emissions were estimated to be over 20 pc higher than in 2015. Air travel demand is booming, particularly in Asia, and air cargo remains the lifeblood of global commerce.

The industry, via the International Air Transport Association (IATA), committed to NetZero Carbon by 2050. However, projections paint a daunting picture. Without drastic intervention, aviation emissions could double or even triple by 2050 compared to 2019 levels. Reaching net-zero from that peak, while demand continues to grow, requires a revolution, not incremental change.

By focussing solely on aircraft exhaust vastly underestimates aviation’s footprint since global airports serve as gigantic carbon hubs, with their massive terminals, sprawling runways, energy-intensive lighting, heating, cooling and ground operations make airports significant emitters. While some aim for ‘NetZero airport operations’, this often excludes the core activity or the planes themselves.

Another aspect that the aviation industry has tried to cover up is the Scope 3 emissions, which are those emissions with a direct link to the industry, but where industry itself is not the emitter.This is aviation’s dirty secret, often omitted from industry reports, such as passenger ground transport as billions of journeys are undertaken by car, taxis, and buses ferrying people to and from airports daily. Similarly, the trucks and vans transporting goods to consolidation centres and final destinations, which again are omitted and the in-flight footprint as vast quantities of single-use plastics, such as cups, cutlery and packaging, food production and waste, which are often high-emission meats and dairy, duty-free goods and printed materials.

Beyond the civil aviation, military flights, largely excluded from international climate agreements and reporting, contribute significantly to global aviation emissions but operate with near-zero public scrutiny or pressure.

A Decade of Delay: The lagging green transition

Air Shows around the world buzz with promises of a sustainable future such as hydrogen concepts, electric vertical take-off vehicles (eVTOLs), and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) logos emblazoned everywhere. Yet, the pace of tangible progress has been glacial.

SAF is the industry’s primary near-term hope. However, current global production meets less than 0.2 pc of total jet fuel demand and scaling up faces immense hurdles due to high costs, which are 3-5 times that of conventional fuel, limited sustainable feedstocks which are those that avoid competition with food crops or lead to deforestation, and lagging policy support for production. While airlines announce SAF offtake agreements, they represent tiny fractions of their overall consumption. The 2025 Air Show saw more SAF pledges, but few concrete breakthroughs on scaling production.

Similarly, the aviation industry’s promises for a technological change to go sustainable through new modes of powering aircraft have so far remained pipedreams. Certainly, hydrogen and battery-electric propulsion hold promise, but primarily for smaller, shorter-range aircraft decades from mainstream adoption. Wide-body, long-haul flights, the biggest emitters, will rely on liquid fuels for the foreseeable future. Efficiency improvements in conventional engines are incremental, easily outpaced by traffic growth.

The industry is also facing an infrastructure inertia as retrofitting airports for widespread SAF use, hydrogen storage, or electric charging requires massive investment and planning and is lagging far behind the rhetoric.

Another challenge is a lack of cohesive policy. A global carbon pricing mechanism for aviation (like CORSIA) remains weak, complex, and riddled with loopholes. Kerosene tax exemptions persist in most countries, a massive implicit subsidy for fossil fuels and regulations on non-CO2 effects (contrails) are nascent.

Shared responsibility for a sky-high problem

Achieving anything close to aviation NetZero by 2050 demands action far beyond aircraft manufacturers:

The industry in its entirety, with airlines, manufacturers and airports, must move beyond lip service and PR. This means a massive and accelerated investment in SAF production by aggressively funding production facilities and accepting higher fuel costs in the short term.

Airlines also need to accelerate retirement of older, inefficient aircraft, even if financially painful. They must also seek operational optimisation by investing in AI for flight path optimisation, such as reducing contrails, single-engine taxiing, weight reduction.

The industry must also adopt transparent full-scope reporting with mandatory accounting and reduction targets for Scope 3 emissions and revolutionising the passenger experience by drastically reducing single-use plastics, offering genuinely sustainable food options by default, enabling seamless low-carbon ground transport links.

Passengers:

Not just the airlines or the aviation industry, but the passengers must also play their part in combatting carbon emissions. Frequent flyers, who are less than 20 pc of the population, but cause 80 pc of passenger emissions, must confront their impact. They can opt to fly lesser by choosing rail for short-haul, embracing virtual meetings, taking fewer but longer trips. They can also fly smarter by opting for

newer, more efficient aircraft types, where possible, and preferring airlines with strong SAF commitments, as well as direct flights and of course by packing light.

Passengers also need to scrutinise offsets to which they contribute, often because they were egged on by the airline. But offsets are not a get-out-of-jail-free card; they must be high-quality, permanent, and additional and used by airlines after they have achieved significant emission reductions.

For their part, cargo shippers and recipients must integrate aviation emissions into their own supply chain carbon accounting and actively seek lower-carbon logistics options through consolidation, slower shipping modes where feasible, demanding transparency and action from freight carriers.

The governments, of course, have the biggest role and responsibility in getting the airlines and the aviation industry to keep their commitments. They must stop coddling the industry and need to end fossil fuel subsidies by imposing a tax on kerosene, which fuels conventional aircraft today.

The governments should also strengthen regulations and mandate increasing SAF blending ratios, enforce strict efficiency standards, regulate non-CO2 emissions.

They can also fund research and development and creation of modern infrastructure as substantial public investment in SAF, hydrogen, and electric aviation infrastructure is crucial.

The governments also need to integrate defence in sustainability by adding military aviation in national emission inventories and set up their reduction plans. For this, defence aviation must be brought into the climate fold, subject to transparency and ambitious decarbonisation targets.

Carbon credits and farmers: A lifeline or a distraction?

The aviation industry heavily promotes carbon offsetting and carbon credits as part of its net-zero pathway. Purchasing credits from projects like reforestation or soil carbon sequestration on farms is attractive as it allows for continued fossil fuel use while claiming NetZero emissions. However, this is fraught with peril as offsets are not a substitute. Offsets must be supplementary to deep, direct emission cuts within aviation itself. Relying on them excessively is greenwashing.

They also need to look at issues of permanence and leakage by seeing whether the carbon stored in trees or soils truly stay locked away for centuries and if preventing deforestation in one area just pushes it elsewhere.

There is also an urgent need for ensuring the integrity, additionality or the issue that the project being sought to cover with offsets would happen anyway, and accurate measurement of carbon credits remains difficult and controversial.

While high-integrity carbon removal credits will be necessary to counterbalance aviation’s hardest-to-abate emissions, they are not the answer. They are a potential component of a solution predicated on the industry slashing its direct emissions by 70-80 pc or more through technology, efficiency and SAF.

Missing the landing strip of NetZero by miles

he honest answer to the question whether the aviation industry will actually meet its stated goal of NetZero by 2050, based on the trajectory of the past decade, is highly doubtful. The scale of transformation required is unprecedented. The relentless growth in demand, the slow pace of SAF scale-up, the immense technological challenges for long-haul flight, the lack of stringent global policy, and the vast hidden Scope 3 emissions create a colossal mountain to climb.

Reaching net-zero would require an immediate and drastic acceleration in SAF production and deployment, reaching 50-70 pc of fuel use by 2040. It would also need a fundamental shift in consumer behaviour towards reduced flying, especially among frequent flyers and revolutionary technological breakthroughs in hydrogen or battery tech for large aircraft, commercialized at scale within 15-20 years.

All these would need unprecedented global political cooperation imposing tough regulations and ending subsidies and an honest accounting and mitigation of the entire aviation footprint, including Scope 3 and defence.

Beyond the Air Show Gloss

The Paris Air Show 2025 showcased the industry’s ambition. But ambition without commensurate action and accountability is merely spectacle. The decade since the Paris Agreement has been one of soaring rhetoric and soaring emissions, a true climate crash course. The aviation industry stands at a precipice. It can continue its current path, relying on distant technologies and questionable offsets while emissions balloon, making its 2050 NetZero pledge a cruel joke. Or, it can embrace a radical transformation, backed by genuine investment, tough policy, and a shared acknowledgment that the era of unfettered growth on fossil fuels is over.

A world interconnected by flights is precious and mandatory but preserving that connection without cooking the planet demands more than shiny prototypes at an air show. It demands a revolution, starting now. The next decade cannot be another climate crash. It must be the decade of aviation’s genuine, urgent, and accountable ascent towards sustainability. The future of flight and indeed the future of our planet depends on it.",https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Australia-India-Film-Council-announced-the-appointment-of-Shreerupa-Mitra-and-Achala-Datar-to-its-National-Board-3-1024x576.png,N,,2025-06-28 08:02:43.563382

Officials are hoping to gather data on the elusive reptile, which is considered the rarest snake on the Island.

The smooth greensnake is harmless and typically lives in grassy fields, in open woodlands and on the edges of wetlands.

But little is known about its population or whether it's at risk on P.E.I., said Julie-Lynn Zahavich, a forest conservation specialist with the province, given that the species has never been formally studied on the Island.

""Knowing where the species are and what habitat they're using is the first step to being able to help conserve a species. So it's really important that we figure out those key puzzle pieces that we can put things together,"" Zahavich told CBC's Island Morning.

""In the future, if things change — you know, with climate change or if insect populations go down — we'll be able to know what we had before, so that we know if we've lost the species, we can act on that.""

Bright green and hard to miss

Zahavich said the smooth greensnake is about 30 to 50 centimetres long and, as the name suggests, has a vivid green back. Its underside or belly is typically whitish or yellowish.

It's also the only egg-laying snake on the Island. The other two commonly seen species, the garter snake and the red-bellied snake, give birth to live young.

The smooth greensnake is easy to distinguish from those two species. Garter snakes are larger and can be more than a metre long, and have a brown or grey back with stripes. Red-bellied snakes have a dark back and a vibrant red belly.

Though the smooth greensnake may bite if it feels threatened, Zahavich said it is not venomous.

""They're very small, and the bite is not going to hurt you,"" she said.

How Islanders can help

Zahavich said the division is hoping Islanders can help gather data on the species by snapping a photo if they happen to see one of the snakes.

""Make note of the habitat that they're using... whether you're on a lawn or near a wetland or an open woodland,"" she said.

People are also being asked to use their phone to get the GPS co-ordinates of the location or check Google Maps for a sense of where they were when they saw the snake.

Photos and location information can be submitted to the Forests, Fish and Wildlife Division via Facebook, by email or by phone. Submissions are being accepted throughout the summer, when the snakes are active.

The division is also interested in hearing about historic sightings.

""If you remember seeing them as a kid or many years ago, we'd also love to hear about that,"" Zahavich said.

As well, Islanders can upload photos and sightings to the iNaturalist app, which helps researchers gather data for scientific and conservation purposes. Zahavich said her team is monitoring the platform for smooth greensnake sightings on P.E.I.

While public reports are key, Zahavich said her team is also doing its own monitoring. Next year, they hope to expand their efforts across more parts of the province and potentially work with watershed groups and other organizations that can help track down more sightings of the reptiles.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RJbwDClWlQadsR61uj2BoA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/c1831a6878ea1d4e279f026e41b0112e,N,,2025-06-28 13:07:39.618368

That was one of the conclusions that emerged at the 2025 Mining Forum organized by newspaper La Prensa in Panama City, with the support of several business chambers. The forum discussed the role of natural resources in development, the legal limits and the environmental challenges of mining in Panama.

The mine was suspended at the end of 2023 following a supreme court decision declaring its concession unconstitutional.

So far this year, the price of copper has risen from US$8,976.68/t to US$9,937.50t at Thursday's close, or by 10.7%, according to data from Trading Economics.

This increase has been driven by a combination of factors, including declining global inventories, supply restrictions in South American mining, and sustained demand from sectors such as the energy transition and infrastructure in Asia.

Amalia Toro, partner and manager at McKinsey & Company in Panama, said during her speech at the forum that, in the current scenario, Panama faces both a great opportunity and a significant challenge.

""What is most striking is that, while in Panama we are just beginning the debate on mining, neighboring countries like Chile have already managed to articulate mechanisms so that extractive work impacts employment, productivity and development. In their case, mining represents between 10% and 14% of GDP,"" said Toro, according to La Prensa.

Before the closure of Cobre Panamá, the mine represented 5% of GDP, according to official data.

The analyst said McKinsey projects global copper demand of 37Mt annually for the coming years, while estimated supply only averages 31.2Mt. ""This gap is exacerbated by structural problems such as operational decline and falling productivity, which fell by 42% between 2020 and 2023.""

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), for its part, estimates that meeting projected demand through 2040 will require at least 80 new mines and an investment of US$250bn.

Copper is also essential for green technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles, which are necessary for the global energy transition. EVs alone could account for more than 5% of global demand by 2025, according to a report published by UNCTAD in May.

""Data centers, electric vehicles, nuclear plants, power grid conversions... everything points to demand growth of between 25% and 39% by 2035. But the big question is: where will the copper come from to fuel that future?"" said the McKinsey expert.

""Moving toward renewable energy and making the energy transition will require extensive use of mineral resources, and that is unavoidable. The circular economy has not yet been able to fill that gap,"" Toro added.

In 2023, First Quantum's subsidiary Minera Panamá produced approximately 330,000t/y of copper at the mine plus some gold.

Legal framework

Reactivating Cobre Panamá, and mining activity in general, also requires a legal framework, as law 407 of November 2023 established an indefinite moratorium on metallic mining throughout Panama, prohibiting the granting of new concessions for the exploration, extraction, transportation and processing of minerals; as well as the renewal or extension of existing ones, among other activities.

Attorney Harley Mitchell said during his presentation at the forum that law 407 prohibits new concessions but not all forms of mining. He argued that concessions are only one of the avenues contemplated by the constitution for capitalizing on mineral resources, and mentioned three others: direct management by the State, state companies or joint ventures, and public procurement under transparency criteria, always under the criterion of sustainability.

""The State can profit from its own mineral resources. The point is that the path must be a legal one, an honest one, a shared one, a path that is not invented now, but rather based on pre-existing instruments,"" Mitchell said.

In contrast, lawyer Rodrigo Noriega said it is clear that ""metallic mining is legally prohibited today in Panama."" He said that law 407 does not establish a moratorium, but rather an express prohibition, applicable even to the State itself. ""If the government wants to create a state-owned mining company, it must go through the national assembly. It cannot do so without a law,"" he said.

Official position

At the end of April, President José Raúl Mulino opted for what he called a ""real partnership"" with Minera Panamá, ruling out the signing of another contract law in the event of a potential reactivation of the open-pit Cobre Panamá mine.

""The only option that will not exist is a contract law. I announce it here: there will be no mining contract law. Period. That issue will not be addressed by the assembly, "" Mulino said during an event held by the chamber of commerce, industries and agriculture (CCIAP), the country's main business association.

""We will do whatever it takes to establish something that is a real partnership and that makes it crystal clear that the mine belongs to Panama,"" he added.

Earlier this month, Mulino said a decision on the mine is not imminent. ""Unfortunately, it is a very complicated issue with many facets that we have to rethink,"" he said.

Following protests by former Minera Panamá workers demanding their jobs back, the president said ""they are right"" but added that this decision will be made ""based on the national interest.""",https://cdnimg.bnamericas.com/msLVgmyqAyUHJtwWTTxvbNdPAWKXSGaVNcddhiRVEeMRLSAxkylSKsLLIwiVonMb.jpeg,N,,2025-06-28 13:07:48.041902

The entire amount rounded up goes directly towards the additional purchase of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With this option, Condor is expanding its offering for more responsible travel and responding to the results of a survey conducted by Condor, in which customers expressed a preference for more opportunities to invest smaller amounts in SAF.

After entering the flight and passenger details, guests can select in the payment overview whether they would like to voluntarily round up their payment amount to the next round amount of 10, 20, 50 or 100 euros. This round-up amount will be invested in SAF in the future and Condor will refuel additional quantities of SAF above the legally prescribed minimum amount.

Condor has also been offering a climate contribution since last year. Guests can make a voluntary contribution during or after their booking to support SAF and certified climate protection projects. Those who want to make a future contribution when choosing their fare can consciously opt for the new Green Fare. This can be booked on all routes and in all booking classes. The flight-specific kerosene-related CO₂ emissions of the respective booking class of the flight serve as the basis for the scope of support for climate protection projects and the use of additional SAF.

Condor also supports the aviation industry’s goal of being CO₂-neutral by 2050. Fleet renewal is making a significant contribution to this. Since March 2024, only brand-new A330neo aircraft have been used on Condor’s long-haul routes.

Pima Animal Care Center’s dog kennels are full, with July 4 just a week away. The shelter is offering multiple ways for the community to help be part of the solution for shelter dogs this Fourth of July.

Fireworks can be frightening and overwhelming for pets, particularly dogs. As a result, more pets are lost on July 4 than any other day of the year, and PACC typically takes in 250-300 dogs in the week following the holiday. PACC urges pet owners to prepare now to keep their pets safely indoors during the fireworks and ensure that they are microchipped and wearing an ID tag, both available for free at PACC ahead of the holiday.

“We have a community full of people who absolutely love their furry family members. If you’re one of those, please remember to bring the dog inside in the evenings, even in the run-up to the Fourth of July,” said Steve Kozachik, PACC’s director. “People will be shooting off fireworks ahead of the 4th so plan ahead to protect your pups by bringing them indoors through the holiday.”

The expected influx is especially concerning, as the shelter is already over capacity with more than 500 dogs in the facility. In an effort to create kennel space, PACC is offering a $5 a day stipend to anyone who fosters a dog that weighs 40 pounds or more. The stipend is generously provided by Friends of Pima Animal Care Center, the shelter’s non-profit partner, and will be paid up to 14 days. PACC aims to place 100 large dogs into foster homes before the holiday and will provide food, toys, and calming aids for foster pets.

Dogs and puppies are also currently free to adopt.

For those interested in helping make the holiday more peaceful for shelter pets, PACC is hosting its first Stars, Stripes, and Stories event at the shelter, 4000 N. Silverbell Road, from 6 to 8 p.m. on July 4. This community reading event will allow members of the public of all ages to read to the shelter dogs in an effort to calm them during the noisy celebrations. In addition, dog ice cream shop Bark ‘n’ Berry will be on site serving ice cream to the dogs as a summer treat, sponsored by Tucson Veterinary Urgent Care.

PACC is open on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from noon to 7 p.m., on Wednesday from 1:30 – 7 p.m., and on weekends from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The shelter will be closed to the public on July 4, with the exception of the Stars, Stripes, and Stories event.

Rubi Munoz Castro can tell you exactly when her dream of becoming an aviation technician first took flight.

As a 33-year-old single mother of two young children, Castro was living from paycheck to paycheck and struggling to pay the bills. She wanted to do something more with her life, but she didn’t have any goals for her future.

The answer came from an unexpected place. While working at an aircraft cleaning company, Castro found herself watching how the mechanics worked on the planes. She’d always liked working with her hands, and soon her interest quickened.

“People kept telling me, you can be a mechanic,” she said. “I started hanging around with the mechanics more, and I started learning a bit more. I think it started there.”

Then she came to the Pima County Kino One-Stop Career Center, looking for help getting her Airframe & Powerplant license, which would enable her to work on a plane’s frame and engine.

“I knew they had a lot of good resources,” Castro said. “I fell in with some wonderful instructors that helped me with creating a professional resume.”

The One-Stop Center also helped her apply for the H-1B One Workforce Grant, designed to help unemployed or underemployed workers gain the skills they need to pursue careers in high-demand industries.

“I applied for the H-1B program, and I was accepted the same day,” Castro said.

Pima County was one of the recipients of the grant, which was awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor in January 2021 to public-private partnerships across the country.

Through the grant, the County partnered with Cochise County, Santa Cruz County and Goodwill Industries of Southern Arizona to support training for high-skilled jobs in the aerospace, information technology, advanced manufacturing, and logistics industries.

“Pima County provided job placement assistance and helped participants connect with local employers and secure employment after completing training,” said Byron Christopher, a community and workforce coordinator at Pima County’s Community & Workforce Development Department.

The grant, which provides funding for both testing fees and on-the-job training wages, gave Castro the boost she needed to launch her new career.

Last summer, she began her on-the-job training as an aviation structures technician – also known as a sheet metal technician – at Ascent Aviation. At the same time, she started going to school at Pima Community College to get her certificate in nondestructive testing (NDT), which means testing aircraft components without damaging them.

Working full time and attending classes while raising two kids wasn’t easy, but Castro looked at it as a challenge, not an obstacle.

“I made a lot of sacrifices and had to study harder, stay focused, and remind myself daily of why I was doing this,” she said. “My kids were – and still are – my greatest motivation. I wanted to show them that anything is possible with dedication and heart.”

After completing her certification, Castro was offered a full-time position as an NDT technician at Ascent Aviation.

“That’s when everything began to shift,” she said. “I began growing – not just in my career, but as a person with gaining confidence in my field.”

Now, she spends her days inspecting aircraft to ensure that they are safe, scrutinizing recent repairs for signs of cracks, corrosion, or other damage.

The H-1B One Workforce Grant ends June 30, but Christopher said its legacy will endure through the impact it had on the community – and the individuals who were able to develop important skills and pursue the careers of their choice. Individuals can still get that kind of help at the One-Stop Center, which continues to offer a wide range of employment services and assistance.

As for Castro, her first visit to the One-Stop Center turned out to be only the first stop on her flight to success.

“I’m thinking of continuing my studies further, because growth never stops,” she said. “This journey wasn’t perfect, but it was mine. I’m proud of who I’ve become.”",https://content.civicplus.com/api/assets/964e45a5-0978-4a14-b0a3-11c76f85cbd0?width=32&height=32&mode=crop,N,,2025-06-28 08:02:52.913552

The Senate is awaiting a final cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office to determine the exact savings impact.","Senate prepares for marathon weekend on budget reconciliation bill... The Senate is pressing ahead with plans to take up the sweeping budget reconciliation package, informally dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” as early as this weekend. A motion to proceed could come Saturday, with a marathon “vote-a-rama” session likely starting Sunday and stretching into Monday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and President Donald Trump have both warned Senators that the chamber will not adjourn for the July 4 recess until the bill is passed. While the Senate Ag Committee successfully revised its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provisions to secure approval from the Senate parliamentarian, the bill’s Medicaid savings — totaling up to $290 billion — remain in limbo after being struck down by the parliamentarian. Negotiations on Medicaid language are ongoing. Even if the Senate manages to pass the package by early next week, Republican leaders face further hurdles in the House, where some members have already signaled opposition to accepting the Senate’s version. With razor-thin majorities in both chambers, GOP leadership faces a tough road to final passage.

White House downplays July 9 trade deadline as Trump holds tariff power... The White House signaled the July 9 deadline for trade negotiations is “not critical,” emphasizing President Donald Trump’s authority to unilaterally set tariff rates if U.S. trading partners do not present acceptable agreements. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration has sent “friendly reminders” to dozens of countries to submit their best trade offers before the current tariff pause expires. Leavitt reiterated that negotiations are ongoing and the 90-day suspension of “reciprocal” tariffs — introduced after market volatility in April — remains in effect. She underscored that if partners do not act, the president can “simply provide these countries with a deal,” highlighting Trump’s readiness to impose country-specific tariffs, some as high as 50%, should talks stall. The administration maintains it is on track to secure tailored, beneficial deals, but Leavitt made clear that Trump’s executive authority allows for swift unilateral action if needed. Of note: Trump could still extend the date at which reciprocal tariffs would take effect if no agreements were reached. Stephen Miran, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said the U.S. is prepared to extend tariff deadlines for countries that are negotiating in good faith and making tangible progress in trade talks. As noted, the current self-imposed tariff deadline is July 9, marking the end of a 90-day negotiation window. Miran indicated this deadline is “not critical” and could be pushed back for countries that are sincerely working toward a deal. “You don’t want to jeopardize a deal that is underway and making genuine, sincere strides by imposing a tariff bomb on it,” he said.

EU weighs lower tariffs on U.S. goods to secure Trump trade deal... The European Union is actively considering cutting tariffs on a range of U.S. imports as part of a strategy to quickly clinch a trade deal with President Trump, according to reports. EU leaders met in Brussels on Thursday evening to debate how far they are willing to go to win over the Trump administration, with options including reducing nontariff barriers, increasing purchases of American goods like liquefied natural gas and cooperating with the U.S. on economic concerns about China. The pace of negotiations has accelerated following Trump’s threat in May to impose 50% tariffs on the EU, a move he paused to allow talks to continue until July 9. Many European officials now believe Trump’s 10% baseline tariffs are likely to remain and are seeking product-specific exemptions to limit the economic impact. Germany and Italy are leading a push for a rapid preliminary agreement that could be expanded in future negotiations, focusing especially on relief for industries hardest hit by existing tariffs — such as cars, chemicals, machinery and steel. However, reaching a deal remains politically fraught. Some member states are wary of signing an agreement seen as overly favorable to the U.S., and differences persist over U.S. demands for changes to EU digital and environmental regulations. While the U.S. recently circulated a draft “agreement on reciprocal trade,” EU officials see it as an opening offer rather than a final text, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has insisted the bloc’s sovereign decision-making is “absolutely untouchable.” Despite some progress, significant sticking points remain — particularly over nontariff barriers and the future of sectoral tariffs targeting EU automobile and steel exports. The EU is also preparing potential countermeasures, with an approved package of tariffs targeting $24 billion in U.S. imports and a second list in development that could reach $102 billion if negotiations collapse. Bottom Line: Whether a deal is reached will likely hinge on Trump being able to declare a political victory and EU member states agreeing on the scope and substance of the final compromise.

Senate parliamentarian clears key SNAP and cost-share reforms... The Senate parliamentarian has approved the Ag Committee’s revised provisions for state cost-share and SNAP eligibility for non-citizens, confirming they comply with the Byrd rule and may proceed as part of budget legislation. The updated plan gives states flexibility to use either their fiscal year (FY) 2025 or 2026 payment error rate to determine their cost-share requirement starting in FY 2028, shifting in later years to a rolling formula based on the rate from three years earlier. States with payment error rates above 6% will be required to contribute a set share of SNAP benefit costs, with error rates published annually each June. The reforms aim to incentivize states to improve program accuracy and ensure resources are directed to those most in need. Of note: The Senate Ag Committee’s updated farm bill plan would reduce federal agriculture spending by about $186 billion — most of it from SNAP. This figure is less than the initial $211 billion proposed cut but still far exceeds the committee’s original $1 billion savings target. Meanwhile, the House Ag Committee is pursuing even deeper reductions, totaling $295 billion.

Wizz Air has earned a remarkable distinction by being named the Most Sustainable Low-Cost Airline at the prestigious World Finance Sustainability Awards for five consecutive years. This recognition underscores the airline’s unwavering commitment to sustainability and its ongoing efforts to lead the aviation sector in adopting eco-friendly practices.

The award is a testament to Wizz Air’s consistent global leadership in sustainability. As a key participant in the Alliance for Zero Emission Aviation (AZEA), the airline has been at the forefront of promoting zero-emission aviation technologies and practices. Through its active involvement in initiatives like COP29, Wizz Air has been vocal in advocating for policy changes and technological advancements that can help reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry.

A key pillar of Wizz Air’s sustainability approach is its dedication to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The airline has set an ambitious target to ensure that 10 percent of its flights are fueled by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. This initiative is crucial for minimizing aviation’s environmental impact, as SAF serves as a highly effective alternative to traditional jet fuel, significantly lowering carbon emissions. Beyond its SAF initiatives, Wizz Air has also embraced a range of operational practices designed to further reduce its environmental footprint. These include the use of single-engine taxiing to improve fuel efficiency and the incorporation of electric ground power to cut down on emissions from airport operations.

The airline’s approach to sustainability is deeply integrated into its operational model. Wizz Air has prioritized fuel efficiency across its fleet and continuously invests in modern, fuel-efficient aircraft. This includes the widespread use of the Airbus A321neo, an aircraft known for its superior fuel efficiency and lower carbon emissions compared to older models. At present, 61 percent of Wizz Air’s fleet is made up of A321neo aircraft, with the remainder of its fleet also comprising relatively new planes, resulting in an average fleet age of only 4.7 years. This younger fleet plays a significant role in reducing the airline’s overall carbon emissions.

Wizz Air’s sustainability efforts have also extended beyond its operations to influence the wider aviation ecosystem. The airline believes that achieving net-zero emissions in aviation requires collaboration across various sectors, including policymakers, fuel producers, and the aviation industry as a whole. Wizz Air has been a strong advocate for innovation in the sector, and its recently launched Net Zero Roadmap outlines the steps the airline plans to take in its journey towards achieving net-zero emissions. The roadmap emphasizes the importance of technology development, such as the ongoing advancements in electric and hybrid propulsion systems, and the scaling up of SAF production.

In terms of carbon emissions, Wizz Air has set an impressive benchmark for the industry. In 2024, the airline achieved the lowest carbon emissions per passenger kilometre, recording just 52 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometre. This figure positions Wizz Air as a leader in sustainable air travel, showcasing the effectiveness of its fleet renewal strategy and its commitment to maintaining one of the most fuel-efficient fleets in the world.

A major factor behind this achievement is the airline’s strategic emphasis on fleet modernization. By utilizing fuel-efficient aircraft such as the A321neo, Wizz Air has made significant strides in reducing its environmental footprint. This is complemented by the airline’s operational efficiencies, including optimized flight paths and advanced fuel management techniques. Additionally, Wizz Air’s average fleet age of 4.7 years plays a crucial role in maintaining low emissions per passenger kilometre, as newer aircraft tend to be more fuel-efficient and produce fewer emissions.

Wizz Air’s continuous sustainability efforts are integral to its larger commitment to environmental stewardship. As part of its long-term strategy, the airline continues to invest in cutting-edge technologies and operational practices that drive sustainability across every facet of its business. Wizz Air’s efforts to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 are ambitious but achievable, given the airline’s current trajectory and its strong focus on innovation.

The airline’s leadership in sustainability has not gone unnoticed. With a robust set of measures in place to reduce its environmental impact, Wizz Air is setting an example for other airlines to follow. By continually investing in sustainable technologies, advocating for policy change, and driving innovation within the aviation industry, Wizz Air is playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of air travel, making it more sustainable, and aligning itself with global goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The use of plant oil to power cars, accompanied by the distinct French fry smell. But what if pig excrement were used instead? Would you fly in a pig-poo powered plane?

Currently, the process of creating jet fuel from pig poop eliminates the smell associated with the waste from pigs. The goal is to use carbon-based organic matter, of which Earth has excessive amounts. While pig poop may seem like an unusual option, small studies have proven it to contain all the necessary components to create a synthetic aviation fuel. Consequently, pigs may prove to be the key needed to help decrease greenhouse gases caused by plane travel in the upcoming years.

Yes, Pig Poop Is Being Transformed Into Synthetic Aviation Fuel

Today, planes are powered by specialized petroleum-based fuel. Not only is the fuel expensive, but it is also harmful to the planet. As a result, alternatives have been explored for years. One of the most promising appeared to be plant-based oils. However, using plants to make fuel competes with the world’s food supply. Consequently, plant-based oils may not be able to create enough jet fuel to be a sustainable option.

One thing that there is a never-ending supply of is pig poop. The waste has been used in some countries as biofuel. But now, that excrement can be transformed into aviation fuel, reducing the waste on Earth and decreasing carbon dioxide and other byproducts that have led to the global warming crisis in recent decades.

The U.S. Department of Defense has sponsored a grant via BioMADE, a Manufacturing Innovation Institute, to create jet fuel from pig fecal matter. The $600,000 project is being spearheaded by Prathap Parameswaran, recipient of the Fornelli Engineering Professorship and associate professor of civil engineering at Kansas State University’s Carl R. Ice College of Engineering. Parameswaran will be working with both Iowa State University and the Quasar Energy Group to bring the concept of turning pig poop into aviation fuel to reality.

“Synthetic aviation fuels are a strategic resource for the U.S. Department of Defense,” Parameswaran explains to K-State Today. “While there are other ways to turn waste into fuel, many rely on federal incentives or are inefficient. The use of anaerobic membrane reactors shows real potential as a promising platform; it just needs to be piloted effectively.”

Turning pig waste into jet fuel on a large scale, theoretically, would have an incredibly positive impact on the planet. But just how is this feat going to be accomplished?

How Pig Poop Is Transformed Into Synthetic Aviation Fuel

The process of turning pig poop into aviation fuel relies on the use of anaerobic membrane reactors. The anaerobic membrane reactors are the same as those used in wastewater treatment plants to break down waste. In those cases, the organic matter is converted into biogas. In the case of pig excrement, however, the organic matter is being turned into jet fuel instead.

Before being turned into synthetic aviation fuel, the waste is “separated and purified.” It is then that the organic matter begins the process of being transformed via “ketonization and hydrodeoxygenation.” According to Parameswaran, the goal of the current study is to prove that the anaerobic membrane reactors will work in the way they are believed to, which could lead to a major transformation in the fuel used to fly aircraft in the near future.

“Our role in this project is to validate the use of anaerobic membrane reactors as a platform for transforming these waste products, including fats, oils and greases, into biomanufactured aviation fuel precursors,” Parameswaran explains to K-State Today. “We are essentially running pilot-scale production of this novel technology, while conducting the vital research and development to validate its versatility and scalability.”

Turning the excess organic matter found around the globe into fuel is not only a novel concept but also necessary for the future of the planet. This is why many have been toying with the concept for years and are now taking it seriously to reach a goal that is only a few years away.

Why Synthetic Aviation Fuel Is Being Produced

Synthetic aviation fuel is being created in response to the Sustainable Fuel Grand Challenge. The challenge has set out to decrease the amount of “conventional” aviation fuel significantly by 2030 and to meet 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand with sustainable alternatives by 2050.

To meet this challenge, the following standards need to be met:

A minimum of a 50% reduction in life cycle emissions compared to conventional fuel

3 billion gallons per year of domestic sustainable aviation fuel by 2030

35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel to satisfy 100% of domestic demand by 2050

The problem with creating synthetic aviation fuel in the past was that there was not the right combination or correct percentage of essential hydrocarbons. But thanks to using pig poop and other substances, it appears that scientists are on the right track to meeting their goal within the next five years.

Other Substances Being Used To Create Synthetic Aviation Fuel

It is not only pig waste that is being considered to create aviation fuel. Human waste has been making headlines for the last several years as an alternative to traditional aviation fuel as well.

Scientists from the United Kingdom’s Firefly, a green company spin-off from Green Fuels, has created jet fuel from human poop. The fuel, which to date has only been made in small batches, has been proven to create a 90% smaller footprint than the fuel used to fly planes currently.

The company plans to produce synthetic fuel on a larger scale once an application for the “fuel qualification process” is approved. The goal is to have a facility operational before 2030, producing over 10 million gallons of synthetic jet fuel annually.

Another substance being considered to create synthetic aviation fuel is plastic. If this were to come to fruition, it would be a huge step in not only decreasing carbon emIf this were to come to fruition, it would be a huge step in not only decreasing carbon emissions but also reducing the amount of plastic found in landfills.

Polystyrene is the plastic being used in studies to create a synthetic aviation fuel. Created nearly 95 years ago, the flexible plastic is one that many recognize on prepackaged foods. While the plastic can be recycled, there is no excellent way to separate it from the larger plastics that can also be recycled. Consequently, it winds up in landfills, waiting to biodegrade for hundreds of years.

Scientists from the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center, part of the Prairie Research Institute at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, have discovered a method to convert the 2.5 million metric tons of polystyrene disposed of in landfills annually into aromatic hydrocarbons, a key component of traditional aviation fuel. This not only reduces carbon emissions from aviation fuel but has also proven to be a cheaper method of producing it.

By utilizing both organic products and plastics, it may be possible to realistically meet the Sustainable Fuel Grand Challenge by 2030. If this is done, it will be a significant step forward in reducing carbon emissions and making the planet a healthier place, while still maintaining the current level of aviation travel.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/a_z_animals_articles_974/6727dc55e29ed29616d13c7a1c589a77,N,,2025-06-27 20:01:25.918939

Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, said in a statement that the court's decision was a ""meaningful win"" for farmers.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- A federal court vacated a 2024 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule the Texas Corn Producers, Texas Sorghum Producers and the National Sorghum producers contend unfairly penalized ethanol in federal fuel-economy calculations.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sided with the ag groups this week, ruling against EPA's use of an ""Ra factor"" when certifying fuel economy in newer vehicles. The Biden administration implemented the factor for E10 gasoline in 2024, which replaced the use of E0 in testing with E10. The court found the value set for E10 was ""arbitrarily low"" and penalized ethanol.

The nature of test fuels is important because it affects measured fuel-economy values, essentially determining whether automakers meet fuel-economy standards.

The ag groups argued the EPA's use of a 0.81 factor undervalued ethanol's contribution to fuel economy. The groups contend that a factor closer to 1 was more accurate.

A low Ra factor for ethanol essentially pushed automakers to adopt more electric-vehicle and higher-efficiency engine technologies, rather than using ethanol to comply with the standards.

""EPA's Ra Rule is unreasonable and unreasonably explained,"" the Fifth Circuit said in its ruling. ""The agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act by ignoring comments that flagged flaws in EPA's determination of the Ra factor. We therefore grant the petition for review and vacate the challenged portion of the Ra rule.""

The court also took the agency to task for not considering public and industry input in conducting a rulemaking.

""EPA offered zero response to extensive comments about the test program's insufficient sample size,"" the Fifth Circuit said. ""That is fatal to the rule because those comments, 'if true and adopted,' would require a change to the rule.""

The court criticized EPA's ""half-hearted defense"" of the rule as ""lipstick on a pig,"" concluding the agency ""identifies no evidence to support (its) 'trust-us-we're-the-experts' response.""

Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, said in a statement that the court's decision was a ""meaningful win"" for farmers.

""The court's ruling restores fairness and transparency to how ethanol is treated in fuel economy rules and holds the government accountable to sound science,"" he said.

David Gibson, executive director of the Texas Corn Producers, said ethanol should be considered by the EPA as a solution to clean air.

""This ruling ensures ethanol isn't penalized by flawed methodology and it gives the current EPA administration a fresh opportunity to get this right,"" Gibson said.

Wayne Cleveland, executive director of Texas Sorghum Producers, said the court ""affirmed what growers have long said, that the science matters and so does the way agencies engage with it.""

Food waste is an underdeveloped source for production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Now, there is no certified conversion process of food waste for SAF by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). We report the use of zeolite-supported molybdenum carbide nanocatalysts in upgrading biocrudes, produced from food wastes through HTL, into SAF precursors. Our data show a complete removal of oxygen from the biocrude through hydrodeoxygenation and a higher heating value of 46.5 MJ/kg, which is comparable to that of Jet A (46.1 MJ/kg). The prescreening tests (tier alpha and beta) show the average carbon number of the distillation cut (150° to 230°C) of upgraded fuel is 10.6, close to the value of 11.4 for average conventional jet fuel, and the specifications of properties including surface tension, viscosity, heating value, flash point, and freezing point were found to meet the standards of SAF. The metal carbide nanocatalysts were reusable in upgrading tests, and the activity of deoxygenation was retained.

INTRODUCTION

Large-scale production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) (1, 2) from wet wastes is crucial to achieve the target of reaching net zero carbon emission by 2050 (3). This is because SAF has less safety concern than other alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen and has a volumetric energy density (34 MJ/liter) 4.0 to 6.9 times higher than hydrogen. Thus, SAF has been considered the only net zero mechanism for long-haul wide-body aircrafts over the next several decades (4). In addition, SAFs are drop-in compatible with all existing infrastructure and aircraft. Therefore, the existing extensive infrastructure in aviation and their current regulatory compliance can be leveraged under the aviation decarbonization strategy with SAFs.

Triglyceride, lignocellulosic biomass, and sugar/starch are three typical sources for SAF production (5). While lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock is cheaper than the other two, it requires expensive and complicated processing (6, 7). Sugar including starch is mainly used for generating light fuels consisting of short carbon chain components and requires multistep conversions, including fermentation (to produce alcohols), dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation (8). Catalytic hydrotreating of triglyceride feedstock, on the other hand, can be a relatively simple approach, in which hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), hydroisomerization, and hydrocracking can simultaneously take place (9). Other than the benefit of facile processing, using triglyceride-based wet waste as feedstock also increases energy recovery (10, 11), valorizes unwanted bioresources, and alleviates water contamination caused by organic substances (12).

A major class of biocrude oil is made from triglyceride-based wet wastes through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) (9, 13–15) and will be used in this study for upgrading to SAFs. A standard set of specifications derived from conventional fuels has been established to prescreen if an upgraded product is suitable as SAF precursor (16). An important criterion is, unlike diesel fuel, a SAF precursor should not contain oxygen, which must be removed to prevent corrosion of jet engine by oxygen-containing compounds such as organic acids. Oxygen also adversely increases density and viscosity of a biocrude oil. The optimal number of carbons in hydrocarbons for aviation fuel, which affects the flash and freezing point of a fuel, is typically in the range of C8 to C16. The preferred jet fuel consists of oxygen-free organics of paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes, and aromatics (17). Higher heating value (HHV), which can be estimated by elemental (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen) contents of a fuel, is another key parameter and should be close to that of Jet A. In short, it is essential to develop scalable and highly reactive catalysts and to demonstrate their use in the production of SAF precursors using real biocrude based on the studies using model compounds (18, 19).

Transition metal carbides (TMCs), such as beta phase molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C), have unique catalytic properties because of their platinum-like electronic structures (20, 21). Recently, β-Mo2C catalysts were shown to exhibit HDO activity comparable to platinum and palladium using model compounds such as oleic acid and guaiacol (18, 22–24). Both metal-like hydrogen adsorption sites and Brønsted acid hydroxyl sites on β-Mo2C surface were thought to be beneficial to the HDO reaction (24, 25). These carbide catalysts also resist poisoning and corrosion from impurities under harsh conditions using model compounds (22–24, 26, 27). While these studies are extremely useful, model reactions are far from sufficient to evaluate the suitability of wet waste–derived biocrude for SAF because the complexity in composition of biocrude oil cannot be replicated by model compounds (22, 23). In addition, using model compounds one cannot evaluate the whole ranges of specifications of the fuel, including viscosity, freezing point, flash points, to name a few (28). Hydrodeoxygenation of HTL biocrude oil from food waste has been demonstrated using alumina-supported metal alloy catalysts, including CoMo and NiMo. Sulfided CoMo/Al2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts were used previously to produce SAF from HTL biocrudes of food waste at 400°C, 1500 psi, and 0.5-hour−1 weight hour space velocity (13). The upgraded biocrude achieved 93% deoxygenation using CoMo catalysts and 91% using NiMo catalysts, increasing to 98% after taking the jet fuel cut. In addition, a two-stage hydrotreating approach using CoMo for demetallization and mild hydrotreating, followed by NiMo for more severe hydrotreating, achieved 97% deoxygenation of HTL biocrude from food waste, producing a diesel-rich product (9). Thus, investigation of Mo2C-based nanocatalysts in the upgrading of real biocrude oil is much needed to establish the proper processing pathways to the SAF production from wet waste–derived biocrudes (29, 30).

Herewith we report the use of zeolite-supported iron–β-Mo2C nanocatalysts in the upgrading of real biocrude oil, derived from wet food waste by HTL, to a SAF precursor that meets all essential criteria in the FAA standard tier beta test. In our approach, β-Mo2C nanocatalysts were dispersed onto zeolite supports (25, 31, 32) to enhance the catalyst dispersion, thus giving rise to a high HDO activity (19). Zeolite Socony Mobil–5 (ZSM-5) was chosen as the catalyst support for its capability to dispersing molybdenum carbide (25) and to produce high aromatic yields with low coke formation (33). Iron (Fe) was used as the cocatalyst and incorporated into the metal carbide to promote cracking (34–38). Previously, Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were reported to exhibit good cracking performance and a Fe loading amount as low as 5 weight % (wt %) could be sufficient to modify the overall acidity (37). The 3-nm Fe-containing β-Mo2C nanoparticle catalyst on ZSM-5 (Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5) was synthesized via carburization method at 600°C. This catalyst exhibited excellent HDO activity, resulting in complete removal of oxygen from the biofuel and an increase in hydrogen-to-carbon atomic (H/C) ratio to 1.96. Tier beta test indicates upgraded biocrude oil satisfied all key specifications of SAF prescreening standards, including surface tension (at 22°C), density (at 15°C), viscosity (at −20° and −40°C), lower heating value (LHV), flash point, and freezing point. In this context, we successfully produced 100% SAF precursors from food waste–derived biocrude oils using non-noble metal nanocatalysts.

RESULTS

Compositional and structural characterization of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5

The Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst was synthesized at 600°C via the carburization method. For safety consideration, freshly made Mo2C catalyst was passivated using 2% O2 in the tube furnace before the characterizations and subsequent catalytic studies (see Materials and Methods for detail). The atomic ratio of Fe to Mo in the precursor is 5%. The stated amount of Fe cocatalyst was chosen on the basis of the prior study, in which 5 wt % on ZSM-5 provided the suited acidity for cracking with low coking effect (25, 33–38). Our experience study indicates a temperature of 600°C or above was required to produce Mo2C. Inductively coupled plasma optical atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) shows the catalyst contains 1.30 wt % Fe and 41.9 wt % Mo, which is close to the nominal amount of 1.26 wt % Fe and 43.1 wt % Mo in the reactant mixture (table S1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) study indicates the as-made catalyst consists of phase-pure β-Mo2C on ZSM-5, with no diffraction from Fe-containing species (Fig. 1A). Mo2C nanocatalyst without Fe was made following the same synthetic procedure except without the addition of iron (III) nitrate. This Fe-free sample exhibits enhanced crystallinity of Mo2C, judging by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and peak intensity (Fig. 1A). The addition of Fe effectively reduced the crystal domain size of Mo2C. The FWHM and positions of XRD peaks for ZSM-5 are similar in the three samples, suggesting no major change in zeolite structure. This structural stability is beneficial for the dispersion of metal precursors and the formation of metal carbide nanoparticle catalysts (25, 39). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) study shows the ZSM-5 particles have an average size of ~2 μm, which are made of aggregates of ~200-nm crystallites (fig. S1). This hierarchical morphology retained for Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts (fig. S2).

The Mo2C nanoparticle catalysts were further examined by both SEM (Fig. 1B) and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. 1C). The microscopic data show that the size of catalyst particles can be as large as ~30 nm, although the primary nanoparticles are only a few nanometers in size. The XRD Rietveld refinement data indicate the crystal domain size is about 3.0 nm (fig. S3 and table S2). The small sub–5-nm Mo2C crystallites were observed to disperse evenly over the ZSM-5 support, judging by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and STEM micrographs (figs. S4 and S5). The fast Fourier transform analysis indicates the lattice observed in HAADF-STEM has a d-spacing of 0.27 nm, which correspond to Mo2C (100) and of 0.22 nm to the (101) facet (Fig. 1C and fig. S6). These results show the carburization could successfully produce carbide nanoparticles with size optimal for catalysis, which is advantageous over the commercial Mo2C (figs. S7 and S8). STEM energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) shows both Fe and Mo elements are dispersed uniformly across the catalyst particles. (Fig. 1D and fig. S9).

Upgrading and characterization of biocrude oil

The upgrading of biocrude oil was performed using a Parr reactor as illustrated in Fig. 2A. The biocrude oil derived from the HTL process was mixed with freshly prepared Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst at a catalyst/biocrude mass ratio of 6:100. All catalytic upgrading was conducted at 400°C in pressurized H2 for 2 hours, unless otherwise stated. Elemental analysis data indicate the oxygen content in the oil decreased from 6.74 to ~0 wt % after the upgrading using Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5, showing a complete deoxygenation (Fig. 2B and table S3). After the hydrodeoxygenation process, 6.6 ml (or 4.8 g) of SAF precursor could be obtained from 10 ml of the biocrude oil (density: 0.857 g/ml). This result corresponds to a conversion of about 56 wt % from pretreat biocrude to SAF precursor, similar to the conversion to hydrocarbon from volatile fatty acids derived from the biobased chemicals through the anaerobic digestion (40). The hydrogen content increased from 12.26 to 14.08 wt %, corresponding to an increase of HHV from 41.80 to 46.51 MJ/kg, which is comparable to that of Jet A (table S4). The substantial improvement in oil quality could also be readily observed from the color change of oils before and after the treatment (fig. S10). To understand the effects of processing variables such as temperature and hydrogen pressure, we conducted upgrading experiments in the absence of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst while keeping all other conditions the same. The oxygen content decreased to 1.70 wt %, which was equal to about 75% of deoxygenation. The hydrogen content of oil, however, only slightly increased to 13.0 wt %. We analyzed the H/C ratio of the upgraded oil, which is a measure of the degree of saturation of organic compounds after the catalytic hydrogenation. Our results show after the treatment by Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst, the oil product exhibited an H/C ratio of 1.96, much higher than that of 1.82 if no catalyst was used. Noticeably, the upgraded oil exhibited the H/C ratio, thus the heating value, comparable to that of Jet A. The oil produced after treatment with commercial Mo2C, however, shows no improvement or even worse than the raw biocrude oil in H/C ratio and oxygen content, with 9.8 wt % O and 12.0 wt % H. Our study shows the nanometer-sized Mo2C particle and zeolite/Fe compositions in the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts are necessary to achieve high HDO activity.

We further investigated the distribution of boiling point of the upgraded oils by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (fig. S11A). The weight percentage of upgraded oil after treatment using the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 nanocatalysts are preferably in the low-temperature regions, with decreased distribution in temperature range above 250°C, as contrast to those treated without catalyst or with the commercial Mo2C (fig. S11B). The weight distribution heatmaps of different oils were obtained by calculating the integral of percentage weight over different temperature ranges (Fig. 2C and table S5). A decrease of weight distribution was observed in the range of 250° to 300°C for all oil samples after the catalytic treatment. This result suggests long carbon chain substances in the oils were cracked in pressurized H2 at 400°C. Weight distribution above 350°C slightly increases for upgraded oils using no catalyst or the commercial Mo2C, which could be caused by the polymerization reaction during upgrading. These two oil products also exhibit relatively uniform weight distributions across 100° to 300°C, while the upgraded oil using the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the predominant fraction is in the temperature range of 150° to 250°C. Because the wet waste–derived biocrude oil is composed of a mixture of different components, an overall weight distribution towards the lighter range increases the percentage of distillation cut that meets the SAF standards (table S6). In a different classification (fig. S11C), our catalytic treatment could upgrade the “diesel-like” raw biocrude oils into “kerosene/gasoline-like” fuels, noting the property of Jet A is regarded as gasoline-like (41).

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was carried out to study the distribution of molecular weight of compounds in various oils (fig. S12 and table S7), which is directly related to the length of carbon chains. An interval of 100 Da was used in our calculation of the number-weighed molecular weight (Fig. 2D). The molecular weight distribution between 100 and 300 Da was given special attention, since carbon chains in the range of C8 to C16 are preferred for SAFs. In the raw biocrude oil, a total of 25.9 wt % was found to locate in this range of molecular weight distribution, while 8.0 and 22.9 wt % were found for the oil products after treatments without the catalyst and with commercial Mo2C, respectively. After the treatment with Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst, 59.4 wt % of the upgraded oil was found in this molecular weight distribution, which is comparable to that of Jet A (62.1 wt %). The upgraded oil has lower molecular weights in all intervals above 300 Da. Table S7 summarizes the number-averaged molecular weights (Mn) and mass-averaged molecular weights (Mm) of all oils tested. Upgraded oil using the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst has a Mn of 254 Da, which is comparable with that of Jet A (242 Da) and much lower than those of raw biocrude oil (404 Da) and the oil product obtained using the other catalysts (522 and 389 Da). The substantial reduction in molecular weight results in the change in density of the oils after the upgrading treatments (table S8). Among all oils tested, raw biocrude oil has the highest density of 0.853 g/ml, and the upgraded oil using Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 has the lowest density of 0.783 g/ml.

Prescreening results as a SAF precursor

The property of hydrocarbon in the product was analyzed on the full distillate range fuel using two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) using the standard methods described elsewhere (Fig. 3A) (42). The full distillate of upgraded biocrude oil ranges from C5 to C21, with an average carbon number of 11.2 close to that of the conventional jet fuel (11.4), and exhibits a bimodal distribution peaked around C8 and C18, consisting of n- and iso-alkanes (69.7%), cycloalkanes (21.5%), and aromatics (8.8%). While the average carbon number is similar to that of jet fuel, the bimodal carbon distribution needs further treatment to pass the ASTM D4054 evaluation. Thus, it is pragmatic to extract the most suitable fraction of the upgraded oil for SAF certification tests.

We obtained the target fraction from the full range biocrude oil by performing distillation, which was executed from 150° to 230°C, focusing on meeting the flash point and freezing point specification limits of the final fuel because these two properties are crucial to address aviation safety issues (43). The front end of distillation is determined to be 150°C, matching that of the conventional jet fuel to ensure a comparable flash point. The back end of the distillation, however, is truncated at 230°C, instead of 260°C for jet fuel, due to the concentrated n-alkanes in the obtained biocrude oil. Freezing point of fuels is typically dominated by molecules having the highest freezing points in oil (44), normally the heaviest hydrocarbon species. Higher carbon number n-alkanes generally have higher freezing points than their isomerized counterparts. The inclusion of C14 to C16 components in the SAF cut is detrimental to the increase of freezing point. Thus, we reduced the back end of the distillation range to ensure a proper freezing point. The yield of SAF precursors from the temperature range of 150° to 230°C is ~15 wt %.

Figure 3B illustrates the analysis of hydrocarbon types of the distilled SAF precursor. The average carbon number of the SAF fraction is 10.6 compared to 11.4 for conventional jet fuel. Compared to the full range oil, the SAF precursor has higher contents of cycloalkanes (25.4%) and aromatics (12.1%), with a distribution peaked around C10. Tier beta prescreening was conducted on the distilled SAF fraction, evaluating properties such as surface tension, density, kinematic viscosity, LHV, flash point, freezing point, and distillation curve. The derived cetane number (DCN) is predicted from estimation due to the volume limitation. These properties are critical for combustor figures of merits and operability limits (17). Aligning the SAF precursor within the specification limit can mitigate risks at the earliest stage of conversion technology development. As shown in Fig. 3C, our SAF fraction demonstrated excellent surface tension, smaller than 24 mN/m at 22°C, which is better than the experience range of conventional jet fuel. The viscosity at −20° and −40°C also outperformed the conventional jet fuel. The density of obtained SAF precursor is relatively low compared with the conventional fuel but still within the acceptable range. Low values in these properties enhance combustor operability limits and are attributed to the cutoff point of 230°C, which excludes heavier fractions (>C14). Energy density of this oil is much higher than the other cuts, as suggested by the LHV ~43.50 MJ/kg, which can be attributed to the high concentration of n- and iso-alkanes. The flash point of SAF precursor is well fitted within the experience range, suggesting a close resemblance with conventional jet fuel regarding the light components. The freezing point is superior because of the approach of excluding >C14 substances. Thus, an optimal distillation range was identified for this fuel to achieve a balance between SAF yield and control of specific properties, such as freezing point. Tier alpha property predictions indicate a high DCN value for the SAF fraction, which could result from the richness of n- and iso-alkane content. Overall, the obtained distillate cut reached the threshold for key physical properties set for SAF, indicating that Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 is an appropriate catalyst for converting food waste–derived biocrude oil to high-quality SAF product, and other conversion pathway and processing protocol need to be further developed.

Figure 3C summarizes the results of an overall assessment performed by evaluating the distillation curve, which contrasts against that of the conventional jet fuel. Our SAF precursor falls in the experience range up to ~60 wt %, with the heavy section slightly deviating from the target due to the lack of C14 to C16 components in the distillate to meet the freezing point specification, which is related to the high concentration of n-alkane (52.2%). From an economic perspective, the current conversion pathway is attractive because besides the SAF precursor, the C4 to C8 cut can be used for gasoline and the C14 to C21 cut as biodiesel. Heavier fraction (C22 and above) in the biocrude can be upgraded for marine fuel or lubricant. We noted that a multistep approach was previously developed using methane as a feedstock to produce n-paraffin SAF designed as a 10 vol % blend (40). In that process, instead of directly upgrading biocrude, methane was converted into mixed volatile C2 to C8 fatty acids (VFAs) via anaerobic digestion. Ketonization over ZrO2 and hydrodeoxygenation over Pt/Al2O3 were then carried out to convert the wet waste–derived VFAs into normal paraffins.

Compositional and structural stability of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst

We investigated the stability of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 by reusing this catalyst for multiple runs (Fig. 4A). In a standard test, after the reaction, the solids including catalyst were separated from the upgraded oil by centrifugation, washed by acetone, and dried at 80°C in a vacuum oven. The Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 after the first upgrading test, which is denoted as Cat-1, was collected and separated from the upgraded oil (i.e., Oil-1) and used as the catalyst for the second upgrading. No reactivation of catalyst was needed, and all reaction conditions were kept the same for all the catalytic upgrading study (Fig. 4A). Figure 4B shows the HDO activity of reused Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts by analyzing the elemental contents of three upgraded oils. No oxygen was detected in all three upgraded oils, suggesting ~100% deoxygenation efficiency (table S9). The hydrogen content of upgraded oils decreased slightly from 14.08 wt % (Oil-1) to 13.74 wt % for Oil-2 and 13.85 wt % for Oil-3. The H/C molar ratio changed from 1.96 (Oil-1) to 1.90 for Oil-2 and 1.90 for Oil-3. The reused Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts (Cat-1 and Cat-2) were still active to produce upgraded oils with the HHV that is comparable to Jet A (~ 46.10 MJ/kg; table S4). Elemental analysis results indicate density of the three upgraded oils is consistent (0.779 to 0.783 g/ml; table S10). Both Oil-2 and Oil-3 exhibited higher carbon content. TGA results show the boiling point distributions for all thee upgraded oils are concentration in the range of 150° to 250°C (Fig. 4C; figs. S13, A and B; and table S11).

XRD and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to examine the structures of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst after each run of upgrading of biocrude oils. The XRD study shows β-Mo2C and ZSM-5 phases retained for all reused Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts (i.e., Cat-1, Cat-2, and Cat-3) and no identifiable coke formed (fig. S14). The morphology and particle size of post-upgrading Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts did not show major difference from that of the freshly prepared (fig. S15). Rietveld refinement analysis indicates the average size of Mo2C nanoparticles remained to be in the range of sub–3 nm (fig. S16 and table S12), which were also observed in the high-resolution electron microscopic images (fig. S17). Surface composition of the reused catalyst was investigated by comparing the valence state of Mo and C based on the XPS study (fig. S18 and table S13). The intensity of Mo(II) peaks for Cat-1 at 231.8 eV (3d3/2) and 228.6 eV (3d5/2) is comparable to that of fresh catalyst. Carbon peaks in the carbides were observed for both Cat-1 and fresh catalysts and no detectable change of surface Mo2C nanoparticles after the upgrading run, indicating good structural and compositional stability.

The XPS Fe 2p data show Fe2+ or Fe3+ 2p1/2 (~724 eV) and 2p3/2 (~710 eV) signals appeared in the Cat-1 sample besides the Fe0 2p3/2 (~707 eV) in the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 (fig. S18) (45, 46). This observation indicates the nanocatalysts could be oxidized either during or after the upgrading process, suggesting that the structures of Fe species might change in the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5. We also performed TGA analysis of fresh Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 and Cat-1 to further study coke formation (fig S19). The mass loss curves for both samples show comparable curves in terms of the weight loss in the entire temperature range. In the temperature range between 270° and 400°C, Cat-1 exhibits larger derivative in weight gain than that of the fresh catalyst. These data suggest the oxidizable species in Cat-1 such as carbide and iron could take up oxygen faster than the freshly made catalysts, in agreement with the XPS Fe 2p data. Nevertheless, the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst is readily reusable for oil upgrading, suggesting that the highly reducing condition of hydrodeoxygenation reaction is highly tolerable of initial structure changes, and catalysts can be regenerated in situ during the process.

DISCUSSION

This work demonstrates the feasibility of catalytic upgrading of wet waste–derived biocrude oil into SAF precursors using zeolite-supported Mo2C nanocatalyst. We found that Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited excellent HDO activity to fully deoxygenate the biocrude oil produced from HTL process. We achieved a yield of 56 wt % for SAF precursor from pretreated biocrude, equivalent to a food waste to SAF production yield of 23 wt %, based on a yield of 59 wt % from food waste to biocrude and a loss of 30 wt % during the pretreatment of biocrude (47–49). The upgrade oil exhibits the HHV over 46.10 MJ/kg comparable to Jet A. This high performance can be attributed to the nanometer-sized Mo2C catalyst on Bronsted acid–based zeolitic supports, which remain compositionally and structurally stable in the stability tests. This work develops low-cost metal carbide catalysts and demonstrates their potential in converting biocrude oils, oleochemical-based fermentation products, and crop residue-derived biomass into SAF candidates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chemical and materials

Ammonium molybdate (para) tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 99%, A13766] and the reference beta-phase molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C, 99.5% metals basis, 012192.36) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate ( ≥98%; ACS reagent, 216828) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Zeolite ZSM-5 (ammonium, 045880.22) and quartz wool (fine, 4 μm; 451040100) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Methane [ultra-high purity (UHP)], hydrogen (UHP), argon (UHP), compressed air (breathing quality grade), and nitrogen were purchased from Airgas. Acetone (ACS grade, A18-4) was purchased from Fisher Chemical. Jet A sample was obtained from a local airport. Biocrude oil was produced from HTL via our laboratory-made continuous plug-flow pilot reactor using food waste as feedstock, as detailed in previous work (47–49). In summary, salad dressing waste (62% lipid, 30% carbohydrate, 2% protein, and 6% ash) was obtained from a local food processing plant and homogenized to a solids content of 20 wt %. The food waste was converted at 300°C and 11 MPa, with a retention time of 20 min, yielding 59 wt % biocrude by mass. Before upgrading, the HTL biocrude oil was washed and distilled to remove salt (mainly Na and K), excess water, and ash. In all experiments, deionized (DI) water (resistivity of 18.25 MΩ·cm at room temperature, Millipore) was used.

Synthesis of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5

The metal precursor was prepared via the wet impregnation method. In a 100-ml flask, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (171.6 mg), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (1.5 g), and ZSM-5 (1.0 g) were added to 20 ml of DI water. The mixture was heated at 80°C (250 rpm) for 8 hours in an oil bath using a hotplate stirrer (VWR 7x7 Ceramic Hotplate Stirrer, 97042-714). After water evaporated, the remaining mixture was further dried at 80°C in a vacuum oven (VWR Symphony Vacuum Oven, catalog no. 414004-582) overnight. The dried solids were collected and ground into a fine powder. The powder precursor (1.0 g) was loaded into a quartz tube, which was placed inside a vertical furnace. Quartz wool was used as a support for the powder precursor in a vertically placed tube. After the assembly, the quartz tube was purged with a flowing gas mixture of CH4/H2 (flow rate ratio: 8/32, 40 sccm in total). The subsequent carburization step was programmed to firstly reach 300°C at a rate of 4°C/min and then to 600°C at 1°C/min. The temperature was then kept at 600°C for 2 hours. After the furnace was naturally cooled to room temperature, the quartz tube was purged by N2 for 10 min (90 sccm). The N2-protected solids were carefully transferred from the quartz tube to a test tube (length > 10 cm) filled with Ar to avoid exposure of catalyst to air. The test tube was then sealed with Parafilm for future usage in oil upgrading. The time of storage was typically <24 hours. Considering the pyrophoric nature of metal carbide nanoparticles, we synthesized the catalyst right before the upgrading tests. For material characterization, the as-made catalysts were passivated in 2% O2 (a mixture of 10 sccm compressed air and 90 sccm N2) for 1 hour after the purge by N2 in the furnace for 10 min. The sample can be safely removed from the quartz tube. [Caution: Freshly made molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are highly reactive if they are not passivated and ignite upon their exposure to ambient air.]

Structural and compositional characterization of catalysts

XRD patterns were obtained using Rigaku Miniflex 600 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα x-ray source (λ =1.54056 Å). The size analysis based on XRD patterns were conducted using a profile fitting software, TOPAS, provided by Bruker Corporation. This software was used to obtain the volume-weighted mean crystallite sizes (LVol-IB) calculated from Scherrer equation based on Rietveld refinement results. SEM images were obtained from Hitachi S-4800 SEM. TEM micrographs were from JEOL 2100 Cryo microscope. High-resolution STEM and EDS studies were conducted using FEI Themis Z advanced probe aberration corrected analytical scanning/transmission electron microscope. The mass contents of Fe and Mo in the samples were determined by ICP-OES using a PerkinElmer Optima 8300 system. XPS data were obtained using Kratos Axis Supra+ Photoelectron spectrometer, and the corresponding data analysis was performed using CasaXPS software. The identification, deconvolution, and assignment of XPS peaks were based on the references provided in an XPS handbook (45, 46). The XPS data were analyzed after the calibration using the adventitious carbon peak at binding energy of 284.80 eV. The deconvolution of overlapped peaks in Mo 3d spectra was carried out using the principle of spin-orbit splitting ratio for 3d spectrum, i.e., 2:3 for the signals from 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively.

Catalytic upgrading tests of biocrude oils

Upgrading tests of biocrude oils were carried out using a 100-ml Parr 4598 reactor with a Parr 4848 reactor controller. The biocrude oil (10 ml) was added to an Ar-protected, freshly prepared, non-passivated Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst (~0.5 g) in the test tube. The mixture was stirred and transferred to a 100-ml stainless steel reaction chamber, which was then assembled in the Parr reactor. The reactor was purged with ~500-psi H2 three times before it was pressurized to 1500-psi H2 (~20°C), followed by a heat treatment at 400°C for 2 hours. The heating rate was set at ~25°C/min. The maximum pressure in the reactor was ~2200 psi at 400°C. After the reaction, the reactor was quenched in cold water for 10 min. The upgraded oils and used catalysts were collected and separated by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min (Beckman Coulter Inc., Allegra X-30 Series). The used catalysts were washed with acetone three times before drying in the vacuum oven overnight. For control experiments using commercial Mo2C or ZSM-5, all reaction conditions were kept the same other than the catalysts used. The weight of individual components, other than the total amount of catalysts, was also kept the same, i.e., ~0.5 g of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 was replaced with ~0.23 g of commercial Mo2C or ~0.27 g of commercial ZSM-5 in the control upgrading tests, according to the theoretical value based on feeding ratio (table S1). When performance was tested with the used Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5, all reaction conditions were kept the same other than the catalyst. The amount of used Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 for the upgrading test is 0.5 g. No pretreatment or reactivation of used catalysts was conducted.

Characterization of biocrude oils and analytical methods

The elemental content was determined using CE440 CHN analyzer from Exeter Analytical. The oxygen content was calculated by the difference, i.e., 100-∑(C+H+N) (wt %). The HHV of biocrude oils was calculated using Dulong’s formula (50). The boiling point distribution of oil samples was obtained using a Q50 Thermogravimetric Analyzer from TA Instruments. The sample was placed in a heating chamber purged with N2, which could mimic the distillation processing. The samples were heated from room temperature to 600°C at a rate of 20°C/min in N2 flow at atmospheric pressure. The TGA data analysis was performed using Universal Analysis 2000 software, provided by TA Instruments, Waters LLC. The distribution of molecular weight of the compounds in biocrude oils was studied by performing MALDI-TOF-MS using Bruker Autoflex Speed LRF instrument. The scan range of mass spectra is between 50 and 1500 Da. The Mn, Mm, and polydispersity index (I) were calculated using the following equations

Mn=∑(Mi×Ni∑Nj)=∑(MiNi)∑Nj

(1)

Mm=∑[Mi×MiNi∑(MjNj)]=∑(Mi2Ni)∑(MjNj)

(2)

I=MmMn

(3)

where Mi and Ni are the mass (in unit of Da) and background-corrected abundance of the ith oligomer, respectively. The background baseline is determined on the basis of averaged noise level of the mass spectra. The polydispersity index (I) measures the dispersion of molecular weights of chemical compounds in the oil, i.e., I of one suggests a homogenous weight distribution, and larger I values (i.e., I > 1) imply widely dispersed weight distribution.

Hydrocarbon type analysis was performed using two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC), of which detailed setup can be found in a previous work (42). The oil went through distillation using a Micro Spinning Band from B/R Instrument, which offers excellent theoretical plates and minimal dead volume. The distillate cut was executed from 150° to 230°C based on the flash point and freezing point specification limits (43).

Bonn climate talks leave mountain to climb for Belem

Deepening divisions between developed and developing countries promise to make Cop 30 an arduous summit, writes Rhys Talbot Paris, 27 June (Argus) — Progress in technical discussions at the UN climate conference in Bonn, Germany, still leaves much work for the incoming Brazilian presidency ahead of November's Cop 30 summit in Belem if it is to deliver a strong outcome on emission cuts. After a rocky start in Bonn this month, with a two-day fight over the agenda, negotiators delivered texts across a number of areas relating to emission reductions. The Brazilian Cop takes place 10 years after the Paris agreement, in which states agreed to limit global warming to well below 2°C and preferably 1.5°C, and two years after Cop 28 in Dubai, when they undertook the global stocktake (GST) to measure progress on reaching Paris goals and pledged to phase out fossil fuels. The annual Bonn talks are intended to allow negotiators to prepare the ground for political decisions to be made at Cop. But this year, even those discussions that have advanced well have tended to produce large texts with many mutually exclusive options in brackets, reflecting incompatible positions that will have to be worked out by policy makers between now and the end of the Belem Cop. The main arena for considering fossil fuels, a discussion of the meaning of the GST, has left a heavily divided text to Belem. Developed countries have argued for a longer, more extensive process, while some parties — including China, India and Saudi Arabia — have tried to limit the scope, duration and outputs of the sessions. And the texts do not directly address the elephant in the room — countries are this year delivering their nationally determined contribution (NDC) documents laying out their plans to cut emissions. Those plans are likely to be insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C. And the Brazilian presidency will have to grasp the initiative to find a way to ensure advances on the Paris and Dubai goals. The leader's summit to be held immediately before Cop could offer a chance for movement. The release of a keenly awaited synthesis report of NDCs on 24 October could offer a spur to this summit. ""People will want a reaction from our leaders"" when the report comes out, Cop 30 executive director Ana Toni said. But Brazil rejects the idea of a cover decision at the end of Belem as a home for discussion of fossil fuels. And the presidency has been reluctant to attack fossil fuels head on. ""This is not an item of negotiation, the GST is,"" Toni said. Brazil must wrangle a fractious conference including major fossil fuel producers such as India, Saudi Arabia and Russia which resist any action on the topic, as well as facing criticism over its own plans to increase oil and gas production . Climate finance fight Climate finance permeated the Bonn talks, with developing countries trying to steer various work programmes towards the issue, while developed countries attempted to limit discussion. Developing countries said the finance settlement reached last year at Baku does not meet developed countries' obligations under the Paris agreement, as well as being far short of actual needs. And in parallel, they expressed their frustration with carbon border adjust mechanism (CBAM)-type arrangements planned for the EU and UK, and projected for Canada. Developed countries see these as essential to protecting their domestic industry and preventing carbon leakage, given their high carbon costs, but developing countries say the costs will fall mostly on them. These two issues appear likely to crop up again as stumbling blocks at Belem that the presidency will have to tackle with political engagement beforehand. Brazil has promoted Cop 30 as an ""implementation"" Cop, with no one particular agenda item dominating. This gives the country the arduous task of having to make concrete progress on many items, rather than focus on one headline target.

German draft RED III consolidates cover crop use

London, 27 June (Argus) — Intermediate crops are set to be considered an advanced feedstock for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Germany, according to the environment and climate ministry's draft bill to amend the Federal Immission Control Act, which aims to implement the EU's renewable energy directive (RED III) into national law. Cover, or intermediate, crops — defined by the European Commission as crops that are grown on areas where only one food or feed crop harvest takes place, require no additional land use, and maintain soil's organic matter content — are to be considered advanced feedstocks for the production of SAF, in accordance with RED III's Annex IX Part A. This means that SAF derived from cover crops will contribute to Germany's minimum advanced biofuels sub-quota, which is proposed to rise to 3pc by 2030, up from the current 2.6pc goal, under draft legislation. Germany's draft implementation proposes an end to double-counting of advanced feedstocks, which could increase demand for products including cover crops. But for non-SAF biofuel production, per Annex IX Part B, cover crops would be considered a non-advanced feedstock. Under Germany's draft legislation, this would be classed as a waste-based feedstock, and would face a cap on volumes that can count towards the mandate, revised up to 2.8pc by 2039, from the current 1.9pc. Although these feedstocks would be single-counted towards the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction quota, the draft amendments stating that biofuels produced from these materials are ""considered to be twice their energy content"" in the calculation of RED III targets a share of renewable energy within the final consumption of energy in the transport sector of at least 29pc by 2030.

SEA biodiesel industry seeks funds to decarbonise

Singapore, 27 June (Argus) — Regional biodiesel associations from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia called for stakeholder support to further decarbonisation goals during the 5th Palm Biodiesel Conference in Bangkok over 23-24 June. Thai electrification shift competes with biodiesel industry Thailand has been driving a shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) under the 30@30 policy, targeting at least 30pc of total motor vehicles produced annually by 2030 to be EVs, while support for biodiesel producers is waning, said Thai biodiesel producer association Chairman Sanin Triyanond. Thailand will no longer subsidise the price of biofuels such as biodiesel under the oil fund act after 24 September 2026, said Supatchalee Sophonthammaphat, an official with the Thai department of alternative energy development and efficiency (DEDE). Triyanond called for both the EV and biodiesel industries to coexist, citing a study that said an EV and biofuel energy mix was recommended for the country. A low biodiesel blend target in Thailand resulted in only 30pc of Thailand's 11.7mn l/d in installed biodiesel capacity being utilised, and high operating costs across its 14 registered companies, Triyanond said. When domestic crude palm oil (CPO) stocks fall below 200,000t, local prices also increase in comparison to the global price, he added. This raises the cost of production when biodiesel producers import CPO as it is subject to 143pc import tax and exempt from export duties in Thailand. Thailand manages CPO supplies and prices by altering its volumetric blend target for biodiesel under the alternative energy development plan (AEDP). However, the biodiesel industry has been struggling with a low blending policy and feels that the stock management program needs to be redesigned to better support producers. Indonesia needs more investment to hit B50 biodiesel blend goal Indonesia is targeting 15.6mn kl of domestic biodiesel consumption in 2025 and has been conducting road tests for a higher B50 biodiesel blend with fossil diesel this year. To meet higher biodiesel blend ratios in subsequent years, new investment from the private sector and policy support from the government on pricing, funding and legislation is needed to drive infrastructure upgrades and capacity expansions, said deputy of promotion and communication at the Indonesian biofuels producer association (APROBI) Ravi Farkhan Pratama. For suppliers, complex logistics resulting in higher costs for transporting biodiesel to remote regions remain, said manager of biofuel and additive supply chain at PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Adi Rachman. A price disparity between public service obligation (PSO) and non-PSO (NPSO) biodiesel blends in the market poses a challenge in ensuring each fuel is supplied to the right customer group, he added. The PSO sector includes state-owned firms that serve the public. Fuel suppliers in this sector receive subsidies from the oil plantation fund management agency (BPDPKS) to fund the difference between palm oil-based biodiesel and the indexed price of diesel, while non-PSO fuel suppliers do not. Biodiesel plants in Indonesia have been running at an average 80pc of Indonesia's 20.9mn kl/yr installed capacity across 24 producers this year, said Pratama. Indonesia consumed about 20pc of annual CPO production under the B35 blend mandate in 2024. This year's B40 biodiesel blend mandate could eat into exports and other avenues including food use, Pratama added. Any further increase to blending mandates would exacerbate how palm supplies are distributed between food and fuel. There are also additional costs around infrastructure upgrades such as coating pipelines and storage tanks, said Rachman. A move to a B50 blend mandate would likely happen in 2027 or later, said head of B40 road test and B40 commercial test team at LEMIGAS research and development center of oil & gas technology, ministry of energy and mineral resources Cahyo Setyo Wibowo at the event. Malaysian biodiesel producers push for higher blending mandates Malaysia's B20 biodiesel blend mandate set in January 2020 has been limited to Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Labuan and Sarawak in the transport sector. A separate 7pc biodiesel blend is required in the industrial sector, first mandated in July 2019. President of Malaysian biodiesel association Tee Lip Teng sought a nationwide B20 implementation for on-road fuels, and a B30 blend ratio by 2030. However, Tee said that a capital expenditure of more than 600mn ringgit ($142mn) would be required to achieve a full B20 nameplate biodiesel production capacity in Malaysia. On the other hand, the country is set to introduce a carbon tax as early as next year, allowing palm oil methyl ester (PME) prices to be more competitive, he added. Lower palm oil prices in relation to gasoil amid oil market uncertainty and during the upcoming peak palm production season could also drive voluntary blending. But fossil diesel continues to be subsidised for qualified businesses in the transportation and logistics sector, increasing the funding burden needed to subsidise PME in these sectors. While PME production continues to face challenges, Tee cited the potential to expand waste-based biodiesel production in Malaysia. Biodiesel exports out of Malaysia rose up to 2019 before declining afterward due to the EU ban on palm-based biofuels, Tee said. Majority of the biodiesel exported now comprises used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) and palm oil mill effluent oil methyl ester (Pomeme) rather than PME, he added. First generation biodiesel producers should be incentivised through government grants to retrofit their plants to use waste-based oils to complement their existing palm oil feedstock, Tee said. Other alternative feedstocks carrying a lower levelized cost of production such as palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) should be considered as a feedstock of choice, said general manager for strategy and sustainability at Petronas Dagangan Berhad Ms. Harlina Pikri.

Australian oil seed tree carbon credits to aid biofuels

Sydney, 27 June (Argus) — A potential inclusion of oil seed tree harvesting into the remake of an expiring Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) method could bring much-anticipated support to Australia's nascent biofuels sector. Australia's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has recently advised industry proponents to investigate the potential of adding oil seed harvesting to the remake of the Reforestation and Afforestation 2.0 method, US agricultural innovation firm Terviva senior manager of commercialisation Kevin Swanepoel told Argus on 27 June. The method credits emission reductions to forest growers and landholders who establish and maintain trees on land previously used for agricultural purposes. It will expire on 30 September 2025, and Terviva and its partner, Japanese refiner Idemitsu Kosan, will participate in the consultation processes around a potential remake of the method. Idemitsu and Terviva, alongside Australian mining company Stanmore Resources, have been working on a trial plantation of pongamia trees in Queensland. The companies are eyeing the crop as a potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). They are also exploring the use of pressed pongamia oilseed cake as livestock feed, as well as the potential creation of ACCUs from the carbon sequestration of the trees. The firms ultimately aim to convert the carbon sequestration benefits of pongamia into ACCUs, Idemitsu said in a separate statement. But no approved methodology currently exists within the ACCU framework to support this pathway, the firm added. Proponent-led pathway The industry had high expectations about an expression of interest submitted by mining firm Rio Tinto in 2024 for the creation of an ACCU method under the new proponent-led model . The proposed ""Sequestration of Carbon from Oil Seed Trees"" method would involve planting perennial oil seed tree species and crediting the carbon sequestration associated with living biomass and potentially soil carbon. The proposal would use pongamia as an example species, with other oil seed species to be included over time. The oil seeds resulting from these plantations would be harvested and used in biofuel production. The Emission Reduction Assurance Committee (Erac) considered the proposal to have ""excellent alignment"" and deemed it ""ready for imminent development"", but noted support for development would come only ""if or when resources permit"". The Australian government prioritised four other methods instead, but said expressions of interest could be re-submitted in the next rounds under the proponent-led pathway. The DCCEEW did not reply to questions on when the next round will be opened or whether there would be a minimum or maximum number of methods to be prioritised. Industry participants said no dates have been indicated by the government. Options outside the proponent-led route Rio Tinto also did not comment on its next steps for the proponent-led pathway, although it has been progressing with a pilot study to explore the potential of pongamia seed oil as a feedstock for renewable diesel output . The pilot, in partnership with Australian wood-fibre processor and exporter Midway, involved the acquisition of approximately 3,000 hectares of land in north Queensland and the planting of pongamia saplings. Support is required to incentivise the production and use of biofuels at scale to grow the industry in Australia, Rio Tinto said in 2024 in a paper about diesel transition. One of the options would be creating pathways for renewable diesel farming projects to be recognised under the ACCU scheme. ""This could serve the dual purpose of supporting development of Australia's biofuels industry , while expanding ACCU supply to help meet expected demand from facilities under the safeguard mechanism ,"" it added. Remaking expiring methods offers the government the opportunity to add new activities to be credited under the ACCU scheme outside the proponent-led route, Midway carbon projects manager John Lawson said. The reforestation and afforestation method has a limited number of projects over its history, so adding seed oil crops and harvest activities could improve uptake of the method with minimal changes to the method required, he added. ""There is a growing group of project developers interested in and actively working on options for implementing changes like these,"" he said.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The SAF Matchmaker is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.

IATA UNVEILS SAF MATCHMAKER PLATFORM

The platform will indeed help to speed up SAF usage since airlines will be better able to secure supplies of SAF.

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

That said, SAF Matchmaker will aid the scaling up of SAF by addressing three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).",https://sustainabilityinthesky.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/airbus-saf-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 18:06:20.697604

In its latest sustainability report, Singapore Airlines Group reported that total emissions rose more than 13% over the past financial year, from 18.8 million tonnes of CO₂e to 21.4 million tonnes. The airline, which has orders for over 70 new planes, pointed to strong passenger demand and ongoing airspace restrictions, which have forced longer flight routes, as key reasons behind the increase.

The company’s CEO, Goh Choon Phong, said its investment in newer aircraft, which the industry says emits up 25% less carbon, will help in plans to reduce emissions to almost zero by 2050.

“Our long-term commitment to investing in and operating new-generation aircraft puts us in a strong position,” Goh said. “As of 31 March 2025, the average age of the Group’s operating fleet was seven years and eight months, well below the global average of 15 years.”

Rising Costs From Climate Rules and Compliance

At the same time, the carrier warned that complying with international climate regulations could come at a significant cost in the years ahead.

It estimated the global aviation carbon offsetting scheme, known as CORSIA, which most airlines are a part of, could cost the airline around $150 million by 2030.

CORSIA requires airlines to purchase credits if their emissions exceed 85% of their 2019 levels, with the goal of offsetting the climate impact of growing international air travel.

In its report, the airline flagged its scope 1 emissions, which are mainly made up of fuel, as the main driver of future compliance costs.

Singapore Airlines pointed to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a long-term solution. SAF can reduce emissions by around 65% compared to traditional jet fuel, according to the sector. The airline called SAF “a critical lever for decarbonisation” and said it would continue to support its development and use.

Managing Climate Risks

The airline said that other climate-related risks, such as extreme weather and infrastructure threats, currently have a limited financial impact.

However, it estimated that direct costs from these risks could reach up to around $35 million by 2030.

As part of its preparations, Singapore Airlines said it has invested in flood prevention measures at Singapore Changi Airport, including flood barriers and new drain sensors.

Touted as “the first true aircraft of the sustainability era,” the aircraft reportedly offers up to 60% lower fuel burn and 90% less emissions when using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compared to similar-sized jets (such as the Bombardier Challenger 3500 or Embraer Praetor 500 and 600). This is partly due to its design, achieving transonic super-laminar flow with the help of AI-supported aerodynamics and a seamless composite fuselage. Also enabling the aircraft’s sustainability is the Williams International (Pontiac, Mich., U.S.) FJ44-4 QPM engine, which can use 100% SAF and integrates the auxiliary power unit (APU).

The Phantom 3500’s design will further reduce aerodynamic drag and also improve fuselage integrity by eliminating windows. Instead, HD display panels will offer what CEO Paul Touw describes as a “super natural infotainment system” that eliminates glare and augments the view from every seat, including a synthetic environment similar to Google Earth and streaming of movies that “goes way beyond just a window.”

As explained on the Otto Aviation website by Matt Thurber, editor-in-chief of Aviation International News (AIN), the Phantom 3500 airframe is all-composite, and Leonardo (Rome, Italy) will build the fuselage at its facility in Grottaglie, Italy.

The Phantom 3500 will offer seating for nine with a cabin height of 6 feet 5 inches (~2 meters) and is designed to cruise at over 600 miles per hour with a range of up to 3,500 nautical miles at altitudes of 51,000 feet. Operating costs are expected to be half those of other super-midsize jets.

Otto Aviation announced it will build the aircraft at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, investing $430 million and relocating its headquarters to the site. Initial flight tests are planned for early 2027, with certification and entry into service expected by 2030.

Development history, laminar flow design

According to Thurber’s article, Otto Aviation has been working on the Phantom 3500 for 3 years, moving forward from its previous development of the Celera 500 aircraft. By January 2025, the company had completed the Phantom 3500’s conceptual design and systems requirement review. It then began announcing suppliers, including Advanced Integration Technology (AIT, Plano, Texas, U.S.) as its tooling and automation partner for production systems. AIT will provide assembly and joining systems, metrology tools and scalable automation cells.

Thurber also reports the Phantom 3500 design is supported by $25 million worth of wind tunnel testing, according to Touw. This includes wing cross-section tests at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California and high-speed tests at the European Transonic Windtunnel (ETW, Cologne, Germany). All of the tests were successful, says Touw, noting the company’s drag predictions and ETW results were within a couple of percent, giving confirmation of the super-laminar flow design.

“Natural laminar flow allows us to make the wing bigger without the consequence of more drag,” Touw notes in Thurber’s article. “Because of that big wing, we can take off and land out of shorter runways than a Challenger 3500 or Praetor 500/600 or Cessna Latitude or Longitude. The aircraft is also lighter… so the airplane’s wing tanks get smaller, the landing gear gets smaller, the engines are smaller, the structure is smaller. So per pound, it’s also less expensive to manufacture.”

According to Touw, the Phantom 3500’s wing is swept 23° and will have leading-edge slots that help to keep almost 90% of the wing in laminar flow. With this reduction in skin friction drag, the wing can then be larger, able to fly higher with lower wing loading compared to most business jets. Otto Aviation has not yet announced who will build the composite wing.

Touw expects to complete the Phantom 3500’s preliminary design review in October 2025 and then begin building the first of four test vehicles required for certification. First flight is currently scheduled for 2027. The single-pilot jet will be certified under FAR Part 23 regulations, anticipated in 2030.

Production facility, RTM versus SQRTM

Currently located at Meacham Field in Fort Worth, Texas, Otto Aviation has announced it will build a factory in Jacksonville, Florida. Thurber reports the company plans to rely on RTM to produce its carbon fiber-reinforced composite airframe, noting that Airbus uses a similar process to manufacture major structural components for the A220.

Actually, the process used to make the A220 wings is resin transfer infusion (RTI) which was first developed at the old Shorts Brothers facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by Bombardier for its C Series 100-150 seat commercial jetliner. That aircraft is now the Airbus A220, while the Belfast facility was later sold to Spirit AeroSystems (see CW’s plant tour) but is now part of Airbus.

Another important note is that the Otto Aviation website actually specifies SQRTM (same qualified resin transfer molding). As explained in “SQRTM enables net-shape parts” and “... combines prepreg with RTM,” this process uses a prepreg layup instead of a dry fabric preform, with the RTM process injecting the same resin that is used in the prepreg, but in liquid form. It thus avoids the need for qualifying new materials and should help speed certification yet still enable automation and aerospace-grade quality control. Note that RTM has been qualified for a number of flying parts, including the LEAP engine fan blades and fan case and the A320 spoilers, as well as the structural grid for the A350 passenger door and the A350 horizontal tail plane (HTP) leading edge produced by Aernnova ICSA.

Thurber says Touw admits that the tooling needed to manufacture the Phantom 3500 will be expensive. However, he believes eliminating labor involved with metal manufacturing (cutting, drilling and riveting) will be more efficient and that robotic manufacturing will also help to keep costs down.

Redefining aviation

Otto Aviation has raised nearly $200 million for the Phantom 3500 and is about to launch a B Series funding round. Thurber predicts the program could require more than $1 billion to reach certification and production. The company currently employs about 100 people and supports another 200 full-time-equivalent contractors.",https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0625-cw-news-phantom3500.jpg;maxWidth=1200,N,,2025-06-27 15:06:12.484421

The Senate's proposed tax and budget reconciliation legislation would modify the '45Z' Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to restore tax parity between sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other advanced biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel effective Oct. 1, 2025. Modifying '45Z' to be technology-neutral marks a critical step in revitalizing U.S. biofuel production, which has dropped sharply since the credit took effect in January.

""We give the Senate a lot of credit for reconfiguring '45Z' to be truly technology neutral. SAF should be incentivized at the same rate as all other biofuels. An equal incentive – 'parity' – will result in more gallons of biofuel being produced and consumed, all at a lower cost for taxpayers,"" said David Fialkov, Executive Vice President of Government Affairs for NATSO and SIGMA. ""Importantly, this provision reduces the overall cost of the '45Z' tax credit while also incentivizing more over the road fuel production – helping to lower prices for consumers. A win for everyone.""

""A level playing field for sustainable aviation fuels versus over-the-road biofuels is critical to restoring the biodiesel market,"" said Matt Durand, NACS Deputy General Counsel. ""Today, the biodiesel market is failing due to tax policy. Unless we act to ensure biodiesel is no longer disadvantaged, the market may never recover. NACS strongly supports the Section '45Z' parity proposal and urges the Senate to retain it.""

The Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided a higher tax credit of up to $1.75 for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. The higher aviation fuel tax credit signed into law by President Biden, coupled with the expiration of the Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit at the end of 2024, has decimated America's advanced biofuel supply chains.

Equal tax treatment between alternative biofuels represents a significant step toward the much-needed certainty that will encourage biofuel production and consumption. SAF is more costly than biodiesel and renewable diesel and results in the production of less gallons of overall fuel. Under the Senate legislation, SAF would have access to the same credit as all other fuels and producers will be able to gravitate toward the most efficient fuels in the market.

SEA biodiesel industry seeks funds to decarbonise

Singapore, 27 June (Argus) — Regional biodiesel associations from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia called for stakeholder support to further decarbonisation goals during the 5th Palm Biodiesel Conference in Bangkok over 23-24 June. Thai electrification shift competes with biodiesel industry Thailand has been driving a shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) under the 30@30 policy, targeting at least 30pc of total motor vehicles produced annually by 2030 to be EVs, while support for biodiesel producers is waning, said Thai biodiesel producer association Chairman Sanin Triyanond. Thailand will no longer subsidise the price of biofuels such as biodiesel under the oil fund act after 24 September 2026, said Supatchalee Sophonthammaphat, an official with the Thai department of alternative energy development and efficiency (DEDE). Triyanond called for both the EV and biodiesel industries to coexist, citing a study that said an EV and biofuel energy mix was recommended for the country. A low biodiesel blend target in Thailand resulted in only 30pc of Thailand's 11.7mn l/d in installed biodiesel capacity being utilised, and high operating costs across its 14 registered companies, Triyanond said. When domestic crude palm oil (CPO) stocks fall below 200,000t, local prices also increase in comparison to the global price, he added. This raises the cost of production when biodiesel producers import CPO as it is subject to 143pc import tax and exempt from export duties in Thailand. Thailand manages CPO supplies and prices by altering its volumetric blend target for biodiesel under the alternative energy development plan (AEDP). However, the biodiesel industry has been struggling with a low blending policy and feels that the stock management program needs to be redesigned to better support producers. Indonesia needs more investment to hit B50 biodiesel blend goal Indonesia is targeting 15.6mn kl of domestic biodiesel consumption in 2025 and has been conducting road tests for a higher B50 biodiesel blend with fossil diesel this year. To meet higher biodiesel blend ratios in subsequent years, new investment from the private sector and policy support from the government on pricing, funding and legislation is needed to drive infrastructure upgrades and capacity expansions, said deputy of promotion and communication at the Indonesian biofuels producer association (APROBI) Ravi Farkhan Pratama. For suppliers, complex logistics resulting in higher costs for transporting biodiesel to remote regions remain, said manager of biofuel and additive supply chain at PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Adi Rachman. A price disparity between public service obligation (PSO) and non-PSO (NPSO) biodiesel blends in the market poses a challenge in ensuring each fuel is supplied to the right customer group, he added. The PSO sector includes state-owned firms that serve the public. Fuel suppliers in this sector receive subsidies from the oil plantation fund management agency (BPDPKS) to fund the difference between palm oil-based biodiesel and the indexed price of diesel, while non-PSO fuel suppliers do not. Biodiesel plants in Indonesia have been running at an average 80pc of Indonesia's 20.9mn kl/yr installed capacity across 24 producers this year, said Pratama. Indonesia consumed about 20pc of annual CPO production under the B35 blend mandate in 2024. This year's B40 biodiesel blend mandate could eat into exports and other avenues including food use, Pratama added. Any further increase to blending mandates would exacerbate how palm supplies are distributed between food and fuel. There are also additional costs around infrastructure upgrades such as coating pipelines and storage tanks, said Rachman. A move to a B50 blend mandate would likely happen in 2027 or later, said head of B40 road test and B40 commercial test team at LEMIGAS research and development center of oil & gas technology, ministry of energy and mineral resources Cahyo Setyo Wibowo at the event. Malaysian biodiesel producers push for higher blending mandates Malaysia's B20 biodiesel blend mandate set in January 2020 has been limited to Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Labuan and Sarawak in the transport sector. A separate 7pc biodiesel blend is required in the industrial sector, first mandated in July 2019. President of Malaysian biodiesel association Tee Lip Teng sought a nationwide B20 implementation for on-road fuels, and a B30 blend ratio by 2030. However, Tee said that a capital expenditure of more than 600mn ringgit ($142mn) would be required to achieve a full B20 nameplate biodiesel production capacity in Malaysia. On the other hand, the country is set to introduce a carbon tax as early as next year, allowing palm oil methyl ester (PME) prices to be more competitive, he added. Lower palm oil prices in relation to gasoil amid oil market uncertainty and during the upcoming peak palm production season could also drive voluntary blending. But fossil diesel continues to be subsidised for qualified businesses in the transportation and logistics sector, increasing the funding burden needed to subsidise PME in these sectors. While PME production continues to face challenges, Tee cited the potential to expand waste-based biodiesel production in Malaysia. Biodiesel exports out of Malaysia rose up to 2019 before declining afterward due to the EU ban on palm-based biofuels, Tee said. Majority of the biodiesel exported now comprises used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) and palm oil mill effluent oil methyl ester (Pomeme) rather than PME, he added. First generation biodiesel producers should be incentivised through government grants to retrofit their plants to use waste-based oils to complement their existing palm oil feedstock, Tee said. Other alternative feedstocks carrying a lower levelized cost of production such as palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) should be considered as a feedstock of choice, said general manager for strategy and sustainability at Petronas Dagangan Berhad Ms. Harlina Pikri.

Australian oil seed tree carbon credits to aid biofuels

Sydney, 27 June (Argus) — A potential inclusion of oil seed tree harvesting into the remake of an expiring Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) method could bring much-anticipated support to Australia's nascent biofuels sector. Australia's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has recently advised industry proponents to investigate the potential of adding oil seed harvesting to the remake of the Reforestation and Afforestation 2.0 method, US agricultural innovation firm Terviva senior manager of commercialisation Kevin Swanepoel told Argus on 27 June. The method credits emission reductions to forest growers and landholders who establish and maintain trees on land previously used for agricultural purposes. It will expire on 30 September 2025, and Terviva and its partner, Japanese refiner Idemitsu Kosan, will participate in the consultation processes around a potential remake of the method. Idemitsu and Terviva, alongside Australian mining company Stanmore Resources, have been working on a trial plantation of pongamia trees in Queensland. The companies are eyeing the crop as a potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). They are also exploring the use of pressed pongamia oilseed cake as livestock feed, as well as the potential creation of ACCUs from the carbon sequestration of the trees. The firms ultimately aim to convert the carbon sequestration benefits of pongamia into ACCUs, Idemitsu said in a separate statement. But no approved methodology currently exists within the ACCU framework to support this pathway, the firm added. Proponent-led pathway The industry had high expectations about an expression of interest submitted by mining firm Rio Tinto in 2024 for the creation of an ACCU method under the new proponent-led model . The proposed ""Sequestration of Carbon from Oil Seed Trees"" method would involve planting perennial oil seed tree species and crediting the carbon sequestration associated with living biomass and potentially soil carbon. The proposal would use pongamia as an example species, with other oil seed species to be included over time. The oil seeds resulting from these plantations would be harvested and used in biofuel production. The Emission Reduction Assurance Committee (Erac) considered the proposal to have ""excellent alignment"" and deemed it ""ready for imminent development"", but noted support for development would come only ""if or when resources permit"". The Australian government prioritised four other methods instead, but said expressions of interest could be re-submitted in the next rounds under the proponent-led pathway. The DCCEEW did not reply to questions on when the next round will be opened or whether there would be a minimum or maximum number of methods to be prioritised. Industry participants said no dates have been indicated by the government. Options outside the proponent-led route Rio Tinto also did not comment on its next steps for the proponent-led pathway, although it has been progressing with a pilot study to explore the potential of pongamia seed oil as a feedstock for renewable diesel output . The pilot, in partnership with Australian wood-fibre processor and exporter Midway, involved the acquisition of approximately 3,000 hectares of land in north Queensland and the planting of pongamia saplings. Support is required to incentivise the production and use of biofuels at scale to grow the industry in Australia, Rio Tinto said in 2024 in a paper about diesel transition. One of the options would be creating pathways for renewable diesel farming projects to be recognised under the ACCU scheme. ""This could serve the dual purpose of supporting development of Australia's biofuels industry , while expanding ACCU supply to help meet expected demand from facilities under the safeguard mechanism ,"" it added. Remaking expiring methods offers the government the opportunity to add new activities to be credited under the ACCU scheme outside the proponent-led route, Midway carbon projects manager John Lawson said. The reforestation and afforestation method has a limited number of projects over its history, so adding seed oil crops and harvest activities could improve uptake of the method with minimal changes to the method required, he added. ""There is a growing group of project developers interested in and actively working on options for implementing changes like these,"" he said.

Mexico’s trade balance swings to surplus in May

Mexico City, 26 June (Argus) — Mexico's trade balance returned to surplus territory in May, as higher crude export volumes helped to offset drags on manufacturing from US tariffs. Mexico recorded a $1.03bn trade surplus in May, statistics agency Inegi reported Thursday, swinging from a $88mn deficit the previous month. Total exports in May were valued at $55.5bn, while imports reached $54.4bn. The surplus was wider than Mexican bank Banorte's forecast of $279mn. The balance reflects the trade deficit in oil-related products narrowing to $2.11bn in May from $2.87bn in April, as well as a rebounding surplus in non-oil trade to $3.14bn from $2.78bn in April. Mexico ran a $2.04bn trade surplus for the January-May period, including a $10.96bn surplus in non-oil trade and a $8.92bn deficit in oil-related trade. This reflects the longer-term trend of growing non-oil exports set against widening deficits of oil-related goods. Manufacturing exports — especially autos — have been the most affected by US tariffs enacted in March and April. Despite US exemptions tied to trade treaties, Mexico still faces an average effective US tariff rate of 11.9pc — the eighth highest globally and the highest in the western hemisphere, according to Fitch Ratings. The auto industry is also participating in negotiations to soften steel and aluminum tariffs to prevent further supply chain disruptions. Manufacturing exports fell by 0.6pc in May after a 0.7pc drop in April. Auto exports declined by 1.3pc in May, following a 4.8pc fall in April. Inegi reported a 10.3pc annual drop in the value of auto exports to the US in May, after an 8pc decline in April. Exports had surged 6.5pc in March as companies rushed shipments ahead of tariff implementation. Agricultural exports contracted by 2.6pc in May from the previous month after rising 2pc in April, while non-oil mining exports contracted 2.9pc after surging 26pc in April. Oil-related exports totaled $2.06bn in May — $1.33bn in crude and $722mn in refined products — compared with $1.83bn in crude alone in April. This comes despite a stronger peso and lower oil prices. Mexico's crude export mix averaged $57.88/bl in May, down $2.94/bl from April and $16.51/bl below the year-earlier level. Crude export volumes rose to 743,000 b/d from 693,000 b/d in April but remained below the 930,000 b/d exported in May 2024.

US reps resist Senate approach to biofuel credit

New York, 26 June (Argus) — A coalition of US House members is pushing the Senate to scrap planned changes to a tax credit that the biofuel industry sees as crucial for profitable production. Republicans in both chambers have looked to use a fillibuster-proof budget bill to keep but modify the Inflation Reduction Act's ""45Z"" tax credit, which increases subsidies for fuels with lower emissions. But some farm-state House members are displeased with the Senate's approach , including less-punitive treatment of foreign feedstocks and substantial cuts to subsidies for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). ""We respectfully urge you and your committee to revise the language around 45Z to reflect the House language,"" seven House Republicans, including three on the House tax-writing committee, wrote Wednesday in a letter to Senate Finance Committee chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho). Both the House and Senate bills would prevent tax officials from factoring in indirect emissions from land use changes, a win for crop-based fuels like corn ethanol, and would extend 45Z four more years through 2031. But the House bill, which passed the chamber narrowly last month, would also strip eligibility from fuels derived from feedstocks outside North America starting next year. The Senate Finance draft, on the other hand, cuts subsidies for fuels from foreign feedstocks by 20pc while still allowing them some credit. The issue is highly contentious across the biofuel supply chain. Farm groups say that recently fast-rising imports of used cooking oil and tallow are hurting demand for domestic crops that can also be refined into renewable diesel. Refiners insist that flexibility around feedstocks is essential for scaling up biofuel output. The House lawmakers say that the Senate language would ""subsidize imported feedstocks"", some of which come from countries that ""actively discriminate against our domestic biofuels industry"". The House letter also asks the Senate to retain additional subsidies for SAF, which they say are critical given the fuel's typically higher cost of production. Under current law, road fuels are eligible for up to $1/USG and SAF up to $1.75/USG, plus inflation adjustments for all types of fuel — but the Senate Finance draft would eliminate that jet fuel premium. Notably, the House lawmakers say they prefer the Senate's more lenient approach to tax credit ""transferability"", which allows smaller companies without enough tax liability to instead sell tax credits to other businesses. President Donald Trump has pushed lawmakers to send him the budget bill before 4 July, but lawmakers still disagree on key details with just days before that self-imposed deadline. Along with fighting over energy policy, some conservatives are wary of the package's potential impact on the federal budget deficit and want more sweeping cuts to government spending. The letter was signed by representatives Michelle Fischbach (R-Minnesota), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Max Miller (R-Ohio), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Brad Finstad (R-Minnesota) and Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa).

This freeze has placed the future of SAF-related federal tax credits in limbo, creating deep uncertainty for developers and investors.
States that proactively support SAF may gain a competitive edge in attracting clean energy investment and positioning their airports as hubs for low-emissions travel.","With the aviation sector under growing pressure to reduce emissions, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as one of the most immediate pathways to decarbonization. In a significant step forward, Michigan has introduced a state-level incentive program aimed at jumpstarting local SAF production. The new legislation—supported by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle—offers targeted tax credits for producers and blenders that can meet stringent emissions and sustainability criteria.

The program is part of a broader shift toward state-led climate and energy action, as federal direction under the Trump administration remains uncertain. While the Michigan initiative establishes a modest tax credit cap of $4.5 million in its first year, it lays the groundwork for regional market development—an essential piece of a national SAF strategy still waiting for clearer federal support.

SAF: A Scalable, Drop-in Solution

SAF is derived from renewable or waste-based feedstocks—such as agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon—and can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. It’s also compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure, enabling airlines to cut emissions without significant capital investment.

But production volumes remain limited. While U.S. airlines have committed to bold SAF procurement targets, the supply chain is still in early stages of scale-up. This is where state action becomes critical.

Industry Expands Despite Federal Policy Ambiguity

Across the U.S., SAF producers continue to ramp up operations:

World Energy is expanding its Paramount, CA facility to become one of the largest SAF hubs in North America, aiming for 250 million gallons per year.

Gevo Inc. is building its Net-Zero 1 facility in South Dakota, expected to produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually with the help of carbon capture and renewable energy.

LanzaJet, headquartered in Illinois, is completing its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Georgia with support from Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Energy.

Neste has expanded its U.S. footprint with SAF supply agreements at San Francisco and Los Angeles airports and a new Houston terminal.

Honeywell UOP and Chevron continue to scale up SAF production through co-processing infrastructure.

Trump Administration: Mixed Signals on SAF

Federal support, however, has become less consistent under the current administration. In February 2025, the Department of Energy (DOE) approved a $1.44 billion loan guarantee for Montana Renewables to expand its SAF facility in Great Falls—signaling at least some support for the sector. But that move contrasts with broader federal inaction:

On his first day in office, President Trump froze funding for numerous climate and energy programs, including clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This freeze has placed the future of SAF-related federal tax credits in limbo, creating deep uncertainty for developers and investors.

The administration has also rebranded SAF as ""synthetic aviation fuel"" in public documents—a rhetorical shift some interpret as a pivot toward domestic fossil-based alternatives.

While Trump has praised SAF as an economic boon for rural America and farmers, especially those producing corn and soy feedstocks, critics note the absence of any cohesive SAF strategy or commitment to lifecycle GHG accounting standards.

This has created what many in the industry describe as a “policy vacuum” at the federal level—one that is now being filled by states like Michigan, California, and Illinois.

What’s Next for SAF in the U.S.?

As SAF production technologies mature and airline demand continues to rise, the question is not whether the U.S. will expand its SAF market—but how quickly and under what regulatory structure. States that proactively support SAF may gain a competitive edge in attracting clean energy investment and positioning their airports as hubs for low-emissions travel.

With uncertainty clouding the future of federal tax credits and lifecycle emissions standards, industry players are increasingly turning to state programs, private capital, and long-term offtake agreements to derisk investments.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250625-172807-49c-A%20modern%20aircraft%20flying%20over%20green%20fields%20with%20a%20biofuel%20facility%20in%20the%20foreground%2C%20symbolizing%20sustainable%20aviation..jpg,N,,2025-06-27 13:09:57.065696

In contrast, Indonesia has a more aggressive policy, mandating a 40% palm oil blend in its biodiesel.
This strategy aligns with the nation’s climate goals and efforts to diversify its palm oil market.
Concerns about a potential oversupply in the market have also emerged due to higher palm oil stockpiles and increased production.
On Thursday, palm oil prices closed at 4,020 Malaysian ringgits ($951) per tonne, a dip from last week’s highs that were influenced by tensions between Israel and Iran and a nearly 20% surge in crude oil prices.","Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer of palm oil, is reportedly considering increasing the amount of palm oil used in its biofuels, a move that would mirror the policies of top producer Indonesia, according to industry sources, reports The Hindu Businessline.

Currently, Malaysia requires a 10% palm oil blend (B10) for transport fuels and a 20% blend (B20) for industrial use. In contrast, Indonesia has a more aggressive policy, mandating a 40% palm oil blend in its biodiesel.

Malaysia is also actively researching and developing palm-based aviation fuel, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and advanced biofuels. This strategy aligns with the nation’s climate goals and efforts to diversify its palm oil market. Industry insiders suggest that rising crude oil prices, often triggered by global political tensions, tend to boost interest in biofuels as an alternative energy source. This could lead to increased demand for palm-based biofuels in regions like Southeast Asia, India, and West Asia, spanning both transportation and industrial energy sectors.

The potential for higher biofuel demand alongside existing food security concerns presents a complex challenge for the global community.

Malaysia’s approach is consistent with that of other nations, such as the United States, which has reportedly proposed allowing refineries to blend a record amount of biofuel into gasoline and diesel next year. Brazil also recently decided to raise its biodiesel blend in diesel from 14% to 15%, effective August 1.

However, a cap on edible oil prices has been observed due to weaker immediate demand from major buyers like India, with signs suggesting that India’s soybean oil imports might decrease.

Concerns about a potential oversupply in the market have also emerged due to higher palm oil stockpiles and increased production. On Thursday, palm oil prices closed at 4,020 Malaysian ringgits ($951) per tonne, a dip from last week’s highs that were influenced by tensions between Israel and Iran and a nearly 20% surge in crude oil prices.

While Malaysia’s B20 biodiesel blend is currently in use only in specific areas, the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities noted in February 2025 that significant funding for infrastructure improvements would be needed to expand the B20 program nationwide. The industry is generally hoping for government financial support, but the government currently has no plans to provide it.

Malaysia introduced its National Biodiesel Programme in 2019, making B10 mandatory for the transport sector and B7 for the manufacturing sector in the same year. However, the B20 program has yet to be fully implemented across the country, being limited to areas such as Labuan, Langkawi, and parts of Sarawak in East Malaysia.

Malaysia exports biodiesel primarily to the European Union (which accounts for over 80% of its biodiesel exports), China, and Singapore, according to the Malaysian Biodiesel Association.

While some in the industry are optimistic about the future of biodiesel and partnerships with private companies, others remain cautious due to price instability. Indonesia’s mandatory B40 biodiesel program, for instance, led to tighter global supplies and made palm oil more expensive than competing oils like soybean oil.

As a result, palm oil’s share in India’s total edible oil imports dropped to 43% (from 58% in the previous year) during the first seven months of the 2024-25 oil year. However, Malaysian palm oil industry leaders view this decline as a temporary market trend, influenced by India’s domestic policies supporting oilseed expansion and diversification of edible oil sources.

Malaysian palm oil production is predicted to see a moderate increase in 2025 and 2026, thanks to better weather, replanting with higher-yielding crops, and improved harvesting efficiency through machinery and advanced technology. However, challenges like labor shortages and unpredictable weather patterns, along with slow adoption of new technology, could limit productivity gains.

“We anticipate prices to remain moderately strong into 2026 due to global political tensions affecting edible oil supply chains, fluctuating prices of rival oilseeds like soybean oil and sunflower oil, currency movements, and biofuel mandates,” the source stated. “However, uncertainties in demand from major importing countries might cause short-term price swings.” Palm oil production is particularly sensitive to weather and labor availability, which can lead to more frequent price changes.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Palm-Oil.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 15:06:21.087251

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has unveiled a groundbreaking platform designed to connect airlines with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers, a key step in accelerating the industry’s transition to more environmentally friendly fuels. The initiative, known as the SAF Matchmaker, is part of a broader effort to increase the availability and use of SAF within the aviation sector, which is pivotal in meeting global sustainability goals.

Bridging the Gap for SAF Procurement

The SAF Matchmaker platform is designed to simplify the procurement process for SAF by providing a centralized hub where airlines can easily find and connect with SAF suppliers. The platform streamlines the procurement process, reducing both the complexity and costs often associated with sourcing SAF. It aims to ensure a more efficient, transparent, and accessible SAF market, which is critical to meeting the aviation sector’s ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The platform functions as a matchmaking tool, allowing airlines to post requests for SAF while suppliers can offer their available quantities of the fuel. When a match is made, the parties can move their negotiations offline to finalize details such as price and payment terms. Initially, the SAF Matchmaker is available only to airlines and SAF suppliers but is expected to expand in the future to include buyers from non-aviation sectors as well.

Enhancing SAF Market Connectivity

IATA’s SAF Matchmaker addresses three core challenges currently facing the aviation industry in its pursuit of greater SAF adoption: efficiency, connectivity, and visibility. By providing a platform where all stakeholders can connect without additional fees, the initiative aims to expedite the procurement process, making it faster and more straightforward.

The SAF Matchmaker enhances connectivity by allowing SAF producers to post information on available or planned volumes of fuel. Airlines, in turn, can register their interest in purchasing specific SAF quantities. The platform also allows users to access detailed information about the available SAF, including its feedstock, location, technology used in production, emissions reductions, and compliance with major environmental frameworks such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

Facilitating a Sustainable Future for Aviation

The SAF Matchmaker platform is part of a larger strategy to build a fully functioning market for sustainable aviation fuel. This platform aims to reduce the barriers to SAF adoption by improving transparency and facilitating smoother connections between airlines and suppliers. By doing so, it plays a crucial role in driving the growth of the voluntary SAF purchasing market, which is essential for the aviation industry’s sustainability goals.

The Current Landscape of SAF Adoption

Sustainable aviation fuel has been slowly gaining traction in the aviation sector since its first use in a commercial flight back in 2008. While SAF still accounts for less than 1% of global aviation fuel consumption, demand has been steadily increasing. In 2023, SAF consumption surged to more than 600 million liters, doubling the previous year’s figures. With a robust growth trajectory, production is expected to exceed 2.7 billion liters in 2025, more than double the 1.3 billion liters anticipated for 2024.

This rapid growth underscores the momentum behind SAF adoption and highlights the crucial role that platforms like the SAF Matchmaker play in enabling airlines to source sustainable fuel more easily and efficiently. By helping to streamline the procurement process, the SAF Matchmaker is set to become a key tool in supporting the aviation sector’s transition to a more sustainable future.

Looking to the Future of SAF

The SAF Matchmaker platform is a significant step forward in the effort to scale up the use of sustainable aviation fuel. As the global aviation industry works towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, initiatives like this one are essential in creating a more sustainable and resilient fuel market. The platform not only simplifies the process of buying and selling SAF but also provides crucial visibility and transparency, making it easier for airlines to make informed decisions about their fuel supply.

With increasing demand and production of SAF, the aviation industry is on a clear path to a greener, more sustainable future. The SAF Matchmaker platform is poised to play a pivotal role in driving this transformation by ensuring that airlines have access to the fuel they need to meet their sustainability targets while reducing their environmental footprint.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__71596-38.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 11:09:19.945770

In a revolutionary move, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

Under the new facility, when there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues – efficiency, connectivity and visibility.

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market.

While SAF offers up to 80 per cent lifecycle emissions reduction, its availability remains patchy, its cost high, and its delivery infrastructure concentrated in a few locations. ATR’s collaboration with ATOBA tackles these challenges head-on through a dual approach, improving physical access to SAF at regional airports and embedding flexible systems for tracking and claiming its environmental impact.

The technical innovation lies in combining direct fuel logistics with a “book-and-claim” accounting model. This system, in line with internationally recognised emissions frameworks, allows airlines to take credit for SAF emissions savings even when the fuel is not delivered directly to their location. It’s a model designed to scale, offering immediate environmental benefits without waiting for infrastructure to catch up.

For ATR, this initiative isn’t a side project. It forms part of its broader 2030 goal to make its aircraft fully SAF-capable. That commitment requires more than engine adaptations, it demands a full ecosystem capable of supporting SAF uptake across a fragmented and globally dispersed user base. By working with ATOBA, a specialist in SAF aggregation and distribution, ATR is putting commercial practicality at the centre of its decarbonisation strategy.

The implications are significant. While much of the aviation sector’s sustainability conversation is dominated by large carriers and long-haul routes, regional aviation accounts for a vast number of daily flights across diverse geographies, many of them underserved by current fuel systems. Bringing SAF into these markets not only reduces emissions at scale, it also introduces consistency into a space that’s often left behind in regulatory frameworks.

What makes this approach notable from an investor perspective is its blend of ambition and operational realism. ATR isn’t just responding to pressure; it’s building systems. Delivery chains, emissions attribution models, and technical integration platforms are all part of a replicable blueprint, one that other segments of the industry could adopt if proven effective.

Moreover, ATOBA’s role adds financial and structural depth. As a SAF aggregator, it brings the purchasing power and contracting stability smaller carriers often lack. Their ability to pool demand, secure long-term supply, and manage regulatory interfaces reduces friction and enhances the bankability of sustainable fuel solutions. Together, they’re creating the kind of framework that enables action, not just intention.

This project’s timing also matters. With regulators moving toward mandatory SAF targets and carbon accounting tightening, the ability to offer airlines a turnkey path to compliance becomes not just attractive, but essential. ATR is positioning itself not merely as an aircraft supplier, but as a partner in regulatory readiness—an enabler of futureproof operations in a constrained and competitive market.

The real value here is strategic optionality. Regional airlines typically have limited leverage in fuel sourcing and limited capital to navigate environmental compliance. By removing access barriers and embedding SAF capability into both aircraft and supply systems, ATR enhances the resilience and relevance of its product offering. Investors would do well to watch how this model performs, not just in emissions savings, but in market adoption and repeatability.

What ATR and ATOBA are building is more than a single programme; it’s a modular, standards-based framework for making SAF viable in regions where demand exists but access has stalled. If successful, it could form the basis for broader transitions, not only for ATR customers, but for regional aviation as a whole.

ATR designs and manufactures turboprop aircraft used by regional airlines across the globe. By aligning with ATOBA Energy to expand access to sustainable aviation fuel, it is creating a commercial and operational pathway for emissions reduction tailored specifically to smaller carriers operating in dispersed markets.",https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Avation-plc.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 08:02:15.907363

Aviation fuel mandates, designed to propel the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), promise to reshape how the industry tackles climate challenges. But the path to achieving these goals is anything but straightforward.

The EU and UK are setting a precedent with their SAF mandates, requiring airlines to blend at least 2% of SAF into their jet fuel supply by 2025. At face value, the numbers sound achievable. Just over 1.2 million tonnes of SAF will be needed between the two regions. However, considering the EU’s jet fuel consumption hovers around 46 million tonnes annually and the UK at 11.9 million tonnes, the scale of transformation required is monumental.

But 2025’s mandate is just the start. The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation is targeting 6% SAF by 2030 and an ambitious 70% by 2050. Meanwhile, the UK is aiming for 10% by 2030, and while their trajectory is slightly different, the ultimate pressure to decarbonize is no less intense.

How, then, will these mandates be met? What hurdles might lie ahead for the aviation industry, and where do the opportunities begin to emerge?

The SAF production puzzle

New mandates aren’t just increasing SAF quotas but are also pushing for technologies like synthetic SAF and alternatives to the dominant HEFA pathway. While necessary for the long-term roadmap, these advancements come with their own cost and scalability concerns.

The move to SAF isn’t just about compliance, it’s an investment in resilience and innovation for the aviation industry.

She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

A “matchmaker” platform that links airlines with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers has been launched by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The initiative is aimed at boosting uptake of SAF within the aviation sector and comes as industry and government collaborates to increase its availability.

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market,” explained Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP sustainability and chief economist.

“The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.

“The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

How does it work?

IATA’s SAF Matchmaker initiative provides a central platform for those seeking to buy and sell SAF.

Specifically, it helps facilitate SAF procurement between airline customers and the energy companies producing the fuel by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, the SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as off-take agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only.

In the future, other sustainable fuel buyers in non-aviation related industries are also expected to be able to use it.

Why is it needed?

IATA says the platform is needed to address three key challenges: efficiency, connectivity and visibility.

The airline association says it will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees.

This in turn will drive further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

IATA’s platform will enhance connectivity by enabling SAF producers and suppliers to post available or planned SAF volumes, while airlines will be able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes.

However any trade will be done away from the platform.

The platform also provides information regarding the available SAF, volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

How much SAF is currently being used?

Since the first flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) took off in 2008, demand for the low-carbon fuel has steadily grown.

To date, around 500,000 flights have used SAF blends.

While SAF still makes up less than 1% of global aviation fuel consumption, usage surged in 2023 to over 600 million litres, doubling the previous year.

The upward trajectory is expected to continue, with production forecast to exceed 2.7 billion litres in 2025, more than double the estimated 1.3 billion litres in 2024, highlighting the rapid scaling of the sector.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AdobeStock_675386331-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 08:02:34.012352

The fuel, produced at Phillips 66’s renewable fuels facility in Rodeo, California, has been sent monthly to Los Angeles International Airport since December, reports Argus.

The agreement strengthens British Airways’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, although the deal’s pricing and future volumes remain undisclosed. Phillips 66 confirmed the ongoing monthly deliveries but did not elaborate further.

This deal follows a similar agreement announced last December, under which Phillips 66 began supplying SAF to United Airlines at airports in California and Illinois. The Rodeo refinery, which was converted primarily to renewable diesel production in early 2024, has since expanded its SAF output.

While the U.S. currently lacks mandates requiring the use of SAF—unlike the UK and European Union—it offers several financial incentives that support production. SAF producers in California can benefit from the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and a new federal clean fuel tax credit launched this year provides higher rewards for fuels that deliver greater emission reductions.

Phillips 66 produces SAF from a variety of domestic and international feedstocks, including vegetable oils, waste animal fats, and used cooking oil. The company is also exploring co-processing renewable feedstocks at its U.S. refineries, in addition to existing operations at its 221,000 b/d Humber refinery in the UK, where it has previously supplied SAF to British Airways.

Despite record SAF production in the U.S. this year, output of other biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel has declined. This drop is largely due to uncertainty surrounding future blending mandates and changes to the clean fuel tax credit.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration proposed record biofuel blend mandates but also suggested cutting credits for fuels made from imported feedstocks—common inputs at major coastal refineries. In Congress, both House and Senate Republicans have floated changes to the SAF tax credit, with a draft Senate bill proposing a future reduction in the extra incentive SAF receives compared to road fuels.

“Policy has been moving around, and that’s the real struggle,” said Brian Mandell, executive vice president of marketing and commercial at Phillips 66, speaking at the Reuters Global Energy Transition 2025 conference in New York.

Phillips 66 CEO Mark Lashier echoed the sentiment at another event this week. “Policy is getting clearer, but there’s still a lot of elements out there that we’re watching very carefully,” he said at the JP Morgan 2025 Energy, Power, Renewables, and Mining Conference.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-7.png,N,,2025-06-27 11:09:54.019750

The U.S. states of Florida and Texas alone generated more private jet flights and emissions than the entire European Union.
In Europe, the gasoline put in cars is taxed, but jet fuel — whether for commercial or private flights — is not.","The battle against climate change is also a class struggle: the ultra-rich generate far more emissions, while the poorest suffer the worst consequences. A clear example is private jets, which are increasingly used despite being the most polluting means of transport. A study by the NGO International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), published this Friday, delves into this issue: each private jet generates, on average, as many greenhouse gases (GHG) per year as 177 cars or eight heavy trucks — while transporting far fewer people or goods.

The report shows that private aviation emitted as many emissions in 2023 — the latest data available — as all the flights departing from Heathrow Airport, the largest in Europe. The researchers also estimate that the 95 jets flying to Venice for Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s wedding will generate 5,000 tons of greenhouse gases.

In the report, the researchers identified 3.57 million private flights in 2023, with each aircraft emitting an average of 810 tons of GHG annually — equivalent to the emissions of 177 cars or nine heavy trucks. Dan Rutherford, one of the researchers, notes via email: “Private jets are a significant, and largely untaxed, source of GHG pollution. Given the wealth of their users, governments should consider taxing their emissions to generate revenue to support aviation decarbonization and climate change mitigation.”

Private aviation grew significantly in 2021 and 2022, coinciding with the reduction in commercial flights in the post-COVID era. According to the study’s authors, private jets emitted approximately 23.74 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) — the unit used to measure greenhouse gases — in 2022, representing almost 4% of total civil aviation emissions. In 2023, that figure dropped to 19.5 million tons of CO₂e, although it is 25% higher than the figure from 10 years ago. As the number of commercial flights increased, this figure represents a lower percentage of all aviation emissions (just over 2% of the total).

What could be the reason for this slight decline? According to the researcher, “the figures suggest that private aviation activity is more volatile than commercial aviation, perhaps because it is less profit-driven: airlines have a strong incentive to optimize the number of trips their planes make each year by adjusting prices; private planes are likely to simply remain parked when demand drops.” Furthermore, 2023 was the year in which conventional commercial air routes returned to pre-pandemic levels.

If emissions from private jets represent such a small percentage of the total, why should we be concerned? “It’s better to analyze this from an equity perspective,” Rutherford responds. “Climate damage falls most heavily on the poorest, especially in the Global South, while private aviation is used for discretionary travel by the ultra-rich, and is largely untaxed. It makes sense to tax private jets to raise revenue to support decarbonization and adaptation.”

The ICCT shows that in 2023, two-thirds of global private jet flights departed from U.S. airports, accounting for more than half (55%) of the estimated GHG emissions from these aircraft. France and the United Kingdom were a distant second and third, with 2.2% and 2.1% of flights, respectively. The U.S. states of Florida and Texas alone generated more private jet flights and emissions than the entire European Union.

Short private flights

The researchers note that private planes are typically used for relatively short distances: half of the flights covered distances less than 900 kilometers (560 miles), while 75% were less than 1,500 kilometers (932 miles). Flights of more than 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) accounted for only 5% of the total. The average flight time was 85 minutes (less than an hour and a half).

For this reason, the ICCT is calling for these flights to be replaced by high-speed trains on all possible routes, as train times are very competitive over short and medium distances. Furthermore, they are calling for governments to tighten fuel efficiency (CO₂) requirements for new private aircraft and to mandate the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) for these flights, as is already beginning to happen with commercial aviation.

In Europe, the gasoline put in cars is taxed, but jet fuel — whether for commercial or private flights — is not. For this reason, the organization is calling for taxes to be imposed on private jets, which would help generate revenue for climate financing “by targeting passengers who are ultra-wealthy and less price-sensitive, allowing tax rates to bridge the 2-5 times cost gap between conventional jet fuel and renewable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), without heavily impacting commercial aviation.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/6VV4IB3YVVETJIZYEGIMP262JI.jpg?auth=03d28cd3f59ddab68f1d8b1d00cf3ed6d380f3bb0c0d8bafeb25590dcd7b9918&width=1200,N,,2025-06-27 08:02:39.812940

The national carrier revealed the plan during the launch of its 2024 Sustainability Report on June 26 in Nairobi. CEO Allan Kilavuka said Kenya Airways signed a memorandum of understanding with a local SAF producer and identified degraded former mining land in Kwale County to grow trees for feedstock.

“We want to be part of production… We shall have to come up with a framework of manufacturing capacity not only for sale for export but also for our local consumption,” he said as quoted by The Standard.

Fuel accounts for 30–35% of Kenya Airways’ operational costs and 64% of its emissions.

“The cost of SAF is estimated currently to be around four to five times the cost of traditional jet fuel… someone has to pay for it, and that is the passenger,” Kilavuka said.

To support carbon offsetting, the airline has planted 1.2mn trees and plans to maintain that number annually. The move supports climate goals under CORSIA and Africa’s Agenda 2063.

Kenya Airways’ plan aligns with a global shift towards SAF amid growing climate pressures. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF demand could reach 17mn tonnes annually by 2030, representing 4–5% of total jet fuel use. Yet current supply accounts for less than 0.2%, with minimal contribution from Africa.

Kilavuka said the airline, which is 48.9% owned by the Kenyan government, 38.1% by a consortium of local banks, and 7.8% by Air France–KLM, has also deployed 12 electric ground units and is working with the African Airlines Association to optimise routes.

He also highlighted KQ’s progress on gender inclusion. “As we talk right now, eight percent of our pilots are women,” Kilavuka said.

Principal Secretaries Festus Ng’eno and Teresia Mbaika praised the national carrier’s efforts, including its SAF initiative, emissions cuts, and commitment to the Fly Kenyan Policy.

In May 2023, it became the first African airline to use SAF on a long-haul flight. Kenya Airways also operates a pyrodiesel plant converting plastic waste.

What is Aviation Fuel?

What Aviation fuel refers to any fuel used to power airplanes or aeroplanes, primarily Jet A, Jet A-1, Jet B, and aviation gasoline (avgas). The chemical formula, composition, autoignition temperature, and flash point vary depending on the type. These properties are key to ensuring safe engine performance under extreme conditions.

Types of Aviation Fuel

Jet A/Jet A-1: Widely used in turbine engines. Jet A-1 is common in international operations due to its lower freezing temperature.

Jet B: A naphtha-kerosene blend suitable for cold climates. It is nearly clear and can be described as straw-colored.

Avgas (aviation gasoline): Used in small piston-engine aircraft; it contains lead and comes in different colors of aviation fuel (e.g., blue for 100LL).

Cryogenic Fuels: Including hydrogen fuel, being explored for future emissions-free flights.

Diesel: An emerging alternative, especially for use in smaller aircraft.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): A type of biofuel made from renewable sources, which aims to reduce carbon emissions.

Sustainable (and Alternative) Aviation Fuels

To reduce carbon emissions, biofuels such as carinata sustainable aviation fuel, non-oil seed crop sustainable aviation fuel, and non-food oilseed sustainable aviation fuel are being developed. These alternative fuels promise lower lifecycle emissions and can even be blended with traditional fuels.

The United States, India, and the EU are investing in SAF research and supply infrastructure. Airlines and FBOs (fixed-base operators) are increasingly participating in carbon offsetting programs.

General Aviation

Nearly every airport offers at least minimal services, primarily fuel. Typically, FBOs service general aviation aircraft. Many pilots rely on AirNav to locate fuel availability and price along with other important information about operations, communication, and runways. For example, in New Smyrna Beach (KEVB), pilots can see there is both Jet A fuel and 100LL avgas available on site.

Epic’s training aircraft run on 100LL because they have spark-ignition piston engines. The “100” indicates the octane rating, and “LL” stands for low lead. It is the most common fuel in general aviation. Fun fact: Manufacturers dye this fuel blue so pilots can tell it apart from other aviation fuel.

If you come across green fuel, that is 100/130 avgas. The octane rating is 100 under lean mixture conditions and 130 under rich mixture conditions.

Aviation Fuel Supply Chain

A robust system supports the global aviation fuel supply, including:

Brokers and suppliers manage the market.

Fuel trucks deliver to airports and to aircraft on site.

Fuel pumps, hoses, and tanks maintain safety.

Filter systems prevent fuel contamination.

Fuel cards and tracking sheets record logistics and taxation.

“Misfueling” or “Wrong Fueling” Accidents

When someone puts the wrong fuel into an aircraft, there is a potential for engine failure and crashes. There are too many of these to list, but we do go over this in pilot training and aircraft mechanic training. Some of these incidents include:

2021 – Beechcraft Baron 58: A fueler at the airport did not notice the “avgas only” sticker and fueled with Jet A, resulting in a crash that seriously injured the pilot.

2020 – Aero Commander 500 Shrike: An Alaska forestry plane on its way to fight forest fires crashed into a pond after taking off because the fuel vendor put the wrong fuel in. Passing teenagers who saw the crash rescued the four on board. Although the pilot signed the receipt, he did not notice it showed the wrong fuel.

2019 – Piper Aerostar 602P: A Tampa surgeon’s plane crashed killing him and his flight instructor because a fueler put Jet A In his plane instead of avgas.

This handful of examples is why we train our linemen at Epic along with our pilots and mechanics to be aware of how easily misfueling can occur.

“Our motto is ‘Safety First’ at Epic, and this includes how we operate on the ramp as well as in the classrooms and cockpits. We train our line crew members in safety procedures regarding aircraft fuel, and both pilots and aircraft mechanics receive training in fuel safety procedures.” –Josh Rawlins, Chief Operating Officer and Aircraft Mechanic Program Director

The 10 Most Common Reasons for Misfueling

Using the wrong fuel can cause serious engine damage or failure. That’s why FAA regulations, pre-flight inspections, and quality control procedures all emphasize fuel type verification. Sadly, investigators have traced many accidents and near-misses back to this simple but critical step.

These are the most common reasons someone might put the wrong fuel into an aircraft:

1. Miscommunication Between Pilot and Fueler

Verbal instructions may be unclear or misunderstood. Incorrect assumptions may be made without verifying fuel type.

2. Similar Appearance of Aircraft

Fuelers may assume a plane uses a certain type of fuel based on appearance (e.g., assuming all small planes use avgas), especially if aircraft models look alike.

3. Inadequate Labeling

Mistakes are more likely if the fuel caps or tanks aren’t clearly labeled with the required fuel type. If a label is worn or faded, replace it.

4. Use of Similar Fuel Nozzles

Jet fuel and avgas nozzles are sometimes not properly differentiated (though Jet A nozzles are wider by standard). If adapters are used, they can bypass this safeguard.

5. Fuel Truck Error

The wrong truck may pull up to the aircraft, especially at busy FBOs or during shift changes without proper documentation checks.

6. Human Error or Fatigue

Fatigue, distraction, or complacency by ramp personnel can lead to skipped verification steps. Focus for safety!

7. Unfamiliar Aircraft or Procedures

Pilots or ground crew may be unfamiliar with a specific aircraft’s fuel requirements (e.g., rental planes or chartered aircraft), increasing the risk of error.

8. Language Barriers or International Procedures

Although English is the universal language for pilots, that is not the case for ground crews. In non-English-speaking regions or international operations, differences in terminology or labeling can cause confusion.

9. Incorrect Assumptions by New Staff

New fuelers may incorrectly generalize (e.g., assuming all turbine engines use Jet A without checking specifics).

10. Poor Recordkeeping or Lack of SOPs

When pilots or others fail to follow or document proper checklists or refueling protocols, the chance of error increases.

Aviation Fuel Safety and Performance

Aviation fuel must withstand extreme temperature ranges and pressures. The autoignition temperature and flash point are crucial for safety. Jet fuel, for example, burns at very high temperatures, which supports high-speed, high-altitude airplane operations.

Refining processes remove impurities and create consistent grades. Each grade has a unique performance profile, which affects how an aircraft is fueled and serviced.

Cost and Fuel Efficiency

Aviation fuel is expensive due to refining, global demand, and taxation. Price may be listed per gallon, litre, pound, or unit of energy density. You can use an online fuel calculator to estimate consumption, rate, and carbon emissions.

Fuel additives improve burn efficiency and engine performance. Advanced engines also focus on maximizing fuel efficiency to reduce operating costs.

Comparing Aviation Fuel to Gasoline

Is aviation fuel the same as gasoline? Not quite. While avgas shares similarities with automotive fuel, it’s more refined and contains additives to support high-altitude performance. Jet fuels, based on kerosine, are entirely different, optimized for turbine engines.

Avgas 82UL is an unleaded aviation fuel with an octane rating of 82. It’s made for aircraft that can run on lower-octane fuel and is similar to car gasoline. Such aircraft are either approved by the manufacturer to use it or have a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) that allows the use of automotive gasoline (mogas) with a specific octane rating.

Aviation Fuel Jobs and Opportunities

The aviation fuel industry supports thousands of jobs in refining, service, supply, and analysis. As emerging technologies take hold, new roles in alternative fuels and SAF development are expanding. Here at Epic, our line crew takes care of refueling aircraft among many related tasks.

The Future of Aviation Fuel

Most of us in aviation agree that the future of aviation fuel lies in cleaner, more sustainable sources. With new technologies, increased awareness of carbon emissions, and investments in SAF, the aviation industry is shifting toward a more environmentally responsible model.

Understanding aviation fuel, its types, cost, and use, is key for everyone from pilots and mechanics to passengers concerned about carbon offsetting. As we explore alternative fuels and cutting-edge systems, the evolution of aviation fuel will remain central to the airplane industry’s innovation. As new products emerge, I will circle back and update this article.

Hi there. I have questions regarding flight training. For a beginner, what would the process be? Is 23 too old to start this type of trade school? You don't need any prior training or college, correct? Could you please email me and let me know the answers to my questions. The length of time it would take to complete courses to fly for airlines or something like that in the future? What kind of planes do you have ? How long does it take and what are all the fees? Do you guys have scholarships or financing options? How does that work? Is there like a tuition form you could send me as well with the break down? Is it all included or are there additional fees for gas and the instructors - what is the estimate for those fees ? I couldn't see it on your website. I am just trying to gather information for the best option for us. We have help just need to supply options to decide. I'll be in contact after we narrow our best options. Thank you for your time.

In the global movement toward decarbonisation, few sectors face as formidable a challenge as aviation. High energy density requirements and global mobility needs have made it difficult to reduce emissions without compromising operational efficiency. Yet, an emerging solution is offering a credible path forward: Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF.

Unlike conventional jet fuels, SAF is derived from renewable sources—such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-food biomass. What makes SAF particularly transformative is its compatibility with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure. This allows it to be adopted without significant operational disruption, which is a critical advantage in a sector where safety and consistency are non-negotiable.

Why SAF Matters: More Than Just a Drop-In Fuel

The benefits of SAF extend far beyond its green credentials. SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent when compared to traditional jet fuel. This makes it one of the most effective tools available for helping aviation reach its net-zero target by 2050.

Because SAF blends can be used in today’s aircraft without any modifications, they offer a practical and scalable way to decarbonise flights in the short- to medium-term. More importantly, SAF enables airlines to maintain their connectivity and economic contributions while progressing toward environmental benchmarks.

An Australian Milestone: SAF Takes Off from Proserpine

A noteworthy example of SAF in action comes from Queensland. In a landmark move, Viva Energy has partnered with Virgin Australia to supply SAF for a series of flights departing from Proserpine Airport between March and July 2025.

This partnership signifies more than just a supply contract. It is an operational demonstration of how SAF can be embedded into routine flight schedules. The blend used in these flights includes 30 to 40 percent synthetic fuel derived from waste and residue feedstocks, ensuring that environmental benefits are realised without compromising performance or safety.

The Economics of Scale: Affordability Through Collaboration

One of the primary challenges in SAF adoption has been cost. As a newer fuel type with limited production infrastructure, SAF is currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel. This is where collaborations like the one between Viva Energy and Virgin Australia become pivotal.

By piloting SAF in commercial settings, these stakeholders are gathering crucial data and laying the groundwork for economies of scale. Greater uptake and diversified production pathways could drive down costs over time, making SAF not only a sustainable choice but also a competitive one.

Infrastructure Investment: Preparing for Tomorrow’s Demand

Realising the full potential of SAF requires more than feedstock and intent—it demands infrastructure. To this end, Viva Energy has secured 2.39 million Australian dollars in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. This funding will be used to refurbish an existing fuel tank at the Pinkenba Terminal, converting it into dedicated SAF storage for Brisbane Airport.

This is a significant move. It signals the shift from pilot projects to scalable supply chains. By integrating SAF into existing pipeline distribution systems, stakeholders are future-proofing aviation fuel logistics and enabling greater accessibility across the network.

Innovation in Tracking: The Book-and-Claim System

Adopting SAF at scale also requires transparent accounting. To address this, Viva Energy is introducing a book-and-claim system. This mechanism allows sustainability certificates to be traded independently of physical SAF deliveries, enabling companies to claim environmental benefits even when direct SAF usage is not feasible.

The approach is especially useful for international carriers and corporations looking to support decarbonisation without logistical constraints. In effect, it makes the sustainability impact of SAF more universally accessible.

The Strategic Outlook: Why This Matters for the Industry

The partnership between Viva Energy and Virgin Australia—and the associated infrastructure and certification mechanisms—demonstrate a comprehensive vision for SAF adoption. It is not just about fuel. It is about building a commercially viable, environmentally aligned aviation system that can scale.

As Nick Adams, General Manager for Aviation at Viva Energy, aptly points out, SAF will play an increasingly important role for commercial airlines aiming to meet both regulatory expectations and growing consumer demand for responsible travel.

Conclusion: A Collective Ascent Towards Sustainable Flight

The trajectory of SAF is not merely a technical evolution—it is a systems-level transformation. From feedstock to fuel tank, from airport to airspace, the integration of SAF is a testament to what is possible when industry, innovation, and policy align.

These developments are not isolated. They are signposts in a larger journey toward sustainable air travel. As more airports, fuel suppliers, and airlines align on this front, the feasibility of net-zero aviation becomes less a vision and more a grounded strategy.

The road ahead will require continued investment, cross-sector collaboration, and transparent governance.

The evidence was presented to the UK Government’s Environmental Audit Committee earlier this month.","Aviation emissions are continuing to rise, the Government’s independent advisors have warned.

In its assessment of the Government’s progress on reducing emissions, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) found that while overall emissions fell 2.5% in 2024, the tenth consecutive year of sustained reduction in emissions, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic years 2020 and 2021, emissions in the aviation sector increased by nine percent in 2024.

The total emissions for aviation in 2024 were 38.4 MtCO2e, marking a return to pre-pandemic levels. The Government’s 2022 Jet Zero Strategy (JZS) and CBDP, and the Seventh Carbon Budget Balanced Pathway all require emissions to stay flat and start decreasing slowly over the rest of the decade.

The CCC says “Limiting emissions in this way will be difficult if passenger numbers increase without sufficient counterbalancing uptake of low-carbon solutions.”

One of these is the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This increased in 2024, and as a proportion of all jet fuel used in UK aviation rose substantially, from 0.7% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024.

The UK has a mandate to achieve 10% by 2030, however, and so the CCC said that the overall rise in aviation emissions are “posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets”.

Although business travel has continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the CCC said that the “most significant driver of aviation emissions since 1990 has been rising demand for international flights, particularly leisure.”

The increase in demand for leisure flights has also been powered by a rise in demand for ‘medium haul’ destinations from the UK.

The New Economics Foundation has identified that as a result of carbon taxes on intra-European flight (through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), there has been a significant increase in leisure flights to ‘medium-haul’ leisure destinations such as Turkey, Greece, the Canary Islands, Morocco, Egypt, Albania, and Saudi Arabia.

The Foundation predicts this trend will increase as the ETS rates increase next year, pushing up prices on short haul flights within Europe and so, ironically, increasing emissions from leisure flights as these increase in duration.

The evidence was presented to the UK Government’s Environmental Audit Committee earlier this month.

GSNR is a nonprofit public benefit corporation established by rural counties to address the urgent issue of catastrophic fires from overgrown and under-managed forests. The group’s initial plans focused on the conversion of woody biomass gathered as part of forest treatment and restoration activities into wood pellets that would be exported for use in large-scale power production and similar applications. The plans included the development of a 700,000-metric-ton-per-year pellet plant in Lassen County and a 300,000-metric-ton-per-year facility in Tuolumne County, along with storage infrastructure at the Port of Stockton.

GSNR in early 2024 signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Drax US BECCS Development LLC “for the joint exploration of sustainable biomass opportunities with a focus on advancing forest resilience and promoting green energy initiatives worldwide.”

In October 2024, GSNR announced the release of a draft environmental impact report (DEIR), as required by the California Environmental Quality Act, for the proposed wood pellet project. The DEIR specified that the MOU with Drax was explicitly non-binding and did not commit Drax to purchase or use any quantity of wood pellets or otherwise become involved in GSNR’s project.

Documents published ahead of GSNR’s June 25 board of directors meeting indicates that the organization received more than 5,500 public comments in response to the DEIR and had identified three viable paths forward for the project.

Under one option, GSNR would have continued with the development of the two proposed full-scale wood pellet plants, updating the project based on the findings of CEQA analysis and comments received. Under another option, GSNR would paused further development at both proposed project sites.

The board, however, voted to move forward with a plan revise the scope of the project, which could include reducing the size and throughput of both facilities while transitioning from producing wood pellets for export to the production of wood chips for domestic use. GSNR noted wood chips could have applications in domestic alternative energy production, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marine biofuels, or in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) applications. Alternatively, wood chips can be used to produce wood products, such as oriented strand board.

According to information published by GSNR, the pivot to wood chip production would significantly lower the project’s capital costs and environmental footprint. The reduced scale of the wood chip project configuration may also facilitate CEQA review and permitting, and expedite site development timelines, improving the feasibility of near-term deployment, the group explained.

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 litres per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritise climate action over their very tight profit margins .

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the UK wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonise aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",,N,,2025-06-26 20:03:37.234028

With deep roots in aerospace innovation and a thriving clean tech ecosystem, Washington state is one of the leaders in the nation in advancing SAF technologies, infrastructure, and investment.

What is SAF and Why Does It Matter?

SAF is a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from non-petroleum feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste, algae, and even captured carbon. When blended with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel (typically at levels between 10% and 50%, depending on the specific SAF and regulatory approvals), SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, without requiring modifications to current aircraft engines or airport fueling systems. This drop-in compatibility makes SAF a scalable and immediate solution for sustainable air travel.

What are SAF Made Of? The Diverse Feedstock Landscape

While SAF is increasingly being integrated into existing airport fuel supply chains, dedicated “SAF hubs” emerge as strategic locations for production, blending, storage, and distribution. The “sustainable” in SAF refers to the renewable nature of its source materials. SAF can be produced from a wide array of feedstocks through various technological pathways:

Used Cooking Oil and Animal Fats (HEFA Pathway): Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) are currently the most mature and widely used pathway. This involves refining waste oils, greases, and animal fats.

Agricultural and Forestry Residues: Waste products from farming (like crop residues and forestry residues) and forestry operations can be converted into SAF.

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW): Non-recyclable household and commercial waste, including food scraps, yard waste, and packaging materials, can be transformed into jet fuel, diverting waste from landfills.

Algae: Certain types of algae can be cultivated and processed to produce biofuels suitable for aviation.

Purpose-Grown Energy Crops: Non-food crops grown on marginal lands can be used as dedicated feedstocks for SAF.

Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ): This pathway converts alcohols, such as ethanol (derived from corn, sugarcane, or cellulosic biomass) or isobutanol, into jet fuel.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) or eFuels: A newer and promising technology that involves synthesizing captured carbon dioxide (from industrial sources or direct air capture) with green hydrogen (produced using renewable electricity) to create synthetic liquid hydrocarbons.

The choice of feedstock and production technology significantly influences the overall carbon reduction potential of the SAF.

How Do SAF Hubs Work?

SAF hubs function as nexuses in the SAF supply chain:

Feedstock Sourcing: Hubs are often strategically located near sources of viable feedstock or with good transportation links to receive them.

Production: Dedicated refineries or retrofitted conventional refineries utilize various approved technologies (HEFA, AtJ, PtL, etc.) to convert feedstocks into SAF.

Blending: The neat SAF is then blended with conventional jet fuel to meet current certification standards (e.g., up to a 50% blend).

Storage and Distribution: The blended SAF is stored and then distributed to airports through existing pipelines, tankers, or dedicated fueling infrastructure.

“Book and Claim” Systems: Many regions also utilize “book and claim” systems. This allows an airline or corporation to purchase SAF certificates (SAFc) representing the environmental benefits of a certain volume of SAF, even if the physical fuel is not delivered to their specific location. The actual SAF is used by an aircraft operator at an airport where it is physically available. This system helps aggregate demand, fund SAF production, and allows entities to meet their emission reduction goals regardless of their geographical proximity to SAF supply.

Economic Development Through Clean Aviation

SAF market is projected to exceed $6.9 billion in the U.S. by 2030. With Greater Seattle’s aerospace supply chain, skilled talent, and abundant clean energy, the region is uniquely positioned to capture a significant share of that market. SAF innovation is already spurring job creation, attracting international investment, and strengthening our region’s leadership in next-generation fuels. These efforts support both metro and rural communities, from Moses Lake to Walla Walla to the Puget Sound.

Incentives: Fueling the Growth of SAF

Federal programs such as the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge aim to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030. Washington’s policy leadership, including state tax incentives up to $2/gallon, complements the national framework, creating fertile ground for SAF innovation and commercialization.

Investment Landscape: Who is Investing in SAF?

Significant investments are flowing into the SAF sector from a diverse range of players:

Airlines: Major carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air France-KLM, British Airways (IAG), Qantas, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines are making substantial investments in SAF through direct procurement agreements, equity stakes in SAF producers, and partnerships to develop new production facilities.

Energy Companies: Traditional oil and gas giants like Shell, Neste, TotalEnergies, and ExxonMobil are leveraging their refining expertise and infrastructure to become major SAF producers. They are investing in new facilities and retrofitting existing ones.

Specialized Biofuel Companies: Dedicated SAF producers and developers like Gevo, World Energy, Fulcrum BioEnergy, and LanzaTech are attracting significant capital to scale up their innovative production technologies.

Private Equity and Infrastructure Investors: Firms such as Bain Capital (investing in EcoCeres) and Brookfield Asset Management (investing in Infinium) recognize the long-term potential of SAF and are injecting substantial capital into SAF projects and infrastructure.

Aircraft and Engine Manufacturers: Companies like Boeing and Airbus are actively involved in SAF development, testing, and investing in SAF initiatives to ensure compatibility and promote adoption. Honeywell is also a key technology provider and investor.

Governments: Beyond incentives, governments are directly investing in research and development and providing financial backing for pioneering SAF projects.

The World Economic Forum highlights the need for an estimated $19-45 billion in capital expenditure by 2030 to meet SAF production demands.

Switching to lower-carbon fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel for air travel, is one of the strategies included in the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation's forthcoming emissions reduction plan.

That plan is a requirement of a landmark settlement agreement the state reached with a group of youth plaintiffs last summer who claimed the state hadn't done enough to reduce climate pollution from the transportation sector. HDOT is expected to release a draft of the plan on Friday.

HDOT director Ed Sniffen told lawmakers on Wednesday that transitioning to lower-carbon fuels and electrification across air, marine, and ground travel will have the ""biggest impact"" of all the emissions-reduction strategies that have been evaluated.

Domestic aviation is responsible for about a quarter of the state's total emissions.

The aviation industry has already been working to swap out jet fuel with lower-carbon alternatives, and many airlines that service Hawaiʻi including Hawaiian and Alaska have set their own emissions-reduction goals.

But sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive than conventional fuel and in limited supply, and Sniffen said the state's timeline to achieve net-zero emissions is more aggressive than those set by the airlines.

""It's difficult for industry to swallow. There's going to be additional costs that come to them, additional costs that come to all of us as users,"" Sniffen said.

Sniffen said HDOT has had conversations with stakeholders in the aviation, marine, and ground transportation sectors about the hurdles in the state's transition away from fossil fuels.

""I will say none of the industries are pushing back and saying, 'This is not important.' They're just saying, 'We got to see how we do this so we can afford it,'"" he added.

A clean fuel standard could incentivize the development and use of lower-carbon fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel, and even electrification through tax credits.

HDOT says it plans to prepare a legislative package for lawmakers ahead of the 2026 legislative session that could include a clean fuel standard.

""The state needs to take some action, similar to states such as California and Washington, to make these fuels competitive in the market,"" said Nicholas Nishimura, a rising junior at Waipahu High School and a member of HDOT's youth council, which has been working with the department on its greenhouse gas reduction plan.

Nishimura cautioned that the transition away from imported gasoline and jet fuel may raise costs for Hawaiʻi consumers.

The goal is clear: to simplify, accelerate, and bring transparency to the SAF procurement process in a market that is still developing.

A Solution for Three Key Challenges

SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical needs in the sector:

1. Efficiency in SAF Procurement

The platform centralizes SAF requests and offers, eliminating barriers and additional costs. This significantly reduces the time and complexity airlines face when searching for suppliers, thereby fostering the growth of the voluntary SAF market.

2. Direct Connectivity Between Stakeholders

Producers and suppliers of sustainable fuel can post available or projected volumes, while airlines register their interest in acquiring specific quantities. When a match is made, the parties can take negotiations offline to finalize details such as pricing and payment terms.

3. Market Visibility and Transparency

The system provides detailed information about each available SAF batch: volume, feedstock used, location, production technology, associated emission reductions, and compliance with international regulations such as CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) or the EU Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

→ EASA and IATA Launch Global Plan to Mitigate GNSS Interference Risks

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, highlighted the strategic impact of this tool: “To achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. SAF Matchmaker demonstrates IATA’s commitment to building a fully operational market that facilitates SAF adoption, reducing costs and barriers for airlines.”

Exclusive Platform, for Now

In its initial phase, SAF Matchmaker will be available exclusively to airlines and SAF suppliers. However, IATA anticipates that other buyers, such as corporations from sectors not directly related to aviation, may join later.

UK in formal talks to avert biofuel plant closure

London, 26 June (Argus) — Associated British Foods (AFB), the multinational food and ingredients group, has said it will shut its 416mn litres/yr Vivergo bioethanol plant near Hull, eastern England, before 13 September unless the UK government agrees to urgent support measures. The company confirmed that ""formal negotiations"" with the government are now under way to find a ""sustainable solution"". But with the outcome uncertain, it has already stopped purchasing wheat feedstocks as of 11 June and begun consultations with staff ""to effect an orderly wind-down"" once existing contractual obligations are met. ABF said the government would need to provide ""both short-term funding of Vivergo's losses and a longer-term solution"" to avoid closure. The future of the plant ""will depend on whether the negotiations deliver a credible route forwards"", it said. The closure threat follows a UK-US trade agreement that removes import tariffs on up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol — roughly equal to total UK demand. Domestic producers say the deal has made the UK market unviable by allowing cheaper US imports to undercut local output. Paul Kenward — chief executive of ABF Sugar, the division of ABF that includes Vivergo Fuels — told MPs earlier this month that the trade deal effectively hands the UK market to US exporters. He proposed raising the UK's ethanol blending mandate from E10 to E15, saying this would give the industry ""room to breathe"", and also suggested a support package worth £75mn/yr ($100mn) for up to two years to help the sector adjust. Vivergo previously told Argus that an E15 mandate could boost demand by 660mn l/yr and highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors. German-owned Ensus, which operates the UK's only other bioethanol plant at Wilton on Teesside, has also warned of potential closure. The firm told Argus that it received a letter from the government's minister for business and trade acknowledging the economic challenges it faces as a direct result of the US trade deal. Ensus said it welcomed the government's recognition of its request for regulatory changes that could help the UK industry remain viable, along with the need for interim financial support.

Australian gas firm sued over ‘greenwashing’ claim

Adelaide, 26 June (Argus) — Australia's competition regulator is suing gas distributor Australian Gas Networks (AGN) in the federal court, alleging ""greenwashing"" occurred in an advertising campaign in 2022 and 2023. AGN misled customers when it ran ""Love Gas"" TV and digital advertisements claiming that gas in its network would be renewable within a generation without holding reasonable grounds that would be the case, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. ""It is not currently possible to distribute renewable gas at scale and at an economically viable price,"" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said on 26 June. ""We allege even though AGN knew the future of renewable gas was uncertain, it made an unqualified representation to consumers that it would distribute renewable gas to households within a generation."" AGN, a major gas distribution firm owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK, forms part of the firm's Australian Gas Infrastructure (AGIG) business. The distributor services more than 1.3mn customers via about 27,000km of distribution networks and 1,300km of gas pipelines. The firm strives to provide clear and accurate communications about the role and benefits of natural gas today and renewable gas into the future and that the company will defend the claims in court, a spokesman for AGIG said. AGIG, an early developer of small-scale green hydrogen blending in gas networks, plans to start operations of its 10MW Hydrogen Park Murray Valley project in late 2025. A 1.25MW project in South Australia's state capital Adelaide began operations in 2021 . Canberra promised to police claims about emissions more strictly, pledging millions of dollars in 2023 to fund regulatory oversight of fossil fuel producers and distributors . The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's first court action for alleged greenwashing was against Mercer Superannuation and concluded in August 2024. The federal court fined the pension fund A$11.3mn ($7.4mn) for misleading statements about seven ""Sustainable Plus"" investment options. The court found that the options included investments in 15 companies involved in fossil fuel sales, such as BHP, Glencore and Whitehaven Coal.

Brazil's E30, B15 blends to start 1 Aug: Update

Adds statement from National oil and gas institute IBP. Sao Paulo, 25 June (Argus) — Brazilian regulators have approved an increase in ethanol and biodiesel blending into fossil fuels effective 1 August. In a meeting of the mines and energy ministry and national energy policy council CNPE today, the government decided to move forward with an increase in ethanol blending rates into gasoline to 30pc to make E30, and to blend 15pc biodiesel into diesel to create B15. CNPE is evaluating the feasibility of raising ethanol blends to a 22-35pc range and biodiesel blends to a 13-25pc range, mines and energy ministry's biofuels department director Marlon Arraes said during Argus ' Biofuels & Feedstocks Latin America Conference, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. National oil and gas institute IBP declared its support for the ethanol and biodiesel blend increases, while asking for more autonomy for hydrocarbons regulator ANP to improve quality monitoring and ensure safety to final consumers. The fuel of the future program, introduced to the Congress on September 2023, spurred more than R53bn ($9.6bn) of investments in biodiesel to achieve a 25pc mix by 2026, as well as R24bn invested in ethanol to reach a 35pc blend that same year, Arraes said. Investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) through advanced geological techniques reached R140bn, while investments in biomethane and products such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel reached bring that total up to R260bn. Cost competitiveness, feedstock supply risks and regulatory instability remain hurdles to a wider biofuel framework in Brazil, he said. The fuel of the future program avoided 705mn metric tonnes (t) of CO2 equivalent, Arraes said, mostly from CCUS and biodiesel investments. ""We need to engage in our way to produce biofuels and sustainable energy to deliver to society the cheapest decarbonization that we can"", he added.

Initiated by the Chinese General Consulate in Frankfurt and co-organized by Xinhuanet and other Chinese and German organizations, the second Sino-European Corporate ESG Best Practices Conference is held here with aim to pay tribute to the companies that have fared well in putting the ESG concept into practice and promote further cooperation between Chinese and European companies in this regard.

ESG is no longer an add-on, but a strategic element of modern corporate management. It helps identify risks early, set standards, and build long-term, stable partnerships, said Thorsten Giehler, head of Economy, Employment, Social Development of Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, a service provider for international cooperation for sustainable development and international educational work.

Giehler called on stakeholders to work on clear, practical rules which can provide guidance and planning security to facilitate the application of ESG.

Huang Yiyang, Chinese Consul General in Frankfurt, believed that the function of ESG should go well beyond a technical jargon and be considered as a solution for the future.

As staunch defenders of the ideas of multilateralism, open cooperation and green transformation, China and Europe should stand out and join hands to provide leadership and confidence for the global cause of ESG at a time of rising uncertainties, Huang stressed in a speech made on Wednesday night.

As a co-organizer of the conference, Xinhuanet intends to boost the dissemination and applications of the ESG concept among Chinese and European companies, Chu Xuejun, chairman of the board of Xinhuanet Co., Ltd. told Xinhua. It will not only be beneficial for China and Europe to achieve a win-win result in green transformation, but also set a solid stage for further and deeper economic and trade cooperation between the two sides, Chu added.

With a case detailing the joint initiative with Air China, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Technical Pathway Challenge for Chinese Universities, Airbus Germany turned out to be one of the winners at the conference.

""This recognition highlights both the project's impact and the strong partnership between China and the EU,"" said Anna Lisa Junge on behalf of Airbus Germany.

""Today's recognition inspires us to go further. We look forward to deepening our cooperation with Air China and other partners, advancing SAF and broader ESG practices -- in China, and for the globe.""

ESG application cases in areas including environment protection, social responsibility, corporate management, scientific and technological innovation, education and training, and other ESG-related innovative practices, have been submitted to the conference for review by a committee consisting of Chinese and European experts.

The two-day event also featured CEO dialogues, application case study, discussions and roadshows, with leading Chinese and European companies looking to explore the possibility of putting the ESG concept into better mass practices. ■",,N,,2025-06-26 17:07:26.809618

It is a proactive solution that supports our local farmers, boosts our agriculture industry and better ensures stable fuel costs—all while also helping cut harmful emissions.”","The Michigan Senate passed bipartisan legislation June 25 to help launch the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Michigan.

Sponsored by Senate Majority Floor Leader Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, and Sen. Joseph Bellino, R-Monroe, Senate Bills 235–36 would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of SAF—a move that would support Michigan’s farmers and economy while reducing the state’s carbon footprint.

“It has been an exciting process to partner with my colleagues across the aisle and across the chamber on this legislation, which not only aims to support Michigan farmers but—in continuing what was outlined in the Clean Energy Future plan—would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,” Singh said. “This legislation will open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the connection between our agricultural sector and the state’s energy goals.”

SAF is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced using biobased renewable products manufactured from crops like soybeans or corn.

By providing a $1.50-per-gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce or blend sustainable aviation fuel, this legislation would directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning SAF.

Additional incentives are available if greater emissions reductions are reached.

There is a maximum incentive cap of $4.5 million annually in the first year, and $9 million each year after.

With environmental concerns rising and governments pushing for cleaner, greener alternatives, sustainability is now a central focus for aviation companies, professionals, and stakeholders alike. It is no longer a niche area of expertise, but a foundational aspect that every aviation professional must understand and act upon.

According to Marie Owens, Senior Vice President of Sustainability & Chief Economist at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainability is “a very existential issue for our industry and for the world in its approach to our industry.” This statement underscores the importance of sustainability in aviation and highlights the urgency of action as the industry grapples with rising environmental pressures.

The Need for a Collective Approach

The aviation sector has long been aware of its environmental impact, but the scale of that impact—and the responsibility to address it—has grown significantly in recent years. Governments worldwide have set ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the aviation sector is no exception. The European Union’s aviation emissions trading system (EU ETS), the United States’ climate commitments, and similar initiatives from other nations highlight the growing regulatory pressure on the industry to reduce carbon footprints.

Governments have also taken steps to encourage greener practices by providing funding and support for research into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), electric aircraft technologies, and more efficient air traffic management systems. The UK, for instance, recently launched its Green Aviation Strategy, which includes a roadmap for net-zero emissions by 2050. These actions reflect an undeniable truth: sustainability is not optional but essential to the future of aviation.

In this context, the role of aviation professionals is more critical than ever. Professionals across all levels of the industry—from engineers and pilots to policymakers and sustainability officers—must work collectively to advance the sector’s sustainability agenda.

Training: A Vital Step Toward Sustainability Expertise

As sustainability becomes increasingly central to the aviation industry, governments and aviation organizations are emphasizing the need for specialized training to equip professionals with the skills necessary for this transformation. The IATA recognizes that moving toward sustainability requires not only investment in technologies and infrastructure but also in people. Professionals with expertise in sustainable practices are in high demand.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, has long advocated for environmental responsibility within aviation. In 2019, ICAO established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which is a global market-based measure aimed at helping the sector offset its emissions. This initiative further underscores the growing need for professionals who are well-versed in sustainability principles, carbon offset programs, and green aviation technologies.

Training programs and courses designed to promote sustainability awareness and expertise are essential to help professionals keep pace with the evolving needs of the industry. Whether it’s understanding how to integrate sustainable aviation fuel into flight operations or navigating the regulatory landscape of carbon emissions trading, training will be crucial for professionals who want to remain competitive in the workforce.

Three Key Steps to Enhance Your Sustainability Skills

As aviation faces growing demands to meet sustainability goals, professionals must adopt a proactive approach to ensure their skills align with industry needs. Below, we outline three key steps that aviation professionals can take to build a sustainable skill set and stay competitive in this rapidly evolving field.

1. Stay Informed About Global Regulations and Policies

Government policies and international agreements play a key role in shaping the aviation industry’s path toward sustainability. Professionals must stay up-to-date with regulatory developments, such as the EU’s Green Deal, ICAO’s CORSIA, and any region-specific initiatives. Understanding how these policies impact the aviation sector—and your specific role—will allow you to make informed decisions and ensure compliance.

Governments are also focusing on providing incentives and grants to support the transition to sustainable aviation. Familiarizing yourself with such programs can open doors to funding and innovation within your organization.

2. Invest in Specialized Training and Certification

Many governments and international organizations, including the IATA and ICAO, offer specialized training programs aimed at fostering sustainability expertise in aviation professionals. These courses can cover topics ranging from carbon emissions management to the implementation of sustainable aviation technologies.

Certifications such as the IATA Environmental Management for Aviation (EMA) and ICAO’s environmental courses can add significant value to your resume, proving your commitment to sustainability and boosting your career prospects. By enhancing your qualifications, you not only increase your value as a professional but also contribute to advancing the industry as a whole.

3. Foster Collaboration and Innovation

Sustainability in aviation requires the collective efforts of all stakeholders. Governments, airlines, manufacturers, regulators, and academics must work together to achieve the sector’s environmental goals. As an aviation professional, you can contribute by actively engaging with sustainability initiatives and collaborating with others in the field.

Look for opportunities to partner with organizations focused on sustainability or join forums and working groups that drive innovation in green aviation. By sharing knowledge and ideas, you will contribute to the collective effort to build a more sustainable aviation future.

Conclusion

Sustainability in aviation is no longer a choice but a necessity. With the environmental impacts of the aviation industry being scrutinized more than ever, governments and organizations worldwide are pushing for greener practices, and professionals must keep pace with these developments. By focusing on continuous training, staying informed about global policies, and actively fostering collaboration, aviation professionals can help build a sustainable future for the industry. As we celebrate World Environment Day, let’s reflect on the collective responsibility we share in ensuring that aviation continues to take flight toward a greener, more sustainable tomorrow.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sustainable-aviation-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 19:05:08.532118

S Africa's Natref refinery set for July-Oct work

London, 26 June (Argus) — South Africa's 107,000 b/d Natref refinery in Sasolburg will undergo a partial maintenance shutdown from July to October affecting several of its units. The turnaround is understood from South African market sources to affect units producing gasoline, middle distillates and heavy end products, including bitumen. The refinery's bitumen customers received communication on 24 June from UK-based Prax Group, Natref's minority shareholder with a 36.4pc stake, saying the refinery will undergo maintenance work from 14 July to 8 October. An official at Sasol, which holds a 63.3pc controlling stake in Natref, said today it could not comment on the refinery's maintenance plans, while Prax officials have so far been unavailable for comment. The refinery's bitumen customers were informed in April that it would cease bitumen production in September, with final stocks of the product to be sold out a month later. The move will be one of the results of a major upgrade programme at the refinery that will enable it to run on light sweet crudes and comply with the country's Clean Fuels 2 regulations that come into force on 1 July 2027. Bitumen market participants said they have been informed that Sasol will maintain normal bitumen production and supply during the upcoming turnaround, while Prax will have no availability of the product. Bitumen production and truck loadings only resumed in early June , following an unexpected outage in mid-May caused by steam supply issues.

Shell moves to quash BP deal talk

London, 26 June (Argus) — Shell today reiterated it is not considering a bid for its UK peer BP, following up its denial on Wednesday, 25 June, and pointed to a London listing rule that imposes restrictions on making an offer. The denials were prompted by a report in the Wall Street Journal that Shell was in early-stage discussions about a possible acquisition of BP. That in turn followed a Bloomberg article in May that said Shell had been evaluating the feasibility of acquiring its rival. Today Shell explicitly pointed to Rule 2.8 of the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which imposes restrictions on a party that has said it does not intend to make an offer for a company that is subject to the code. Usually once a party has said it does not intend to bid for a company subject to the code, that party cannot then make a takeover approach for a period of six months. Shell did note, however, that it has the right to set the Rule 2.8 restrictions aside under certain circumstances, such as if a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for BP. Shell's management team has repeatedly emphasised that the company sees better value in its own shares, which it believes are rated too low by investors. ""Everything we do has to rank against… the shares and the buying back of the shares,"" chief financial officer Sinead Gorman noted on the company's first-quarter earnings call in May.

But unlike the E.U. which has established a long-term SAF strategy with its mandates under ReFuelEU (requiring 70% of all fuel uplifted at EU airports be SAF by 2050)2, U.S. SAF policy remains in a state of limbo especially as the H.R. 1 bill (President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”) headed for a Senate vote seeks to hamper the ability of the country’s leading SAF policy - the 45z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit - to truly encourage sustainable SAF production. This paper provides an overview of the technological options available to the U.S. based on its available resources, finding that despite the early success of the HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway, domestic SAF will have to be carried forward by Alcohol-to-Jet, Gasification, and e-SAF pathways. Policy improvements are then recommended to ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of SAF production, in particular for the Alcohol-to-Jet and e-SAF sectors that have a more complex scaling road ahead of them. The objectives of these recommendations include but are not limited to ensuring a thorough LCA understanding of corn ethanol, strengthening the requirements of the Renewable Fuel Standard, and promoting the competitiveness of American electro-fuels. Their ultimate goal, however, is to reach domestic production levels of truly sustainable SAF in line with the targets of the federal government’s Grand SAF Challenge: meeting the projected domestic demand of 35 billion gallons annually by 2050.",Not Available,https://escholarship.org/images/escholarship-facebook2.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 18:13:14.008837

It comes at an opportune moment when it’s marking its record-setting maiden first-ever first flight on its golden 50th-anniversary celebration, marking a grand resurgence for supersonic passenger aircraft.

A Landmark Decision: The “Concorde Bill”

This revival has been made possible by the executive order signed by former U.S. President Donald J. Trump on June 6th, 2025, widely referred to as the “Concorde Bill.” This significant legislation lifts a decades-long ban that had stifled supersonic innovation due to environmental concerns and the disruptive sonic booms created by previous-generation aircraft flying over populated areas. Originally enacted to mitigate noise pollution and environmental impact, the ban effectively halted all progress in supersonic passenger aviation over continental land.

With this landmark regulatory shift, experts predict unprecedented innovation, reigniting global interest and investment in sustainable supersonic technology. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) anticipates significant economic benefits from this resurgence, along with measurable advancements in aerospace engineering and environmental sustainability.

Sustainable Technology: Greener, Quieter, Faster

While the legendary exterior silhouette of Concorde remains unchanged—preserving its status as an icon of aviation elegance—the technology beneath its sleek skin has been entirely transformed. The new-generation Concorde will be approximately 50% lighter than the original model, achieved through the use of advanced composite materials. This significant weight reduction directly translates to superior fuel efficiency and a reduced environmental footprint.

Powered primarily by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the reborn Concorde will deliver an impressive 80% reduction in emissions compared to its predecessor. This dramatic environmental improvement aligns with global aviation goals outlined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which advocates for increased sustainability within the industry.

Additionally, extensive research and design innovations by Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, a distinguished physicist from Oxford University, have culminated in groundbreaking sonic boom suppression technology. After more than two decades of dedicated research, Churchill secured the world’s first patent for this innovative system in May 2025, perfectly timed to coincide with the Concorde revival. This pioneering technology promises dramatically quieter supersonic flights, enabling the aircraft to fly at speeds surpassing Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound) without disruptive sonic booms at ground level.

Luxury Interiors: Timeless Elegance Meets Japanese Aesthetic

Continuing Concorde’s legacy of luxury travel, the new interiors promise an unparalleled passenger experience. Crafted by internationally renowned architects who specialize in sustainable design, the interior space will embody a refined Japanese aesthetic, balancing simplicity, elegance, and sustainability. Passengers can expect meticulously curated cabins designed with natural, eco-friendly materials, enhancing comfort, serenity, and overall well-being at an altitude of 60,000 feet.

This luxurious yet eco-conscious approach firmly positions Concorde at the forefront of modern aviation, where innovation meets indulgence without compromising environmental integrity.

Digital Innovation: Introducing Concorde Coin (CSSC)

The revival of Concorde extends beyond aviation engineering into the realm of digital innovation. Fly-Concorde Limited, spearheading the development, has introduced Concorde Coin (CSSC)—a blockchain-based stablecoin directly backed by tangible Concorde assets and operational revenues. This innovative digital asset aims to offer passengers and investors an exciting and secure way to engage financially with the iconic Concorde brand.

With increasing global acceptance of blockchain and cryptocurrency as secure investment vehicles, CSSC positions Concorde at the intersection of luxury travel and digital finance, appealing to a new generation of tech-savvy travelers and investors alike.

Leadership and Legacy: Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill

Central to this revival is Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, CEO and Founder of Concorde Co., headquartered in Washington state. Churchill’s deeply personal connection to the Concorde legacy traces back to his lineage—his ancestor, Sir Winston Churchill, originally championed the Concorde as a post-World War II peace initiative.

Dr. Churchill, holding three doctoral degrees in physics and related disciplines from the University of Oxford, has passionately committed over 23 years to overcoming the challenges of sonic boom disruption. His leadership and scientific acumen have been instrumental in bringing the Concorde back into the skies, underscoring the significance of innovation-driven, sustainable aviation solutions.

Global Impact and Economic Potential

According to recent projections by aerospace analysts, the Concorde brand—already synonymous with prestige—is now estimated to be worth approximately $50 billion. The revival is expected not only to boost the global aviation industry but also to generate substantial economic impact in regions connected by these supersonic routes, revitalizing tourism and international business.

Government agencies and regulatory bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are actively collaborating to streamline certification processes for the Concorde’s return to service. Both agencies emphasize safety, sustainability, and community acceptance as cornerstones of this new era in aviation.

Conclusion: The Future is Supersonic

While all over the world, fans are itching for its return, the new Concorde represents much more than nostalgia itself—it represents ultimate sustainable aviation technology, luxurious travel, and cutting-edge digital finance innovation. Ideally blending its timeless heritage with forward-looking innovation, Concorde will redefine travel worldwide once again and show how sustainability and luxury can coexist and thrive at supersonic speeds.

The new AI-powered maintenance scheduler is the brainchild of the IAG.ai Lab team, comprising around 70 AI specialists working in nine departments across labs in Barcelona and London.

The in-house labs serve as hubs for AI-centric innovation and collaboration, focusing on aircraft maintenance, customer service, and overall airline operations.

Better Aircraft Maintenance Workflows

The new engine maintenance scheduling tool uses “algorithms to assess millions of different scenarios, each one tailored to factor in operational, financial or technical assumptions, and identify the optimal maintenance schedule for its fleets,” according to aviationweek.com.

The system is being tested on Aer Lingus’ (EI) A320 CFM56-5B engines, and IAG expects the system to be rolled out to its other airlines by the end of the year.

The goal of the IAG fleet maintenance scheduling overhaul is to prevent maintenance delays, thereby addressing the ever-present engine supply chain issues, as airlines and MROs are struggling to obtain essential engine parts, including materials like titanium and high-pressure turbine blades.

Intergrating AI into the MRO workflow can decrease costs, shorten lead times and compensate for labor shortages. We know that due to scarcity, prices for engine parts have surged, and with procurement of parts is taking longer, lead times for some components can extend to months. Finally, there is a shortage of skilled labor in the aerospace industry, further complicating maintenance and repair processes.

AeroMorning: Mark, can you tell us about the purpose and characteristics of the WindRunner aircraft?

Mark Lundstrom:

The WindRunner aircraft is a project currently being developed by Radia, an aerospace and clean-energy technology company based in Boulder, Colorado, and founded in 2016.

The primary purpose of the WindRunner is to transport wind turbine blades, specifically enabling onshore wind turbines to use blades as long as offshore ones—up to 105 meters in length. Today, onshore turbine blades are typically limited to around 70 meters, as roads and infrastructure can’t accommodate longer blades. Extending onshore blade lengths significantly boosts green energy production efficiency, lowers energy costs, and reduces the land area needed for wind farms.

The WindRunner will be the largest aircraft in the world under development. It features four engines, a length of 108 meters, a wingspan of 80 meters, and has 12 times the internal volume of a Boeing 747.

In terms of performance, WindRunner can land on semi-prepared airstrips as short as 1,800 meters, carrying a maximum payload of 72 metric tonnes.

Thanks to its unique capabilities, WindRunner is expected to have many applications beyond transporting wind turbine blades. These include moving military hardware (such as F-16s or Chinook helicopters), delivering disaster relief equipment, launching satellites, and transporting other oversized cargo anywhere in the world. Radia envisions a fleet of aircraft to meet global demand.

To mitigate development and cost risks, WindRunner is being designed using proven, certified, and mass-produced technologies. There will be no prototype phase—the project will move directly to a certification aircraft, to be certified under FAA Part 25.

The supply chain is already well-integrated, with most of the key suppliers selected. Most of the structural parts will be sourced from Europe:

Wings and engine pylons – Aernnova (Spain)

Fuselage – Leonardo (Italy)

Empennage – Aciturri (Spain)

Landing gear – Magnaghi (Italy)

Testing and certification will be carried out by Radia with other international partners, with program management handled by Radia in Boulder, Colorado.

Initially, the WindRunner will run on conventional jet fuel, but the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is planned in the second phase, once it becomes widely available and economically viable.

In summary, WindRunner is more than a transportation tool—it’s an enabler for a more sustainable world. By making large-scale onshore wind turbines feasible, it helps reduce the concrete and materials required, cuts energy costs, and increases clean energy output to power high-demand infrastructure like AI data centers or to produce green fuels like SAF in greater volumes and at lower prices.

With WindRunner, Radia is playing a key role in building a cleaner, greener future.

Singal's commitment to export-led growth reflects a broader view of America's role in the global energy transition.
In this way, green energy is not just a climate imperative but an economic opportunity, one that brings capital investment, job creation, and export potential to American soil.","As the global economy accelerates toward a lower-carbon future, few voices carry the pragmatic clarity and cross-border vision that Suneet Singal brings to the table. A business leader and sustainability advocate with a forward-leaning approach to infrastructure and clean energy, Singal is helping to define how the United States can emerge not just as a domestic clean energy leader but as an exporter of American-made green technologies, fuels, and expertise to meet global mandates.

Within this ethos is a strong belief in free-market innovation, profitability, and American energy independence, ideals that resonate deeply with conservative principles while aligning with broader climate goals.

The Southern United States, often associated with traditional energy production, now stands at the intersection of tradition and transformation. With its rich biomass reserves, rail and port infrastructure, and globally leading carbon sequestration hubs, the region is positioned to become a powerhouse in the green energy supply chain. Singal sees immense value in tapping into this potential, not just to serve domestic carriers and industries looking to reduce their emissions, but also to build export pipelines to nations whose emissions mandates have already taken effect.

It's a compelling proposition for Republican lawmakers and conservative-minded investors: create jobs at home, build critical infrastructure in America's heartland, and use US-grown technologies to compete on a global stage. Singal understands this alignment well. His work bridges business with policy in a way that encourages private-sector growth while supporting national interests. Rather than chasing tax incentives, Singal's model focuses on unit economics by delivering clean fuels, such as green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), at competitive prices.

Singal's commitment to export-led growth reflects a broader view of America's role in the global energy transition. While Europe is deepening its decarbonization regulations and Asia is ramping up its demand for clean fuels, the United States, under the right leadership, can be the one to supply them.

""We can build globally competitive facilities in the US, leveraging America's biomass abundance, skilled labor, and advanced logistics to deliver profitable solutions abroad. We now have an opportunity where we don't have to be just consumers of the green transition, we can be the suppliers"". Commented Singal.

This strategy also offers an answer to one of the most asked questions in climate policy: how to align environmental responsibility with fiscal discipline. For conservative stakeholders, Singal's approach offers a path that rewards efficiency, innovation, and entrepreneurial drive.

Projects rooted in the US can be designed to meet both global emission standards and market demands. In this way, green energy is not just a climate imperative but an economic opportunity, one that brings capital investment, job creation, and export potential to American soil.

Carbon capture and sequestration stands out as a key player in Singal's blueprint. The Southern US already boasts some of the most advanced geological formations for long-term CO₂ storage. According to the Global CCS Institute, the US leads the world in operational CCS facilities, with more than 20 active commercial-scale projects. Many of these are concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

These sites are essential not only for capturing emissions from traditional industries but also for enabling low-carbon fuel production. By capturing and storing CO₂ from biofuel facilities, for example, producers can generate net-negative emissions fuels, highly attractive to international buyers facing carbon pricing regimes.

But the global opportunity extends beyond fuel. Singal's vision includes not only shipping green methanol or SAF to global partners, but also building localized versions of US facilities abroad. This decentralized-yet-connected system allows the United States to retain intellectual and economic leadership in clean tech, even as it supports the development of greener supply chains overseas.

""It is not a zero-sum game between economic strength and environmental stewardship. With the right strategies and incentives, the two can reinforce each other. America can build at home and serve abroad. It can meet domestic needs while shaping global standards. We can also do this without abandoning our values, but by elevating them, turning competition, innovation, and independence into the cornerstones of climate leadership.""

Yesterday’s Fryer Oil, Tomorrow’s Flight

U.S. kitchens pour out ≈ 3 billion lb of used cooking oil (UCO) every year. Airlines want it: up to 80 % of all new SAF in the next five years will be made through the HEFA pathway that relies on UCO, cutting lifecycle emissions as much as 80 % compared with Jet A. Our own Grease Connections drivers see the demand firsthand: South Florida tankers now head straight from our Miami depot to a nearby HEFA refinery every Friday. The message is simple: when you keep oil clean, you help fuel the next departure board and earn for it.

Five Stops from Kitchen to Cockpit

A typical quick service restaurant produces about 35 lb oil/day. Here’s where Grease Connections steps in:

Cool & pour into a lidded tank: our techs remind crews never to top past 75 % to leave room for expansion.

Smart pickup: our trucks scan the tank tag; a digital manifest hits your inbox before we roll out.

Pre treatment at a regional hub; solids skimmed in under 20 minutes thanks to our heated centrifugal units.

Refinery gate: UCO enters hydroprocessing, stripping oxygen and isomerizing chains to jet spec molecules.

Blend & fly: 865 000 + commercial flights have already used SAF.

What’s Your Oil Worth Today?

USDA spot sheets list yellow grease at $0.33 to $0.45 / lb this week, driving an underground market. One Missouri thief siphoned 258 gal in a single night, nearly $1 000 in diesel equivalent value. Grease Connections curbs that risk with locked lids and GPS sealed pickups; our Orlando district hasn’t lost a gallon since switching to tamper proof hatches last year. Beyond cash, each gallon of UCO based biodiesel can generate LCFS credits; Florida is tightening those rules to push prices higher. Expect the new federal 45Z clean fuel credit to add even more upside when it starts in 2025.

Stay Compliant, Stay Open

EPA’s FOG guide bans any drain disposal and requires documented pickups. NFPA 96 caps unprotected indoor storage at 60 gal for Class IIIB liquids. Grease Connections’ technicians install secondary containment trays that slide out for quick wash downs: health inspectors in Miami tell us it’s the fastest way to ace surprise visits. Our manifests meet cradle to grave traceability rules, a growing focus after reports of fraudulent UCO imports.

How We Beat Grease Bandits

Field lesson: illuminated enclosures plus our steel “shark tooth” lids cut attempted siphoning by 60 % at a Dallas diner row last quarter. Cameras help prosecution, but speed helps more: our average pump out takes five minutes, leaving nothing for thieves. If an overnight spill happens, absorbent socks from our spill kit bag stop oil before it reaches drains; every new customer gets one free at signup.

Choosing the Right Tank: Grease Connections’ Picks

Inside the Refinery: Where Oil Turns to SAF

Hydrotreating removes oxygen; isomerization tailors freeze points. HEFA is still the only fully commercial SAF route, supplying 80 % of today’s volumes. For every 1 000 gal processed, lifecycle CO₂ drops roughly 70 t compared with petroleum jet A. Grease Connections contracts guarantee our loads head to SAF, not lower value diesel, so your waste truly helps aviation decarbonize.

ESG Story Your Customers Will Love

One fast food location recycling with us diverts 12 000 + lb of oil a year (based on our Atlanta route logs). We bundle annual recycling reports you can post on menu boards or RFPs: proof that your fries help power flights, not landfills. With travelers and corporate buyers asking for low carbon dining, this is a story worth telling.

Quick Fire FAQ

Minimum pickup? We start at 50 gal, about two weeks for a busy diner.

Hot water down the drain? Still illegal under FOG rules.

Are imports losing credit eligibility? Yes, as 45Z favors domestic, fully traced oil.

Does SAF really fly now? 865 000 + flights so far.

Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero.","As you wait in the departure lounge for your flight this summer, you may notice your aeroplane being pumped full of fuel ahead of takeoff. And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels, and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 litres per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritise climate action over their very tight profit margins.

Up in the air

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the UK wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonise aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/676581/original/file-20250625-56-arar05.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=444%2C1508%2C4721%2C2360&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-26 13:08:12.984414

An ABF spokesperson said:

“We are extremely pleased to be entering the next phase of formal negotiations with Government over the future of Vivergo.

We believe it is a very positive signal that Government recognises the strategic importance of a domestic bioethanol industry, and is serious about working with the sector to find a sustainable long-term future. We look forward to engaging intensively and constructively with ministers over the coming weeks.

ABF cannot continue to absorb losses at the plant. That is why a timely solution is vital. Our clear preference is to find that solution through this process and to get back to running a business that can thrive in the long term.

In parallel, we have entered into a consultation process with our employees - a necessary step given there can be no guarantee that the negotiations with Government will be successful. Our employees are our most important consideration, and we will engage with them properly and transparently about the future. Consultation is not a fixed outcome - and closure is not a certainty. The outcome depends on the progress we are able to make through negotiations with the Government. Our goal is for that outcome to be positive.

We want to keep Vivergo operating. We have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in it. We have fought hard to save it - and the potential ahead is enormous. Just days ago, we signed a £1.25 billion Memorandum of Understanding with Meld Energy to anchor a world-class Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at the site. There is a real opportunity for Hull to be home to one of Britain’s most exciting clean fuel clusters.

ABF has always been and remains a long-term UK investor with a consistent record of supporting UK industry and jobs. We are committed to playing a lasting role in the country’s green industrial future.”

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), an industry group that represents 350 global airlines, has created a new online platform to match airlines with sustainable fuel companies.

The new matchmaker platform is designed to streamline the complicated and expensive process airlines must endure in order to find a sustainable fuel provider that suits their needs. Air carriers can submit their requests on the platform, and fuel providers can then follow up with their supply details. When there’s a match, the companies can take their discussion offline to hammer out details like pricing and payment terms.

IATA says the central database was designed in order to facilitate more voluntary purchases of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The organization has set an ambitious goal for the air travel industry to operate on a carbon neutral basis in less than 30 years.

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist. “The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

Sustainable jet fuel currently only makes up 0.3% of jet fuel use around the globe, according to a recent report by the World Travel and Tourism Council.

The matchmaker platform will include comprehensive details about the fuel options, including volumes of supply, type of feedstock used, location and technology of production, emissions reduction, and compliance with various regulations, such as the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive.

For now, IATA’s platform is only available to airlines and fuel suppliers. However, the organization says that in due time, the database will open up to other non-aviation corporations who wish to participate.

In addition to making sustainable fuel options more accessible, IATA’s plan to achieve net zero emissions includes using other technologies, like those that remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The company has accused ministers of rendering its business unprofitable by awarding subsidies to rival American producers.
But the Department for Transport has been accused of undermining domestic bioethanol producers by awarding green energy subsidies to American producers that make the chemical from waste, which is seen as more eco-friendly.
Ensus, which runs the country’s only other bioethanol plant, has similarly warned that its facility in Teesside is at risk.
ABF is asking for an end to the green energy certificates being awarded to American producers.","Ministers are racing to save Britain’s largest bioethanol plant after the owner warned it would be forced to close the site without state intervention.

On Thursday, Associated British Foods (ABF) said it had entered into last-ditch talks with the Government about securing support for its Vivergo Fuels business in Hull, which is losing £3m a month.

Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, also confirmed he was engaging “in good faith” with the company and could commit taxpayer money to a rescue package.

If the negotiations fail, ABF’s bosses have threatened to close the factory by Sept 13.

The company has accused ministers of rendering its business unprofitable by awarding subsidies to rival American producers.

Bosses had previously warned they would decide this week whether to close the plant, which makes bioethanol for blending into petrol and employs around 150 people.

But ABF said it had entered “formal negotiations” about whether the site could be kept going. It is understood that the decision follows an intervention by Mr Reynolds.

The Government’s offer to the company remains unclear. But ABF is demanding “short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses” as well as a longer-term deal to put its plant on a profitable footing again.

In a move that piled further pressure on ministers, the company warned: “Given the outcome of the negotiations is uncertain, Vivergo is simultaneously beginning consultation with employees to effect an orderly wind-down.”

The plant, which can produce 420,000m litres of bioethanol per year, had already stopped ordering wheat feedstock, it added.

Losing the facility would leave the UK more reliant on foreign imports and dent ambitions for domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel.

The chemicals sector is described as one of several “foundation industries” in the industrial strategy published by ministers on Monday.

A spokesman for the Government said ABF’s latest ultimatum was “disappointing to see”, while Mr Reynolds described it as “premature”.

Mr Reynolds told journalists: “We have secured a mandate across government to negotiate with them.

“That means we’re willing to engage with them and potentially put government money into a restructure to make sure they’ve got a strong future.

“We have met them many times. We’ve engaged the consultants and we’re well into the process.

“Frankly, I really do regret the Vivergo’s decision to start consultations to let the workforce go and close the plant.”

Only two plants in the UK make bioethanol, which is most commonly blended with petrol to make greener fuels such as E5 and E10.

The vast majority of production uses primary feedstocks such as sugar crops or wheat that are processed to yield fermentable sugars that are then converted into ethanol. Because the fuel is made from plants, it is regarded as renewable.

But the Department for Transport has been accused of undermining domestic bioethanol producers by awarding green energy subsidies to American producers that make the chemical from waste, which is seen as more eco-friendly.

ABF and domestic competitor Ensus say ministers then compounded the problem by striking a trade deal with the US that grants American bioethanol producers tariff-free access to the UK market.

The trade deal has not yet taken effect but ABF says its plant in Hull is already unprofitable and cannot be sustained. It has already written £700m off its value.

Ensus, which runs the country’s only other bioethanol plant, has similarly warned that its facility in Teesside is at risk.

Previous talks between the companies and the Government had not made serious progress.

But it is understood that Mr Reynolds and Heidi Alexander, the Transport Secretary, met company bosses on Tuesday and that the Government has brought in consultants to examine ABF’s proposed rescue package.

ABF is asking for an end to the green energy certificates being awarded to American producers.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/06/26/TELEMMGLPICT000430122367_17509327077600_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOFeYxM9hegFHu6FKJsELIlG_q4qZnN0rfu8_1IeP84M.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-06-26 12:22:33.544044

It turns out that restaurants, street food stalls and home cooks in Malaysia — which is “among the world’s leading suppliers of both UCO and virgin palm oil” — will pay less for fresh cooking oil than the international market will pay for used cooking oil.
Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact).
Virgin palm oil can be substituted for used cooking oil and voila!
Malaysia exports far more “used” cooking oil than oil that it uses.","The ever-excellent Matt Levine points us to the amusing economic policies that connect the international jet-set to Malaysian street hawkers of fried noodles. The EU and the US have created strong economic incentives to create sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and a good way to do this is to recycle used cooking oil (UCO). What could be better, right? Take a waste product and turn it into jet fuel! The EU and US policies, however, are so strong that all the EU and US used cooking oil cannot meet the demand. Here’s a great sentence, “Europe simply cannot collect enough used cooking oil to fly its planes.”

In the US, credits under the Inflation Reduction Act can account for up to $1.75 to $1.85 per gallon of SAF. Meanwhile cooking oil is subsidized in some parts of the world. The result?

It turns out that restaurants, street food stalls and home cooks in Malaysia — which is “among the world’s leading suppliers of both UCO and virgin palm oil” — will pay less for fresh cooking oil than the international market will pay for used cooking oil. Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact). Also fresh cooking oil is subsidized by the government in Malaysia: “Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.” So if you run a restaurant, you can buy fresh cooking oil for about $0.60 (USD), use it to fry food a few times, and then sell it to a refiner for $1, which is a nice little subsidy for the difficult, risky, low-margin business of running a restaurant.

The noodle hawkers in Kuala Lumpur are getting a nice little bump in profit but who is going stall to stall to check that the oil is in fact used? And what counts as used? One fry or two? Clever entrepreneurs have cut out the middleman. Virgin palm oil can be substituted for used cooking oil and voila! Sustainable aviation fuel is contributing to deforestation in Malaysia. Malaysia exports far more “used” cooking oil than oil that it uses. No surprise.

All of this illustrates a broader point: externalities suggest policy interventions may improve outcomes but markets are complex and politics is blunt. It’s easy to make things worse. If intervention is necessary, a uniform carbon tax beats a patchwork of production-specific subsidies. A price is a signal wrapped up in an incentive. Send everyone the same signal and the same incentive to ensure that the cheapest emissions are cut first and total costs are minimized.

Crucially, a carbon tax rewards any effective solution, even ones a planner would never think of–lighter planes and cleaner fuels sure but also operational tweaks like jet washes. In contrast, subsidies tether policy to specific technologies, like used cooking oil. That invites rent-seeking and inefficiency.

Tax carbon, not inputs. Avoid games with paperwork. One verification point at the fuel supply point is simpler than tracing global waste-oil chains. Don’t subsidize the fry oil and audit the street hawkers. Tax the emissions.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RNbmR40xThM/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&rs=AOn4CLCM2ybrzB3Y9w8WkND8UK8ZnmAVSA,N,,2025-06-26 12:22:39.293902

Pratt & Whitney Canada and German aircraft manufacturer, Deutsche Aircraft, have marked a major milestone in the advancement of regional aviation with an update to the D328eco regional turboprop. Featured at the 2025 Paris Air Show following the May rollout of the first test aircraft, the TAC 1, the D328eco program takes a significant step forward from design to hands-on testing, with the goal of achieving type certification and Entry Into Service (EIS) by late 2027.

Driving the advancement of the D328eco is the new Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127XT-S engine – a state-of-the-art turboprop that’s been engineered to meet the operational demands of regional carriers. Boasting up to 15 per cent improved fuel efficiency, 40 per cent longer time on wing, and 20 per cent lower maintenance costs when compared to the D328’s legacy engine, the PW127XT-S represents a significant improvement to lifecycle and reliability.

It’s an advancement and impact that aren’t lost on Pratt & Whitney Canada President, Maria Della Posta, who also recognizes the position that the global leader in aerospace engine design and manufacturing is in to be able to drive innovation within the space further.

“For over 40 years, we’ve been dedicated to supporting regional airlines by understanding their unique needs,” she says. “With the PW127XT engine family, we’ve developed a solution that reduces maintenance and operating costs, delivering significant value to our customers.”

In addition, progress and innovation around the updated aircraft extends beyond the airframe. In late 2024, the two aerospace manufacturers entered into a joint synthetic fuel test campaign using the D328 UpLift demonstrator in collaboration with the German Aerospace Center. The five-flight series, which used 100 per cent synthetic Fischer-Tropsch fuel, demonstrated the propulsion system’s performance under alternative fuel conditions, supporting the goal of achieving certification for the D328eco for 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel use.

(Reuters) -Associated British Foods said it would close the UK’s largest bioethanol plant by September if the government does not provide support and funding, potentially the first victim of Britain’s tariff deal with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Under last month’s trade deal, the UK’s 19% tariffs on U.S. ethanol will fall to zero, through a 1.4 billion-litre (370 million gallon) quota – a figure equating to the size of the UK’s entire ethanol market.

The possible closure would be an embarrassment for Prime Minister Keir Starmer who hailed the trade deal as a boost to businesses that would protect jobs and attract investment.

It also underscores how Trump’s assault on trade is being felt around the world, with the closure set to affect the production of byproducts including animal feed and carbon dioxide, and British arable farmers which supply the industry.

Bioethanol is produced from crops such as wheat and is used to make petrol greener and to make sustainable aviation fuel. On Monday, Starmer’s government launched its industrial strategy, promising to invest in the green economy.

Britain has two major bioethanol plants in northern England – AB Foods’ Vivergo plant and one operated by Ensus, owned by Germany’s Sudzucker Group – which account for nearly all of the UK’s production capacity.

They have warned that the trade deal, along with existing regulations that give U.S. producers an advantage in the British market, has made the environment impossible. The industry supports thousands of jobs.

Ensus, which has warned its Teesside plant also faces imminent closure, on Thursday welcomed the appointment of external advisers to work with the industry, and said it would work with the government “urgently”.

LEVEL THE REGULATORY PLAYING FIELD

AB Foods said on Thursday it would begin consultations with employees for an orderly wind-down of its plant, while simultaneously continuing talks with the government, which it said is now committed to reaching “a sustainable solution”.

It said it would cease all manufacturing before September 13, its financial year-end, “unless the government is able to provide both short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses and a longer-term solution.”

A spokesperson for the government said it was disappointed with AB Foods’ announcement, having entered into negotiations with the company on financial support on Wednesday.

The government would “present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods,” the spokesperson added.

AB Foods wants the government to increase the amount of ethanol in UK petrol from 10% to 15% and support the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

It also wants the industry to have access to short-term financial aid of up to 150 million pounds ($202 million).

Britain’s concession on ethanol was made in return for the removal of 25% additional tariffs on steel and aluminium, and a quota of 100,000 cars at a duty of 10%.

This positions Swedavia as a world leader in the aviation sector, as seven out of ten Swedavia airports are now certified at the highest level.

“The fact that three new Swedavia airports have achieved the highest climate certification is clear evidence of our long-term, goal-oriented effort to drive the climate transition in the aviation industry. With seven out of ten airports certified at ACA level 5, we have shown that it is possible to combine critical infrastructure with climate leadership,"" says Fredrik Jaresved, Director of Strategic Initiatives and Innovation at Swedavia.

The long-term goal is for the Swedish aviation industry to be completely fossil-free for domestic flights by 2030 and for international flights by 2045, in line with the aviation industry’s joint roadmap within the framework of Fossil-Free Sweden. Swedavia firmly believes that sustainable aviation fuel, electric aircraft and hydrogen-powered aircraft are vital elements in achieving the green transition in the aviation industry.

Swedavia became fossil-free in its own airport operations at all ten airports as early as 2020, making the Group the first in the world to achieve this. By 2025, all ground operations at Swedavia’s airports that are carried out by other operators will also be made fossil-free through the partnership plan that has been developed, which involves all operators at the airports signing an agreement with Swedavia stipulating a focus on phasing out fossil fuels from their operations.

With Visby Airport, Åre Östersund Airport and Kiruna Airport achieving Level 5 certification within Airport Carbon Accreditation, seven out of ten Swedavia airports are now certified at the highest level. This achievement follows Göteborg Landvetter Airport and Malmö Airport, which were certified at Level 5 in December 2023, and Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Ronneby Airport, which were certified in October 2024. With ACA 5 certification of Visby, Åre Östersund and Kiruna, Swedavia has taken the final steps necessary to phase out fossil fuels at all levels at these three airports.

Within the framework of Airport Carbon Accreditation, Swedavia's ambition is for its remaining three airports - Bromma Stockholm Airport, Luleå Airport and Umeå Airport - to be certified at level 5 by 2026.

,,2025-06-26 10:36:29+00:00,www.iata.org,IATA Releases SAF Matchmaker to Connect Airlines and SAF Suppliers,Not Available,,,,,https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2025-releases/2025-06-26-01/,"Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.
Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes.
The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.
The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.
The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only.","Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers. When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The SAF Matchmaker is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.
