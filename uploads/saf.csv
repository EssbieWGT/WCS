The spokesman said: “We are extremely pleased to be entering the next phase of formal negotiations with Government over the future of Vivergo.

“We believe it is a very positive signal that Government recognises the strategic importance of a domestic bioethanol industry and is serious about working with the sector to find a sustainable long-term future. We look forward to engaging intensively and constructively with ministers over the coming weeks.

“ABF cannot continue to absorb losses at the plant. That is why a timely solution is vital. Our clear preference is to find that solution through this process and to get back to running a business that can thrive in the long term.

“In parallel, we have entered into a consultation process with our employees - a necessary step given there can be no guarantee that the negotiations with Government will be successful. Our employees are our most important consideration, and we will engage with them properly and transparently about the future. Consultation is not a fixed outcome - and closure is not a certainty. The outcome depends on the progress we are able to make through negotiations with the Government. Our goal is for that outcome to be positive.

“We want to keep Vivergo operating. We have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in it. We have fought hard to save it - and the potential ahead is enormous. Just days ago, we signed a £1.25 billion Memorandum of Understanding with Meld Energy to anchor a world-class Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at the site. There is a real opportunity for Hull to be home to one of Britain’s most exciting clean fuel clusters.

The total emissions for aviation in 2024 were 38.4 MtCO2e, marking a return to pre-pandemic levels.
This increased in 2024, and as a proportion of all jet fuel used in UK aviation rose substantially, from 0.7% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024.
The UK has a mandate to achieve 10% by 2030, however, and so the CCC said that the overall rise in aviation emissions are “posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets”.
The evidence was presented to the UK Government’s Environmental Audit Committee earlier this month.","Aviation emissions are continuing to rise, the Government’s independent advisors have warned.

In its assessment of the Government’s progress on reducing emissions, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) found that while overall emissions fell 2.5% in 2024, the tenth consecutive year of sustained reduction in emissions, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic years 2020 and 2021, emissions in the aviation sector increased by nine percent in 2024.

The total emissions for aviation in 2024 were 38.4 MtCO2e, marking a return to pre-pandemic levels. The Government’s 2022 Jet Zero Strategy (JZS) and CBDP, and the Seventh Carbon Budget Balanced Pathway all require emissions to stay flat and start decreasing slowly over the rest of the decade.

The CCC says “Limiting emissions in this way will be difficult if passenger numbers increase without sufficient counterbalancing uptake of low-carbon solutions.”

One of these is the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This increased in 2024, and as a proportion of all jet fuel used in UK aviation rose substantially, from 0.7% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024.

The UK has a mandate to achieve 10% by 2030, however, and so the CCC said that the overall rise in aviation emissions are “posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets”.

Although business travel has continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the CCC said that the “most significant driver of aviation emissions since 1990 has been rising demand for international flights, particularly leisure.”

The increase in demand for leisure flights has also been powered by a rise in demand for ‘medium haul’ destinations from the UK.

The New Economics Foundation has identified that as a result of carbon taxes on intra-European flight (through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), there has been a significant increase in leisure flights to ‘medium-haul’ leisure destinations such as Turkey, Greece, the Canary Islands, Morocco, Egypt, Albania, and Saudi Arabia.

The Foundation predicts this trend will increase as the ETS rates increase next year, pushing up prices on short haul flights within Europe and so, ironically, increasing emissions from leisure flights as these increase in duration.

The evidence was presented to the UK Government’s Environmental Audit Committee earlier this month.

According to information published by GSNR, the pivot to wood chip production would significantly lower the project’s capital costs and environmental footprint.","The board of Golden State Natural Resources on June 25 voted to revise its plans for the proposed development of two wood pellet plants in California and will instead move forward with the development of two smaller-scale wood chip projects.

GSNR is a nonprofit public benefit corporation established by rural counties to address the urgent issue of catastrophic fires from overgrown and under-managed forests. The group’s initial plans focused on the conversion of woody biomass gathered as part of forest treatment and restoration activities into wood pellets that would be exported for use in large-scale power production and similar applications. The plans included the development of a 700,000-metric-ton-per-year pellet plant in Lassen County and a 300,000-metric-ton-per-year facility in Tuolumne County, along with storage infrastructure at the Port of Stockton.

GSNR in early 2024 signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Drax US BECCS Development LLC “for the joint exploration of sustainable biomass opportunities with a focus on advancing forest resilience and promoting green energy initiatives worldwide.”

In October 2024, GSNR announced the release of a draft environmental impact report (DEIR), as required by the California Environmental Quality Act, for the proposed wood pellet project. The DEIR specified that the MOU with Drax was explicitly non-binding and did not commit Drax to purchase or use any quantity of wood pellets or otherwise become involved in GSNR’s project.

Documents published ahead of GSNR’s June 25 board of directors meeting indicates that the organization received more than 5,500 public comments in response to the DEIR and had identified three viable paths forward for the project.

Under one option, GSNR would have continued with the development of the two proposed full-scale wood pellet plants, updating the project based on the findings of CEQA analysis and comments received. Under another option, GSNR would paused further development at both proposed project sites.

The board, however, voted to move forward with a plan revise the scope of the project, which could include reducing the size and throughput of both facilities while transitioning from producing wood pellets for export to the production of wood chips for domestic use. GSNR noted wood chips could have applications in domestic alternative energy production, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marine biofuels, or in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) applications. Alternatively, wood chips can be used to produce wood products, such as oriented strand board.

According to information published by GSNR, the pivot to wood chip production would significantly lower the project’s capital costs and environmental footprint. The reduced scale of the wood chip project configuration may also facilitate CEQA review and permitting, and expedite site development timelines, improving the feasibility of near-term deployment, the group explained.

Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97.
They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.
Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.
By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero.","As you wait in the departure lounge for your flight this summer, you may notice your aeroplane being pumped full of fuel ahead of takeoff. And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels , and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 litres per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritise climate action over their very tight profit margins .

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Bulent camci/Shutterstock

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the UK wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonise aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",,N,,2025-06-26 20:03:37.234028

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” says Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP sustainability and chief economist.

Key takeaways:

· The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

• SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

• The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

With deep roots in aerospace innovation and a thriving clean tech ecosystem, Washington state is one of the leaders in the nation in advancing SAF technologies, infrastructure, and investment.

What is SAF and Why Does It Matter?

SAF is a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from non-petroleum feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste, algae, and even captured carbon. When blended with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel (typically at levels between 10% and 50%, depending on the specific SAF and regulatory approvals), SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, without requiring modifications to current aircraft engines or airport fueling systems. This drop-in compatibility makes SAF a scalable and immediate solution for sustainable air travel.

What are SAF Made Of? The Diverse Feedstock Landscape

While SAF is increasingly being integrated into existing airport fuel supply chains, dedicated “SAF hubs” emerge as strategic locations for production, blending, storage, and distribution. The “sustainable” in SAF refers to the renewable nature of its source materials. SAF can be produced from a wide array of feedstocks through various technological pathways:

Used Cooking Oil and Animal Fats (HEFA Pathway): Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) are currently the most mature and widely used pathway. This involves refining waste oils, greases, and animal fats.

Agricultural and Forestry Residues: Waste products from farming (like crop residues and forestry residues) and forestry operations can be converted into SAF.

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW): Non-recyclable household and commercial waste, including food scraps, yard waste, and packaging materials, can be transformed into jet fuel, diverting waste from landfills.

Algae: Certain types of algae can be cultivated and processed to produce biofuels suitable for aviation.

Purpose-Grown Energy Crops: Non-food crops grown on marginal lands can be used as dedicated feedstocks for SAF.

Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ): This pathway converts alcohols, such as ethanol (derived from corn, sugarcane, or cellulosic biomass) or isobutanol, into jet fuel.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) or eFuels: A newer and promising technology that involves synthesizing captured carbon dioxide (from industrial sources or direct air capture) with green hydrogen (produced using renewable electricity) to create synthetic liquid hydrocarbons.

The choice of feedstock and production technology significantly influences the overall carbon reduction potential of the SAF.

How Do SAF Hubs Work?

SAF hubs function as nexuses in the SAF supply chain:

Feedstock Sourcing: Hubs are often strategically located near sources of viable feedstock or with good transportation links to receive them.

Production: Dedicated refineries or retrofitted conventional refineries utilize various approved technologies (HEFA, AtJ, PtL, etc.) to convert feedstocks into SAF.

Blending: The neat SAF is then blended with conventional jet fuel to meet current certification standards (e.g., up to a 50% blend).

Storage and Distribution: The blended SAF is stored and then distributed to airports through existing pipelines, tankers, or dedicated fueling infrastructure.

“Book and Claim” Systems: Many regions also utilize “book and claim” systems. This allows an airline or corporation to purchase SAF certificates (SAFc) representing the environmental benefits of a certain volume of SAF, even if the physical fuel is not delivered to their specific location. The actual SAF is used by an aircraft operator at an airport where it is physically available. This system helps aggregate demand, fund SAF production, and allows entities to meet their emission reduction goals regardless of their geographical proximity to SAF supply.

Washington State: A National Leader in SAF Innovation

From cutting-edge research labs to first-of-their-kind production facilities, Washington is home to a growing ecosystem of SAF pioneers. Here are key players driving this momentum:

Economic Development Through Clean Aviation

SAF market is projected to exceed $6.9 billion in the U.S. by 2030. With Greater Seattle’s aerospace supply chain, skilled talent, and abundant clean energy, the region is uniquely positioned to capture a significant share of that market. SAF innovation is already spurring job creation, attracting international investment, and strengthening our region’s leadership in next-generation fuels. These efforts support both metro and rural communities, from Moses Lake to Walla Walla to the Puget Sound.

Incentives: Fueling the Growth of SAF

Federal programs such as the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge aim to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030. Washington’s policy leadership, including state tax incentives up to $2/gallon, complements the national framework, creating fertile ground for SAF innovation and commercialization.

Investment Landscape: Who is Investing in SAF?

Significant investments are flowing into the SAF sector from a diverse range of players:

Airlines: Major carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air France-KLM, British Airways (IAG), Qantas, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines are making substantial investments in SAF through direct procurement agreements, equity stakes in SAF producers, and partnerships to develop new production facilities.

Energy Companies: Traditional oil and gas giants like Shell, Neste, TotalEnergies, and ExxonMobil are leveraging their refining expertise and infrastructure to become major SAF producers. They are investing in new facilities and retrofitting existing ones.

Specialized Biofuel Companies: Dedicated SAF producers and developers like Gevo, World Energy, Fulcrum BioEnergy, and LanzaTech are attracting significant capital to scale up their innovative production technologies.

Private Equity and Infrastructure Investors: Firms such as Bain Capital (investing in EcoCeres) and Brookfield Asset Management (investing in Infinium) recognize the long-term potential of SAF and are injecting substantial capital into SAF projects and infrastructure.

Aircraft and Engine Manufacturers: Companies like Boeing and Airbus are actively involved in SAF development, testing, and investing in SAF initiatives to ensure compatibility and promote adoption. Honeywell is also a key technology provider and investor.

Governments: Beyond incentives, governments are directly investing in research and development and providing financial backing for pioneering SAF projects.

The World Economic Forum highlights the need for an estimated $19-45 billion in capital expenditure by 2030 to meet SAF production demands.

Switching to lower-carbon fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel for air travel, is one of the strategies included in the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation's forthcoming emissions reduction plan.

That plan is a requirement of a landmark settlement agreement the state reached with a group of youth plaintiffs last summer who claimed the state hadn't done enough to reduce climate pollution from the transportation sector. HDOT is expected to release a draft of the plan on Friday.

HDOT director Ed Sniffen told lawmakers on Wednesday that transitioning to lower-carbon fuels and electrification across air, marine, and ground travel will have the ""biggest impact"" of all the emissions-reduction strategies that have been evaluated.

Domestic aviation is responsible for about a quarter of the state's total emissions.

The aviation industry has already been working to swap out jet fuel with lower-carbon alternatives, and many airlines that service Hawaiʻi including Hawaiian and Alaska have set their own emissions-reduction goals.

But sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive than conventional fuel and in limited supply, and Sniffen said the state's timeline to achieve net-zero emissions is more aggressive than those set by the airlines.

""It's difficult for industry to swallow. There's going to be additional costs that come to them, additional costs that come to all of us as users,"" Sniffen said.

Sniffen said HDOT has had conversations with stakeholders in the aviation, marine, and ground transportation sectors about the hurdles in the state's transition away from fossil fuels.

""I will say none of the industries are pushing back and saying, 'This is not important.' They're just saying, 'We got to see how we do this so we can afford it,'"" he added.

A clean fuel standard could incentivize the development and use of lower-carbon fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel, and even electrification through tax credits.

HDOT says it plans to prepare a legislative package for lawmakers ahead of the 2026 legislative session that could include a clean fuel standard.

""The state needs to take some action, similar to states such as California and Washington, to make these fuels competitive in the market,"" said Nicholas Nishimura, a rising junior at Waipahu High School and a member of HDOT's youth council, which has been working with the department on its greenhouse gas reduction plan.

Nishimura cautioned that the transition away from imported gasoline and jet fuel may raise costs for Hawaiʻi consumers.

With the help of the University of Hawaiʻi, HDOT is currently conducting an analysis of the possible financial impact of a clean fuel standard on Hawaiʻi residents, which will be provided to lawmakers ahead of the next legislative session.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e1b08fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x2948+0+451/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F09%2F03%2F592aecd84218986d4f955187c96d%2Fap100607016266.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 18:08:27.646333

The goal is clear: to simplify, accelerate, and bring transparency to the SAF procurement process in a market that is still developing.

A Solution for Three Key Challenges

SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical needs in the sector:

1. Efficiency in SAF Procurement

The platform centralizes SAF requests and offers, eliminating barriers and additional costs. This significantly reduces the time and complexity airlines face when searching for suppliers, thereby fostering the growth of the voluntary SAF market.

2. Direct Connectivity Between Stakeholders

Producers and suppliers of sustainable fuel can post available or projected volumes, while airlines register their interest in acquiring specific quantities. When a match is made, the parties can take negotiations offline to finalize details such as pricing and payment terms.

3. Market Visibility and Transparency

The system provides detailed information about each available SAF batch: volume, feedstock used, location, production technology, associated emission reductions, and compliance with international regulations such as CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) or the EU Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

→ EASA and IATA Launch Global Plan to Mitigate GNSS Interference Risks

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, highlighted the strategic impact of this tool: “To achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. SAF Matchmaker demonstrates IATA’s commitment to building a fully operational market that facilitates SAF adoption, reducing costs and barriers for airlines.”

Exclusive Platform, for Now

In its initial phase, SAF Matchmaker will be available exclusively to airlines and SAF suppliers. However, IATA anticipates that other buyers, such as corporations from sectors not directly related to aviation, may join later.

UK in formal talks to avert biofuel plant closure

London, 26 June (Argus) — Associated British Foods (AFB), the multinational food and ingredients group, has said it will shut its 416mn litres/yr Vivergo bioethanol plant near Hull, eastern England, before 13 September unless the UK government agrees to urgent support measures. The company confirmed that ""formal negotiations"" with the government are now under way to find a ""sustainable solution"". But with the outcome uncertain, it has already stopped purchasing wheat feedstocks as of 11 June and begun consultations with staff ""to effect an orderly wind-down"" once existing contractual obligations are met. ABF said the government would need to provide ""both short-term funding of Vivergo's losses and a longer-term solution"" to avoid closure. The future of the plant ""will depend on whether the negotiations deliver a credible route forwards"", it said. The closure threat follows a UK-US trade agreement that removes import tariffs on up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol — roughly equal to total UK demand. Domestic producers say the deal has made the UK market unviable by allowing cheaper US imports to undercut local output. Paul Kenward — chief executive of ABF Sugar, the division of ABF that includes Vivergo Fuels — told MPs earlier this month that the trade deal effectively hands the UK market to US exporters. He proposed raising the UK's ethanol blending mandate from E10 to E15, saying this would give the industry ""room to breathe"", and also suggested a support package worth £75mn/yr ($100mn) for up to two years to help the sector adjust. Vivergo previously told Argus that an E15 mandate could boost demand by 660mn l/yr and highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors. German-owned Ensus, which operates the UK's only other bioethanol plant at Wilton on Teesside, has also warned of potential closure. The firm told Argus that it received a letter from the government's minister for business and trade acknowledging the economic challenges it faces as a direct result of the US trade deal. Ensus said it welcomed the government's recognition of its request for regulatory changes that could help the UK industry remain viable, along with the need for interim financial support.

Brazil looks to Cop 30 as progress slow at Bonn

Bonn, 26 June (Argus) — Technical climate talks at Bonn, to prepare for political negotiations at the UN Cop 30 summit in Belem, Brazil in November, look set to end with little progress on mitigation — actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions. As negotiations continue, the incoming Brazilian presidency has signalled it is seeking new avenues as formal processes have become bogged down. New nationally determined contributions (NDCs), countries' climate plans to 2035, due this year, were not formally discussed in Bonn. Few nations have submitted them, so far, and commitments will once again likely be insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The Paris agreement seeks to curb the temperature rise to ""well below"" 2°C, and to pursue a 1.5°C limit. Brazil on Wednesday called the NDCs a ""portrait"" of where states see themselves in 2035, saying that if it does not look good ""we will need to work together to improve it."" Brazil and the EU may be pinning hopes on the leaders' summit at Cop 30 to cut through the logjam. The EU ""sees value in having a political space for high-level discussions"" in response to the NDC synthesis report, it said. This report — due to be released on 24 October — will sum up countries' NDCs as long as they are submitted by September. This could provide a focal point for action ahead of the conference. Another avenue to find progress which Brazil has pushed is the ""action agenda"", a programme of voluntary initiatives by national and sub-national governments as well as civil society and private businesses, which runs alongside the formal negotiations between states. There are hopes that the states seeking to push mitigation the most could create a ""coalition of the willing,"" according to Andreas Sieber of environmental non-governmental organization (NGO) 350.org. This would generate momentum for initiatives which then make the leap to the negotiated process. This was the case for the pledge to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, which originated in the action agenda at Cop 28 in Dubai in 2023 but then made it into the formal outcomes of the summit. By engaging first with willing states, Brazil avoids obstructions, typically from large oil exporters. Baku 2.0 But so far in Bonn, progress on a key element for mitigation — a programme to discuss the meaning of the global stocktake (GST) — has bogged down. The GST, conducted in Dubai in 2023, was a review of the progress on reaching the goals of the Paris accord. It expressed the need to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. But talks on the GST have stalled since, and one delegate expressed a fear that the talks could be entering the same realm as the mitigation work programme (MWP), another workstream which has delivered little progress. Ensuring that discussion of options continues between Bonn and Belem will be key to lay the ground for solid outcomes once decision-makers are in the room, with some sensing a shift to more positive engagement. But frustrations over a new $300bn/yr climate finance target for developing nations could resurface in Brazil. Developing and developed countries were at loggerheads on climate finance and mitigation into the last minutes of the Baku summit. Brazilian climate agency Observatorio do Clima said the focus on finance at Bonn was much more prominent than the incoming Cop presidency expected, with Cop 30 risking ""becoming a Baku 2.0"". Meeting the priorities of many developing countries — more, better and accessible finance — may prove difficult. The Brazilian presidency said today that the Baku to Belem roadmap — a workstream decided on last year to work out ways to increase finance on to $1.3tn/yr — was supported by developing countries. But their priorities differ from those of G20 countries, the Brazil presidency said, implying that agreement may be hard to find. In the absence of the US, which did not send a delegation to Bonn, Brussels and Berlin have emerged as new blockers to talking about increasing finance, according to Victor Menotti of NGO Demand climate justice.

Australian gas firm sued over ‘greenwashing’ claim

Adelaide, 26 June (Argus) — Australia's competition regulator is suing gas distributor Australian Gas Networks (AGN) in the federal court, alleging ""greenwashing"" occurred in an advertising campaign in 2022 and 2023. AGN misled customers when it ran ""Love Gas"" TV and digital advertisements claiming that gas in its network would be renewable within a generation without holding reasonable grounds that would be the case, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. ""It is not currently possible to distribute renewable gas at scale and at an economically viable price,"" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said on 26 June. ""We allege even though AGN knew the future of renewable gas was uncertain, it made an unqualified representation to consumers that it would distribute renewable gas to households within a generation."" AGN, a major gas distribution firm owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK, forms part of the firm's Australian Gas Infrastructure (AGIG) business. The distributor services more than 1.3mn customers via about 27,000km of distribution networks and 1,300km of gas pipelines. The firm strives to provide clear and accurate communications about the role and benefits of natural gas today and renewable gas into the future and that the company will defend the claims in court, a spokesman for AGIG said. AGIG, an early developer of small-scale green hydrogen blending in gas networks, plans to start operations of its 10MW Hydrogen Park Murray Valley project in late 2025. A 1.25MW project in South Australia's state capital Adelaide began operations in 2021 . Canberra promised to police claims about emissions more strictly, pledging millions of dollars in 2023 to fund regulatory oversight of fossil fuel producers and distributors . The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's first court action for alleged greenwashing was against Mercer Superannuation and concluded in August 2024. The federal court fined the pension fund A$11.3mn ($7.4mn) for misleading statements about seven ""Sustainable Plus"" investment options. The court found that the options included investments in 15 companies involved in fossil fuel sales, such as BHP, Glencore and Whitehaven Coal.

Brazil's E30, B15 blends to start 1 Aug: Update

Adds statement from National oil and gas institute IBP. Sao Paulo, 25 June (Argus) — Brazilian regulators have approved an increase in ethanol and biodiesel blending into fossil fuels effective 1 August. In a meeting of the mines and energy ministry and national energy policy council CNPE today, the government decided to move forward with an increase in ethanol blending rates into gasoline to 30pc to make E30, and to blend 15pc biodiesel into diesel to create B15. CNPE is evaluating the feasibility of raising ethanol blends to a 22-35pc range and biodiesel blends to a 13-25pc range, mines and energy ministry's biofuels department director Marlon Arraes said during Argus ' Biofuels & Feedstocks Latin America Conference, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. National oil and gas institute IBP declared its support for the ethanol and biodiesel blend increases, while asking for more autonomy for hydrocarbons regulator ANP to improve quality monitoring and ensure safety to final consumers. The fuel of the future program, introduced to the Congress on September 2023, spurred more than R53bn ($9.6bn) of investments in biodiesel to achieve a 25pc mix by 2026, as well as R24bn invested in ethanol to reach a 35pc blend that same year, Arraes said. Investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) through advanced geological techniques reached R140bn, while investments in biomethane and products such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel reached bring that total up to R260bn. Cost competitiveness, feedstock supply risks and regulatory instability remain hurdles to a wider biofuel framework in Brazil, he said. The fuel of the future program avoided 705mn metric tonnes (t) of CO2 equivalent, Arraes said, mostly from CCUS and biodiesel investments. ""We need to engage in our way to produce biofuels and sustainable energy to deliver to society the cheapest decarbonization that we can"", he added.

Initiated by the Chinese General Consulate in Frankfurt and co-organized by Xinhuanet and other Chinese and German organizations, the second Sino-European Corporate ESG Best Practices Conference is held here with aim to pay tribute to the companies that have fared well in putting the ESG concept into practice and promote further cooperation between Chinese and European companies in this regard.

ESG is no longer an add-on, but a strategic element of modern corporate management. It helps identify risks early, set standards, and build long-term, stable partnerships, said Thorsten Giehler, head of Economy, Employment, Social Development of Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, a service provider for international cooperation for sustainable development and international educational work.

Giehler called on stakeholders to work on clear, practical rules which can provide guidance and planning security to facilitate the application of ESG.

Huang Yiyang, Chinese Consul General in Frankfurt, believed that the function of ESG should go well beyond a technical jargon and be considered as a solution for the future.

As staunch defenders of the ideas of multilateralism, open cooperation and green transformation, China and Europe should stand out and join hands to provide leadership and confidence for the global cause of ESG at a time of rising uncertainties, Huang stressed in a speech made on Wednesday night.

As a co-organizer of the conference, Xinhuanet intends to boost the dissemination and applications of the ESG concept among Chinese and European companies, Chu Xuejun, chairman of the board of Xinhuanet Co., Ltd. told Xinhua. It will not only be beneficial for China and Europe to achieve a win-win result in green transformation, but also set a solid stage for further and deeper economic and trade cooperation between the two sides, Chu added.

With a case detailing the joint initiative with Air China, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Technical Pathway Challenge for Chinese Universities, Airbus Germany turned out to be one of the winners at the conference.

""This recognition highlights both the project's impact and the strong partnership between China and the EU,"" said Anna Lisa Junge on behalf of Airbus Germany.

""Today's recognition inspires us to go further. We look forward to deepening our cooperation with Air China and other partners, advancing SAF and broader ESG practices -- in China, and for the globe.""

ESG application cases in areas including environment protection, social responsibility, corporate management, scientific and technological innovation, education and training, and other ESG-related innovative practices, have been submitted to the conference for review by a committee consisting of Chinese and European experts.

The two-day event also featured CEO dialogues, application case study, discussions and roadshows, with leading Chinese and European companies looking to explore the possibility of putting the ESG concept into better mass practices. ■",,N,,2025-06-26 17:07:26.809618

Sponsored by Senate Majority Floor Leader Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, and Sen. Joseph Bellino, R-Monroe, Senate Bills 235–36 would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of SAF—a move that would support Michigan’s farmers and economy while reducing the state’s carbon footprint.

“It has been an exciting process to partner with my colleagues across the aisle and across the chamber on this legislation, which not only aims to support Michigan farmers but—in continuing what was outlined in the Clean Energy Future plan—would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,” Singh said. “This legislation will open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the connection between our agricultural sector and the state’s energy goals.”

SAF is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced using biobased renewable products manufactured from crops like soybeans or corn.

By providing a $1.50-per-gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce or blend sustainable aviation fuel, this legislation would directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning SAF.

Additional incentives are available if greater emissions reductions are reached.

There is a maximum incentive cap of $4.5 million annually in the first year, and $9 million each year after.

“Access to sustainable, reliable and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” Bellino said. “I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.

With environmental concerns rising and governments pushing for cleaner, greener alternatives, sustainability is now a central focus for aviation companies, professionals, and stakeholders alike. It is no longer a niche area of expertise, but a foundational aspect that every aviation professional must understand and act upon.

According to Marie Owens, Senior Vice President of Sustainability & Chief Economist at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainability is “a very existential issue for our industry and for the world in its approach to our industry.” This statement underscores the importance of sustainability in aviation and highlights the urgency of action as the industry grapples with rising environmental pressures.

The Need for a Collective Approach

The aviation sector has long been aware of its environmental impact, but the scale of that impact—and the responsibility to address it—has grown significantly in recent years. Governments worldwide have set ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the aviation sector is no exception. The European Union’s aviation emissions trading system (EU ETS), the United States’ climate commitments, and similar initiatives from other nations highlight the growing regulatory pressure on the industry to reduce carbon footprints.

Governments have also taken steps to encourage greener practices by providing funding and support for research into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), electric aircraft technologies, and more efficient air traffic management systems. The UK, for instance, recently launched its Green Aviation Strategy, which includes a roadmap for net-zero emissions by 2050. These actions reflect an undeniable truth: sustainability is not optional but essential to the future of aviation.

In this context, the role of aviation professionals is more critical than ever. Professionals across all levels of the industry—from engineers and pilots to policymakers and sustainability officers—must work collectively to advance the sector’s sustainability agenda.

Training: A Vital Step Toward Sustainability Expertise

As sustainability becomes increasingly central to the aviation industry, governments and aviation organizations are emphasizing the need for specialized training to equip professionals with the skills necessary for this transformation. The IATA recognizes that moving toward sustainability requires not only investment in technologies and infrastructure but also in people. Professionals with expertise in sustainable practices are in high demand.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, has long advocated for environmental responsibility within aviation. In 2019, ICAO established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which is a global market-based measure aimed at helping the sector offset its emissions. This initiative further underscores the growing need for professionals who are well-versed in sustainability principles, carbon offset programs, and green aviation technologies.

Training programs and courses designed to promote sustainability awareness and expertise are essential to help professionals keep pace with the evolving needs of the industry. Whether it’s understanding how to integrate sustainable aviation fuel into flight operations or navigating the regulatory landscape of carbon emissions trading, training will be crucial for professionals who want to remain competitive in the workforce.

Three Key Steps to Enhance Your Sustainability Skills

As aviation faces growing demands to meet sustainability goals, professionals must adopt a proactive approach to ensure their skills align with industry needs. Below, we outline three key steps that aviation professionals can take to build a sustainable skill set and stay competitive in this rapidly evolving field.

1. Stay Informed About Global Regulations and Policies

Government policies and international agreements play a key role in shaping the aviation industry’s path toward sustainability. Professionals must stay up-to-date with regulatory developments, such as the EU’s Green Deal, ICAO’s CORSIA, and any region-specific initiatives. Understanding how these policies impact the aviation sector—and your specific role—will allow you to make informed decisions and ensure compliance.

Governments are also focusing on providing incentives and grants to support the transition to sustainable aviation. Familiarizing yourself with such programs can open doors to funding and innovation within your organization.

2. Invest in Specialized Training and Certification

Many governments and international organizations, including the IATA and ICAO, offer specialized training programs aimed at fostering sustainability expertise in aviation professionals. These courses can cover topics ranging from carbon emissions management to the implementation of sustainable aviation technologies.

Certifications such as the IATA Environmental Management for Aviation (EMA) and ICAO’s environmental courses can add significant value to your resume, proving your commitment to sustainability and boosting your career prospects. By enhancing your qualifications, you not only increase your value as a professional but also contribute to advancing the industry as a whole.

3. Foster Collaboration and Innovation

Sustainability in aviation requires the collective efforts of all stakeholders. Governments, airlines, manufacturers, regulators, and academics must work together to achieve the sector’s environmental goals. As an aviation professional, you can contribute by actively engaging with sustainability initiatives and collaborating with others in the field.

Look for opportunities to partner with organizations focused on sustainability or join forums and working groups that drive innovation in green aviation. By sharing knowledge and ideas, you will contribute to the collective effort to build a more sustainable aviation future.

Conclusion

Sustainability in aviation is no longer a choice but a necessity. With the environmental impacts of the aviation industry being scrutinized more than ever, governments and organizations worldwide are pushing for greener practices, and professionals must keep pace with these developments. By focusing on continuous training, staying informed about global policies, and actively fostering collaboration, aviation professionals can help build a sustainable future for the industry. As we celebrate World Environment Day, let’s reflect on the collective responsibility we share in ensuring that aviation continues to take flight toward a greener, more sustainable tomorrow.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sustainable-aviation-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 19:05:08.532118

S Africa's Natref refinery set for July-Oct work

London, 26 June (Argus) — South Africa's 107,000 b/d Natref refinery in Sasolburg will undergo a partial maintenance shutdown from July to October affecting several of its units. The turnaround is understood from South African market sources to affect units producing gasoline, middle distillates and heavy end products, including bitumen. The refinery's bitumen customers received communication on 24 June from UK-based Prax Group, Natref's minority shareholder with a 36.4pc stake, saying the refinery will undergo maintenance work from 14 July to 8 October. An official at Sasol, which holds a 63.3pc controlling stake in Natref, said today it could not comment on the refinery's maintenance plans, while Prax officials have so far been unavailable for comment. The refinery's bitumen customers were informed in April that it would cease bitumen production in September, with final stocks of the product to be sold out a month later. The move will be one of the results of a major upgrade programme at the refinery that will enable it to run on light sweet crudes and comply with the country's Clean Fuels 2 regulations that come into force on 1 July 2027. Bitumen market participants said they have been informed that Sasol will maintain normal bitumen production and supply during the upcoming turnaround, while Prax will have no availability of the product. Bitumen production and truck loadings only resumed in early June , following an unexpected outage in mid-May caused by steam supply issues.

Brazil looks to Cop 30 as progress slow at Bonn

Bonn, 26 June (Argus) — Technical climate talks at Bonn, to prepare for political negotiations at the UN Cop 30 summit in Belem, Brazil in November, look set to end with little progress on mitigation — actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions. As negotiations continue, the incoming Brazilian presidency has signalled it is seeking new avenues as formal processes have become bogged down. New nationally determined contributions (NDCs), countries' climate plans to 2035, due this year, were not formally discussed in Bonn. Few nations have submitted them, so far, and commitments will once again likely be insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The Paris agreement seeks to curb the temperature rise to ""well below"" 2°C, and to pursue a 1.5°C limit. Brazil on Wednesday called the NDCs a ""portrait"" of where states see themselves in 2035, saying that if it does not look good ""we will need to work together to improve it."" Brazil and the EU may be pinning hopes on the leaders' summit at Cop 30 to cut through the logjam. The EU ""sees value in having a political space for high-level discussions"" in response to the NDC synthesis report, it said. This report — due to be released on 24 October — will sum up countries' NDCs as long as they are submitted by September. This could provide a focal point for action ahead of the conference. Another avenue to find progress which Brazil has pushed is the ""action agenda"", a programme of voluntary initiatives by national and sub-national governments as well as civil society and private businesses, which runs alongside the formal negotiations between states. There are hopes that the states seeking to push mitigation the most could create a ""coalition of the willing,"" according to Andreas Sieber of environmental non-governmental organization (NGO) 350.org. This would generate momentum for initiatives which then make the leap to the negotiated process. This was the case for the pledge to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, which originated in the action agenda at Cop 28 in Dubai in 2023 but then made it into the formal outcomes of the summit. By engaging first with willing states, Brazil avoids obstructions, typically from large oil exporters. Baku 2.0 But so far in Bonn, progress on a key element for mitigation — a programme to discuss the meaning of the global stocktake (GST) — has bogged down. The GST, conducted in Dubai in 2023, was a review of the progress on reaching the goals of the Paris accord. It expressed the need to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. But talks on the GST have stalled since, and one delegate expressed a fear that the talks could be entering the same realm as the mitigation work programme (MWP), another workstream which has delivered little progress. Ensuring that discussion of options continues between Bonn and Belem will be key to lay the ground for solid outcomes once decision-makers are in the room, with some sensing a shift to more positive engagement. But frustrations over a new $300bn/yr climate finance target for developing nations could resurface in Brazil. Developing and developed countries were at loggerheads on climate finance and mitigation into the last minutes of the Baku summit. Brazilian climate agency Observatorio do Clima said the focus on finance at Bonn was much more prominent than the incoming Cop presidency expected, with Cop 30 risking ""becoming a Baku 2.0"". Meeting the priorities of many developing countries — more, better and accessible finance — may prove difficult. The Brazilian presidency said today that the Baku to Belem roadmap — a workstream decided on last year to work out ways to increase finance on to $1.3tn/yr — was supported by developing countries. But their priorities differ from those of G20 countries, the Brazil presidency said, implying that agreement may be hard to find. In the absence of the US, which did not send a delegation to Bonn, Brussels and Berlin have emerged as new blockers to talking about increasing finance, according to Victor Menotti of NGO Demand climate justice.

Shell moves to quash BP deal talk

London, 26 June (Argus) — Shell today reiterated it is not considering a bid for its UK peer BP, following up its denial on Wednesday, 25 June, and pointed to a London listing rule that imposes restrictions on making an offer. The denials were prompted by a report in the Wall Street Journal that Shell was in early-stage discussions about a possible acquisition of BP. That in turn followed a Bloomberg article in May that said Shell had been evaluating the feasibility of acquiring its rival. Today Shell explicitly pointed to Rule 2.8 of the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which imposes restrictions on a party that has said it does not intend to make an offer for a company that is subject to the code. Usually once a party has said it does not intend to bid for a company subject to the code, that party cannot then make a takeover approach for a period of six months. Shell did note, however, that it has the right to set the Rule 2.8 restrictions aside under certain circumstances, such as if a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for BP. Shell's management team has repeatedly emphasised that the company sees better value in its own shares, which it believes are rated too low by investors. ""Everything we do has to rank against… the shares and the buying back of the shares,"" chief financial officer Sinead Gorman noted on the company's first-quarter earnings call in May.

Australian gas firm sued over ‘greenwashing’ claim

Adelaide, 26 June (Argus) — Australia's competition regulator is suing gas distributor Australian Gas Networks (AGN) in the federal court, alleging ""greenwashing"" occurred in an advertising campaign in 2022 and 2023. AGN misled customers when it ran ""Love Gas"" TV and digital advertisements claiming that gas in its network would be renewable within a generation without holding reasonable grounds that would be the case, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. ""It is not currently possible to distribute renewable gas at scale and at an economically viable price,"" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said on 26 June. ""We allege even though AGN knew the future of renewable gas was uncertain, it made an unqualified representation to consumers that it would distribute renewable gas to households within a generation."" AGN, a major gas distribution firm owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK, forms part of the firm's Australian Gas Infrastructure (AGIG) business. The distributor services more than 1.3mn customers via about 27,000km of distribution networks and 1,300km of gas pipelines. The firm strives to provide clear and accurate communications about the role and benefits of natural gas today and renewable gas into the future and that the company will defend the claims in court, a spokesman for AGIG said. AGIG, an early developer of small-scale green hydrogen blending in gas networks, plans to start operations of its 10MW Hydrogen Park Murray Valley project in late 2025. A 1.25MW project in South Australia's state capital Adelaide began operations in 2021 . Canberra promised to police claims about emissions more strictly, pledging millions of dollars in 2023 to fund regulatory oversight of fossil fuel producers and distributors . The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's first court action for alleged greenwashing was against Mercer Superannuation and concluded in August 2024. The federal court fined the pension fund A$11.3mn ($7.4mn) for misleading statements about seven ""Sustainable Plus"" investment options. The court found that the options included investments in 15 companies involved in fossil fuel sales, such as BHP, Glencore and Whitehaven Coal.

But unlike the E.U. which has established a long-term SAF strategy with its mandates under ReFuelEU (requiring 70% of all fuel uplifted at EU airports be SAF by 2050)2, U.S. SAF policy remains in a state of limbo especially as the H.R. 1 bill (President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”) headed for a Senate vote seeks to hamper the ability of the country’s leading SAF policy - the 45z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit - to truly encourage sustainable SAF production. This paper provides an overview of the technological options available to the U.S. based on its available resources, finding that despite the early success of the HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway, domestic SAF will have to be carried forward by Alcohol-to-Jet, Gasification, and e-SAF pathways. Policy improvements are then recommended to ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of SAF production, in particular for the Alcohol-to-Jet and e-SAF sectors that have a more complex scaling road ahead of them. The objectives of these recommendations include but are not limited to ensuring a thorough LCA understanding of corn ethanol, strengthening the requirements of the Renewable Fuel Standard, and promoting the competitiveness of American electro-fuels. Their ultimate goal, however, is to reach domestic production levels of truly sustainable SAF in line with the targets of the federal government’s Grand SAF Challenge: meeting the projected domestic demand of 35 billion gallons annually by 2050.",Not Available,https://escholarship.org/images/escholarship-facebook2.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 18:13:14.008837

The SAF Matchmaker supports both spot purchases and purchase agreements and is initially available only to airlines and SAF suppliers.
SAF Matchmaker is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.","The SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify the acquisition of SAF, facilitating and streamlining the connection between all parties without additional costs. This will therefore facilitate the development of the voluntary SAF acquisition market.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can publish available or planned volumes, while airlines can register their interest in purchasing the displayed or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent transactions will be conducted offline.

Visibility: The platform contains comprehensive information on available SAF, such as volumes, raw materials used, production location and technology, emissions reductions, and compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

It comes at an opportune moment when it’s marking its record-setting maiden first-ever first flight on its golden 50th-anniversary celebration, marking a grand resurgence for supersonic passenger aircraft.

A Landmark Decision: The “Concorde Bill”

This revival has been made possible by the executive order signed by former U.S. President Donald J. Trump on June 6th, 2025, widely referred to as the “Concorde Bill.” This significant legislation lifts a decades-long ban that had stifled supersonic innovation due to environmental concerns and the disruptive sonic booms created by previous-generation aircraft flying over populated areas. Originally enacted to mitigate noise pollution and environmental impact, the ban effectively halted all progress in supersonic passenger aviation over continental land.

With this landmark regulatory shift, experts predict unprecedented innovation, reigniting global interest and investment in sustainable supersonic technology. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) anticipates significant economic benefits from this resurgence, along with measurable advancements in aerospace engineering and environmental sustainability.

Sustainable Technology: Greener, Quieter, Faster

While the legendary exterior silhouette of Concorde remains unchanged—preserving its status as an icon of aviation elegance—the technology beneath its sleek skin has been entirely transformed. The new-generation Concorde will be approximately 50% lighter than the original model, achieved through the use of advanced composite materials. This significant weight reduction directly translates to superior fuel efficiency and a reduced environmental footprint.

Powered primarily by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the reborn Concorde will deliver an impressive 80% reduction in emissions compared to its predecessor. This dramatic environmental improvement aligns with global aviation goals outlined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which advocates for increased sustainability within the industry.

Additionally, extensive research and design innovations by Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, a distinguished physicist from Oxford University, have culminated in groundbreaking sonic boom suppression technology. After more than two decades of dedicated research, Churchill secured the world’s first patent for this innovative system in May 2025, perfectly timed to coincide with the Concorde revival. This pioneering technology promises dramatically quieter supersonic flights, enabling the aircraft to fly at speeds surpassing Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound) without disruptive sonic booms at ground level.

Luxury Interiors: Timeless Elegance Meets Japanese Aesthetic

Continuing Concorde’s legacy of luxury travel, the new interiors promise an unparalleled passenger experience. Crafted by internationally renowned architects who specialize in sustainable design, the interior space will embody a refined Japanese aesthetic, balancing simplicity, elegance, and sustainability. Passengers can expect meticulously curated cabins designed with natural, eco-friendly materials, enhancing comfort, serenity, and overall well-being at an altitude of 60,000 feet.

This luxurious yet eco-conscious approach firmly positions Concorde at the forefront of modern aviation, where innovation meets indulgence without compromising environmental integrity.

Digital Innovation: Introducing Concorde Coin (CSSC)

The revival of Concorde extends beyond aviation engineering into the realm of digital innovation. Fly-Concorde Limited, spearheading the development, has introduced Concorde Coin (CSSC)—a blockchain-based stablecoin directly backed by tangible Concorde assets and operational revenues. This innovative digital asset aims to offer passengers and investors an exciting and secure way to engage financially with the iconic Concorde brand.

With increasing global acceptance of blockchain and cryptocurrency as secure investment vehicles, CSSC positions Concorde at the intersection of luxury travel and digital finance, appealing to a new generation of tech-savvy travelers and investors alike.

Leadership and Legacy: Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill

Central to this revival is Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, CEO and Founder of Concorde Co., headquartered in Washington state. Churchill’s deeply personal connection to the Concorde legacy traces back to his lineage—his ancestor, Sir Winston Churchill, originally championed the Concorde as a post-World War II peace initiative.

Dr. Churchill, holding three doctoral degrees in physics and related disciplines from the University of Oxford, has passionately committed over 23 years to overcoming the challenges of sonic boom disruption. His leadership and scientific acumen have been instrumental in bringing the Concorde back into the skies, underscoring the significance of innovation-driven, sustainable aviation solutions.

Global Impact and Economic Potential

According to recent projections by aerospace analysts, the Concorde brand—already synonymous with prestige—is now estimated to be worth approximately $50 billion. The revival is expected not only to boost the global aviation industry but also to generate substantial economic impact in regions connected by these supersonic routes, revitalizing tourism and international business.

Government agencies and regulatory bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are actively collaborating to streamline certification processes for the Concorde’s return to service. Both agencies emphasize safety, sustainability, and community acceptance as cornerstones of this new era in aviation.

Conclusion: The Future is Supersonic

While all over the world, fans are itching for its return, the new Concorde represents much more than nostalgia itself—it represents ultimate sustainable aviation technology, luxurious travel, and cutting-edge digital finance innovation. Ideally blending its timeless heritage with forward-looking innovation, Concorde will redefine travel worldwide once again and show how sustainability and luxury can coexist and thrive at supersonic speeds.

IATA Launches SAF Matchmaker for Airlines, Suppliers

Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers. When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

""To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,"" said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The SAF Matchmaker is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.

The in-house labs serve as hubs for AI-centric innovation and collaboration, focusing on aircraft maintenance, customer service, and overall airline operations.

Better Aircraft Maintenance Workflows

The new engine maintenance scheduling tool uses “algorithms to assess millions of different scenarios, each one tailored to factor in operational, financial or technical assumptions, and identify the optimal maintenance schedule for its fleets,” according to aviationweek.com.

The system is being tested on Aer Lingus’ (EI) A320 CFM56-5B engines, and IAG expects the system to be rolled out to its other airlines by the end of the year.

The goal of the IAG fleet maintenance scheduling overhaul is to prevent maintenance delays, thereby addressing the ever-present engine supply chain issues, as airlines and MROs are struggling to obtain essential engine parts, including materials like titanium and high-pressure turbine blades.

Intergrating AI into the MRO workflow can decrease costs, shorten lead times and compensate for labor shortages. We know that due to scarcity, prices for engine parts have surged, and with procurement of parts is taking longer, lead times for some components can extend to months. Finally, there is a shortage of skilled labor in the aerospace industry, further complicating maintenance and repair processes.

IAGi Accelerator Program

Last March, IAG opened applications for its IAGi Accelerator 2025 program, formerly called Hangar 51. The program’s goal is to identify and test ideas that can solve challenges across the aviation industry.

This year’s accelerator is focused on start-ups specialising in AI, “automation, sustainability, customer-focused platforms, connectivity, and next-generation computing technology,” aiming to streamline operational efficiencies, boost productivity, and enhance the customer journey across IAG’s operating companies.

AeroMorning: Mark, can you tell us about the purpose and characteristics of the WindRunner aircraft?

Mark Lundstrom:

The WindRunner aircraft is a project currently being developed by Radia, an aerospace and clean-energy technology company based in Boulder, Colorado, and founded in 2016.

The primary purpose of the WindRunner is to transport wind turbine blades, specifically enabling onshore wind turbines to use blades as long as offshore ones—up to 105 meters in length. Today, onshore turbine blades are typically limited to around 70 meters, as roads and infrastructure can’t accommodate longer blades. Extending onshore blade lengths significantly boosts green energy production efficiency, lowers energy costs, and reduces the land area needed for wind farms.

The WindRunner will be the largest aircraft in the world under development. It features four engines, a length of 108 meters, a wingspan of 80 meters, and has 12 times the internal volume of a Boeing 747.

In terms of performance, WindRunner can land on semi-prepared airstrips as short as 1,800 meters, carrying a maximum payload of 72 metric tonnes.

Thanks to its unique capabilities, WindRunner is expected to have many applications beyond transporting wind turbine blades. These include moving military hardware (such as F-16s or Chinook helicopters), delivering disaster relief equipment, launching satellites, and transporting other oversized cargo anywhere in the world. Radia envisions a fleet of aircraft to meet global demand.

To mitigate development and cost risks, WindRunner is being designed using proven, certified, and mass-produced technologies. There will be no prototype phase—the project will move directly to a certification aircraft, to be certified under FAA Part 25.

The supply chain is already well-integrated, with most of the key suppliers selected. Most of the structural parts will be sourced from Europe:

Wings and engine pylons – Aernnova (Spain)

Fuselage – Leonardo (Italy)

Empennage – Aciturri (Spain)

Landing gear – Magnaghi (Italy)

Testing and certification will be carried out by Radia with other international partners, with program management handled by Radia in Boulder, Colorado.

Initially, the WindRunner will run on conventional jet fuel, but the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is planned in the second phase, once it becomes widely available and economically viable.

In summary, WindRunner is more than a transportation tool—it’s an enabler for a more sustainable world. By making large-scale onshore wind turbines feasible, it helps reduce the concrete and materials required, cuts energy costs, and increases clean energy output to power high-demand infrastructure like AI data centers or to produce green fuels like SAF in greater volumes and at lower prices.

With WindRunner, Radia is playing a key role in building a cleaner, greener future.

Singal's commitment to export-led growth reflects a broader view of America's role in the global energy transition.
In this way, green energy is not just a climate imperative but an economic opportunity, one that brings capital investment, job creation, and export potential to American soil.","As the global economy accelerates toward a lower-carbon future, few voices carry the pragmatic clarity and cross-border vision that Suneet Singal brings to the table. A business leader and sustainability advocate with a forward-leaning approach to infrastructure and clean energy, Singal is helping to define how the United States can emerge not just as a domestic clean energy leader but as an exporter of American-made green technologies, fuels, and expertise to meet global mandates.

Within this ethos is a strong belief in free-market innovation, profitability, and American energy independence, ideals that resonate deeply with conservative principles while aligning with broader climate goals.

The Southern United States, often associated with traditional energy production, now stands at the intersection of tradition and transformation. With its rich biomass reserves, rail and port infrastructure, and globally leading carbon sequestration hubs, the region is positioned to become a powerhouse in the green energy supply chain. Singal sees immense value in tapping into this potential, not just to serve domestic carriers and industries looking to reduce their emissions, but also to build export pipelines to nations whose emissions mandates have already taken effect.

It's a compelling proposition for Republican lawmakers and conservative-minded investors: create jobs at home, build critical infrastructure in America's heartland, and use US-grown technologies to compete on a global stage. Singal understands this alignment well. His work bridges business with policy in a way that encourages private-sector growth while supporting national interests. Rather than chasing tax incentives, Singal's model focuses on unit economics by delivering clean fuels, such as green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), at competitive prices.

Singal's commitment to export-led growth reflects a broader view of America's role in the global energy transition. While Europe is deepening its decarbonization regulations and Asia is ramping up its demand for clean fuels, the United States, under the right leadership, can be the one to supply them.

""We can build globally competitive facilities in the US, leveraging America's biomass abundance, skilled labor, and advanced logistics to deliver profitable solutions abroad. We now have an opportunity where we don't have to be just consumers of the green transition, we can be the suppliers"". Commented Singal.

This strategy also offers an answer to one of the most asked questions in climate policy: how to align environmental responsibility with fiscal discipline. For conservative stakeholders, Singal's approach offers a path that rewards efficiency, innovation, and entrepreneurial drive.

Projects rooted in the US can be designed to meet both global emission standards and market demands. In this way, green energy is not just a climate imperative but an economic opportunity, one that brings capital investment, job creation, and export potential to American soil.

Carbon capture and sequestration stands out as a key player in Singal's blueprint. The Southern US already boasts some of the most advanced geological formations for long-term CO₂ storage. According to the Global CCS Institute, the US leads the world in operational CCS facilities, with more than 20 active commercial-scale projects. Many of these are concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

These sites are essential not only for capturing emissions from traditional industries but also for enabling low-carbon fuel production. By capturing and storing CO₂ from biofuel facilities, for example, producers can generate net-negative emissions fuels, highly attractive to international buyers facing carbon pricing regimes.

But the global opportunity extends beyond fuel. Singal's vision includes not only shipping green methanol or SAF to global partners, but also building localized versions of US facilities abroad. This decentralized-yet-connected system allows the United States to retain intellectual and economic leadership in clean tech, even as it supports the development of greener supply chains overseas.

""It is not a zero-sum game between economic strength and environmental stewardship. With the right strategies and incentives, the two can reinforce each other. America can build at home and serve abroad. It can meet domestic needs while shaping global standards. We can also do this without abandoning our values, but by elevating them, turning competition, innovation, and independence into the cornerstones of climate leadership.""

Yesterday’s Fryer Oil, Tomorrow’s Flight

U.S. kitchens pour out ≈ 3 billion lb of used cooking oil (UCO) every year. Airlines want it: up to 80 % of all new SAF in the next five years will be made through the HEFA pathway that relies on UCO, cutting lifecycle emissions as much as 80 % compared with Jet A. Our own Grease Connections drivers see the demand firsthand: South Florida tankers now head straight from our Miami depot to a nearby HEFA refinery every Friday. The message is simple: when you keep oil clean, you help fuel the next departure board and earn for it.

Five Stops from Kitchen to Cockpit

A typical quick service restaurant produces about 35 lb oil/day. Here’s where Grease Connections steps in:

Cool & pour into a lidded tank: our techs remind crews never to top past 75 % to leave room for expansion.

Smart pickup: our trucks scan the tank tag; a digital manifest hits your inbox before we roll out.

Pre treatment at a regional hub; solids skimmed in under 20 minutes thanks to our heated centrifugal units.

Refinery gate: UCO enters hydroprocessing, stripping oxygen and isomerizing chains to jet spec molecules.

Blend & fly: 865 000 + commercial flights have already used SAF.

What’s Your Oil Worth Today?

USDA spot sheets list yellow grease at $0.33 to $0.45 / lb this week, driving an underground market. One Missouri thief siphoned 258 gal in a single night, nearly $1 000 in diesel equivalent value. Grease Connections curbs that risk with locked lids and GPS sealed pickups; our Orlando district hasn’t lost a gallon since switching to tamper proof hatches last year. Beyond cash, each gallon of UCO based biodiesel can generate LCFS credits; Florida is tightening those rules to push prices higher. Expect the new federal 45Z clean fuel credit to add even more upside when it starts in 2025.

Stay Compliant, Stay Open

EPA’s FOG guide bans any drain disposal and requires documented pickups. NFPA 96 caps unprotected indoor storage at 60 gal for Class IIIB liquids. Grease Connections’ technicians install secondary containment trays that slide out for quick wash downs: health inspectors in Miami tell us it’s the fastest way to ace surprise visits. Our manifests meet cradle to grave traceability rules, a growing focus after reports of fraudulent UCO imports.

How We Beat Grease Bandits

Field lesson: illuminated enclosures plus our steel “shark tooth” lids cut attempted siphoning by 60 % at a Dallas diner row last quarter. Cameras help prosecution, but speed helps more: our average pump out takes five minutes, leaving nothing for thieves. If an overnight spill happens, absorbent socks from our spill kit bag stop oil before it reaches drains; every new customer gets one free at signup.

Choosing the Right Tank: Grease Connections’ Picks

Inside the Refinery: Where Oil Turns to SAF

Hydrotreating removes oxygen; isomerization tailors freeze points. HEFA is still the only fully commercial SAF route, supplying 80 % of today’s volumes. For every 1 000 gal processed, lifecycle CO₂ drops roughly 70 t compared with petroleum jet A. Grease Connections contracts guarantee our loads head to SAF, not lower value diesel, so your waste truly helps aviation decarbonize.

ESG Story Your Customers Will Love

One fast food location recycling with us diverts 12 000 + lb of oil a year (based on our Atlanta route logs). We bundle annual recycling reports you can post on menu boards or RFPs: proof that your fries help power flights, not landfills. With travelers and corporate buyers asking for low carbon dining, this is a story worth telling.

Quick Fire FAQ

Minimum pickup? We start at 50 gal, about two weeks for a busy diner.

Hot water down the drain? Still illegal under FOG rules.

Are imports losing credit eligibility? Yes, as 45Z favors domestic, fully traced oil.

Does SAF really fly now? 865 000 + flights so far.

And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels, and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 litres per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritise climate action over their very tight profit margins.

Up in the air

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the UK wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonise aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/676581/original/file-20250625-56-arar05.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=444%2C1508%2C4721%2C2360&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-26 13:08:12.984414

An ABF spokesperson said:

“We are extremely pleased to be entering the next phase of formal negotiations with Government over the future of Vivergo.

We believe it is a very positive signal that Government recognises the strategic importance of a domestic bioethanol industry, and is serious about working with the sector to find a sustainable long-term future. We look forward to engaging intensively and constructively with ministers over the coming weeks.

ABF cannot continue to absorb losses at the plant. That is why a timely solution is vital. Our clear preference is to find that solution through this process and to get back to running a business that can thrive in the long term.

In parallel, we have entered into a consultation process with our employees - a necessary step given there can be no guarantee that the negotiations with Government will be successful. Our employees are our most important consideration, and we will engage with them properly and transparently about the future. Consultation is not a fixed outcome - and closure is not a certainty. The outcome depends on the progress we are able to make through negotiations with the Government. Our goal is for that outcome to be positive.

We want to keep Vivergo operating. We have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in it. We have fought hard to save it - and the potential ahead is enormous. Just days ago, we signed a £1.25 billion Memorandum of Understanding with Meld Energy to anchor a world-class Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at the site. There is a real opportunity for Hull to be home to one of Britain’s most exciting clean fuel clusters.

ABF has always been and remains a long-term UK investor with a consistent record of supporting UK industry and jobs. We are committed to playing a lasting role in the country’s green industrial future.”

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), an industry group that represents 350 global airlines, has created a new online platform to match airlines with sustainable fuel companies.

The new matchmaker platform is designed to streamline the complicated and expensive process airlines must endure in order to find a sustainable fuel provider that suits their needs. Air carriers can submit their requests on the platform, and fuel providers can then follow up with their supply details. When there’s a match, the companies can take their discussion offline to hammer out details like pricing and payment terms.

IATA says the central database was designed in order to facilitate more voluntary purchases of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The organization has set an ambitious goal for the air travel industry to operate on a carbon neutral basis in less than 30 years.

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist. “The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

Sustainable jet fuel currently only makes up 0.3% of jet fuel use around the globe, according to a recent report by the World Travel and Tourism Council.

The matchmaker platform will include comprehensive details about the fuel options, including volumes of supply, type of feedstock used, location and technology of production, emissions reduction, and compliance with various regulations, such as the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive.

For now, IATA’s platform is only available to airlines and fuel suppliers. However, the organization says that in due time, the database will open up to other non-aviation corporations who wish to participate.

In addition to making sustainable fuel options more accessible, IATA’s plan to achieve net zero emissions includes using other technologies, like those that remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

But the Department for Transport has been accused of undermining domestic bioethanol producers by awarding green energy subsidies to American producers that make the chemical from waste, which is seen as more eco-friendly.

ABF is asking for an end to the green energy certificates being awarded to American producers.","Ministers are racing to save Britain’s largest bioethanol plant after the owner warned it would be forced to close the site without state intervention.

On Thursday, Associated British Foods (ABF) said it had entered into last-ditch talks with the Government about securing support for its Vivergo Fuels business in Hull, which is losing £3m a month.

Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, also confirmed he was engaging “in good faith” with the company and could commit taxpayer money to a rescue package.

If the negotiations fail, ABF’s bosses have threatened to close the factory by Sept 13.

The company has accused ministers of rendering its business unprofitable by awarding subsidies to rival American producers.

Bosses had previously warned they would decide this week whether to close the plant, which makes bioethanol for blending into petrol and employs around 150 people.

But ABF said it had entered “formal negotiations” about whether the site could be kept going. It is understood that the decision follows an intervention by Mr Reynolds.

The Government’s offer to the company remains unclear. But ABF is demanding “short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses” as well as a longer-term deal to put its plant on a profitable footing again.

In a move that piled further pressure on ministers, the company warned: “Given the outcome of the negotiations is uncertain, Vivergo is simultaneously beginning consultation with employees to effect an orderly wind-down.”

The plant, which can produce 420,000m litres of bioethanol per year, had already stopped ordering wheat feedstock, it added.

Losing the facility would leave the UK more reliant on foreign imports and dent ambitions for domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel.

The chemicals sector is described as one of several “foundation industries” in the industrial strategy published by ministers on Monday.

A spokesman for the Government said ABF’s latest ultimatum was “disappointing to see”, while Mr Reynolds described it as “premature”.

Mr Reynolds told journalists: “We have secured a mandate across government to negotiate with them.

“That means we’re willing to engage with them and potentially put government money into a restructure to make sure they’ve got a strong future.

“We have met them many times. We’ve engaged the consultants and we’re well into the process.

“Frankly, I really do regret the Vivergo’s decision to start consultations to let the workforce go and close the plant.”

Only two plants in the UK make bioethanol, which is most commonly blended with petrol to make greener fuels such as E5 and E10.

The vast majority of production uses primary feedstocks such as sugar crops or wheat that are processed to yield fermentable sugars that are then converted into ethanol. Because the fuel is made from plants, it is regarded as renewable.

But the Department for Transport has been accused of undermining domestic bioethanol producers by awarding green energy subsidies to American producers that make the chemical from waste, which is seen as more eco-friendly.

ABF and domestic competitor Ensus say ministers then compounded the problem by striking a trade deal with the US that grants American bioethanol producers tariff-free access to the UK market.

The trade deal has not yet taken effect but ABF says its plant in Hull is already unprofitable and cannot be sustained. It has already written £700m off its value.

Ensus, which runs the country’s only other bioethanol plant, has similarly warned that its facility in Teesside is at risk.

Previous talks between the companies and the Government had not made serious progress.

But it is understood that Mr Reynolds and Heidi Alexander, the Transport Secretary, met company bosses on Tuesday and that the Government has brought in consultants to examine ABF’s proposed rescue package.

It turns out that restaurants, street food stalls and home cooks in Malaysia — which is “among the world’s leading suppliers of both UCO and virgin palm oil” — will pay less for fresh cooking oil than the international market will pay for used cooking oil.
Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact).
Virgin palm oil can be substituted for used cooking oil and voila!
Malaysia exports far more “used” cooking oil than oil that it uses.","The ever-excellent Matt Levine points us to the amusing economic policies that connect the international jet-set to Malaysian street hawkers of fried noodles. The EU and the US have created strong economic incentives to create sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and a good way to do this is to recycle used cooking oil (UCO). What could be better, right? Take a waste product and turn it into jet fuel! The EU and US policies, however, are so strong that all the EU and US used cooking oil cannot meet the demand. Here’s a great sentence, “Europe simply cannot collect enough used cooking oil to fly its planes.”

In the US, credits under the Inflation Reduction Act can account for up to $1.75 to $1.85 per gallon of SAF. Meanwhile cooking oil is subsidized in some parts of the world. The result?

It turns out that restaurants, street food stalls and home cooks in Malaysia — which is “among the world’s leading suppliers of both UCO and virgin palm oil” — will pay less for fresh cooking oil than the international market will pay for used cooking oil. Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact). Also fresh cooking oil is subsidized by the government in Malaysia: “Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.” So if you run a restaurant, you can buy fresh cooking oil for about $0.60 (USD), use it to fry food a few times, and then sell it to a refiner for $1, which is a nice little subsidy for the difficult, risky, low-margin business of running a restaurant.

The noodle hawkers in Kuala Lumpur are getting a nice little bump in profit but who is going stall to stall to check that the oil is in fact used? And what counts as used? One fry or two? Clever entrepreneurs have cut out the middleman. Virgin palm oil can be substituted for used cooking oil and voila! Sustainable aviation fuel is contributing to deforestation in Malaysia. Malaysia exports far more “used” cooking oil than oil that it uses. No surprise.

All of this illustrates a broader point: externalities suggest policy interventions may improve outcomes but markets are complex and politics is blunt. It’s easy to make things worse. If intervention is necessary, a uniform carbon tax beats a patchwork of production-specific subsidies. A price is a signal wrapped up in an incentive. Send everyone the same signal and the same incentive to ensure that the cheapest emissions are cut first and total costs are minimized.

Crucially, a carbon tax rewards any effective solution, even ones a planner would never think of–lighter planes and cleaner fuels sure but also operational tweaks like jet washes. In contrast, subsidies tether policy to specific technologies, like used cooking oil. That invites rent-seeking and inefficiency.

Tax carbon, not inputs. Avoid games with paperwork. One verification point at the fuel supply point is simpler than tracing global waste-oil chains. Don’t subsidize the fry oil and audit the street hawkers. Tax the emissions.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RNbmR40xThM/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&rs=AOn4CLCM2ybrzB3Y9w8WkND8UK8ZnmAVSA,N,,2025-06-26 12:22:39.293902

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only.

(Reuters) -Associated British Foods said it would close the UK’s largest bioethanol plant by September if the government does not provide support and funding, potentially the first victim of Britain’s tariff deal with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Under last month’s trade deal, the UK’s 19% tariffs on U.S. ethanol will fall to zero, through a 1.4 billion-litre (370 million gallon) quota – a figure equating to the size of the UK’s entire ethanol market.

The possible closure would be an embarrassment for Prime Minister Keir Starmer who hailed the trade deal as a boost to businesses that would protect jobs and attract investment.

It also underscores how Trump’s assault on trade is being felt around the world, with the closure set to affect the production of byproducts including animal feed and carbon dioxide, and British arable farmers which supply the industry.

Bioethanol is produced from crops such as wheat and is used to make petrol greener and to make sustainable aviation fuel. On Monday, Starmer’s government launched its industrial strategy, promising to invest in the green economy.

Britain has two major bioethanol plants in northern England – AB Foods’ Vivergo plant and one operated by Ensus, owned by Germany’s Sudzucker Group – which account for nearly all of the UK’s production capacity.

They have warned that the trade deal, along with existing regulations that give U.S. producers an advantage in the British market, has made the environment impossible. The industry supports thousands of jobs.

Ensus, which has warned its Teesside plant also faces imminent closure, on Thursday welcomed the appointment of external advisers to work with the industry, and said it would work with the government “urgently”.

LEVEL THE REGULATORY PLAYING FIELD

AB Foods said on Thursday it would begin consultations with employees for an orderly wind-down of its plant, while simultaneously continuing talks with the government, which it said is now committed to reaching “a sustainable solution”.

It said it would cease all manufacturing before September 13, its financial year-end, “unless the government is able to provide both short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses and a longer-term solution.”

A spokesperson for the government said it was disappointed with AB Foods’ announcement, having entered into negotiations with the company on financial support on Wednesday.

The government would “present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods,” the spokesperson added.

AB Foods wants the government to increase the amount of ethanol in UK petrol from 10% to 15% and support the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

It also wants the industry to have access to short-term financial aid of up to 150 million pounds ($202 million).

Britain’s concession on ethanol was made in return for the removal of 25% additional tariffs on steel and aluminium, and a quota of 100,000 cars at a duty of 10%.

Swedavia's airports Visby Airport, Åre Östersund Airport and Kiruna Airport have now achieved Airport Carbon Accreditation level 5, the highest international certification according to the standard for climate transition work at the world’s airports. This positions Swedavia as a world leader in the aviation sector, as seven out of ten Swedavia airports are now certified at the highest level.

“The fact that three new Swedavia airports have achieved the highest climate certification is clear evidence of our long-term, goal-oriented effort to drive the climate transition in the aviation industry. With seven out of ten airports certified at ACA level 5, we have shown that it is possible to combine critical infrastructure with climate leadership,"" says Fredrik Jaresved, Director of Strategic Initiatives and Innovation at Swedavia.

The long-term goal is for the Swedish aviation industry to be completely fossil-free for domestic flights by 2030 and for international flights by 2045, in line with the aviation industry’s joint roadmap within the framework of Fossil-Free Sweden. Swedavia firmly believes that sustainable aviation fuel, electric aircraft and hydrogen-powered aircraft are vital elements in achieving the green transition in the aviation industry.

Swedavia became fossil-free in its own airport operations at all ten airports as early as 2020, making the Group the first in the world to achieve this. By 2025, all ground operations at Swedavia’s airports that are carried out by other operators will also be made fossil-free through the partnership plan that has been developed, which involves all operators at the airports signing an agreement with Swedavia stipulating a focus on phasing out fossil fuels from their operations.

With Visby Airport, Åre Östersund Airport and Kiruna Airport achieving Level 5 certification within Airport Carbon Accreditation, seven out of ten Swedavia airports are now certified at the highest level. This achievement follows Göteborg Landvetter Airport and Malmö Airport, which were certified at Level 5 in December 2023, and Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Ronneby Airport, which were certified in October 2024. With ACA 5 certification of Visby, Åre Östersund and Kiruna, Swedavia has taken the final steps necessary to phase out fossil fuels at all levels at these three airports.

Within the framework of Airport Carbon Accreditation, Swedavia's ambition is for its remaining three airports - Bromma Stockholm Airport, Luleå Airport and Umeå Airport - to be certified at level 5 by 2026.

Concorde Supersonic Jet to Return by 2026

After decades of silence, Concorde is on track to become the world’s leading supersonic passenger aircraft once again.

The recently signed executive order clears regulatory airspace that had long blocked overland supersonic travel due to sonic boom and environmental concerns. The new legislation positions the U.S. as a leader in next-generation aerospace innovation and sustainability.

The new Concorde will remain true to its iconic silhouette but will be 50% lighter and use advanced composite materials and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), cutting emissions by 80%.

It will cruise at 60,000 feet, significantly higher than conventional commercial jets, while operating faster, quieter, and cleaner than the original.

The interior will reflect minimalist Japanese aesthetics, developed by leading sustainable architects. Every feature, from cabin design to propulsion systems, will incorporate cutting-edge aerospace technologies rooted in decades of research and development.

Leadership, Legacy, and Supersonic Breakthroughs

At the helm of this supersonic revival is Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, CEO and Founder of The Concorde Co., based in Washington state.

A triple PhD from Oxford and an expert physicist, Dr. Churchill is credited with solving the long-standing sonic boom challenge. His patented Sonic Boom Suppression technology, granted in May 2025, enables Concorde to fly overland without disturbing ground-level communities.

Dr. Churchill is a direct descendant of Sir Winston Churchill, whose original Concorde initiative was launched as a post-World War II peace project. Now, his legacy continues through the rebirth of this aviation legend, targeted for launch on its 50th anniversary.

Patricia Bader-Johnston, Vice President and Chief Development Officer at Fly-Concorde Limited, emphasizes the aircraft’s broader vision: “Concorde is set to become the global benchmark for sonic boom suppression and sustainability.”

Financial Innovation

Fly-Concorde is also innovating on the financial front. It has introduced Concorde Coin (CSSC), a stablecoin backed by Concorde’s aviation assets and operations.

With blockchain technology gaining global traction, CSSC is designed to attract investors aligned with futuristic, environmentally responsible air travel ventures.

This digital currency initiative aims to fund development while enabling broader engagement in Concorde’s mission. The move reflects growing synergy between aerospace advancement and decentralized finance.

Globally recognized as a pinnacle of aviation excellence, the Concorde brand is now valued at approximately $50 billion. The upcoming relaunch aims to restore its reputation as the epitome of luxury air travel, now aligned with modern values of environmental stewardship, digital innovation, and safety.

History of the Supersonic Era

The Concorde, a joint marvel by British Airways (BA) and Air France (AF), revolutionized high-speed air travel with its supersonic performance. Operating primarily between London Heathrow (LHR), Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), and New York John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK), Concorde represented the peak of technological ambition in commercial aviation.

The aircraft’s inaugural transatlantic flight occurred on September 26, 1973, marking a new era of rapid travel. Despite initial global fascination, the Concorde’s commercial future was constrained by high operational costs, limited routes, and its eventual involvement in a fatal accident in 2000.

Birth of a Supersonic Dream

Concorde’s development began with the 1962 treaty between France and the UK, aiming to share the cost and innovation challenges of producing a supersonic transport (SST).

British Aerospace and Aérospatiale collaborated on the aircraft’s frame, while Rolls-Royce and SNECMA developed its powerful Olympus 593 engines. This cooperation marked a defining moment in European aerospace engineering.

After its maiden flight on March 2, 1969, the Concorde entered commercial service on January 21, 1976. British Airways (BA) initially operated the London (LHR) to Bahrain route, and Air France (AF) flew from Paris (CDG) to Rio de Janeiro (GIG). Shortly after, both airlines launched regular services to Washington Dulles (IAD) and New York JFK (JFK), offering transatlantic flights in under three and a half hours.

Although capable of cruising at Mach 2.04 (2,179 km/h), the Concorde was never economically viable. Only 14 production aircraft entered commercial service, with persistent financial losses leading to route reductions until JFK remained the only regular destination. The aircraft’s sonic boom and high noise levels also restricted route expansion.

Tupolev Tu-144, Copy of Concorde?

The Tupolev Tu-144, the world’s first supersonic transport (SST) aircraft, was a milestone in Soviet aerospace engineering. Designed by legendary aircraft designer Andrey N. Tupolev and his son Alexey, the Tu-144 symbolized the USSR’s ambition to lead in high-speed aviation during the Cold War era.

First flown in December 1968 and surpassing Mach 1 in June 1969, the Tu-144 predated Concorde’s first supersonic flight. It was publicly unveiled in Moscow in May 1970 and stood as a technological marvel with futuristic design elements and record-breaking performance.

Despite its technical achievements, the Tu-144’s career was marred by high-profile incidents. A tragic crash during a demonstration at the 1973 Paris Air Show raised early concerns. Though the aircraft began mail service on the Moscow–Alma-Ata route in 1975 and passenger service in 1978, another fatal crash that same year led to its commercial withdrawal.

Only 55 passenger flights were completed before Aeroflot ceased its SST operations. The aircraft’s high operating costs, limited range, and reliability issues made it commercially unsustainable.

While its commercial role was short-lived, later Tu-144 variants were used in experimental flight programs. Notably, in the 1990s, a modified Tu-144LL flew under a joint Russian-American program to advance next-generation supersonic transport technology.

Final Years and Grounding

On July 25, 2000, Air France Flight 4590 (AF4590), a Concorde departing from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) to New York JFK, crashed shortly after takeoff.

A burst tire punctured a fuel tank, igniting a fire that led to engine failure. The aircraft crashed into a nearby hotel in Gonesse, France, killing all 109 on board and 4 on the ground.

This tragedy, combined with growing maintenance costs and declining passenger numbers, marked the beginning of the end.

Air France retired its Concorde fleet in May 2003, and British Airways followed in October 2003, officially concluding the era of supersonic commercial aviation.

A demonstration project located in Taonan in Northeast China's Jilin province is expected to produce the first barrel of green methanol in July, which will subsequently be transported to Shanghai Port to bunker the commercial logistics vessels under French shipping and logistics group CMA CGM, according to Ni Jianjun, deputy general manager of Shanghai Boiler Works Co Ltd, a unit of Shanghai Electric Group Co Ltd.

""The Taonan site has an annual production capacity of 50,000 metric tons, and we have plans to build more capacity to meet soaring market demand,"" said Ni.

As a type of clean and renewable energy, green methanol is produced mainly from renewable energies featuring high efficiency, clean emission, renewability, easy storage and transportation convenience.

Despite rising demand for green transition across the global shipping industry, production capability of clean energies remains limited.

Throughout 2024, orders for 515 vessels using alternative fuels including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and methanol were placed, up 38 percent year-on-year, with 166 ships to be powered by methanol, reported the Shanghai-based newspaper Jiefang Daily citing data from international certification and classification body DNV.

Among the 180 million tons of methanol produced worldwide in 2023, merely 500,000 are green methanol, including some 300,000 tons produced in China, according to a Shanghai Observer report.

According to Ni, apart from the Taonan project, a much bigger project with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons of methanol is in the pipeline.

What's noteworthy is that all the core technologies and key equipment used in the Taonan project are researched and developed by Shanghai Electric, Ni added.

""CMA CGM's demand for green methanol is much bigger than the 50,000 tons we are going to provide. In fact, there is a supply shortage in terms of green methanol globally,"" Ni said.

Public information shows the demand for green methanol is projected to surpass 10 million tons by 2030, while production is only approaching 500,000 tons annually for the moment.

In addition to the innovative application of green energy in the shipping industry, Shanghai Electric has plans to develop sustainable aviation fuel and will continue to introduce more green fuel solutions for various sectors, Ni said.

On its way to building itself into an international shipping hub, the port of Shanghai is also seizing the emerging opportunities that green transition creates.

A simultaneous ship-to-ship bunkering of green methanol for dual-powered container ship HMM Green under South Korean logistics company was conducted in March at Shanghai's Yangshan Port, becoming the first bunkering of domestically produced green methanol, according to Shanghai International Port (Group) Co Ltd.

The bunkering was conducted by the Hai Gang Zhi Yuan tanker, the nation's first and largest methanol bunkering vessel in operation. In comparison with the bunkering conducted by Hai Gang Zhi Yuan for Danish shipping and logistics services provider A.P.Moller-Maersk's Astrid Maersk in April 2024, the latest bunkering involves a greater amount of green methanol, about 2,900 tons, and the green energy is produced in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.

Indonesia is emerging as a promising destination for energy transition investments. Two of the country’s leading sovereign wealth funds have recently reaffirmed their commitment to scaling up investments in clean energy.

At the same time, the European Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia (EuroCham Indonesia) is advocating for the development of low-carbon fuels such as bioenergy, encouraging local companies to tap into global decarbonization trends to drive export-led industrial growth.

INA, Danantara target nickel processing, clean power, and grid upgrades

At the Energy Transition Forum co-hosted by the Financial Times and Nikkei on June 25, Indonesian Investment Authority (INA) and the newly established sovereign fund Danantara outlined their upcoming investment priorities, naming electric vehicle battery supply chains, solar energy, and grid modernization among key targets.

INA CEO Ridha Wirakusumah noted that renewable energy currently accounts for about 12% of INA’s US$4 billion portfolio and is expected to rise to 15–20% this year. The fund is not only supporting the early retirement of coal plants but also focusing on geothermal, solar, and waste-to-energy projects.

Ridha highlighted a solar power project under discussion that could break the record for the largest installed capacity in the country. In the EV space, INA is prioritizing nickel processing, an essential link in battery manufacturing, leveraging Indonesia’s abundant mineral resources to build a competitive position in the global EV supply chain.

In May, INA, Danantara, and French mining giant Eramet signed an MoU focused on building a domestic nickel ecosystem for EV battery materials. The agreement was witnessed by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.

Foreign stakeholders urge acceleration of low-carbon fuel exports

Danantara Chief Investment Officer Pandu Sjahrir, also speaking at the forum, emphasized the fund’s dual focus on nickel processing and upgrading the national power grid. Indonesia’s outdated electricity infrastructure, originally built to serve fossil fuel plants, is now seen as a major bottleneck to renewable integration.

Danantara, launched in February under the Prabowo administration, is authorized to manage the assets of key state-owned enterprises such as the national oil company Pertamina. The fund oversees assets worth over US$900 billion and is pursuing nine strategic investment areas, including mining for battery minerals, biofuel agriculture, and renewable power.

Foreign investors see Indonesia’s vast natural resources and strategic location as offering immense export potential. Thomas Wagner, head of EuroCham Indonesia’s energy working group, recently stated at a geopolitical forum that Indonesia should move swiftly to develop low-carbon fuels, including bio-based sustainable aviation fuel and bio-methanol, which could generate up to US$8 billion annually in exports.

Wagner urged Indonesian companies to take a proactive stance in capturing surging global demand and benefiting from favorable policies.

Oil and gas licensing In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry.
The checkpoint is used to assess whether proposed oil and gas licenses align with the UK’s climate change goals.
This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans.","The British government weakened key climate policies after fossil fuel giants lobbied ministers and used legal loopholes to avoid public scrutiny, a new report has found.

Climate-focused think tank InfluenceMap has uncovered that industry influence appears to have led to the delay and dilution of UK policies on the roll-out of heat pumps, the development of ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel and the granting of new oil and gas licenses.

In each case, it found that lobbyists representing fossil fuel actors that stood to lose billions from progressive climate regulations were able to influence the Conservative government’s policy without scrutiny.

While InfluenceMap’s report looks at policies relating to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, its findings on the way the UK’s lax laws allow lobbying to be conducted in secret can be applied across sectors. The think tank is calling for reforms to address this and close the “major transparency gap”.

The secrecy around lobbying, which has been at the heart of many government scandals in recent years, is a major driver of the disillusionment in British politics.

Three-quarters of the public believe the government is “rigged to serve the rich and influential”, according to polling conducted by More in Common and University College London’s Policy Lab last year.

InfluenceMap’s findings illustrate “how inadequate and opaque lobbying rules undermine effective policymaking”, said Alastair McCapra, the CEO of the UK lobbying industry body.

He added: “Business engagement should help to build sounder policy with better outcomes for the public, but unaccountable lobbying breeds public mistrust. This important report removes the guesswork needed to piece together what kind of lobbying is taking place.”

Weak lobbying laws

openDemocracy has previously reported extensively on the ways that the UK’s weak lobbying laws allow corporate influence to secretly shape policy.

Our investigations have now been backed up by InfluenceMap, which has found a huge gap exists between the lobbying that takes place and that which is disclosed. This means the British public often has no way of knowing who is swaying policy.

Comparing transparency rules in the UK, the European Parliament, the US, Canada and France, InfluenceMap found that the UK has by far the worst system.

Of the five, only the UK exempts lobbyists who work in-house for a company, rather than for an agency or consultancy, from registering with a statutory lobbying watchdog. Less than 15% of lobbyists working in the UK need to register because of this rule.

The firms on the register must publish a list of clients on whose behalf they have lobbied each quarter. But they do not have to publish any details about the lobbying, including whether it involved written correspondence or a meeting and what legislation or policy was discussed.

Registered lobbyists also only need to declare clients for whom they lobbied government ministers and senior officials. There is no requirement to name clients when they approached other MPs and peers, including those on select committees, or influential government advisers.

The Committee for Standards in Public Life, an independent public body that advises the prime minister on lobbying and other aspects of public office, has consistently recommended the government publish a single, searchable database of all meetings with lobbyists.

Its recommendations would expand the scope of the current register considerably, requiring lobbyists to disclose the specific policies or legislation they discussed at meetings with government ministers and special advisers.

InfluenceMap has also called on the government to take up this recommendation and address the fundamental flaws in the lobbying act by including in-house lobbyists and publishing all responses to government policy consultants as standard.

Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said the report “starkly demonstrates how major transparency gaps in the UK’s lobbying regime are undermining the development of good climate policy.”

“We fully support their recommendations to make lobbying much more transparent and bring the UK in line with international best practice. These reforms would support more participatory and open decision-making to help rebuild public trust and ensure better decision-making, widening the evidence base for policy making and reducing risks of policy capture by vested interests,” she said.

Oil and gas licensing

In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. The checkpoint is used to assess whether proposed oil and gas licenses align with the UK’s climate change goals.

Oil giants BP and Shell and their industry association, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), responded to a consultation on the checkpoint by objecting to the inclusion of two key metrics for measuring the impact of fossil fuels, according to InfluenceMap’s analysis of consultation responses obtained via Freedom of Information requests.

The measures they opposed would have required the government to consider ‘Scope 3 emissions’ and the ‘global production gap’ when issuing new oil and gas licences.

Scope 3 emissions are produced during end-use and contribute the largest share of all emissions from oil and gas production, while the production gap tracks the discrepancy between planned fossil fuel production and what’s needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.

The government dropped both criteria from the final checkpoint, which instead focuses solely on operational emissions, which represent only a fraction of total emissions from oil and gas projects.

This outcome, InfluenceMap’s report notes, strongly aligns with the positions advocated for by BP, Shell, and OEUK, suggesting their lobbying efforts were successful.

The following year, the government approved 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences, which had a potential emissions footprint equivalent to Denmark’s annual output.

InfluenceMap’s report also highlights the issues around government consultations on proposed policies, pointing out that, as in this case, lobbyists typically use these to suggest amendments in favour of their clients, but their responses are not published as standard.

Similarly, unlike in the other four Parliaments InfluenceMap looked at, corporations in the UK are not required to declare their engagement on policies, how much they spend on lobbying, or which legislation or decisions they are targeting.

It highlights that this can lead to a situation in which companies make voluntary corporate disclosures that fail to capture the true extent of this advocacy. In this case, InfluenceMap found BP published a summary of its response to the checkpoint that omitted key lines of its opposition, which were only revealed later through Freedom of Information requests.

Rachel Davies, advocacy director at Transparency International UK, said: “This report highlights, yet again, the glaring gaps in our lobbying transparency regime and the potential risks of favouring a small group of vested interests at the public’s expense.

“The UK needs to catch up to other comparable democracies and act swiftly to introduce a comprehensive lobbying register with meaningful disclosures.”

Domestic hydrogen

It is broadly agreed that, in the UK, hydrogen is not a viable solution for decarbonising domestic heating and is an especially bad alternative to heat pumps. Much of our hydrogen comes from burning gas or coal and it cannot be transported through our existing pipelines without massive and costly infrastructure changes.

This reality has been set out by different independent bodies advising the UK government.

In 2021, the Climate Change Committee warned that hydrogen had “not yet been proven at scale and should not be a cause to delay other options” such as the roll-out of heat pumps or low-carbon heat networks. Two years later, the National Infrastructure Commission said the government “should not support the roll-out of hydrogen heating” because there is “no public policy case” for its use.

As InfluenceMap’s report notes, this has not prevented the gas industry from waging a successful lobbying campaign in a bid to shore up its market position – with a clear impact on government policy.

The think tank found the industry pursued its cause in a number of ways, including setting up Hello Hydrogen, a campaign fronted by TV star Rachel Riley, to make the case for using hydrogen in homes to the public in 2022. While the campaign did not declare its funders, its director was also a director of Cadent Gas, the UK’s largest gas distribution network.

Cadent is one of the funders of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hydrogen, which has publicly called for hydrogen to play a part in domestic heating. The APPG’s other funders include Equinor, Shell and the Energy and Utilities Alliance, a lobbying body run by Mike Foster, the former Labour MP for Worcester (home to Worcester Bosch, a major manufacturer of gas boilers).

Other fossil fuel firms and industry lobbying bodies have also consistently pushed for the use of hydrogen in domestic heating in letters to parliamentary select committees and responses to government consultations.

Ahead of last year’s general election, Centrica (formerly British Gas) wrote to the Public Accounts Committee, which examines the value for money of government projects, to call for further public investment in hydrogen for home heating. The firm had written to the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee in support of the technology less than 12 months earlier.

This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans. A February 2023 report by the House of Lords Committee blamed mixed messages on the effectiveness of hydrogen from the government and industry for the poor uptake of a publicly subsidised scheme for heat pumps, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create many jobs.

The lords’ report concluded: “Hydrogen is not a serious option for home heating for the short to medium-term and misleading messages, including from the government, are negatively affecting take-up of established low-carbon home heating technologies like heat pumps.”

The UK’s heat pump roll-outs have lagged behind those of its neighbours. Just 55,000 heat pumps were installed in the UK in 2019, compared to 600,000 in France, according to a study cited in the InfluenceMap report.

In the UK, this reportedly created around 2,000 jobs and reduced emissions of CO₂ by 0.08 million tonnes (MT); in France 30,000 jobs were created and 0.84 MT of CO₂ emissions avoided.

‘Sustainable’ aviation fuel

InfluenceMap also uncovered how industry significantly influenced the government’s so-called ‘Jet Zero’ strategy for cutting emissions in the UK’s aviation industry, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Biofuels, largely made up of used cooking oils, are often suggested as an option for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), although they are generally accepted to be worse in terms of scalability than other, more advanced fuels, and much worse than just reducing the number of flights.

The government initially proposed limiting the use of used cooking oil for SAF to alleviate competition on the resource – which is increasingly in demand for other uses, such as producing biodiesel for cars – and to encourage investment in new technologies for the aviation industry.

The proposals included two options; either banning the use of used cooking oil for SAF altogether, or rapidly phasing down its use so that it would make up just 8.5% of total sustainable aviation fuel by 2040.

But the government’s final SAF policy was more closely aligned with industry preferences than scientific warnings, InfluenceMap found. It allows used cooking oil to make up 100% of SAF uptake in 2025 and 2026, 71% in 2030, and 35% in 2040.

InfluenceMap’s analysis reveals the weakened SAF mandate came after pressure from Shell, BP, the International Airlines Group (which owns several airlines), Airlines UK (the trade body for UK-registered airlines) and Virgin Atlantic airline.

It also found that business interests were overrepresented in parliamentary meetings on SAF while the policy was being shaped.

This can be seen in the make-up of Parliament’s Jet Zero Council, “a partnership between industry academia and government”, which was run by Heathrow’s chief operating officer, while the International Airlines Group chaired the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Delivery Group.

The council comprised 24 members from industry, three from academia and one from civil society. Ministers were also directly involved with the council, with then-prime minister Boris Johnson attending the group’s first meeting along with four ministers.

Global aviation desperately needs Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Boeing’s recovery depends on successful sales of its aircraft. Below are two articles that show how these two imperatives have flowed together nicely for the

Seattle/Chicago/Arlington? company.

Boeing is seeking to sell its aircraft to Canada and India

The two countries pose prime opportunities to develop SAF

An apt term for Boeing’s substantial investment in each country’s Green Technologies while hoping to sell both members of the Commonwealth of Nations (a/k/a British Commonwealth) might be

The investment is well justified from both a financial and a environmental basis. Here are some of the explanations of the need and the challenge:

More SAF feedstocks = cheaper green fuel?

The SAF investments are absolutely critical to attaining the 2050 Global Goal of Net Zero Carbon Emissions. Contributing to target markets is a wise way to match environmental goals with sales.

Boeing Sees India as Crucial Player in Sustainable Aviation Future

India has the potential of producing 8-10 million tonnes annually, said President of Boeing India and South Asia, Salil Gupte

India can emerge as a net exporter of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and play a significant role in global green and clean aviation. Speaking at the CII Annual Business Summit 2025 in New Delhi, President of Boeing India and South Asia, Salil Gupte, highlighted that the availability of abundant feedstock like agricultural residue in India can be used for SAF production and help in the reduction of carbon emissions from the aviation sector, the Business Standard reported.

“This means that India can actually provide over 5% of the world’s SAF requirements...India can be an exporter of SAF. This creates an opportunity. This means India can help decarbonise the civil aviation industry,” said President of Boeing India and South Asia, Salil Gupte, according to BS.

SAF annual production must reach 185 million tonnes to meet the global net-zero aviation target by 2050. India, with its various kinds of feedstock, including used cooking oil and farm waste, has the potential of producing 8-10 million tonnes annually, he added.

This comes months after Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury mentioned that the aviation industry is likely to miss its carbon emissions target by 2050. Although the aircraft is working on building aircraft that is hydrogen-powered but presently it’s commercially impossible to produce them at scale. This makes SAF a more viable option for a net-zero target.

“I don’t think we are wrong to pursue net zero by 2050…Maybe it’s going to take a bit more time, but let’s not be shy in the ambition,” Airbus CEO had said, according to Bloomberg. To mitigate the emissions, he suggested the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) as an interim solution.

OTTAWA, Ontario, May 28, 2025 — Boeing will invest $17.48 million CAD to strengthen the energy security of Canada and bolster the country’s economic growth. The investments will promote the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and are part of Boeing’s Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) commitment to Canada for its selection of Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon to fulfill its long-range, multi-mission aircraft role.

The investments will support two projects:

$10 million CAD for Project Avanceopens in a new tab

A joint venture between Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables in Port Cartier, Quebec, to convert wood residuals from existing sawmills into a low-carbon intermediate “biocrude” that can be converted into SAF. Project Avance is forecasted to enable future projects in Quebec to produce 10 million gallons (approximately 37,854,000 liters) of unblended SAF annually.

$7.48 million CAD for Dimensional Energyopens in a new tab

The power-to-liquid technology provider will scope scaled development of its pioneering carbon utilization project to convert industrial CO2 emissions into synthetic aviation fuel production. This study will support future projects in North America to convert 500,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions to produce more than 40 million gallons (approximately 151,416,000 liters) of SAF annually.

“This significant investment in SAF production demonstrates our commitment to scaling sustainable aviation fuel and to our work in Canada, where we have driven innovation for over a century,” said Al Meinzinger, president, Boeing Canada. “With 2,000 employees across Canada, Boeing is committed to supporting Canada’s aerospace industry and domestic productivity and advancing exciting new energy innovations.”

“Our proprietary Alder Renewable Crude (ARC) product has enormous potential to fast-track the production of SAF in Canada,” said Darren Fuller, Chief Commercial Officer of Alder Renewables. “The support of Boeing and local government leaders in Quebec is supercharging our commitment to securing a low carbon future for the aviation sector. Close collaboration with our industry partners — Boeing and Bioenergie AECN — coupled with government support is essential to get to the next phase. We’re ready to play our part.”

“Making high performance hydrocarbons is an innovative use for carbon dioxide that turns unwanted waste into valuable fuels and products,” said Jason Salfi, CEO of Dimensional Energy. “This investment from Boeing provides essential predevelopment capital to catalyze projects and scale our proven power-to-liquid technology to market now.”

“Boeing’s investments in Quebec and British Columbia highlight Canada’s position as a strategic partner of choice in sustainable aviation and will generate high-value jobs and economic growth,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. “The Government of Canada is committed to reducing aviation emissions and reinforcing Canada’s position as a global leader in aerospace innovation.”

The two SAF projects are part of Boeing’s over $280 million CAD investment in Canadian Clean Technology projects through the P-8 ITB program. Boeing investments will advance technologies that have the potential to unlock vast renewable resources and accelerate industries producing low-carbon fuels to meet the rising global demand. SAF has the potential today to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s lifecycle and offers the fastest route to decarbonization in the aviation sector.

The Government of Canada announced its decision to acquire the P-8A Poseidon aircraft in November 2023 as part of the Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project. These Boeing CMMA ITB investments build on more than $2 billion in P-8 contracts with Canadian companies to date, contributing to economic growth across the country. The purchase will generate benefits of nearly $358 CAD million annually in economic output to Canada, according to an independent study by Ottawa-based Doyletech Corporation.

They have helped us to create a meaningful offer incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuels, starting in the German domestic market. We are confident that such ‘Sustainable Corporate Value Fare’ is going to be successful across the Business Travel ecosystem.”

Customized options for more sustainable flying with SAF

The Lufthansa Group offers several special fares for corporate customers: With the “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare”, business customers can offset up to 30% of the CO₂ emissions calculated for their individual flight through the use of SAF in flight operations. The Lufthansa Group also offers companies the opportunity to invest in larger quantities of SAF through SAF bulk deals.

Background: The use of SAF in the Lufthansa Group

There is no refueling of individual flights with pure SAF. As a so-called ""drop-in"" fuel, SAF is compatible with fossil kerosene and can be blended with it without any problems. Before being transported to the airport, SAF is blended with fossil jet fuel or produced in a process known as co-processing (joint processing of biogenic residues with fossil oil) and then fed into the airport infrastructure. The Lufthansa Group ensures that the amount of SAF required to offset individual CO2 emissions is fed into the Lufthansa Group's flight operations within six months of purchase. Over its entire life cycle, the SAF from biogenic residues used by the Lufthansa Group has a CO2 footprint that is around 80 percent lower than that of conventional kerosene made from fossil crude oil.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Lufthansa_June25_1bba5e7acd.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 00:59:14.232797

In the fall of 2014, she began her Ph.D. in industrial management at Cambridge’s Institute for Manufacturing.
“In my Ph.D., I studied start-ups encouraging healthier, more sustainable food consumption,” she said.","We need carbon for everything. It’s critical for fuel, but it also has applications in construction, manufacturing, even textiles.

Literally billions of tons of carbon sit in our atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), contributing to rising global temperatures and just waiting to be converted into something useful.

What if CO2 could be taken out of the atmosphere, and converted into fuel? Kirsten Van Fossen, S.B. ‘12, is trying to answer that question. She’s a postdoctoral research fellow at the Magda Barecka Lab at Northeastern University, where they’re using electrochemistry to convert CO2 into ethanol, an intermediary in the synthesis of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“There’s a lot of discussion around decarbonization, but more accurately this technology should be considered ‘defossilization,’” said van Fossen. “This is really a technology that can move us away from the reliance on fossil fuels as a source of carbon.”

Van Fossen’s research is the culmination of the last 15-plus years of her life, going all the way back to her time as an environmental science and engineering concentrator at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). It taps into the lessons she learned about sustainability, entrepreneurship and tech commercialization as a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and then as a department head at the foodservice data start-up Galley. And it draws on her government work with the U.S. Department of Transportation, where she was part of the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center and worked on SAF and alternative aviation fuel projects over a decade ago.

“I just feel like it’s all coming together in this opportunity working with the Barecka Lab,” she said. “I’m very drawn to the world of start-ups, building things from scratch.”

FROM BOATING TO BRAZIL

A national-caliber rower as a high school student in New Jersey, Van Fossen chose Harvard in part because of the appeal of rowing on the Charles River every day. While always planning to study engineering, she didn’t know which discipline before she got here.

“I understood that at Harvard, I could explore multiple disciplines,” she said. “Engineering was a good fit for me. It combined my passion for math and science, my love for working in a team, and gave me plenty of hands-on experience. At Harvard I became aware of the issues of climate change, the urgency, and I saw environmental engineering as the discipline that would set me up for having the most impact.”

A SEAS class on environmental chemistry and an MIT class in which she built a light sensor for a device that concentrates solar energy were some of the early experiences that convinced van Fossen that environmental engineering was the right choice. But it was her senior thesis that would prove life-changing. She designed an electrochemical filter for drinking water, and while in the lab was introduced to a visiting professor from the Universidade de São Paulo. After graduating, that professor invited her to continue her research and work on a water reuse and recycling project with him in Brazil.

“In my work in Brazil, I visited a lot of industrial sites,” she said. “That’s also what I was around as a child. My father worked at a small business called Van-Air & Hydraulics, and I remember visiting the workshop there. It was in Brazil where I started thinking about applying to graduate school.”

START-UPS AND SUSTAINABILITY

Seeing how Brazilian companies managed water and other resources inspired Van Fossen to dive deeper into the world of sustainable industry and entrepreneurship. In the fall of 2014, she began her Ph.D. in industrial management at Cambridge’s Institute for Manufacturing.

“In my Ph.D., I studied start-ups encouraging healthier, more sustainable food consumption,” she said. “I was exposed to lots of different start-ups, pitched some start-up ideas myself while I was working on my Ph.D., and I kind of caught the start-up bug.”

Within a month of finishing her Ph.D. in late 2018, Van Fossen joined Galley as Head of Customer Success. Working there for over four years, she eventually transitioned to Head of Sustainability and Education at the company, whose platform offered a range of foodservice data solutions, including inventory management, menu planning, nutritional analysisand aspirations to decrease food waste and increase sustainable food practices. When the company decided to withdraw focus on those aspirations, Kirsten moved on.

“I joined Galley as the seventh employee. In my tenure there, we grew to over a hundred people working at the organization,” she said. “I saw what it looks like for a start-up to grow rapidly, and what it takes to build up a company.”

NEW USES FOR CO2

Van Fossen has been at the Barecka Lab since November 2024. Her research draws on not only the hard science of her undergraduate days, but also the industry and entrepreneurial experiences she’s had since then. One of her major focus areas is the eventual commercialization of this technology, as well the market for other potential products that could be synthesized with the Barecka Lab’s patented technology. The lab is partially funded from a grant from the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, with a goal of bringing the air-to-ethanol technology to market.

“I love that I can draw on that hard science background that I got from Harvard. The math, chemistry, physics that I got to study in engineering, it’s all so beautiful and practical,” she said. “With the core curriculum, I got the base that I needed to navigate lots of different work contexts. I’ve had federal government experience, academic experience, start-up experience, and I really think that base came from the work I did at Harvard.”",https://seas.harvard.edu/themes/custom/seas/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-25 20:01:49.909363

With sustainability taking a seat at the table in all our board rooms, companies need quick wins with measurable impact. Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is rapidly gaining attention with businesses whose M.O. involves regular air travel. The Film and TV industry particularly. But how impactful is SAF, and is it the environmental panacea we’ve all been hoping for?

What Exactly Is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. It’s incredible to think that these raw, organic materials - namely the waste from gardening, catering, sewage processing, paper making and bin collecting - can produce fuel to power aircraft. These natural by-products are processed to create a fuel with significantly reduced environmental impact over its lifecycle, compared to its fossil-based predecessors.

The Truth About CO2

When burned, SAF creates similar levels of carbon dioxide to conventional aviation fuels. The difference is that the CO2 produced is already part of the carbon cycle - not extracted from the ground specifically for creating aviation fuel. Fossil fuels increase the overall level of CO2 by releasing carbon that had been previously locked away underground. In contrast, SAF recycles the CO2 which is absorbed by the vegetation from which it is made.

According to the International Air Transport Association, IATA, the CO2 absorbed by during the growth of the original plant materials is roughly in balance with the amount produced by using the fuel. This would make SAF carbon neutral, but it must be acknowledged that some emissions are released during the production process, due to transportation and refining methods.

The Good News

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is already accelerating progress towards a net zero future. Not only can it use existing fuel infrastructure in getting to airports, it’s safe to use in current aircraft. SAF can be blended easily with traditional jet fuel and used without modifying the existing engines. Most importantly, simply by using SAF, lifecycle emissions can be reduced by up to 80%.

The IATA estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions the aviation sector needs to reach its 2050 net zero goals. When you factor in the role aviation plays in film and television productions - not just to transport people to shoot locations but equipment, replacement props and parts, never mind the promotional tours, factoring SAF into your plans will result in significant impact.

Making It Work For You

The inconvenient truth here is that, currently, there isn’t enough SAF to fuel the world’s commercial airlines for even a single day. So, in the spirit of partnership, Air Partner has teamed up with Delta Airlines who has already invested significantly in SAF for their own fleet, and who actively lobby for access to more sustainable, affordable fuels for all. When your travel team books a flight with Air Partner, they’ll be offered the option of purchasing SAF environmental attributes – a super-easy way to claim carbon reductions against the emissions footprint of your own flight. The exact quantity needed is calculated, and the cost added seamlessly onto your flight booking.

This means that your company gives back by being “allocated” the SAF environmental attributes associated with the actual SAF that is loaded into Delta Air Lines infrastructure and used within their network. You have essentially bought the right to “claim” the emissions reduction associated with this physical SAF’s use.

Measuring Your Impact

Evolving legislation means that we all have to prove our impact with verified data. And rightly so to avoid greenwashing. That’s why a SAF Certificate will be issued to you, detailing the specifics of the physical SAF associated with your environmental attributes. It confirms your ownership of these attributes and the emission reductions they represent and can support any related claims you make in that all-important impact reporting.

What About Carbon Offsetting?

This is another option available to you when you book flights with Air Partner. As well as giving back to the planet, you’ll be supporting projects that not only work to reduce CO2 but also to alleviate poverty and improve lives.

Scouting For Eco-Friendly Locations

If you’re thinking about lush settings for your next shoot, consider Costa Rica. Already established as a paradise for eco-tourism, this destination also delivers a massive 90% VAT refund on production budgets over $500K. It also has plenty of eco-friendly production options so, if you’re bringing something adventurous or nature-themed to the screen, Costa Rica’s world-famous rainforests, volcanoes and beaches offer a cost-effective and responsible choice.

(June 25, 2025) — Today, the Michigan Senate passed bipartisan legislation to help launch the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Michigan.
By providing a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce, or blend sustainable aviation fuel, this legislation would directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning, ethanol-derived aviation fuels.
“Access to sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” said Sen. Bellino.
“I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.

(June 25, 2025) — Today, the Michigan Senate passed bipartisan legislation to help launch the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Michigan. Sponsored by Senate Majority Floor Leader Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Sen. Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe), Senate Bills 235–36 would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of SAF — a move that would support Michigan’s farmers and economy while reducing the state’s carbon footprint.

“It has been an exciting process to partner with my colleagues across the aisle and across the chamber on this legislation, which not only aims to support Michigan farmers but — in continuing what was outlined in the Clean Energy Future plan — would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,” said Sen. Singh. “This legislation will open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the connection between our agricultural sector and the state’s energy goals.”

SAF is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced using bio-renewable products like ethanol or diesel, which are manufactured from crops like soybeans or corn. By providing a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce, or blend sustainable aviation fuel, this legislation would directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning, ethanol-derived aviation fuels. Additional incentives are available if greater emissions reductions are reached. There is a maximum incentive cap of $4.5 million annually in the first year, and $9 million each year after.

“Access to sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” said Sen. Bellino. “I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.

The coalition includes Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR); NATSO, representing travel centers and truck stops; American Trucking Associations (ATA); Illinois Soybean Growers; National Energy & Fuels Institute (NEFI); SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel Marketers; and the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).

Equalizing the value of the credit between over-the-road biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was an important policy improvement. Creating SAF parity would be an important step to leveling the playing field and mitigating the ongoing problem of SAF displacing gallons of over-the-road biomass-based diesel rather than gallons of petroleum.

Another important policy improvement from the House version was the extension of transferability of the credit to all seven years of the program. Without transferability, most biomass-based diesel producers would not have access to the credit at all.

Finally, biomass-based diesel producers are glad to see that the removal of Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) stayed in the Senate version. After 20 years of predictions of ILUC from biofuels, the modeled ILUC results were never observed and certainly not scientifically agreed upon.

We applaud these policy improvements and call for them to remain in the final version that Congress passes. We especially want to thank Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and biomass-based diesel champion Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), and other members of the Finance Committee for their hard work.

While these improvements make '45Z' a much more workable policy from the original law passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the amendments do not take effect until 2026. The expiration of the blenders' tax credit in January and the lack of implementing regulations for '45Z' have put the biomass-based diesel industry in great peril. The industry is all but shut down for all of 2025 and will continue to be for at least the rest of the year unless there is some transitional short-term policy measure to turn the plants back on and provide a bridge to '45Z' in 2026. We have called for a streamlined version of the blenders' tax credit for the rest of 2025 to be that bridge. Without such a bridge, most biomass-based diesel producers will not survive to 2026. At a time of dangerous conflict in the Persian Gulf, America needs all of the domestic energy it can get.

As global aviation accelerates its shift to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Africa is struggling to keep pace due to prohibitive costs and limited infrastructure. The continent has only five SAF projects and a projected production capacity of just 0.6 million tonnes by 2030.

This leaves Africa sidelined in the industry’s green transition, as SAF currently costs two to three times more than conventional jet fuel—a burden that most African airlines cannot bear without substantial financial support. Jet fuel in Africa averages 17% more expensive than elsewhere, with taxes, fees, and financing costs also significantly higher. Despite these challenges, African air traffic is projected to double to 345 million passengers by 2043; yet, intra-African connectivity remains underdeveloped and dominated by non-African carriers.

Africa World Airlines Announces Fare Reductions and New Route

Africa World Airlines (AWA) will reduce airfares by the end of June 2025, aiming to make air travel more accessible. The airline, known for its strong safety record, also announced the launch of direct flights from Accra to Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, starting July 1, 2025. This new route is expected to enhance trade and partnerships between Ghana and Burkina Faso, offering passengers significant time savings and competitive fares starting at $290.

South African Airways Expands Domestic and Regional Network

South African Airways continues rebuilding its network post-restructuring, with plans to launch and revive several domestic and cross-border routes. The airline will resume flights to George and East London and relaunch the Durban–Cape Town route. Internationally, SAA will commence service between Johannesburg and Gaborone (Botswana) in October and introduce a seasonal route between Cape Town and Mauritius in November 2025. The pace of expansion is contingent upon aircraft availability, as SAA continues to rebuild its fleet following the resumption of operations in 2021.

Recognition for Africa’s Leading Low-Cost Carriers

FlySafair, a South African airline, has been named the Best Low-Cost Airline in Africa for 2025 by Skytrax, praised for its punctuality, efficient check-in, and customizable no-frills model. Other notable budget carriers include Lift and Fastjet, which are expanding regional connectivity. Ethiopian Airlines also retained its title as Best Airline in Africa for the seventh consecutive year, underscoring the strength of the continent’s top full-service carriers.

Advanced Air Mobility and Drone Innovation Spotlighted

The Aviation Africa 2025 Summit is highlighting the continent’s growing focus on advanced air mobility, including drones and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.

Drones are being used for medical deliveries, agriculture, wildlife conservation, disaster response, and infrastructure monitoring across several African countries. Urban centers like Lagos and Nairobi are exploring the use of drones and eVTOLs for logistics and congestion relief. The summit aims to move from policy to practical implementation, advancing regulatory clarity and readiness for advanced air mobility across Africa.

But like other markets, the business case for eVTOL is a work in progress. If this applies in places like the US, how much more so in Africa?

The aviation industry is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and as air travel continues to grow, so does its environmental impact. In response, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has implemented the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to mitigate these emissions. A crucial component of CORSIA is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which has the potential to significantly reduce the industry's carbon footprint. This article provides a comprehensive guide to CORSIA and SAF standards, covering regulations, compliance, and industry impact.

Overview of CORSIA and its Objectives

CORSIA is a global market-based measure aimed at offsetting CO2 emissions from international aviation. Its primary objective is to stabilize emissions at 2020 levels by promoting the use of SAF and offsetting emissions through carbon credits. CORSIA applies to international flights, and its implementation is divided into three phases: pilot (2021-2023), first (2024-2026), and second (2027-2035).

Importance of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels, made from renewable resources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste. SAF can reduce lifecycle CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The use of SAF is critical to achieving CORSIA's emissions reduction goals and is considered a key strategy for the aviation industry to reduce its environmental impact.

Brief History and Development of CORSIA and SAF Standards

The development of CORSIA and SAF standards has been a collaborative effort between ICAO, governments, and industry stakeholders. CORSIA was adopted by the ICAO Assembly in 2016, and its standards and recommended practices (SARPs) were developed over the subsequent years. The first batch of CORSIA-eligible SAF pathways was approved in 2020, marking a significant milestone in the development of SAF standards.

CORSIA Regulations and Compliance

Detailed Explanation of CORSIA Regulations

CORSIA regulations require airlines to monitor, report, and verify (MRV) their CO2 emissions from international flights. The regulations also establish a framework for offsetting emissions through the purchase of carbon credits. The CORSIA MRV system is based on three main components:

Emissions monitoring: Airlines must monitor their CO2 emissions using approved methodologies.

Emissions reporting: Airlines must report their emissions to their respective states and to ICAO.

Emissions verification: Emissions reports must be verified by an independent third-party auditor.

The following flowchart illustrates the CORSIA MRV process:

Emissions Monitoring

Offsetting Emissions

Compliance Requirements for Airlines and Aviation Operators

Airlines and aviation operators must comply with CORSIA regulations by:

Monitoring and reporting their CO2 emissions

Verifying their emissions reports

Offsetting their emissions through the purchase of carbon credits

Maintaining accurate records and submitting reports to their respective states and to ICAO

The compliance requirements for CORSIA are outlined in the following table:

Compliance Requirement Description Emissions Monitoring Monitor CO2 emissions using approved methodologies Emissions Reporting Report emissions to respective states and to ICAO Emissions Verification Verify emissions reports through independent third-party audit Offsetting Emissions Offset emissions through purchase of carbon credits

Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) Processes

The MRV process is critical to ensuring the integrity of CORSIA. The process involves:

Emissions monitoring: Airlines use approved methodologies to monitor their CO2 emissions.

Emissions reporting: Airlines report their emissions to their respective states and to ICAO.

Emissions verification: Emissions reports are verified by an independent third-party auditor.

Production and Supply Chain Considerations for SAF

The production and supply chain for SAF are critical to its adoption. SAF can be produced from a variety of feedstocks, including waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste. The supply chain for SAF must be carefully managed to ensure that it is sustainable and environmentally beneficial.

The following table outlines the key considerations for SAF production and supply chain:

Consideration Description Feedstock Sourcing Ensure feedstocks are sustainably sourced Production Process Optimize production process for efficiency and emissions reduction Supply Chain Management Manage supply chain to ensure sustainability and environmental benefits

Current Challenges and Future Prospects for SAF Adoption

Despite its potential, SAF adoption faces several challenges, including high production costs and limited supply. However, as demand for SAF increases and production technologies improve, costs are expected to decrease, making SAF more competitive with conventional jet fuel.

The future prospects for SAF adoption are promising, with many airlines and aviation operators committing to using SAF. Governments and industry stakeholders are also working together to promote the development and use of SAF.

Industry Impact and Future Directions

Economic and Environmental Impacts of CORSIA and SAF on the Aviation Industry

CORSIA and SAF are expected to have significant economic and environmental impacts on the aviation industry. The use of SAF is expected to reduce the industry's carbon footprint, while CORSIA is expected to promote the development and use of SAF.

The economic impacts of CORSIA and SAF will depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of SAF and the price of carbon credits. However, the adoption of SAF is expected to create new economic opportunities in the aviation industry, including the development of new supply chains and production facilities.

Opportunities for Innovation and Growth in Sustainable Aviation

CORSIA and SAF present opportunities for innovation and growth in sustainable aviation. The development and use of SAF are expected to drive innovation in production technologies and supply chain management.

The following diagram illustrates the opportunities for innovation and growth in sustainable aviation:

Future Directions for CORSIA and SAF Standards

The future directions for CORSIA and SAF standards will be shaped by a variety of factors, including technological advancements, economic considerations, and environmental goals. ICAO will continue to play a critical role in promoting the development and use of SAF and in ensuring the integrity of CORSIA.

As the aviation industry continues to evolve, CORSIA and SAF will remain critical components of its efforts to reduce its environmental impact.

Conclusion

In conclusion, CORSIA and SAF are critical components of the aviation industry's efforts to reduce its environmental impact. The use of SAF is expected to play a key role in achieving CORSIA's emissions reduction goals, and the development and use of SAF are expected to drive innovation and growth in sustainable aviation.

“A lot of global consumption is going to be underpinned by the mandates in Europe and the United Kingdom,” said Fabricio Cardoso, principal at Argus Consulting.

Both of those regions introduced two per cent SAF mandates in 2025 and will be driving global demand going forward, he said during a recent webinar hosted by the company.

Scouting for physiological leaf spot in the coming weeks is critical now that that the crop disease has been confirmed in winter wheat fields in southern Alberta.

Alfonso Berrocal, business development manager for oil products with Argus, estimates that the European Union and U.K. mandates will generate 1.5 to 1.7 million tonnes of demand in 2025.

The EU mandate remains at two per cent for the first five years and then moves to six per cent.

The U.K. mandate is more ambitious in the short-term, growing to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040.

However, the EU mandate is bigger in the long-term, climbing to 20 per cent by 2035 and 70 per cent by 2050.

Lindsey Liu, senior Argus analyst covering the Chinese biofuel market, said the Asia Pacific region is a bit behind the EU and U.K., but mandates are coming.

Japan is targeting a 10 per cent SAF mandate by 2030.

Singapore will go to one per cent by 2026, rising to three to five per cent by 2030.

Thailand’s is one per cent by 2026, climbing to three per cent by 2030.

India will have a one per cent SAF mandate on international flights by 2027, rising to five per cent by 2030.

China has no national mandate. Instead, it has set a 50,000 tonne SAF target for 2025 that will be met through airport level blend targets for select airlines at key airports in Beijing, Chengdu, Zhengshou and Ningbo.

Indonesia has a 2.5 per cent target for 2030, while Malaysia and South Korea have one per cent targets.

Australia has no planned mandate, but one is likely coming with the re-election of the Labor government in May.

Liu said there are SAF proposals in most of the major markets in the Asia Pacific region, but there is still considerable policy uncertainty, which is leaving producers wary.

“A lack of firm policy support in most countries in the region is slowing development of the sector and causing timelines of many planned projects to be postponed,” she said.

There are close to 50 announced projects in the region, but many are a long way from producing.

Matthew Cope, American biofuel reporter for Argus, said the SAF supply and demand situation is much further behind in North America.

“This market is far less developed than what we’re seeing in Europe and Asia,” he said.

It is a market that will be driven by tax credits rather than mandates.

Producers are still awaiting clarity on the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, which will pay up to US$1.75 per gallon for SAF.

Cardoso said when it’s all added up, there will be about 15 billion litres of annual global demand by 2030 and 30 billion litres by 2035.

However, there is a big caveat.

“Obviously, any mandate coming from China could have a massive impact on overall demand,” he said.

As it sits, there will be more global capacity than demand until 2035 when demand finally surpasses capacity.

And that is only using projects that are under construction or have achieved a final investment decision.

If you factor in “very provisional” proposed plants that have not secured financing, the capacity far outstrips demand well beyond 2035.

The burning question for many in the agriculture sector is — what feedstock will be used to make the jet fuel?

“We would expect SAF to be coming primarily from UCO (used cooking oil),” said Cardosa.

However, there won’t be enough UCO to supply the sector by the time the EU achieves its 20 per cent mandate by 2035.

A wide assortment of feedstocks will be needed by that time.",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/25105151/147902_web1_2019-10-20T000000Z_1719650286_MT1NURPHO000INDKSZ_RTRMADP_3_ENGLAND-AIRPORT.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 15:10:26.749165

Brazil's E30, B15 blends to start 1 Aug

Sao Paulo, 25 June (Argus) — Brazilian regulators have approved an increase in ethanol and biodiesel blending into fossil fuels effective 1 August. In a meeting of the mines and energy ministry and national energy policy council CNPE the government decided to move forward with an increase in ethanol blending rates into gasoline to 30pc to make E30, and blend 15pc biodiesel into diesel to create B15. CNPE is evaluating the feasibility of raising ethanol blends to a 22-35pc range and biodiesel blends to a 13-25pc range, mines and energy ministry's biofuels department director Marlon Arraes said during Argus ' Biofuels & Feedstocks Latin America Conference, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The fuel of the future program, introduced to the Congress on September 2023, spurred more than R53bn ($9.6bn) of investments in biodiesel to achieve a 25pc mix by 2026, as well as R24bn invested in ethanol to reach a 35pc blend that same year, Arraes said. Investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) through advanced geological techniques reached R140bn, while investments in biomethane and products such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel reached bring that total up to R260bn. Cost competitiveness, feedstock supply risks and regulatory instability remain hurdles to a wider biofuel framework in Brazil, he said. The fuel of the future program avoided 705mn metric tonnes (t) of CO2 equivalent, Arraes said, mostly from CCUS and biodiesel investments. ""We need to engage in our way to produce biofuels and sustainable energy to deliver to society the cheapest decarbonization that we can"", he added.

European middle distillates fall to pre-conflict levels

London, 25 June (Argus) — Gains in European jet fuel and diesel prices caused by the Israel-Iran conflict have entirely reversed following this week's ceasefire agreement. Front-month Ice gasoil futures — the underlying value in Argus ' European middle distillate assessments — sank to $688.25/t at close on Tuesday, 24 June, the day of the ceasefire. This was the contract's lowest settlement since 12 June, the last close before the conflict began. The contract fell by $75/t on the day on Tuesday, the largest single-day decline in 31 months. Benchmark crude basket North Sea Dated dropped by around 11pc to $68.06/bl on Tuesday, its lowest closing value since 11 June. Ice gasoil values rose to $798.50/t on 19 June, as the conflict raised fears of weaker supply from the Mideast Gulf, particularly for middle distillates. The region accounted for just under 25pc of Europe's jet fuel and diesel imports last year, according to Kpler and Vortexa. Tensions rose just as seasonal demand for jet fuel and diesel neared an annual peak in Europe, with the region relying on imports to meet demand. Market participants said the price rises were excessive, considering there had been no disruption to supply. European refining margins have also fallen, reflecting middle distillate prices' heavier falls than those for crude. Delivered cargoes of jet fuel and diesel to northwest Europe held premiums of $21.08/bl and $22.90/bl respectively to Dated, having peaked at $26.82/bl and $28.98/bl on 19 June. Cracks have averaged below $20/bl in recent months. Jet fuel margins could remain elevated in line with seasonal demand, but European diesel supply had tightened before the conflict because of weaker imports and extra demand for marine gasoil (MGO) in the Mediterranean after the start of the emissions control area. This shortness of supply has not yet fully resolved and could further support refining margins in the coming weeks.

Cheaper power key to reach UK’s climate targets

Edinburgh, 24 June (Argus) — The UK's climate plan credibility has improved slightly but no progress has been made to make electricity cheaper, which is key to hit the country's emissions targets, independent advisory body Climate Change Committee (CCC) said in its progress report. The report assesses the UK's progress towards its net zero goals under the current government, which took power in July 2024. The CCC found the UK's 2050 target remains reachable but climate action needs to accelerate, even though policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions have improved. Only half of the 16 key indicators assessed by the CCC, with a relevant benchmark or target, are on track — including offshore and onshore wind operational capacity, sustainable aviation fuel, electric vehicle (EV) charging points and distances travelled by car. EV car sales, heat pump installations, woodland creation and peatland restoration are ""slightly off track"", while the ratio of electricity to gas prices for households and industries is ""significantly off track"", the CCC said. The committee noted no progress has been made on actions to lower the cost of power. The government is planning to consult on this ""in due course"", but CCC urged for actions and timelines. The CCC has identified ""ten priority actions"" for the year ahead, with cutting the cost of electricity for households and businesses again at the top. Cheaper power will support industrial electrification and ""speed up the uptake of clean electric technologies, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles,"" the CCC said. The transition to renewables will eventually reduce the country's reliance on volatile wholesale gas prices, which are the main driver of electricity prices, it said. ""But the government can take immediate action to accelerate this by moving policy costs associated with past schemes, and those that are not directly related to the cost of electricity generation, off electricity bills,"" the CCC said. Removing electricity policy costs — levied on the unit price of electricity at 20 times the rate of gas — would reduce annual electricity bills by £190 ($258) for a typical household with a gas boiler and by £490 for a typical household with a heat pump, CCC found. ""This would bring UK prices into the range of other countries who are ahead on heat pump roll-out,"" it said. The CCC report assessed policy development from July 2024 to 23 May 2025, so does not take into account policies announced in the recent spending review nor the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme intended to reduce electricity costs by up to £40/MWh for more than 7,000 electricity-intensive businesses. UK emissions reached 413.7mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in 2024, including its share of international aviation and shipping, down by 50pc from 1990 and by 2.5pc from 2023, according to the CCC. The year-on-year reductions come mainly from the electricity supply — declining gas generation — and the industry sector. The government will increasingly need to focus on transport, building, agriculture and aviation to reach its emission reduction targets, the CCC said. The report points to encouraging trends in EVs and in heat pump installations, which grew by 56pc on the year, and in woodland creations, but it reiterated action on these fronts must accelerate. Although much of the progress stems from policies set by previous government, the CCC said ""bold policies"" introduced this year are promising, such as removing planning barriers on renewable deployment and the reinstatement of the 2030 phase-out date for gasoline and diesel vehicles. The market share of new EVs increased on the year in 2024, by nearly 20pc. But CCC noted aviation sector emissions are increasing. The share of sustainable aviation fuel increased to 2.1pc last year from 0.7pc in 2023, but a lot more is required to reach the 10pc SAF mandate by 2030.

Brooke Rogachuk

Rogachuk, who was also selected as an Astronaut Scholar in 2024, became only the second OU student to be selected in back-to-back years. She was also recently named a 2025 Goldwater Scholar. Her undergraduate research has focused on sustainable aviation, and she currently works on sustainable aviation fuel implementation for Boom Supersonic.

“Being an Astronaut Scholar has given me connections that will help me throughout my career. Not only did I get a mentor that helped me land my job at Boom Supersonic, but I’ve made friends with so many people that I can reach out to when I need them,” she said.

She credits the opportunity to conduct her own undergraduate research through the Gallogly College of Engineering as a major reason why she was selected two years in a row.

“A lot of my fellow scholars can’t say that they’ve developed their own methodology or developed their own research study. It’s been really amazing to work in Dr. Dai’s lab and study materials science. It’s something that I don’t think I would have been able to do if I had gone anywhere else but OU,” she said.

Huynh, a National Merit Scholar with career ambitions to become a physician-scientist, is currently interning at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Like Rogachuk, she too sees the importance of mentorship.

“A lot of the opportunities that I’ve had are because someone else has shown me what’s possible. That’s why the Astronaut Scholarship stuck out to me. It also reaches students who want to make a difference in their field and make the world a better place,” she said.

Since her freshman year, Huynh has worked on cancer studies in Zhibo Yang’s lab and the OU Health Science Center.

“It’s been really exciting to work on such demanding research, especially since we get to work with real patient samples. That gets me closer to the clinic side and actively helping those in need,” she said. “A lot of my research has been guided by patient outcomes.

by Michael McAdams (Advanced Biofuels Association/Real Clear Energy) Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has moved from the margins of energy policy to the forefront of America’s energy future. Once viewed as a long-shot innovation, SAF is now a commercially viable, rapidly scaling solution to power our aviation sector while revitalizing rural economies and advancing our national goals for energy dominance. As SAF production accelerates, Congress and the Trump administration have an opportunity to cement America’s leadership in aviation fuel innovations by extending long-term tax credits that support domestic SAF production.

This sector’s momentum is undeniable. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently reported that SAF production in the U.S. surged from 2,000 barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 25,000 barrels per day by February 2025. As of May, production capacity stands at roughly 30,000 barrels daily, and industry projections suggest we could approach 500,000 barrels per year by the end of 2025.

SAF’s explosive growth is a direct response to policy certainty and strategic investment—but we are only getting started. I recently spoke with Alison Graab, Executive Director of the SAF Coalition, about this issue. She rightly noted, “The biggest barrier we hear from our coalition members is the need for a longer-term market signal for SAF investment.” Without it, this American success story and the promise it offers to our country’s economy risks being outsourced.

That’s because SAF, at its heart, is an innovation and jobs engine. The entire SAF value chain—from feedstock cultivation to production and refining—offers new economic lifelines to American farmers and rural communities. These fuels are derived from a wide variety of sources, including agricultural residues, waste oils, and even woody biomass. SAF development creates stable demand for these materials, opening new revenue streams for growers and foresters. During our conversation, Graab concurred about the significant potential offered by SAF, “There are so many additional benefits that really offer a lot of opportunities to this administration and Congress.” Put simply, SAF can transform America’s heartland into an energy innovation engine.

Global demand for SAF is projected to soar as countries implement mandates and incentives to power their aviation sectors. As I spoke with Graab, she highlighted how the United States is well-positioned to lead, with more production facilities online than any other nation. “We can see the U.S. continue to grow that by helping to export and fulfill what other countries need in addition to the U.S.,” Graab emphasized. This growth offers America an important energy diplomacy tool and a new source of revenue through SAF exports. At a time when many nations are competing to develop cutting edge energy technologies, America’s ability to scale SAF production is a geopolitical advantage we cannot afford to squander.

Fortunately, Congress is awake to this challenge and has already taken an encouraging step in the right direction. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by the U.S. House of Representatives includes an extension of the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit through December 2031. This is exactly the kind of long-term policy signal investors need to deploy capital into SAF projects. Extending this credit is a critical win, but more must follow. We must ensure the SAF-specific tax credit structure remains robust, technology- and feedstock-neutral, and predictable over the next decade.

To deliver on SAF’s promise, policymakers must act boldly. Long-term certainty around 45Z and related credits is the clearest path forward. Equally important is for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to modernize its regulatory treatment of feedstocks like woody biomass to unlock hundreds of millions of gallons of potential fuels. The American SAF industry knows how to scale. We have the infrastructure, we have the feedstocks, and we have the know-how. Now we need Washington to follow through to unleash this potential to advance our American energy dominance agenda.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 15:10:31.040011

The Elixir, equipped with a Turbotech turbine, completed its maiden flight in La Rochelle just ahead of the Paris Air Show. This inaugural flight marks a key step toward a 100% SAF-powered flight scheduled for the end of 2025.

To support this initiative, Elixir Aircraft signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)—a formal agreement outlining the intent to collaborate—with TotalEnergies on June 17, 2025. Under this MoU, TotalEnergies will supply part of the sustainable aviation fuel used during flight testing.

First Flight of the Elixir Turbine in La Rochelle

This milestone is part of the BeautHyFuel project, supported by CORAC (the French Civil Aviation Research Council) and the DGAC. It is led by Elixir Aircraft and Turbotech, in partnership with Safran Aircraft Engines, Daher, and Air Liquide.

Following the first engine start on the aircraft in February 2025, the Elixir “Turbine” completed its maiden flight on June 6, 2025, in La Rochelle. The flight lasted 55 minutes. Since then, the aircraft has entered its flight testing campaign, having already accumulated over five hours and seven test flights.

A 100% SAF-powered flight is scheduled before the end of 2025.

The Elixir Turbine is on display at the Paris Air Show as part of a DGAC exhibit showcasing recent innovations from French aerospace manufacturers aimed at decarbonizing light aviation—many of which are already in active operation.

MoU Signed with TotalEnergies

To support its flight testing program using Jet A-1 SAF, Elixir Aircraft signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TotalEnergies on Tuesday, June 17, 2025, during the Paris Air Show. TotalEnergies will supply part of the sustainable fuel needed for the test flights.

The first phase of testing, beginning this summer, will use a 35% blend of SAF biofuel produced in France by TotalEnergies. A second phase will use 100% SAF by the end of 2025.

“TotalEnergies shares our ambition to develop solutions that help decarbonize the aviation industry. We are thrilled to conduct the Elixir Turbine tests with the support of this leading innovator in aviation fueling,” said Arthur Léopold-Léger, Co-founder and President of Elixir Aircraft.

“We are delighted to support Elixir Aircraft with the supply of sustainable aviation fuel for its flight tests. SAF plays an essential role in decarbonising the aviation sector and this agreement demonstrates our ability to support our customers in reducing their CO₂ emissions,” said Louise Tricoire, SVP Aviation & Marine Fuel at TotalEnergies.

The Elixir: A 4th Generation Aircraft, Made in France

The Elixir is a 4th-generation aircraft featuring a streamlined all-composite Carbon OneShot airframe, composed of only nine parts—no rivets, no glue. This innovative technology offers exceptional structural integrity, enhanced safety, simplified maintenance, and a lighter weight—resulting in lower fuel consumption compared to traditional 2nd-generation metal or 3rd-generation semi-composite aircraft. Thanks to its advanced structure and low fuel usage of just 12 litres per hour, the Elixir is the most environmentally efficient aircraft in its category.

With an order book of 300 units—mostly for export—the Elixir has been adopted by private flight schools such as Airbus Flight Academy and Leading Edge Aviation, and was recently selected by ENAC (École Nationale de l’Aviation Civile).

A Future-Proof, Fuel-Agnostic Aircraft

While Elixir Aircraft chose the reliable Rotax engine to meet today’s flight school requirements, the company remains focused on advancing sustainable aviation technologies:

Its current production of ultra-efficient piston-engine aircraft, running on unleaded fuel, already reduces CO₂ emissions by 70%.

The development of the Turbotech TP-R90 turbine prototype, designed to run on sustainable aviation fuel, will achieve an 85% reduction in CO₂ emissions.

With stronger measures, the UK can not only achieve its legally binding climate targets but also boost energy security for homes and businesses nationwide.
Without tougher policy and real investment in sustainable fuels, airport expansions and weak carbon pricing will put climate targets and industry leadership at real risk.
The government should take urgent action to tackle non-CO2 emissions as highlighted in the report and start properly charging for international aviation emissions.
The report highlights that in shipping recent IMO decisions on fuel standards and emissions pricing have improved shipping’s outlook for meeting climate targets.","The Climate Change Committee (CCC) has today published its first assessment of the new Labour Government’s progress on reducing emissions. The independent statutory body reports that, while government policies have improved over the past year, further urgent action is still required. With stronger measures, the UK can not only achieve its legally binding climate targets but also boost energy security for homes and businesses nationwide.

Anna Krajinska, UK Director T&E said, ‘The UK’s transport sector is at a crossroads. To keep net-zero targets within reach, we need immediate action: maintain the ZEV mandate, set a clear path to phase out diesel HGVs, and accelerate investment in sustainable aviation fuels. This must be coupled with comprehensive pricing for fossil fuel use in shipping and aviation to drive forward the switch to clean alternatives.Now is the time for bold policy, not more flexibilities or delays’

For cars, with flexibilities on the rise, CCC reports that the ZEV mandate risks shifting from ‘slightly off track’ to ‘significantly off track’—if carmakers exploit flexibilities. T&E’s analysis shows that the recent changes risk a cliff edge in 2030 with carmakers potentially having to sell an impossible over 100% ZEV to make up for excessive borrowing. To reduce this risk the government must ensure regulatory certainty and a robust industrial strategy to support domestic manufacturing and stay competitive.

T&E UK is also calling for urgent government action to complement new infrastructure investment. While the confirmation of 54 new zero-emission HGV charging hubs by Innovate UK is a positive step, the UK Government has still not established a clear regulatory mandate to drive the uptake of zero-emission heavy goods vehicles, and ensure the phase-out of diesel HGVs by 2040. Without a robust policy mechanism—such as a ZEV-HGV mandate—the UK risks falling short of its net-zero transport targets, leaving industry and investors without the certainty needed to accelerate the transition to cleaner freight

In aviation, according to the CCC, emissions now outpace the UK’s entire electricity sector. Without tougher policy and real investment in sustainable fuels, airport expansions and weak carbon pricing will put climate targets and industry leadership at real risk. The government should take urgent action to tackle non-CO2 emissions as highlighted in the report and start properly charging for international aviation emissions.

The report highlights that in shipping recent IMO decisions on fuel standards and emissions pricing have improved shipping’s outlook for meeting climate targets. However, T&E’s analysis shows that the IMO regulation only covers 20% of UK emissions and further action by the UK government is needed to meet climate targets. This should include the expansion of the UK Emission Trading Scheme to include international shipping.",https://www.transportenvironment.org/uploads/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/pexels-alexeydemidov-10658552.jpg?mtime=1750840764,N,,2025-06-25 16:08:04.678515

,,2025-06-25 12:34:42+00:00,www.agri-pulse.com,Senate changes to 45Z tax credit could hinder SAF growth - Agri-Pulse,Rebekah Alvey,,,,,https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/23108-senate-changes-to-45z-could-hider-growth-in-saf,"However, the 45Z credit has significant support from Republicans representing the agriculture sector.
SAF value lowered in Senate proposal While the House bill does not explicitly mention SAF, the Senate proposal suggests lowering the maximum value of the credit for SAF from $1.75 per gallon to $1.
The 45Z credit was intended to build off those developments and support options that would reduce carbon intensity.
“Today what matters is carbon intensity and innovation,” Fitzgerald said of the 45Z credit value model.
Under the Senate proposal, ethanol producers can claim the 45Z credit for themselves rather than selling their fuel to an alcohol-to-jet SAF producer, which could undermine growth, Cooper explained.","Treatment of sustainable aviation fuel under the 45Z tax credit for clean fuel producers in the Senate GOP budget reconciliation could be detrimental for the domestic market, sources say.

Both the House-passed reconciliation bill, and the proposal by the Senate Finance Committee would preserve 45Z and extend it through 2031, a win for many across the biofuel spectrum. But key differences between the two proposals could have a major impact on the SAF space.

Senators hope to vote on the final reconciliation bill and return it to the House later this week. Until then, senators are debating key provisions of reconciliation, including 45Z and SAF.

The clean fuel production credit is one of the few Inflation Reduction Act credits preserved in this reconciliation. Credits like those to support electric vehicles, clean electricity and clean hydrogen production were cut or will be phased out.

Upon returning from meetings at the White House Monday night, some senators reported that President Donald Trump wanted the entirety of the IRA cut. However, the 45Z credit has significant support from Republicans representing the agriculture sector.

Leaving a GOP conference Monday night, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said the Senate Finance Committee's 45Z provision was still under discussion. Leaders indicated in the meeting that they plan to continue the path of the draft released last week. But Moran noted there’s no final text.

Ahead of the final text, SAF and farm groups are pushing the Senate to adjust pieces of the 45Z provision.

In a letter obtained by Agri-Pulse, 37 farm groups urged Senate Finance members to move toward the House proposal for disincentivizing foreign feedstocks instead of the Senate proposed model.

Under the House reconciliation bill, the credit could only apply to fuels made with feedstocks from the U.S., Canada or Mexico. The Senate version would cut the value of the credit by 20% if the fuel uses feedstocks grown outside the U.S., which farm groups worry is less effective in making domestic feedstocks competitive.

SAF value lowered in Senate proposal

While the House bill does not explicitly mention SAF, the Senate proposal suggests lowering the maximum value of the credit for SAF from $1.75 per gallon to $1. This puts it on the same level as other road fuels like ethanol and renewable diesel.

This cut would be a challenge for the SAF industry given it’s an opt-in fuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard and Low Carbon Fuel Standard programs, Tom Miller, who leads biofuels regulatory affairs for energy giant BP, said on a webinar. This means SAF is starting at a disadvantage in comparison to road fuels. The increased credit value under 45Z was an important incentive for SAF project development.

Renewable diesel production and SAF production have similar economics. However, Bruce Fleming, CEO of Montana Renewables, said that without a premium, producers are less compelled to produce SAF.

“People won't bear the working capital cost. People won't bear the transportation costs and the headaches absent a premium,” Fleming said. “That can come from policy support, that can come from the market, that can come from early adopters, that can come from countries with mandates.”

Unlike road fuels, SAF producers have to build new infrastructure in the U.S., said Lindsay Fitzgerald, chief advocacy and communications officer at Gevo.

Fitzgerald said the biodiesel blenders tax credit was effective at getting many road fuels on a level playing field by supporting the development of blending infrastructure. The 45Z credit was intended to build off those developments and support options that would reduce carbon intensity.

“Today what matters is carbon intensity and innovation,” Fitzgerald said of the 45Z credit value model. “That’s what this program is rewarding.”

If the Senate proposal isn't changed, Fitzgerald said some refineries could convert to renewable diesel. But without the added incentive, the SAF market is likely to stall. This lowered credit could specifically hinder ethanol to jet facilities, Fitzgerald said.

Lower credit could slow industry growth

SAF is one space in which the ethanol and corn industry see some promise, particularly given consumer demand and the push for sustainability across the globe. But it’s going to take time for the industry, particularly the ethanol-to-jet sector, to scale up, said Matt Ziegler, biofuel policy lead for the National Corn Growers Association.

“Knocking down the value of that credit by 75 cents is certainly detrimental in our eyes,"" he said.

Shortly after the Senate text was released, Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, said he could see the credit reduction becoming an impediment to making the fuel competitive or potentially slowing further investment.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, echoed concerns about the reduction in the value for SAF under the Senate proposal. He said the original structuring of 45Z presented challenges for alcohol-to-jet production, but cutting the credit will make that even harder.

Under the Senate proposal, ethanol producers can claim the 45Z credit for themselves rather than selling their fuel to an alcohol-to-jet SAF producer, which could undermine growth, Cooper explained.

“If Congress envisioned 45Z helping to drive growth in sustainable aviation fuel and really open the door for alcohol-to-jet made from corn ethanol, we’re not sure that limiting 45Z to $1 for SAF is going to accomplish that goal,” Cooper said.

The SAF industry backs some features, including extension through 2031. The sector has long called for a longer runway for the credit to provide market certainty and encourage investment. This extension is likely to provide that, particularly for independent developers, Miller said.

The Senate version does not phase out transferability for the credit. The House version does. Preserving transferability does add cost but is a win for both renewable road fuels and SAF.

“We have to have it,” said Fleming of Montana Renewables of transferability. “Nobody’s going to operate without it.”

Before the IRA, it was not possible to sell and buy credits. Instead, a producer could allocate credits to an investor through partnership allocation rules. But this was a complex and burdensome process, said Sue Moon, an associate at King and Spalding. Even though the transferability rules are still complex, it was quickly adopted by many producers.",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/California-Bureau/sustainable-aviation-fuel-836x627.jpg?height=635&t=1749433164&width=1200,N,,2025-06-25 09:02:51.539372

By consistently upgrading its aircraft, Wizz Air ensures that it maintains one of the most eco-friendly fleets among its low-cost competitors.

Wizz Air’s commitment to sustainability extends beyond its fleet and operational practices. The airline also prioritizes a range of other initiatives aimed at reducing its environmental impact, including sustainable fuel development, efficient ground operations, and minimizing waste generation. The airline’s sustainability journey aligns with broader industry goals, including reducing the carbon footprint of air travel and meeting the targets set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

As the aviation industry continues to evolve, Wizz Air’s dedication to sustainability serves as a model for other low-cost carriers striving to balance affordability with environmental responsibility. The airline’s leadership in this field reinforces its position as a trailblazer in sustainable aviation and highlights the crucial role that the aviation sector plays in combating climate change. With its continued investment in sustainable practices, Wizz Air is set to remain a key player in the global movement towards greener air travel.

Yvonne Moynihan, Corporate and ESG Officer at Wizz Air, said: “We are honoured to have received this prestigious recognition for the fifth year in a row. Wizz Air’s approach to sustainability is built into every aspect of our operations, from advanced fuel efficiency to our investment in future-facing technologies. As articulated in our recently launched Net Zero Roadmap (flying towards net zero), We believe the path to net-zero in aviation depends on collaborative innovation—across policymakers, fuel producers, and the aviation ecosystem as a whole.”

Wizz Air’s increasing commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) stands out as a significant factor in its sustainability strategy. The airline has set an ambitious goal to power at least 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030, aligning with both the UK’s SAF mandate and current EU regulations. To support this target, Wizz Air is forging equity partnerships with SAF developers to help scale production over the long term.

Derived from waste like used cooking oil, SAF offers an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions. Global policies, innovative feedstocks, and airline commitments are driving its adoption, aiming to reshape aviation’s role in the climate crisis.

SAF, particularly those derived from used cooking oil, avoids the ethical and ecological concerns associated with food-based biofuels. Unlike palm or soy oils, UCO-based SAF supports a circular economy by repurposing waste, reducing landfill use, and easing pressure on natural ecosystems. Countries like Malaysia are leveraging their waste streams to become key suppliers of feedstock to major SAF producers in Europe.

Government mandates and airline sustainability pledges are accelerating SAF integration. In 2025, both the UK and EU will require a minimum of 2% SAF blending in jet fuel, with targets rising gradually. Airlines under large international groups are already sourcing SAF with green certifications, demonstrating how regulatory support and market demand can catalyse environmental innovation at scale.

Despite its promise, SAF production remains costly and limited in scale. Current supply cannot yet meet global demand, and price competitiveness with fossil jet fuel remains a hurdle. However, aviation experts say SAF could account for 65% of the emissions cuts needed to hit net-zero targets by 2050. Investments, subsidies, and public-private collaborations are key to boosting its availability.

Experts stress that the aviation industry alone cannot green its future—governments, fuel producers, airlines, and consumers must align. From incentivising UCO collection to expanding certified supply chains, sustainable aviation demands a systems-level approach. With growing interest from regions like Asia and support from global climate organisations, SAF is fast becoming the standard bearer for decarbonised air travel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents more than a cleaner fuel alternative—it’s a symbol of how innovation, responsibility, and collaboration can reshape entire industries. With countries repurposing waste, airlines embracing green procurement, and global standards tightening, SAF is poised to play a pivotal role in climate-resilient aviation. As adoption expands, used cooking oil could become the unlikely hero of our journey to net-zero skies.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is an umbrella term for all aviation fuels that are produced without the use of fossil fuels like petroleum, which have an up to 80 % lower carbon footprint. For electricity-based power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, the CO₂ reduction compared to fossil fuel-based kerosene will be even higher in the future (> 90 %). SAFs are blended with conventional fossil kerosene for use in aviation.

And why is it important?

Alternative fuels are the only way to decarbonize aviation with existing technology. Condor will purchase SAF over the next 12 months as part of “Round up for the future” in quantities that exceed the legally prescribed amounts. This amount of SAF will be used on future Condor flights. Moreover, according to the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can help reduce contrails and climate impacts in air travel.

Because SAF contains fewer aromatic compounds than kerosene, it results in fewer soot particles. This reduces the formation of ice crystals and thus the development of cirrus clouds, which contribute to global warming. Moreover, SAF could positively impact other non-CO₂ emissions like nitrogen oxides and continue to alleviate the pressure on the climate.

How can you support us in using SAF in the future?

Your contribution makes a difference – when refueling on future Condor flights. We specifically use the rounded-up amount from the “Round up for the future” initiative to purchase and use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The funds are allocated exclusively to SAF fuel. Book now, round up, and together we will make a big difference, little by little!

Partnership with Caphenia for power-based sustainable fuels

Condor and start-up Caphenia have engaged into a long-term partnership on the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). In doing so, we are supporting the further development of the process to market-readiness, while ensuring access to firmly agreed purchase quantities once production has reached an industrial scale. (expected to be in 2027).

Caphenia aims to generate a synthesis gas from bio-methane, CO₂, water, and renewable energy to produce environmentally friendly fuels. According to Caphenia, CO₂ emissions can be reduced by up to 92 % compared to the fossil fuel kerosene.

Caphenia's first production facility is currently being built at the Höchst Industrial Park in Frankfurt to demonstrate the industrial scalability of the technology. It is expected to start producing SAF on an industrial scale from 2027, at which point the purchase agreement with Condor will also take effect.

Associated partner of the innovation platform InnoFuels

​​This project is coordinated by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and runs from February 2023 to August 2026. The goal of the InnoFuels platform is to speed up the industrial production of electricity-based fuels (power-to-liquid, or PtL) and advanced biofuels in Germany. This will be achieved by connecting stakeholders from science, industry, politics, and society to leverage synergies and advance the development and application of these fuels.

The project is divided into seven thematic innovation priorities, which encompass all process steps – from raw material procurement through production to the application of fuels. In these areas, research institutions, companies, and political actors collaborate to develop practical solutions. We are also involved in the steering committee for the aviation sector.

Collaboration with INERATEC

The first commercial-scale INERATEC plant is located in Frankfurt, designed to produce up to 2,500 tons of sustainable e-fuels and e-waxes annually. Located in an industrial park, the plant uses renewable hydrogen and biogenic CO₂ to produce synthetic hydrocarbons that are then processed into drop-in fuels, waxes, and chemicals. These products are compatible with existing infrastructure and will meet the legal requirements for sustainable fuels in various industries, including aviation, shipping, and chemicals.

The INERATEC Customer Advisory Board (CAB) is an exclusive, invitation-only forum for leading representatives of airlines, aircraft manufacturers, airports, and policymakers who are shaping the future of more sustainable aviation. Condor has been involved in CAB since spring 2025.

By providing insights into market trends, production requirements, and regulatory challenges, members help INERATEC scale its e-SAF technology to advance industry-wide decarbonization efforts.

The move signals a pivotal shift in the airline’s approach to decarbonization and comes at a time when global aviation is under mounting pressure to accelerate climate action.

Unveiled at the airline’s Pride Centre in Nairobi, the report places SAF at the heart of Kenya Airways’ long-term environmental strategy. Through a memorandum of understanding with a local fuel producer, the airline plans to cultivate SAF feedstock on degraded land in Kwale County, previously a mining site. The initiative is expected to generate homegrown SAF for both domestic use and export markets, reducing emissions while strengthening energy security.

The development comes as fuel continues to dominate the airline’s carbon footprint, accounting for over 60% of total emissions. By anchoring SAF production within its operations, Kenya Airways aims to address both climate impact and long-term fuel cost volatility. According to CEO Allan Kilavuka, localizing SAF supply could enhance not only environmental sustainability but also economic resilience.

The airline has already made early strides. In 2023, Kenya Airways became the first African airline to operate a long-haul flight using SAF, flying from Nairobi to Amsterdam. It has also taken steps to green its ground operations, converting 12 service vehicles to electric and launching a waste-to-biodiesel pilot plant.

Beyond SAF, the 2024 report outlines broader progress in embedding sustainability across Kenya Airways’ operations. In the past year, the airline served over 5.2 million passengers, expanded its workforce by 8%, and increased the proportion of women employees to 44%. A 15% reduction in operational waste was recorded, and 12% of ground service equipment is now powered by renewable energy. In the same year, the CEO said they set up a plant to convert waste plastic into biodiesel, which is a lot cleaner than fossil diesel.

The company’s afforestation programme also remains a flagship climate action initiative. To date, over 1.2 million trees have been planted, with plans to replicate this scale annually. Meanwhile, women now represent 8% of KQ’s pilot workforce, nearly double the global average – reflecting targeted efforts to close gender gaps in aviation leadership.

Kenya Airways’ environmental strategy is aligned with the global “Fly Net Zero by 2050” commitment under the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The airline is also a participant in the SkyTeam alliance’s Sustainable Flight Challenge, which encourages innovation in low emission flying through competitive benchmarking and shared best practices.

The sustainability report was welcomed by government officials, who praised KQ’s contributions to national climate goals. Kenya has committed to a 32% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The airline’s SAF initiative, alongside fleet modernization and waste reduction was hailed as a strong example of public-private cooperation for low-carbon development.

Kenya Airways’ leadership in SAF comes as other African carriers begin to explore similar solutions. In South Africa, SAA is examining SAF production from sugarcane and biomass feedstocks. Ethiopian Airlines has piloted SAF on select flights, while Morocco and Egypt are evaluating industrial capacity to support alternative fuel scaling. These efforts reflect a growing recognition that Africa’s aviation future must align with global climate expectations, even though the continent currently accounts for just 2–3% of global aviation emissions.

Significant hurdles still remain; Globally, SAF supply meets only about 2% of demand, and production costs remain four to five times higher than traditional jet fuel. For many African carriers, already contending with high operating costs and currency instability, SAF adoption without supportive policy frameworks or financial incentives is a steep climb.

Momentum, however, is building. The African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) has endorsed the continent’s participation in CORSIA—the UN-led Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. Countries like Rwanda and Nigeria have initiated national aviation decarbonization roadmaps, while regional airports are assessing green retrofit opportunities and carbon-neutral certification.

The dream of a cleaner, more sustainable aviation sector is fast becoming a reality with the growing adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—particularly those derived from used cooking oil (UCO). SAF represents a crucial innovation in the global effort to reduce the aviation industry’s environmental impact.

SAF is a biofuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel, offering a significantly lower carbon footprint without requiring any major modifications to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. Depending on the feedstock and production method, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

Recognizing aviation’s contribution to global emissions—2.5% of the world’s energy-related CO₂ emissions in 2023—the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and national governments are pushing for broader SAF adoption. The European Union and the UK, for instance, have begun requiring that jet fuel contains at least 2% SAF starting in 2025, with that number set to rise gradually over the next 15 years.

One of the most promising feedstocks for SAF is waste oil, especially UCO. When compared to biofuels made from agricultural commodities like soy or palm oil, UCO-based SAF avoids competition with food crops and helps prevent deforestation, making it a truly circular and responsible solution.

Countries like Malaysia, one of the world’s largest producers of UCO and virgin palm oil, are playing a key role in this green transition. A recent initiative there rewards volunteers with up to $21 per litre for turning in used cooking oil. Companies like Evergreen Oil & Feed, which operates UCO collection centers, are supplying this crucial feedstock to European SAF producers such as Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell, and Finland’s Neste.

Major airline groups like the International Airlines Group (IAG)—parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, and LEVEL—are already purchasing SAF with green certification from jet fuel suppliers, signaling a strong commitment to low-carbon aviation.

Despite its potential, SAF still faces hurdles: primarily in terms of production scale and cost. However, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF is expected to contribute to 65% of emissions reductions needed for the aviation sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The journey toward greener air travel has taken off—and with collective action from governments, industries, and individuals, SAF could be the fuel that powers a cleaner future for aviation.",https://indianpsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/British-Airway.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 07:04:43.124115

Abstract

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a key component for the defossilization of the aviation sector. The economic feasibility of SAF production is typically evaluated through techno-economic assessments (TEA), with the Minimum Jet Fuel Selling Price (MJSP) serving as the key economic performance indicator. Comparing MJSP values across different SAF pathways is challenging and potentially misleading due to differences in modelling assumptions, estimation methods for key variables, and their underlying relationships. This study aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the economic feasibility of four prominent SAF pathways: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Pyrolysis-to-Jet (PTJ), Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), and Fischer-Tropsch (FT). We employed qualitative and quantitative methods, including meta-analysis and variable harmonization, to analyze a wide range of TEA studies from the literature and investigate the factors contributing to MJSP variation for these pathways. Our findings reveal that feedstock cost is a primary driver of MJSP variability across all pathways. Moreover, regression and harmonization analyses uncovered complex interdependencies among economic variables often underexplored in individual TEAs. Key sources of MJSP variability include methodological differences in by-product credit valuation, process design choices, capital cost estimation approaches, and financial assumptions. Recognizing and addressing these factors offers strategic opportunities to improve the techno-economic performance and comparability of SAF pathways. Notably, the PTJ pathway emerged as a promising alternative for non-food feedstocks, and all pathways demonstrated improved economic outcomes when integrated with existing industrial infrastructure. The analytical findings of this study provide a robust empirical foundation that can be leveraged by future studies aimed at policy analysis, as well as for project budgeting and investment decisions in sustainable aviation fuels.

The national carrier shared the update during the launch of its 2024 Sustainability Report at the Pride Centre in Nairobi, reports The Standard.

KQ CEO Allan Kilavuka said the airline has signed a memorandum of understanding with a local SAF producer. The project will involve planting trees on degraded land in Kwale County, a former mining site, to generate feedstock for SAF production. “Our goal is to produce SAF for both local use and export once the trees mature around 2030,” he said.

Kilavuka noted that KQ has already planted 1.2 million trees and plans to match that number annually. He highlighted that fuel accounts for 64% of the airline’s carbon emissions, stressing the urgency of adopting cleaner alternatives. “SAF is still new and costly—about four to five times more expensive than regular jet fuel—which makes its adoption challenging,” he said.

He added that 30–35% of airline costs come from fuel, making fuel efficiency a priority. KQ is working with the African Airlines Association to improve flight routes and reduce distances flown.

In May 2023, KQ became the first African airline to use SAF for a long-haul flight, flying from Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport.

KQ has also converted 12 pieces of ground service equipment to electric and established a plant that transforms plastic waste into biodiesel. Kilavuka said the airline is committed to promoting gender equality, with women making up 8% of its pilots—well above the global average of 4–5%.

Principal Secretary for Environment and Climate Change Festus Ng’eno praised KQ’s role in helping Kenya reach its target of a 32% reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2030. “This SAF project is a perfect example of the public-private partnerships needed to drive green growth,” said Ng’eno, in remarks delivered by John Elungata, Secretary of Administration at the State Department.

Aviation’s path to sustainability is being redefined, not just by innovations in fuel chemistry, but by how those innovations are being deployed. A recent strategic move by Houston-based company XCF Global illustrates how the future of clean aviation fuel may depend as much on flexibility and partnership as on the fuel itself.

The company has unveiled a bold international expansion strategy centered around a modular facility design and local licensing partnerships. While this may seem like just another corporate expansion, its implications for global sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) deployment deserve closer attention.

From Centralized Innovation to Distributed Impact

XCF Global’s announcement highlights a transition from centralized SAF development to localized empowerment. By offering regional partners access to its synthetic aviation fuel platform through licensing agreements—while retaining intellectual property ownership—XCF is adopting a capital-light model that fosters scale without sacrificing control.

This isn’t just smart economics. It’s a strategic acknowledgment of a complex reality: local regulations, feedstock availability, logistics infrastructure, and policy support vary widely across markets. A modular and locally adapted approach enables faster uptake in regions otherwise sidelined by traditional fuel infrastructure models.

Local Partnerships as Catalysts for Global Progress

The company’s emphasis on “smart, localized partnerships” echoes a wider trend in sustainable transport: empowering local actors to lead while leveraging global technology. Rather than simply exporting facilities or fuel, XCF’s strategy invites co-ownership of the decarbonization journey. This approach unlocks regional momentum and may become a defining characteristic of successful SAF deployment worldwide.

The licensing-plus-equity model also allows the company to remain invested—both financially and operationally—in each market’s success. This represents a subtle shift from the historical norm of corporate detachment, toward a shared-responsibility ecosystem in clean aviation.

Signals from the Market and Beyond

What adds weight to XCF’s move is timing. Governments around the world are moving to reduce aviation-related carbon emissions. From Europe’s blending mandates to North America’s clean fuel incentives, the demand for scalable, certified SAF is escalating.

Yet, the road from innovation to implementation is often blocked not by science, but by distribution bottlenecks. XCF’s patent-pending modular design could prove to be the bridge between feasibility and real-world adoption. Modular facilities can adapt to different feedstocks, regulatory contexts, and infrastructure limitations, giving regions autonomy to advance their own decarbonization timelines.

Building Trust Through Transparency and Stability

Another often overlooked aspect of this development is financial health. XCF reports a conservative debt profile with a total debt to capital ratio of just 0.01. In an industry where capital expenditures can be daunting, financial discipline enhances credibility—especially when entering emerging or less predictable markets.

Moreover, the company’s stable capital structure and newly secured $50 million equity line underscore its readiness to support long-term, sustainable growth. Recent executive appointments and a board with deep experience in energy transition issues further support this trajectory.

The Bigger Picture: A Global Transition Requires Local Solutions

For sustainability professionals, XCF’s expansion strategy offers a case study in harmonizing innovation, economics, and policy. It demonstrates how SAF technologies—though global in ambition—require regional customization.

The aviation sector, responsible for nearly three percent of global carbon emissions, has few alternatives to liquid fuel in the short term. As such, synthetic aviation fuels that are both scalable and certifiable hold promise. But only if their deployment mechanisms are as innovative as their chemistry.

Why This Matters Now

With XCF’s Nasdaq listing and renewed leadership structure, the company seems poised to act not just as a fuel supplier, but as an architect of the next-generation SAF ecosystem. The conversion of its Nevada facility to support renewable diesel and SAF production is more than a logistical shift; it is a signal of intent to serve as a modular model for others to follow.

In a world where sustainable solutions often falter in the leap from laboratory to large-scale impact, this distributed model could serve as a critical blueprint for others in the low-carbon mobility space.

Conclusion: Turning Strategic Design into Shared Climate Action

This isn’t just a story about fuel or expansion. It is about unlocking local potential through globally informed design. XCF Global’s approach highlights how progress in clean aviation will come not only from what is produced, but how it is shared and where it is implemented.

Sustainability professionals should take note. The future may belong to those who see modularity not as a technical workaround, but as a philosophical commitment—to flexibility, partnership, and regional ownership of global climate goals.

By drawing attention to such approaches, industry voices can foster deeper alignment between technology, policy, and local action. The modular mindset may well be the bridge that links today’s innovations to tomorrow’s net-zero skies.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-47.svg,N,,2025-06-25 08:02:54.136653

The traditional idea of energy dominance has long revolved around fossil fuel extraction and global supply control. Today, however, a quiet yet powerful shift is underway. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is becoming one of the most dynamic instruments in reshaping the American energy agenda. This transition is not simply about replacing one type of fuel with another. It is about building a resilient energy economy grounded in domestic innovation, rural revitalization, and global leadership in clean technologies.

Recent policy discussions and data from national agencies show that Sustainable Aviation Fuel is more than a decarbonization tool—it is emerging as a catalyst for strategic advantage.

From Niche to Necessary: A Steep Climb in Production Capacity

Just a year ago, Sustainable Aviation Fuel was largely considered an emerging technology. Today, it has surged into the mainstream of US energy policy. According to the US Energy Information Administration, SAF production has grown from just 2,000 barrels per day at the end of 2024 to over 30,000 barrels daily by mid-2025. This trajectory is expected to continue, with projections pointing toward 500,000 barrels per year by the end of the year.

This momentum reveals more than market dynamics. It reflects the power of aligned policy, strategic incentives, and industry readiness. Crucially, it signals that clean fuels are no longer on the periphery of American energy systems—they are central to them.

Innovation Rooted in Rural America

The story of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is as much about rural revitalization as it is about decarbonization. From agricultural residues to woody biomass and waste oils, the raw inputs for SAF come from the very communities often overlooked in clean energy narratives. These are not fringe sources. They are economically viable, scalable, and capable of fueling both aircraft and livelihoods.

Alison Graab of the SAF Coalition underscored this point in a recent interview, highlighting how SAF can become a long-term engine for economic stability in rural regions. These communities are positioned not just as beneficiaries but as central actors in the next era of American energy growth.

Global Demand Creates Domestic Opportunity

The SAF market is not limited to US borders. International demand is rising rapidly as governments implement mandates and incentives to green their aviation sectors. With more operational SAF production facilities than any other country, the United States has a head start—but this advantage must be nurtured.

SAF offers the US a rare convergence of environmental, economic, and diplomatic opportunity. Scaling production supports domestic sustainability goals while also serving global markets. This is not merely about exporting fuel—it is about exporting standards, systems, and scalable solutions that can help other nations meet their climate commitments.

Policy Certainty: The Foundation of Long-Term Investment

Despite its upward trajectory, the SAF industry still faces hurdles—chief among them, policy uncertainty. Investors, project developers, and supply chain stakeholders all need a consistent framework to commit long-term capital.

The extension of the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit through December 2031, recently passed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by the House of Representatives, is a major step in the right direction. This credit provides essential assurance that public policy will continue to reward innovation and production in this space.

Yet this is only a beginning. The industry also needs clarity and predictability around feedstock eligibility, regulatory standards, and credit valuation. Specifically, the modernization of regulations surrounding woody biomass by the US Environmental Protection Agency could unlock vast additional capacity.

A Moment to Lead, Not to Pause

The current phase of SAF expansion is less about technological feasibility and more about execution. America has the talent, infrastructure, and feedstocks to meet soaring demand. What is needed now is a firm commitment from policymakers to create the enabling conditions for exponential growth.

This is a rare alignment: a clean technology with bipartisan potential, strong job creation prospects, rural appeal, and significant export value. SAF is not asking for special treatment—it is asking for a consistent, forward-looking framework that acknowledges its role in America’s strategic interests.

The Subtler Advantage: Redefining Energy Power Through Systems Thinking

One of the most compelling yet underdiscussed aspects of the SAF revolution is its role in redefining what energy leadership actually looks like. It shifts the focus from raw extraction to circular systems, from global control to local empowerment, and from fossil-based exports to sustainable innovation flows.

This systems-level approach resonates with transport and sustainability professionals worldwide. It offers a blueprint for how mobility, energy, and environment goals can be aligned not just in rhetoric, but in infrastructure and investment.

Conclusion: Building the Bridge Between Policy, Industry, and Purpose

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is no longer a hopeful experiment. It is a proven pathway toward economic diversification, climate resilience, and global leadership. As Congress considers long-term tax incentives and regulatory refinements, the opportunity is clear: support this momentum and secure America’s place at the forefront of aviation’s clean energy future.

For those working in mobility transformation and sustainability, the evolution of SAF provides a clear case for integrated strategy. It is a sector where policy clarity, regional collaboration, and technological deployment must work hand-in-hand. It also reveals the growing importance of consulting, advisory, and implementation partners in bridging ambition with action.

The Trough of Disillusionment

The Gartner Hype Cycle tracks the five key phases of a technology’s life cycle. Following the ‘Technology Trigger’ with significant media interest and the ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’ which sees scores of failures, the sector moves into the ‘Trough of Disillusionment’ where interest wanes. Later, following investment in promising ideas, the industry reaches the ‘Slope of Enlightenment’ and the ‘Plateau of Productivity.’ (Wayne J Davis/RAeS)

The Gartner Hype Cycle might have its detractors, but its memorable descriptors often resonate as we follow the progress of technologies towards commercial success.

Aviation sustainability, while not a technology as such, has certainly followed a familiar path in recent years and, therefore, when Mark Westwood, Professor of Aeronautics at Cranfield University, says he thinks we are heading into Gartner’s ‘Trough of Disillusionment’, it is not hard to see what is driving that view.

Westwood is, however, keen to emphasise that he does not actually feel disillusioned. “It’s a part of the technology development life cycle,” he explains, “what you see playing out is the enthusiasm of engineers and scientists hitting the cold, hard facts of physics and economics.”

As the aviation industry started to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, there was an acceleration of interest in developing new technologies and strategies to enable the sector to meet net zero 2050. More radical technologies, such as hydrogen-fuelled aircraft enabling true zero emissions flight, buoyed by government investment, went from being principally hypothetical case studies happening in academia to industry-led research programmes firmly focused on practical implementation.

Projects developing hydrogen-fuelled propulsion technologies over the last few years have ranged from start-ups and small companies focused on powertrains initially suitable for retrofit into existing small aircraft to the Airbus ZEROe programme with the ambition to develop new airliners. However, since their inception around 2020, many of these projects have struck headwinds – Universal Hydrogen shut down in 2024 after failing to find adequate funding and Project Fresson and ZeroAvia have both seen delays to planned key milestones.

Hydrogen hold-ups

Is future flight powered by hydrogen? (Lufthansa Technik)

A further blow to the industry’s hydrogen ambitions came in February this year, when Airbus announced that its previous plan to launch a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft in 2035 would be pushed back by five to ten years. Airbus’ announcement also drew attention to the required infrastructure and ecosystem required to support hydrogen aircraft, which is possibly a bigger challenge than the aircraft technology itself, and is not wholly within the aerospace sector’s control.

Nonetheless, Duncan McCourt, CEO of Sustainable Aviation, believes that hydrogen will play a significant role in aviation. “It’s probably been pushed a little bit to the right,” he explains, “but I would expect it to play a part to 2050 and to expand significantly beyond then.”

The harsh realities of these delays to the introduction of hydrogen aircraft, particularly those of a larger size, is that the technology is likely to offer only a minimal contribution towards net zero before 2050.

In commercial aviation, regional and smaller aircraft account for less than 10% of emissions, with the rest coming from single-aisle and widebody aircraft. However, based on recent news, hydrogen-fuelled versions of these larger aircraft do not seem likely to come into service at all before 2050. Of the small proportion of emissions which might be addressed by first-generation regional hydrogen aircraft before 2050, it will only be feasible to address a fraction of them due to the slow timeline of fleet replacement in aviation.

According to Cirium data, in 2024, only 34% of the global fleet was comprised of the latest generation of aircraft (Airbus A320neo family, A350, Boeing 737 MAX and 787). These aircraft first came into service between 2011 and 2017, yet still represent only just over a third of the fleet, clearly demonstrating the limited impact that yet-to-be-developed new hydrogen aircraft could have before 2050. Furthermore, the environmental benefit of resolving supply chain issues and accelerating deliveries of current state-of-the-art aircraft, which are typically 10-20% more efficient than the aircraft they replace, should not be underestimated.

The SAF dilemma

SAF has the potential to provide a fast route to decarbonisation but its production at scale has problems, regardless of the source of the fuel. (ATR)

Thankfully, decarbonising aviation is not solely reliant on radical new aircraft technologies and the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a major contributor to reaching net zero for the sector in all potential roadmaps. SAF certainly has the potential to provide a faster route to decarbonisation than anything that relies on the introduction of new aircraft, given that it can be used in the existing fleet, albeit as a blend or with some additives to make it a drop-in fuel.

However, although SAF is an effective means of reducing emissions from aviation, its production at scale seems to give rise to controversy, regardless of the source of the fuel. For Tony Henley, Chair of the RAeS Environmental Sustainability Co-ordination Group, considering SAF derived from waste, the challenge is the availability of the feedstock in sufficient quantities. “Waste-derived SAF will give you a few percent of what you need, but it isn’t going to solve the problem,” he explains, adding that a lot of waste is currently used elsewhere in other industries and diverting it to aviation will serve only to transfer the problem to different sectors.

When it comes to plant-based SAF, “you’re either taking agricultural land which is already in short supply (and climate change is making it scarcer still)… so you’re immediately threatening people’s food supplies. If you don’t use agricultural land…then you’re turning vast uncultivated areas into monocultures, so you’re massively denting biodiversity”. Henley also flags the cost and effort of using this marginal land which is typically unused due to the difficulty of cultivation.

This leaves Power-to-Liquid SAF, where captured carbon is combined with green hydrogen to form synthetic kerosene. On paper it has the potential to reduce the net emissions more than the other options but, as Henley explains, “the only problem is that you need a massive amount of energy to get those raw materials and then combine them into a usable fuel.” He continues: “That’s got to be the way to go … but unless we massively increase the amount of green electricity, it’s not viable.”

However, despite these challenges, McCourt is optimistic about the ability of industry to scale up SAF production, “where there’s a will and a commercial interest to do so.”

The need for green energy

It is notable that both Henley and Westwood, when asked what they see as the biggest barriers to reaching net zero 2050 for aviation, identify the reliance on cheap renewable energy as a significant risk. Increasing the supply of green energy is not something which falls within the purview of the aerospace sector and will be heavily reliant on government policy if it is to be achieved. In recent months, however, UK politicians across the parties have seemingly been pulling back from the commitment to reaching net zero by 2050. Although it currently remains government policy, it does not seem inconceivable that the current policy may be diluted or delayed. This will have knock-on impacts on all the industries reliant on developments such as renewable energy or greenhouse gas removals and require national and global coordination and support. It is also yet to be determined how the recent US move away from climate action might affect global efforts to address the issue. Furthermore, Westwood suggests that the current geopolitical landscape is likely to drive increased defence spending in many countries, putting pressure on budgets, potentially at the cost of spending on environmental initiatives.

There is also the growing realisation that net zero is an expensive objective, not least for aviation, and one that consumers seem reluctant to pay for. Recent research by the RAeS into public attitudes to decarbonisation (see ‘Would you pay more to decarbonise your flight?’ AEROSPACE April 2025) suggested only a little over a third of passengers might be willing to pay more for a greener flight and, as Westwood says, “It’s very difficult to see how alternatives to kerosene will be cheaper.”

With the aerospace sector seeming unlikely to branch out into renewable energy generation (except perhaps on a small scale at airports to support ground operations), SAF petrochemical processes or greenhouse gas removal technology, their role in the development and scale-up of these out-of-sector enablers for aviation net zero seems best suited to that of an intelligent customer – clearly articulating the demand, opportunities and implications but not acting directly.

Ever more efficient

Recent cuts to NASA’s budget have contributed to Boeing’s decision to pause work on the joint Transonic Truss-Braced Wing demonstrator project. (NASA)

Where then should industry be focusing its internal efforts? Accepting that the best fuel is the fuel you do not use, should we be concentrating on developing the next generation of conventional aircraft, pursuing further efficiency improvements for SAF-fuelled aircraft to lighten the demand on renewable energy for SAF production?

Westwood thinks this is an important element of industry’s drive towards net zero: “I’d like to see both of those companies [Airbus and Boeing] focusing really heavily on what’s the absolute best we could do with the technologies we’ve got. Maybe it flies slightly slower, it’s lighter, it’s got even better aerodynamic performance or optimised structures – what’s the best that we could possibly do if these high-risk technologies don’t come off?”

Research from the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute suggests that the next generation of single-aisle and widebody aircraft, using only relatively mature technology improvements could see a 15-20% reduction in fuel burn, compared to current aircraft.

It certainly seems as though the technology exists for a new highly efficient aircraft, which could contribute significantly to net zero, even if the idea does not generate the levels of hype and enthusiasm that new fuels and radical aircraft designs do. Furthermore, both aircraft and engine OEMs are working on more ambitious developments, such as extremely high-aspect ratio wings and open rotor engine configurations. However, the recent announcement of a draft budget for NASA which eliminates all “green aviation” programmes must be bad news for Boeing, which has already paused work on its X-66 Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project.

However, neither Airbus nor Boeing seem particularly inclined to launch new aircraft development programmes imminently. Indications a few years ago were that they might target a new single-aisle aircraft entering service in the mid-2030s with a larger aircraft following later but, as previously explored, waiting that long will mean the impact before 2050 is much reduced due to the slow rate of fleet replacement, which is unlikely to change due to the economics for airlines.

It is economics, or rather the business case, which seems to be lacking in terms of encouraging the airframers to act sooner. At the end of 2024, Airbus had an order backlog of 8,658 aircraft, while Boeing’s backlog stood at 5,595. Having such a solid order book with their existing production aircraft, the investment required to develop a new aircraft and the inherent risk associated with it, must seem both unnecessary and unappealing, even if it might bring environmental benefits. “I think we’re being naïve if we think they’re going to have environmental sustainability as their primary focus,” says Westwood. “I have no doubt both organisations are well-intentioned but they’ve got businesses to run.”

Is net zero by 2050 achievable?

The future of airline flight? (Airbus)

With delays to radical new technologies, the replacement of the fleet with more efficient conventional aircraft seeming likely to take decades and SAF and greenhouse gas removals reliant on uncertain global government action, is 2050 an achievable timeline for reaching net zero for the sector? Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, certainly seems not to think so, having recently stated that he believes the industry will need to review its targets.

“My view would be that we should not focus on 2050,” says Westwood. “It’s just a line in the sand. The best solution [for aviation] might not be the one that gives you the most reduction in emissions at the 2050 point.”

McCourt, however, favours continuing to target net zero 2050 and believes it is an achievable goal. “The balance of various technologies that deliver net zero will probably change beyond 2050, but I still think it’s right that we have a target.”

Henley has a similar perspective: “Net zero in 2050 might not be possible, but getting a lot closer to net zero by 2050 than we are at the moment is worth having.”

Despite challenges, there seems to be no hesitation over the importance of pushing towards net zero, even if the target of 2050 is in question. However, with the challenges and uncertainties that exist, and which are becoming more apparent, it does not seem too much of a stretch to say that we are indeed on the downward slope to the Trough of Disillusionment – both in relation to the novel technologies that remain a key component to emission-free flight but also for aviation sustainability as a whole.

Catchy labels aside, as Westwood says: “You can convince yourself it is all impossible, but it doesn’t really mean we should divert from what we’re doing. The drivers, the reasons for doing it, haven’t gone away. It’s just recognising that it is more difficult, but the direction [we are moving in] is the right direction.”",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26872/zeroe-demonstrator.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 07:05:06.177985

US President Donald J. Trump swept into office on a mission to throttle back activity in the nation’s booming renewable energy industries, but the hits just keep on coming. The latest development involves the massive new Project Roadrunner e-fuels facility in Reeves County, Texas, near Pecos. The developer, US-based Infinium, aims to replace conventional jet fuel with a new concoction formulated from green hydrogen and captured carbon.

Follow The Money To E-Fuels

If you’re wondering why Texas is a good location for an SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) operation, that’s a good question. After all, Texas is a longstanding epicenter of US oil and gas production. However, Texas has also become a leading wind and solar producer in the US, and thus a suitable environment for green hydrogen producers. Unlike conventional hydrogen extracted from natural gas, green hydrogen is jolted loose from water in electrolysis systems powered by renewable energy.

With its copious footprint in various industrial operations, Texas also produces a large amount of capture-able carbon, along with the infrastructure needed to transport fuels from one place to another. As described by its developer, the US firm Infinium, Project Roadrunner will deploy captured emissions from local operations that currently vent CO2 to the air. The renewable energy will come from purpose-built wind and solar farms in West Texas.

CleanTechnica has been following the e-fuels project since 2023, when American Airlines and the Breakthrough Energy Catalyst Fund got involved. Last year, Brookfield Asset Management put up $200 million to claim the role of strategic funding partner for the project, along with another $850 million earmarked for distributing e-fuels including sustainable aviation fuel from Project Roadrunner.

In the latest development, on June 24, the leading global financial firm HSBC provided additional, substantial support in the form of a project-based credit arrangement. “The financing marks a significant step forward for the Roadrunner Project, which will produce approximately 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other low-carbon eFuel products using renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide,” Infinium explained in a press statement.

What’s In It For HSBC?

So … interesting! While US financial institutions and other leading corporate citizens have busied themselves currying favor with the malevolently incompetent Commander-in-Chief who occupies the White House, HSBC is a UK-based firm that follows a different drummer to the beat of global decarbonization. The firm is determined to deepen its mark on the US market, which explains its interest in a high-profile e-fuels project.

HSBC doubled down on its US footprint last year, highlighted by the unveiling of a new headquarters in New York City’s super-trendy Hudson Yards district in Midtown Manhattan.

“Our new U.S. headquarters in the heart of one of the world’s financial capitals symbolizes our commitment to our clients and to this critical market,” enthused HSBC Group Chairman Mark Tucker in a press release celebrating the new HQ dated May 23, 2024.

“We remain focused on connecting our clients in the US to opportunities overseas, and those around the world to the US,” HSBC emphasized.

Apparently, the abrupt shift in federal energy policy since May of 2024 has not deterred HSBC from its decarbonization mission. Referring to the newly announced credit arrangement in support of Project Roadrunner, HSBC’s CEO for Infrastructure Finance and Sustainability Danny Alexander explained that the transaction “represents HSBC’s commitment to support emerging decarbonisation technology, crucial to accelerating the transition.”

“The construction of Roadrunner is a first-of-a-kind facility and marks a huge achievement for Infinium and for the fuel industry,” Alexander added.

E-Fuels Really Are Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

With its green hydrogen connection and American Airlines among the offtakers already in its pocket, Project Roadrunner validates the opinion of analysts at BloombergNEF. At a recent energy conference in New York City, BNEF opined that green hydrogen is not ready for prime time yet, except in optimal market conditions such as those offered by Texas.

For the record, Project Roadrunner is Infinium’s second e-fuels venture in Texas, following the commissioning of its Project Pathfinder facility in 2024.

California is another state determined to have a hand in the US e-fuels industry. In March, the Texas-based firm HIF Global announced that it has earned Tier II Design Pathway Certification for its e-fuels process from the California Air Resource Board, through the agency’s Low Carbon Fuels Standard division.

“This LCFS certification underscores the growing demand for e-Fuels in the U.S. and globally, which could reach more than 250 mtpa by 20351, providing opportunity for over $1 trillion in potential capital investment in new facilities to produce the fuels, including HIF Global’s 1.4 mtpa e-Fuels project,” noted HIF Global Board Executive Director Meg Gentle.

Somewhat ironically, that particular project is not located in California. The site is Matagorda County, Texas. Even more ironically, when HIF Global announced Matagorda as the location for its first e-fuels project in the US, Texas Governor Gregg Abbot enthusiastically endorsed the idea.

“With plans to make a $6 billion capital investment, HIF will create more than 125 permanent operating jobs as well as thousands of other direct and indirect jobs in the region,” the Office of the Governor noted in a press release dated April 18, 2022.

Abbott and his fellow Republican elected officials in Texas are not particularly known for their affection for renewable energy, but money talks and Abbott added his two cents to the celebration.

“As the leader in the future of eFuels, HIF will be an excellent addition to the Texas economic juggernaut,” Abbott cheered. “This investment is great news for Texans in Matagorda County and the Coastal Bend, with more jobs, opportunity, and enhanced technology coming to the Lone Star State.”

Next Steps For E-Fuels In The US

Meanwhile, not to splash cold water on the Matagorda project — but they did anyways — on May 29 BBC News reported that the final investment decision has yet to be nailed down. The company is “waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production,” observed BBC reporter Zoe Corbyn.

If the Republicans make the tax credits for green hydrogen go buh-bye, perhaps HIF can dial up HSBC for a loan. Better yet, perhaps e-fuels cheerleader Abbott can prod the Republican members of the Texas delegation to Congress for some relief. After all, he’s the one who said that “Texas is proud to be the energy capital of the world, and I look forward to a continued partnership with HIF to keep our state the energy leader.”

There were some positives and negatives for Canada’s canola industry, said the executive director of the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its proposed rule for the Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs).

The biomass-based diesel mandate, which includes biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, was set at 5.61 billion gallons for 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons for 2027.

That is a massive increase from the 3.35 billion gallon mandate for 2025 and is even higher than the 5.25 billion gallons that a coalition of oil and biofuel groups had been lobbying for.

That is good news for Canada’s crushers and canola farmers.

The bad news is that the EPA also proposed that foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50 per cent of the Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN) credit value relative to U.S. biofuels and feedstocks.

“That’s unfortunate,” said Vervaet.

“They’re proposing a 50 per cent haircut, if you will.”

The American Soybean Association was thrilled with the “new concept.”

“As soybean farmers struggle to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly growing flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks like used cooking oil, this proposal would once again give U.S. agriculture a competitive edge in the biofuel value chain,” the association said in a press release.

Vervaet is puzzled that the EPA chose to penalize Canadian canola-based biofuels since elsewhere in the proposed rule it praised canola oil as a predictable and plentiful feedstock.

He said that new proposal could seriously restrict the flow of Canadian canola oil to the U.S. market.

“With that type of a haircut on credit values, we’re going to be challenged to compete with other feedstocks. There’s no doubt about it,” he said.

However, he is hopeful that the EPA will come to its senses in time for the final rule, which is expected later this year.

“We have to remember this is a proposed rule. There is still time to influence some of the final content in this rule,” he said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee released its draft of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which includes an extension of the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit.

Vervaet said there were some pluses and minuses with that legislative proposal as well.

He was pleased to see that the credit, which pays up to US$1 per gallon for biodiesel and renewable diesel and $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel, would be extended through the end of 2031, just like the House version of the bill.

More importantly, both the Senate and House reconciliation bills exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. That means canola-based fuels would be eligible for the credit.

However, the Senate version of the bill differs from the House version in one crucial area.

The House version limits the availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada.

The Senate version says the feedstock can be produced anywhere, but the credit would be reduced by 20 per cent for fuel produced from feedstocks grown outside the U.S. effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Vervaet said the Senate version penalizes Canadian canola oil, while the House version creates a “ringfence” for North American feedstock, which he thinks makes sense.

“Our markets are so integrated already, where you have millions of dollars of feedstock and finished fuels crisscrossing our border,” he said.

He is hopeful that the House will prevail in that aspect of the ongoing budget bill battle.

Ian Thomson, past president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said the glass is definitely half empty when it comes to how Canada’s biofuel producers view the new U.S. policy proposals.

“We’re worse off than we were before,” he said.

The biomass-based diesel industry was “delighted” with the EPA’s new mandates for 2026 and 2027.

But Canadian biofuels would not be competitive in the U.S. market if they can’t get the same RIN values and tax credits as American biofuels.

Thomson is pleased with the removal of the ILUC factor in calculating greenhouse gas emissions, but it is a hollow victory because soybean oil renewable diesel would receive a $0.53 per gallon credit under the new rules, while canola oil renewable diesel would get a $0.22 credit.

“You’re still way under water versus the U.S.,” he said.

Thomson said U.S. biofuel policy is shifting to a made-in-the-U.S. approach, rather than the open border concept that existed for years.

Canada may have to follow their lead and promote made-in-Canada biofuels, he said.

Ottawa is aware of the problem and is well briefed on what needs to happen to keep Canada’s biofuel sector whole.

“They understand there is urgency,” said Thomson.

“This is not something that can grind through iterations of how Canada will respond.”

British Columbia recently made changes to its Low Carbon Fuels Act, doubling the renewable fuel mandate for diesel to eight per cent and requiring that the renewable content must be produced in Canada.

“Could Canada do likewise?” said Thomson.

“It could.”",https://ukragroconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/biotoplivo.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 00:58:57.305693

Netherlands publishes RED III biofuels draft

London, 24 June (Argus) — The Dutch government's updated draft legislation to transpose the EU's revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) notably proposes abolishing double-counting renewable energy contributions from Annex IX feedstocks. The draft introduces a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction mandate for land, inland shipping and maritime shipping, but excludes aviation — which was included in a previous draft . The RED III mandate will take effect in 2026. Obligated parties have to fulfil the mandate by surrendering a sufficient amount of so-called emission reduction units (EREs) in each sector. The mandate's flexible credit allowance allows EREs generated in the land sector to be used to partly meet emission reduction obligations in inland and maritime shipping ( see table ), but EREs from inland and maritime shipping cannot be used by land sector suppliers to fulfil their compliance requirements. Fuel suppliers with overall consumption of more than 500,000 l/yr will need to incorporate a 14.4pc share of renewable fuels in their annual deliveries in 2026. This increases linearly, to reach 27.1pc in 2030. The amount of crop-based biofuels in the land sector will be limited to 1.4pc of the overall energy content of total consumption until 2030, and will not be accepted towards targets in maritime and inland shipping and aviation. The amount of Annex IX Part B biofuels — such as used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — that can be counted towards the mandate will be limited to 4.29pc in the land sector and 11.07pc in inland shipping. Obligated parties will be unable to claim EREs from Annex IX Part B fuels used in maritime shipping. The draft also introduces a minimum share of emission reductions that have to be achieved by Annex IX Part A and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO), for all sectors. RED III mandates that 5.5pc of all fuels supplied must be advanced biofuels, including at least 1pc RFNBOs by 2030. The Netherlands' draft decouples these targets, to reduce investment uncertainty ( see table ). Refineries that use renewable hydrogen in their production process can claim refinery reduction units — or RAREs — which can be used by a supplier to meet an RFNBO sub-target in various sectors. Correction factor delay The ministry will delay its plans to apply a ""correction factor"" of 0.4 to its ""refinery route"" stimulus for hydrogen demand, in order to ensure the measure does not undermine direct use of hydrogen in transport. The correction factor means the value of emissions reductions credits generated through the use of renewable hydrogen for transport fuel production would be limited to a certain percentage of those generated through direct use of renewable hydrogen or derivatives in transport. The government leaves the option open to impose a correction factor from 2030. Although the EU Fuel Quality Directive increases the maximum share of bio-based components to 10pc in diesel, the Dutch government said fuel suppliers must continue to offer B7 — diesel with up to 7pc biodiesel — as a protection grade, because of the large number of cars incompatible with B10. Companies will be able to carry forward any excess EREs to the next compliance year. Companies with an annual obligation can carry forward up to 10pc of the total amount of EREs needed to fulfil their obligation in a year, with registering companies allowed to carry forward 4pc. Dutch renewable fuel tickets (HBEs) carried into 2026 will be converted into EREs on 1 April 2026, the government said.

Erex to start Vietnam biomass co-firing tests in August

Tokyo, 24 June (Argus) — Japanese renewable energy developer Erex plans to start coal and biomass co-firing test runs at thermal power plants in Vietnam from August. Co-firing test runs will start at the 110MW Na Duong plant in August and at the 115MW Cao Ngan plant in September, Erex said on 20 June. Both plants are owned and operated by Vietnam National Coal and Mineral Industries (Vinacomin). The Japanese company announced in April that it was planning co-firing test runs at the two plants , but had not previously disclosed when the tests would start. The trial operations are expected to last for several months and burn locally produced wood chips, starting from 5pc co-firing and gradually increasing to 20pc. The two companies will renovate the plants in 2026-27 after the trial operations and start commercial co-firing operations around 2027-28, Erex said. Erex said it also plans to conduct co-firing test runs at Vinacomin's 670MW Cam Pha plant in 2027-28 and start commercial operations around 2029-30. The company aims to carry out co-firing at six Vinacomin plants with a combined capacity of 1,585MW, including Na Duong, Cao Ngan, and Cam Pha. The co-firing projects are part of Vietnam's net zero strategy. Erex is eyeing carbon credits from the plants once commercial co-firing begins. The company aims to sell some of the carbon credits in Japan and is currently negotiating with Vietnamese government on this. Erex is expanding its renewable energy business in Vietnam and southeast Asia. In addition to co-firing projects, the company aims to operate a total of 19 biomass-fired power plants in Vietnam. The first of these, the 20MW Hau Giang plant, started commercial operations in April. Erex also plans to build up to five biomass-fired power plants in Cambodia. The company projects that profits from Vietnam and Cambodia will account for more than half of its overall earnings by around 2030, from nearly negligible levels in 2024.

Ontario weighs domestic biomass-based diesel quota

New York, 23 June (Argus) — Ontario is considering requiring that domestically produced renewable fuels make up 3pc of the province's diesel pool, an effort to help biodiesel producers struggling to adapt to policy changes in the US. Ontario late last week requested input on a proposal to supplement existing provincial biofuel blend requirements with a new mandate for Canadian production, similar to a domestic content rule that took force in British Columbia this year. Ontario already requires that renewables like biodiesel and renewable diesel make up 4pc of diesel consumption each year, but this proposal would require that three-fourths of that mandated volume come from biofuels produced in Canada. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks says the proposal is in response to a new clean fuel tax credit that took effect in the US this year, which can only be claimed by US producers. A US Department of Agriculture report late last year said that there were six remaining operational biodiesel plants in Canada and that the industry has historically sent almost all its fuel into the US, which up until this year treated foreign biodiesel as eligible for a federal tax credit. At the same time, US biofuels have increasingly entered Canada to meet demand from low-carbon fuel standards federally and in British Columbia. In those programs, higher-carbon fuels that exceed annual carbon intensity limits incur deficits that suppliers must offset with credits generated from approved lower-carbon alternatives. The Canadian biofuel industry has pushed officials to respond. British Columbia as a result began requiring this year that renewables make up a minimum 8pc of diesel fuels supplied in the province, up from 4pc, and that this mandated volume must come from Canadian producers starting in April. British Columbia-based renewable diesel producer Tidewater Renewables has also unsuccessfully pushed Canada to impose duties on US product. The Ontario environment ministry said the domestic mandate, if finalized, would be a ""temporary, time-limited measure"" that would last as long as US subsidies ""threaten Ontario's biodiesel industry."" The new US tax credit that excludes foreign refiners is currently set to lapse after 2027, but Republican lawmakers have floated using a massive budget bill they want to pass in the coming weeks to extend the incentive through 2031. While full regulatory text is not available, as is typical for this early stage of the Ontario rulemaking process, it appears the proposal would otherwise keep intact the general structure of the province's biofuel mandate. The program offers more credit to lower-carbon fuels, which led to a slightly lower than 4pc biofuel blend rate for the diesel pool in 2023, according to a report from trade group Advanced Biofuels Canada. The domestic content proposal would also not affect a separate mandate that biofuels make up increasing amounts of the gasoline pool through 2030.

Commercial aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. Airlines burn fossil fuels at high altitudes with few viable alternatives. The result is over 1.1 billion tonnes of CO₂ emissions per year, a figure projected to rise with global demand. The goal is to reach net zero by 2050.

But what if nature already offered us the solution? Here’s how how hemp can eliminate aviation emissions.

The hemp advantage

Hemp is a fast-growing industrial crop that captures CO₂ from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Its long fibres and woody stalks can be used in construction, biofuels and bioplastics.

Tao Climate focuses on two climate applications of hemp:

Carbon removal

When processed into building materials like hempcrete, the carbon captured by hemp during growth is locked away for decades. Each tonne of hemp can remove around 1.6 tonnes of CO₂ from the atmosphere.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Hemp biomass can be fermented into ethanol and refined into drop-in SAF through the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process. SAF made this way can cut lifecycle emissions by 75 percent compared to fossil jet fuel.

Our model to reach net zero aviation by 2050

We modelled the land and biomass scale-up required for hemp to deliver aviation decarbonisation on a planetary scale. In this scenario, global hemp biomass increases from 300,000 tonnes in 2020 to around 3.9 billion tonnes by 2050. Each year, 20 percent of the biomass is permanently sequestered in infrastructure, while 80 percent is processed into SAF.

Only the correct carbon benefits are counted:

CO₂ removed into hemp used for SAF is not counted, as that carbon is re-emitted in combustion.

CO₂ avoided by SAF is counted, based on lifecycle emissions savings.

CO₂ removed into hempcrete or other long-term use is counted, as that carbon stays locked away.

What the chart shows

This chart illustrates how the total climate impact grows over time, split between CO₂ removal via permanent storage and avoided emissions via SAF. By 2050, the combined impact meets or exceeds 1.1 gigatonnes per year, neutralising aviation’s carbon footprint.

Land area required

At full scale, this model would require about 650 million tonnes of hemp biomass per year stored and 2.6 billion tonnes processed into SAF. Assuming average yields of 6 tonnes per hectare, this translates to approximately 650 million hectares under hemp cultivation globally. While ambitious, this represents less than 5 percent of global agricultural land and is achievable through international cooperation, innovation and the use of marginal lands.

Tao Climate is building this future now

Our AI-powered monitoring platform ensures scientific accuracy and full transparency in how carbon is measured, reported and verified. Our credits support hemp housing reconstruction in Ukraine and our SAF pathway delivers verified emissions reduction potential for the aviation industry.

Contributed by Adam Klauber

Government policy can be instrumental in advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), especially when market forces alone are slow to drive adoption. SAF, which can significantly reduce aviation emissions, currently accounts for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel. Cost, feedstock availability, and infrastructure timelines are major barriers to demand and supply. Many governments around the world are stepping in with policies to accelerate SAF production and adoption.

These SAF policies reflect different governmental systems and priorities. Comparing them can help producers, developers, and investors make decisions for the near term and try to influence future government actions. This chart summarizes some key SAF policies around the world. You’ll find more details below, with some of the most interesting aspects of these policies highlighted.

United Kingdom: Mandates + Revenue Certainty

For a small country, the United Kingdom has a very strong policy, combining incentives — in the form of high credits for carbon reduction — with mandates for SAF reaching 10% of forecasted jet fuel consumption by 2030. This is an ambitious target, given that the UK’s current SAF supply is near zero. The timeline aligns with the time needed to build SAF plants, hopefully encouraging rapid project development.

The UK is especially interesting because it is also developing a revenue certainty model. If airlines can’t afford SAF due to market conditions, the government can provide financial support to cover the price premium. Having a government backstop to cover the price premium of SAF is unique to the UK right now.

The UK is also trying to support new SAF feedstock technologies such as electrofuels by scaling down the percentage of HEFA SAF (the most mature SAF production pathway today) that can be used to meet mandates. The HEFA process can account for 100% of SAF through 2026, after which the allowed share progressively drops to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040. Regardless of production pathway, SAF must meet a 40% carbon reduction threshold compared to fossil jet fuel to qualify under the mandate.

More on UK SAF policy can be found here.

European Union: Blending Mandate + Subsidies

The ReFuelEU blending mandate obligates fuel suppliers to blend increasing amounts of SAF into jet fuel. It started modestly at 2% in 2025 but rises to 34% by 2040 and ultimately 70% by 2050. The EU uses percentage-based blending targets tied to actual fuel usage, which demands detailed data calculations that may make it harder to implement.

Eligible SAF must meet a wide set of feedstock and emissions reduction requirements set out in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). EU SAF must achieve emissions reductions of at least 65% compared to fossil fuel, with carbon intensity values to decrease over time.

The EU recently announced a subsidy program to help airlines afford SAF. They can receive subsidies of up to €6 per liter for electrofuels and €0.5 per liter for biofuels. In addition to offering higher subsidies, EU policy aims to advance newer technologies like electrofuels and alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel with a specific prohibition on recognizing imports of HEFA. But the EU needs to rely on outside supply to reach its targets due to the realities of how much feedstock can be grown or obtained from the region, so the policy may have to allow for Book & Claim contracts to satisfy requirements.

More on EU SAF policy can be found here.

United States: Incentives

The United States bears extra attention due to its status as a leading supplier of SAF and its unique policy profile. Rather than using mandates, the United States relies on tax incentives and voluntary programs to stimulate domestic production of SAF. Although specifics are currently in flux, the 45Z producers tax credit now in place offers up to $1.75 per gallon for SAF, depending on feedstock emissions profiles.

In the United States and elsewhere, Scope 3 customers — typically corporations seeking to reduce Scope 3 aviation emissions — are increasingly entering the SAF market, helping to cover costs and drive demand and investment. With SAF certificate insets, these companies can buy the environmental attributes of SAF and apply them against their aviation emissions, while the fuel itself goes into the supply chain. The Book & Claim chain-of-custody model tracks these transactions and ensures integrity.

Although US policy uncertainty is a challenge at the moment, it’s important to recognize the existing federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) has no expiration. In fact, recent EPA proposals have better aligned RFS obligations and targets with real-world production capacity. That’s a strong signal to producers that some form of market-sensitive government incentive will exist over the duration of their investment. SAF must deliver at least 50% life-cycle GHG reductions to qualify.

Several states also offer SAF incentives. California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is opt-in and voluntary, rewarding low-carbon fuel production with tax credits without mandating the use of specific fuels. States like Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Illinois, and Iowa have also introduced SAF-specific tax benefits.

The US incentive model can avoid economic distortions that sometimes accompany mandates, when the penalty for noncompliance can easily become the price of the product, regardless of what it costs to produce. This can stifle demand and put producers out of business.

In an incentive market, risk comes in times of volatility or high prices, when it can be difficult for customers or producers to manage the costs. But overall, the price of incentive-driven SAF is closer to the real cost of producing it, which is more efficient for buyers.

More on US SAF policy can be found here.

Brazil: Emissions-Based Targets + Book & Claim

Brazil’s Fuel of the Future policy takes a pragmatic approach to aviation decarbonization. First, it focuses on GHG reductions, not SAF volume. Airlines must reduce domestic aviation emissions by 3% by 2030 and 10% by 2037 based on a full life-cycle analysis. This approach incentivizes the use of technologies or feedstocks with lower carbon intensities and the continual improvement of SAF over time.

Second, Brazil is the only country explicitly allowing Book & Claim for SAF. Airlines may be able to meet emissions targets by purchasing SAF attributes tied to fuel used elsewhere. For some period of time, that may be the way they can comply because there isn’t yet commercial SAF supply in Brazil.

India: Mandate

India targets 1% SAF on international flights by 2027, rising to 2% in 2028, with domestic SAF targets expected later. It’s one of the few developing countries with such a policy. India is attracting considerable interest from investors, especially in the alcohol-to-jet and ethanol conversion technologies, which can be supported by an array of local feedstocks, including bamboo and sugarcane. Some SAF production plants are in the pilot or ramp-up stage, including ethanol producer Praj and state-controlled refiner IOC, which has projected 1% SAF production on its own by fall 2025.

However, it’s not yet clear whether the domestic demand from airlines and corporations will be sufficient to cover the price premium. This challenge may lead some SAF producers to sell their physical supply to more developed markets, where there is a higher willingness to pay.

Japan: Preparing for a 2030 Mandate

Japan mandates that refiners replace 10% of fossil jet fuel with SAF by 2030. Though the mandate is not yet in force, preparations to comply are underway. Government subsidies of up to ¥30 per liter ($0.78 per gallon) are available for producers and are already being awarded. Some airlines are signing offtake agreements. And one refinery began delivering SAF domestically in early 2025, although its production volumes are unclear.

More on Japan SAF policy can be found here.

Singapore: Mandate + Passenger Fee

Beginning in 2026, flights departing Singapore must use 1% SAF, ramping to 3%–5% by 2030. The mandate will be supported by a centralized SAF procurement system and a levy on ticket prices, shifting the cost burden from fuel producers to passengers. The levy varies by target volumes of SAF, its cost, and the distance and class of travel.

The policy is intriguing because it allows for the influence of market forces. Money collected from the levy will purchase fuel at competitive prices, which avoids market distortions and shields airlines.

One short-term issue in Asia is limited regional demand, given the delayed mandate timeframe. For example, Singapore currently exports SAF to the UK. A global Book & Claim system could allow SAF certificates to fulfill international mandates without physically transporting fuel — minimizing emissions and costs.

Conclusion: The Need for Long-Term Policy Certainty

Government policies worldwide are providing material support and signaling confidence in future SAF development. This article is by no means an exhaustive list, and additional SAF policies are continually coming into play. But regardless of where SAF programs are enacted, the question of policy certainty stands out.

Giving private investors and entrepreneurs confidence that government frameworks that exist today will exist well into the future is probably the number one way to unlock new supply. Financial institutions ignore short-term policy for capital investment decisions and weigh permanent measures like the US Renewal Fuel Standard most favorably when determining policy risk and commercial viability.

Speaking ahead of the launch of the Climate Change Committee’s 2025 progress report, Prof Piers Forster, the CCC’s interim chair, told journalists it would be “possible” to meet the UK’s 2030 international climate goal, as well as its 2050 target to cut emissions to net-zero.

Moreover, Forster responded to attacks on climate policy from opposition parties, the Conservatives and Reform UK, by saying that reaching net-zero would, “ultimately, be good for the UK economy”.

The CCC’s report points to progress in areas such as windfarm planning rules, plans for clean power by 2030 and the accelerating adoption of clean-energy technologies for heat and transport.

It says that 38% of the emissions cuts needed to hit the UK’s 2030 target are now backed by “credible” policies, up from 25% two years earlier.

However, it says “significant risks” remain – and its top recommendation is for government action to reduce electricity prices, which would support the electrification of heat, transport and industry.

Change of tone

This is the first progress report from the CCC to assess climate policy and action under the new Labour government, which took office in July 2024.

Last year’s edition had said that “urgent action is needed” and that the UK was “not on track” for its 2030 international climate goal, namely, a 68% reduction in emissions relative to 1990 levels.

In contrast, the 2025 report says: “This target is within reach, provided the government stays the course.”

Speaking at a pre-launch press briefing, CCC interim chair Prof Piers Forster said: “[This is] an optimistic report, [showing] that it is possible for the country to meet its climate commitments.”

Moreover, in comments aligned with the shift in language since last year, he said that the report was “more optimistic” than the 2024 edition. Forster explained:

“We are not a political organisation and our job as a committee is just to look at the evidence, but, in terms of looking at the evidence, we are more optimistic than we were this time last year.”

The reasons for this were a mixture of policies from the previous government starting to deliver and the impact of decisions taken by the new administration, he said.

While the tone is relatively optimistic, the latest progress report uses less prescriptive language than previous editions, according to Carbon Brief analysis shown in the figure below.

For example, the word “must” occurs once every 10 pages in this year’s report, down from seven times in 2021. Similarly, the word “should” only occurs four times per 10 pages, down from 13.

This shift in language appears to be a continuation of the approach taken by the committee in its advice on the UK’s seventh “carbon budget”, published in February.

(Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the government has until June 2026 to legislate for this budget, which is a legally binding emissions limit for the five-year period from 2038 to 2042.)

The committee has faced inaccurate criticism from some opponents of climate action, who have argued that it was, in effect, setting government policy.

Pushing back on this, Forster had reiterated in February: “[O]ur core responsibility…is to give…the very best non-partisan advice possible…It’s not up to us to make the policy, it’s up to government.”

Beyond the overall tone of the latest progress report, it also puts a stronger emphasis than last year’s on the need for action to reduce emissions.

It sets out the rationale for the world reaching net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to stop global warming, but also asserts the benefits this would bring to the UK in terms of energy security, a more efficient economy and lower bills:

“[C]ontinued reliance on fossil fuels undermines UK energy security…[A] fossil-fuelled future would leave the UK increasingly dependent on imports, and energy bills would remain subject to volatile fossil fuel prices.”

In language that could be interpreted as pushback against the leader of the opposition, the Conservative’s Kemi Badenoch, who recently falsely claimed that reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 was both “impossible” and only possible “by bankrupting us”, the CCC report states:

“The science is unambiguous. Only by achieving net-zero CO2 emissions, with deep reductions in other greenhouse gases, can the UK stop contributing to an ever-warmer climate…The 2050 net-zero target for the UK remains deliverable and affordable, with whole-economy costs estimated at an annual average of 0.2% of GDP.”

Asked directly if he agreed that the net-zero by 2050 target was “impossible” and would come with “catastrophic” costs – as Badenoch has asserted – Forster said that on the contrary, it was “possible” and would, “ultimately, be good for the UK economy”. He told journalists:

“We think that, provided there is further government policy, it is possible both to reach our [2030 target], our carbon budgets and then, ultimately, get to net-zero…[and that] while the benefit doesn’t come instantly…it will, ultimately, be good for the UK economy.”

The report also makes the point that the UK is far from alone in its efforts, with global investments in clean-energy technologies reaching $2tn last year, double the sum going to fossil fuels. It adds:

“Most of the world is investing heavily in low-carbon technologies, driven by falling costs, energy security concerns and a realisation of the need to respond to rising climate impacts.”

(This is despite the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and a “period of uncertainty” in international relations since the US election, the report notes.)

Overall progress

Last year’s report, published just days after Labour’s “landslide” election victory, had set the scene for the new administration, saying that it needed to “make up lost ground” to get back on track.

That report had called on the new government to “limit the damage” from Conservative climate policy rollbacks, which had been implemented ahead of the election.

This year’s report looks at how things have progressed since then, based on three sets of metrics:

First, it looks at changes to the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions over the past year.

Second, it looks at indicators of progress on the ground, such as the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), the rollout of electric heat pumps and the rate of tree-planting.

Third, it looks at policy changes introduced over the past year by the new government.

The assessment includes policy changes introduced up until 23 May 2025, meaning that it does not consider the June spending review or the industrial strategy published earlier this week.

Greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, with a 50.4% reduction, making the UK “one of the leading economies in the world”, Forster said. The report adds:

“The UK should…be proud of its place among a leading group of economies demonstrating consistent and sustained decarbonisation.”

It says that UK emissions fell again during 2024, with a 2.5% reduction marking the tenth year of steady decline, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent rebound.

Echoing Carbon Brief analysis published in March, the CCC says that the latest drop in emissions was due to the power sector, industry and transport, where EVs are starting to have an impact.

However, the report emphasises once again that progress to date has largely come in the electricity sector, where the UK became the first country in the G7 to phase out coal power in 2024.

Indeed, the CCC says that electricity supply is now only the UK’s sixth-largest source of emissions, after surface transport, buildings, industry, agriculture and aviation, as shown in the figure below.

In order to continue cutting emissions to meet UK climate goals, the CCC says that reductions will be needed across a broader range of sectors, including transport, buildings, industry and land-use.

The pace of emissions cuts outside the power sector – an average of 8m tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) per year since 2008 – is roughly on track for the fourth carbon budget covering 2023-27.

However, the report says this pace will need to “more than double” toward the end of the decade, hitting 19MtCO2e per year, in order to hit the UK’s NDC and sixth carbon budget.

Turning to the indicators of progress on the ground, the CCC says that there are some “clear signs” of such shifts starting to take place, in areas such as transport, buildings and land-use.

For example, the report points to “significant increases” in the rates of heat-pump rollout (up 56% year-on-year in 2024), tree-planting (+59%) and peatland restoration (+47%).

(See the sections below for further detail on policies and progress in each sector.)

Back to top

Policy gaps

Turning to its assessment of government climate policy, the CCC report says there has also been some “positive progress” since Labour came to office last year.

Specifically, it points to the removal of planning barriers for onshore wind and heat pumps, as well as implementation of the “clean heat market mechanism” to drive heat-pump sales, reinstatement of the 2030 combustion car ban and publication of the 2030 clean-power action plan.

As a result, the CCC says that there are now “credible policies” in place to make 38% of the emissions cuts needed to hit the UK’s 2030 target, up from 25% in 2023 and 32% last year.

At the same time, the share of emissions savings subject to policies facing “some” or “significant risks” has fallen from 53% in 2023 and 50% in 2024, down to 43% in the latest report.

These improvements are illustrated in the figure below, which shows that the credibility of UK climate policies towards the 2030 target has been steadily increasing.

Nevertheless, there are still “insufficient plans” to make 14% of the cuts needed by 2030, the same share as last year. The biggest policy gaps are around heat-pump rollout, the report says.

The CCC says: “With 39% of policies and plans needed to hit the 2030 NDC rated as having significant risks, or insufficient or unquantified plans, the government must act swiftly.”

The figure below illustrates the implications of falling to “act swiftly” more clearly.

If only the most “credible” policies actually deliver emissions savings (solid dark blue line) then the UK would miss its international targets for 2030 and 2035 (black circles) by significant margins.

The UK would get somewhat closer to its goals, if emissions cuts are successfully achieved as a result of policies subject to “some” (light blue) or “significant” delivery risks (grey line).

At the pre-launch briefing, Dr Emily Nurse, head of net-zero at the CCC, told journalists that further action was needed to get on track for the 2030 target. She said:

“Around three-fifths of what’s needed is covered by either credible plans or [those] having some risks…The UK can hit its upcoming emissions reduction targets and remain on track for net-zero, but only with further policy action.”

The government has the chance to fill these policy gaps when it publishes its updated “carbon budget delivery plan”, which has a deadline of 29 October this year.

This plan must set out how the government intends to meet the UK’s legally binding climate goals, after the previous administration’s plan was ruled unlawful by the High Court.

While there has been “good or moderate progress” on 20 of the 35 policy recommendations made last year, the CCC says there has been “no progress” on its top recommendation to make electricity cheaper.

The report says this remains its top recommendation for the second year in a row.

The reason for emphasising this, it says, is that electrification of transport, heat and industry will be the key to making required emissions cuts over the next decade, according to the CCC, with these shifts being facilitated by the expansion and continued decarbonisation of the power sector.

CCC chief executive Emma Pinchbeck told journalists that making progress in lowering electricity prices was “absolutely critical”, particularly relative to the price of gas. She said:

“The reason we keep banging on about [this], very simply, [is] that the evidence from every other country that’s had a successful rollout of electric technologies – particularly for heat – is that you need a three-to-one electricity-to-gas price ratio.”

(At present, domestic electricity prices are roughly four times higher than gas prices.)

Pinchbeck reiterated the committee’s call for the government to remove policy “levies” from electricity bills, adding that failing to do so would mean “slowing down” the transition. She said:

“If you’re effectively taxing your future fuel, you’re slowing down your energy transition, when the economy is going to become more and more dependent on electricity…It is just sensible economic policy to have cheap fuel going into your economy.”

While Pinchbeck welcomed plans in the government’s just-published industrial strategy to cut levies on industrial electricity bills, she said that it should do the same for households.

Road transport

Road-transport emissions fell for a second consecutive year in 2024, says the report.

The number of electric vehicles (EVs) on UK roads is roughly doubling every two years.

If this trend continues, the road-transport sector will produce the emissions savings required for its contribution to the UK’s 2030 climate target, the CCC says (see below).

EVs made up 19.6% of new car sales in 2024, compared to 16.1% the previous year, according to the report. In the first quarter of 2025, this figure rose to 20.7%.

This represents “strong growth”, but is below the headline targets of the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, a government regulation that requires car manufacturers to sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission vehicles each year, the CCC says.

The mandate targets a 22% market share for 2024 and a 28% share for 2025, according to the CCC.

The CCC notes that lower-cost EVs are becoming increasingly available. It adds that “price parity with petrol cars has already been reached in parts of the second-hand market”, with this milestone set to arrive for new cars by between 2026 and 2028.

Overall, there has been a “small improvement” in the UK’s policy efforts to decarbonise road transport since last year’s report, it says.

This is largely down to Labour’s decision to reinstate a 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, which was weakened to 2035 under Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak, explains the report.

The CCC describes the move as a “welcome market signal to accelerate the transition to EVs”.

As well as reinstating the 2030 ban, the government announced changes to the ZEV mandate.

The government essentially weakened the mandate by extending flexibilities and allowing the sale of hybrid vehicles between 2030 and 2035.

Ministers said this move was in response to import tariffs announced by Donald Trump.

The CCC says the changes “risk allowing existing planned plugin hybrid vehicle sales to slightly reduce the emissions savings from EVs”, adding:

“It is also possible that manufacturers could divert investment towards [hybrids], diluting the consumer offer for EVs – we currently think that this risk is minimal due to progress in scaling up the EV market to date, but it is something that we will monitor closely.”

It adds that “for the transition to accelerate, further reductions in the cost of purchasing EVs, as well as improved access to, and reduced costs of, local public charging, are needed”.

Buildings

Heat pump installations increased by 56% in 2024 compared to the year before, the report says. Some 98,000 heat pumps were installed.

A total of 23,000 heat pumps were installed under the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which allows homeowners to claim grants for replacing fossil-fuel boilers. This is an increase of 83% on 2023 levels, says the CCC.

However, the speed at which heat pumps are rolled out remains one of the “biggest risks” to the UK meeting its 2030 climate target, it adds.

The UK’s heat pump market share is around 4%, much lower than comparable countries, such as Ireland (30%) and the Netherlands (31%), the CCC says.

The government has taken steps to “remove planning barriers” for heat pumps. This includes amending the planning policy in England to remove the requirement for planning permission for heat pumps located less than 1m from a property boundary.

However, the government has “not yet provided clarity on whether [it] will continue with the proposed phase-out of new fossil fuel boiler installations from 2035”, or “make alternative plans to ensure that low-carbon heating reaches the installation rates required”, the CCC says.

The report adds that the ratio of residential electricity to gas prices is “significantly off track”.

The ratio is important because it underpins the “underlying cost savings of switching to electric technologies are reflected in the bills paid by households and businesses”, the CCC says, continuing:

“Action has not been taken to remove policy costs from electricity prices which would address this, despite it being our first recommendation last year…Currently, a typical household with a heat pump is paying around £490 per year in policy costs, which inflate their bills above the underlying cost of the additional electricity used.”

Data from other nations suggests that the “market share of heat pump installations are correlated with more favourable electricity-to-gas price ratios”, says the CCC (see chart below).

Forster told the press briefing that the CCC’s “biggest recommendation” to government remains reducing the price of electricity in relation to gas:

“By far the most important recommendation we have for the government is to reduce the cost of electricity, both for households and for businesses and industry as well…If we want the country to benefit from the transition to electrification, we have to see it reflected in utility bills.”

The report adds that, on efforts to increase the energy efficiency of residential buildings, the “proportion of homes with insulated cavity walls has steadily increased over recent years, but this will need to accelerate later in the decade” to be in line with net-zero.

Back to top

Industry

Industry emissions decreased by 4.7MtCO2e in 2024, compared to the year before, the CCC says. Emissions are now 48% lower than 2008 levels.

From 2023-24, annual emissions dropped quickly due to the removal of blast furnaces at Port Talbot steelworks in 2024. They are due to be replaced by electric arc furnaces by 2027, with the move leading to 2,500 job losses.

The government should have developed a “more proactive and decisive transition plan” for Port Talbot and the report describes the UK’s upcoming steel strategy as “an opportunity to set out plans for the low-carbon transition at Scunthorpe steelworks and other UK steel production”.

To deliver the emissions savings needed to meet the UK’s 2030 climate goal, companies will “increasingly need to switch to electric alternatives to fossil-fuelled technology”, the report says, adding:

“A high ratio of [industrial] electricity-to-gas prices currently presents a barrier to this.”

It adds that, currently, “there is now no major source of government support for manufacturers to invest in electrification”.

The CCC notes that the government did not launch the latest round of the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund, which was due in December 2024. It has “not clarified whether this or similar funding will continue”.

On 23 June, the UK government announced a 10-year industrial strategy, including measures to slash the price of electricity for energy-intensive businesses from 2027 by exempting them from green levies.

In the press briefing, Pinchbeck described the move as “good”, but urged the government to introduce similar measures for household electricity bills, too. (See: Buildings.)

On efforts to introduce carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to UK industries, the report says progress “is not on track to be deployed at the pace required” by government plans to reach net-zero.

Back to top

Fossil fuels and hydrogen

The report says that the UK’s “continued reliance on fossil fuels undermines energy security”, continuing:

“Household energy bills rose sharply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and have remained high since. It is the price of gas that has driven up both gas and electricity bills.”

(See Carbon Brief’s factcheck on what is causing high electricity bills in the UK.)

The report does not directly address the Labour government’s policies on oil and gas production in the North Sea.

Labour has ruled out new oil and gas licences. However, the government has indicated it might approve new projects that already have a licence, if they can pass a new environmental impact assessment that will consider the emissions from burning the oil and gas produced.

In regards to the North Sea, the report says:

“With North Sea resources largely used up, a fossil-fuelled future would leave the UK increasingly dependent on imports and energy bills would remain subject to volatile fossil fuel prices.”

The CCC adds that the “main progress in the fuel-supply sector in the past year has been around low-carbon hydrogen production”.

In the 2024 autumn budget, the government confirmed support for 11 “electrolytic”

hydrogen production projects, which are expected to start operating by the end of 2026. (These projects use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.)

Back to top

Electricity

The UK’s transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy in its electricity supply continued to drive the bulk of emissions reductions in 2024, the CCC says. It accounted for 41% of the total in-year reduction in emissions.

From the 1990s until 2024, the power sector has transformed from the largest source of emissions to only the sixth largest, behind aviation. (See: Overall progress.)

The UK’s last coal-fired power plant, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, closed in October 2024. (See Carbon Brief’s detailed explainer on how the UK became the first G7 nation to phase out coal.)

Coal emissions from electricity generation were 99% lower in 2024 than in 2008 and will reach zero in 2025, the CCC says. It describes this as a “major milestone on the UK’s path to a decarbonised power system”.

Falling gas generation accounted for 72% of emissions reductions in the power sector in 2024, the CCC says.

The electricity supplied by gas fell by 15% in 2024, compared to the previous year. This was “made up with roughly equal proportions of imports and low-carbon generation”.

The rollout of wind and solar capacity in 2024 was larger than in any of the previous six years, the report says.

But to achieve the government’s goal of “clean power” by 2030, total renewable capacity will need to more than double.

Based on projects in the pipeline, both offshore and onshore wind “appear on track” for the government’s goal, according to the CCC.

However, “roll-out of solar is significantly off track and will need to improve to deliver its contribution to a decarbonised electricity system”.

The report says that, overall, “positive policy progress has been made in decarbonising electricity supply over the past year”.

It continues that “concrete steps have been made to remove barriers and support the deployment of low-carbon technology”.

These steps include removing barriers facing onshore wind developments, “streamlin[ing]” the approval of nationally significant infrastructure, including renewable projects and introducing reforms to speed up connecting projects to the grid.

However, the CCC adds that there are “remaining uncertainties on the future electricity market arrangements and further challenges to deploying infrastructure to overcome”.

Back to top

Agriculture and land

There was a “significant increase” in both tree-planting and peatland restoration in 2024, the report says.

Some 20,700 hectares of new trees were planted, an increase of 59% on the year before and the highest rate in 20 years, it adds, as shown in the chart below.

Over the same period, the restoration of peatlands increased by 47%.

This “demonstrates that a rapid increase in rates is feasible” for the land-use sector, the CCC says.

However, woodland creation remains “slightly off track”. (Carbon Brief reported last year that successive UK governments have fallen so far short of their tree-planting targets since 2020 that they have failed to plant an area of forest nearly equivalent to the size of Birmingham.)

In addition, Scotland accounted for 73% of the total trees planted from 2023-24 and the CCC has “concerns that recent reductions in funding for woodland creation in Scotland could reverse this trend”.

A target to have 35,000 hectares of peat under restoration in England by 2025 is also “expected to be missed”.

Livestock numbers continued to fall in 2024, the report says.

Meat eating has declined steeply over the past couple of years. The average amount of meat eaten per person each week dropped by around 100g from 2020-22, according to CCC data.

Pinchbeck told the press briefing that meat-eating in the UK is now lower than what the CCC had anticipated in its central pathway for meeting net-zero:

“There’s lots of factors behind that, including the cost of living crisis. So we are not necessarily saying that trend will increase. Farming is facing a number of pressures, outside having to deal with a changing climate, reduced crop yields [and] difficulty making farms sustainable.”

Both the reduction in livestock and meat eating are “key to freeing up land required to increase tree-planting and peatland restoration”, the report says.

The government’s progress on addressing land-use sector emissions with policies has been “mixed” over the past year, according to the CCC.

The government is expected to produce a long-awaited land-use framework by the end of this year, but it “remains unclear how this framework will drive change on the ground”, the advisers say.

The government paused the sustainable farming incentive, part of the environmental land management (ELM) schemes, in March 2025.

This was due to all of the funding being allocated, which is “positive”, says the CCC. However, the decision has left a “gap in delivery grants for on-farm actions”.

The Nature for Climate Fund has been extended by one year, but is “unclear” what will happen to this scheme in the long term, it adds.

Back to top

Aviation and shipping

Emissions in the aviation sector increased by 9% year-on-year in 2024, “marking a return to pre-pandemic levels”, the report says.

In government and CCC scenarios for net-zero, emissions stay flat and start slowly decreasing over the rest of the decade, the report says, adding:

“Aviation emissions will likely exceed the trajectories assumed in all [these] pathways if they continue to increase, posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets.”

The biggest driver of aviation emissions since 1990 has been “rising demand for international flights, particularly leisure”, it continues.

Aviation now causes more emissions than the UK’s entire power grid. In 1990, aviation emissions were 10 times lower than those from electricity, according to the report.

The CCC “recommends that the government should develop and implement policy that ensures the aviation sector takes responsibility for mitigating its emissions and, ultimately, achieving net-zero”, adding:

“This includes paying for permanent engineered removals to balance out all remaining emissions. Robust contingencies should also be in place to address any delays in decarbonisation, including through managing the forecasted increase in aviation demand.”

The share of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a proportion of all jet fuel rose from 0.7% to 2.1% from 2023-24, the CCC says.

It notes that the SAF mandate came into force in January 2025 and the sustainable aviation fuel bill was introduced to parliament in May.

Achieving the government’s target of 10% of jet fuel from SAF by 2030 “remains uncertain as different types of SAF will need to scale up”, it adds.

There are currently no operational UK SAF plants, but some are under construction.

On shipping, the report notes that the UK has set out a maritime decarbonisation strategy, with an aim to reduce the domestic maritime sector’s fuel lifecycle emissions to zero by 2050 and interim goals of cutting pollution by 30% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, compared to 2008.

The targets are “broadly aligned” with government plans for net-zero, the CCC says.

Back to top

Other sectors

Another sector tracked by the CCC is “engineered removals”, technologies that suck CO2 out of the atmosphere.

Aside from small experiments, there is no deployment of such technologies in the UK. However, the government’s pathway for net-zero expects such methods to remove 6MtCO2e from the atmosphere by 2030, the report says, adding:

“This sector will need to develop and scale up notably over the coming five years.”

One of the CCC’s “top 10” priority actions is for the government to “finalise business models for large-scale deployment of engineered removals”.

On this, the advisers say:

“There has been little progress…This puts the contribution of engineered removals to the UK’s 2030 NDC at increasing risk.”

Another issue assessed by the CCC is waste, which produced 26.7MtCO2e in 2024, making it the eighth most polluting sector.

The report says there has been “some progress” on waste policy, but notes the government is “yet to confirm its intention to prevent biodegradable waste from going to landfill, a key measure to reduce emissions from waste”.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/3BJ19MA.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 21:00:22.095109

GTA chief executive officer Pat O’Shannassy said the program has been designed to provide grain market participants and service providers with the latest insights into developments locally and globally.

“We’ve lined up speakers from a diverse range of backgrounds that highlight the scope ofmarkets AGIC delegates work across in these changing times,” Mr O’Shannassy said.

Global market insights will come from US-based analyst Emily French, who started with Cargill in 1996 before joining the US Grains Council and then World Perspectives, and in investment banking in the US and Australia, prior to founding Global Ag Protein.

Speaking about global trade impacts and facilitating trade is UK-based Grain and Feed Trade Association director general and Federation of Commodity Associations chair Jaine Chisholm Caunt.

“Both these speakers are leaders in their field, and as we come to terms with global unrest that is changing our trading environment, their insights will be invaluable.”

As always, domestic markets and their interface with international pricing are prominent in the AGIC program, and will look at everything from bread, courtesy of Bakers Delights founders Lesley and Roger Gillespie, to sustainable aviation fuel in the remit of Neste general manager James Williamson.

“Every tonne of grain processed locally, whether it’s for human consumption, feed, or biofuels, can add value to Australian economy.”

“To dive into what we are doing currently, and further opportunities that exist, our value-adding panel has a representative from each sector.”

Joining Mr Williamson on that panel will be Mauri head of commodity Michael Schmidt and Patrick Hutchinson, who has vast experience in the meat industry and is now principal of Gibraltar Strategic Advisory.

The latest on the Australian market, including the impact of drought in south-eastern Australia, will be covered by a panel facilitated by Mauri commodity price-risk manager Erin Burns, and comprising Louis Dreyfus Company Australia senior commodity trader pulses Simone Dax, Riordan Grains chief commercial officer Mark Lewis, and Cargill Australia trading manager Sam Napier.

Delegates are invited to register for AGIC at the early-bird rate by July 4, and growers have a subsidised rate available to them thanks to the Grains Research and Development Corporation.

Of particular interest to the grower and others in the supply chain will be the panel looking at how growers are driving forward and sowing success.It will canvass the views and experiences of CBH Board chair Simon Stead, South Bunarba Agriculture general manager Sam Heagney, Mungindi, and Kate Gunn, who farms in her family’s Merrivale partnership on the Liverpool Plains, and chairs commercial and research organisation AMPS Agribusiness.

Two former federal politicians, Simon Birmingham and Warren Entsch, will also be taking the stage.

Now ANZ Banking Group’s head of Asia Pacific engagement and chair, South Australia, Mr Birmingham will touch on topics including trade policy, government finance, international relations, and regulated environments.

Expect Mr Entsch’s topics, under the heading of From Crocodiles to Cairns to Canberra, to be a little more free-wheeling, and enlightened by his 25 years representing Far North Queensland’s Leichhardt electorate.

However, this growth comes with significant environmental costs, including greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. To mitigate these impacts, the industry is turning to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as a key solution. In this article, we will explore the role of SAF in minimizing the environmental impact of air travel and the steps being taken to increase their adoption.

Production and Types of Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Sustainable aviation fuels are made from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste materials, or synthetic fuels produced using renewable energy. The production process for SAF involves several steps, including feedstock collection, conversion, and refining.

Overview of SAF Production Processes

There are several production pathways for SAF, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common pathways include:

Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis: This process involves converting biomass or waste materials into a synthetic gas, which is then converted into a liquid fuel using the FT process.

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA): This process involves converting vegetable oils or animal fats into a hydrocarbon fuel through hydroprocessing.

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ): This process involves converting alcohols, such as ethanol or butanol, into a jet fuel using a catalytic conversion process.

The following flowchart illustrates the different SAF production pathways:

Feedstock Collection

Conversion

Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids

Alcohol-to-Jet

Refining

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Types of Feedstocks Used in SAF Production

The feedstocks used in SAF production can vary widely, depending on the production pathway. Some common feedstocks include:

Biomass: Agricultural waste, forestry residues, and algae are all potential biomass feedstocks.

Waste materials: Municipal solid waste, waste cooking oil, and other waste materials can be used to produce SAF.

Synthetic fuels: Fuels produced using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, can be used to produce SAF.

Comparison of Different SAF Production Pathways

Each SAF production pathway has its own advantages and disadvantages, including differences in cost, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions. The following table compares the different pathways:

Production Pathway Feedstock Energy Efficiency Greenhouse Gas Emissions Fischer-Tropsch Biomass or waste 40-60% 50-80% reduction HEFA Vegetable oils or animal fats 80-90% 50-80% reduction ATJ Alcohols 60-80% 50-80% reduction

Benefits and Challenges of SAF Implementation

The adoption of SAF has several benefits, including reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, there are also challenges associated with scaling up SAF production.

Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions

SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fossil fuels. This is because SAF is made from renewable resources, which absorb CO2 during their growth cycle. The following equation illustrates the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions:

GHG reduction=GHG emissions (fossil fuel)−GHG emissions (SAF)GHG emissions (fossil fuel)×100 \text{GHG reduction} = \frac{\text{GHG emissions (fossil fuel)} - \text{GHG emissions (SAF)}}{\text{GHG emissions (fossil fuel)}} \times 100 GHG reduction=GHG emissions (fossil fuel)GHG emissions (fossil fuel)−GHG emissions (SAF)​×100

For example, a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that SAF produced using the FT pathway can reduce GHG emissions by up to 75% compared to traditional fossil fuels 1.

Air Quality Improvements

SAF can also improve air quality by reducing emissions of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide. A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that SAF produced using the HEFA pathway can reduce particulate matter emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional fossil fuels 2.

Challenges in Scaling Up SAF Production

Despite the benefits of SAF, there are several challenges associated with scaling up production. These include:

High production costs: SAF is currently more expensive than traditional fossil fuels, making it challenging to compete in the market.

Limited availability of feedstocks: The availability of feedstocks, such as biomass or waste materials, can be limited in certain regions.

Infrastructure constraints: The existing infrastructure for fuel production and distribution may not be suitable for SAF.

The following mind map illustrates the challenges associated with scaling up SAF production:

Challenges in Scaling Up SAF Production

High Production Costs

Limited Availability of Feedstocks

Infrastructure Constraints

Economies of Scale

Feedstock Diversification

Infrastructure Investment

Policy and Regulatory Frameworks for SAF Adoption

To support the adoption of SAF, governments and regulatory bodies are implementing policies and regulations. These include:

Existing Policies and Regulations Supporting SAF Adoption

Renewable Fuel Standard: The Renewable Fuel Standard in the United States requires airlines to use a certain percentage of renewable fuels, including SAF.

EU Renewable Energy Directive: The EU Renewable Energy Directive sets a target for the use of renewable energy in transportation, including aviation.

Incentives for SAF Production and Use

To encourage the production and use of SAF, governments are offering incentives, such as:

Tax credits: Tax credits can help reduce the production costs of SAF.

Grants and funding: Governments are providing grants and funding for SAF production projects.

Low-interest loans: Low-interest loans can help reduce the financial risks associated with SAF production.

Future Directions for SAF Policy and Regulation

As the demand for SAF continues to grow, governments and regulatory bodies will need to continue to evolve their policies and regulations to support the industry. This may include:

Setting SAF-specific targets: Governments can set targets for the use of SAF in aviation.

Developing SAF standards: Regulatory bodies can develop standards for SAF production and use.

Increasing funding for SAF research and development: Governments can provide funding for research and development in SAF production and use.

Conclusion

Sustainable aviation fuels have the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of air travel. While there are challenges associated with scaling up SAF production, governments and regulatory bodies are implementing policies and regulations to support the industry. As the demand for SAF continues to grow, it is likely that the industry will continue to evolve and improve.

In the past six months, only one SAF project globally reached the stage of final investment decision (FID).
But with fewer than 15 SAF projects globally reaching FID each year, the pace is well below what’s needed.
With government support and the right policies, the region could become a leader in the global aviation fuel market.
But success will require moving beyond pilot projects and setting up the financial, legal, and commercial foundations needed to turn plans into large-scale fuel production.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), long seen as aviation’s best path to cutting emissions, is beginning to take shape globally. As of June 2025, the Mission Possible Partnership’s Global Project Tracker reports 22 SAF plants in operation and a pipeline of 144 more projects. This puts aviation ahead of many sectors in the shift to cleaner industrial practices, with the industry accounting for one-fifth of all clean industrial project announcements worldwide, reports Aviation Business.

Despite this growth in planned projects, actual development is lagging. In the past six months, only one SAF project globally reached the stage of final investment decision (FID). To meet global climate goals, the pace of SAF production needs to rise sharply.

Governments are beginning to push the transition. Europe has introduced binding targets through its ReFuelEU policy, requiring 2% SAF blending by 2025 and 6% by 2030. In the U.S., a mix of national and state-level programs—including tax breaks and funding for research—has started to boost interest. Still, progress is slow. Of the 144 projects on record, just seven have reached FID. Many others face difficulties such as high feedstock costs and trouble securing long-term buyers.

Currently, most SAF is made from bio-based sources like used cooking oil and plant fats (a process known as HEFA). However, more advanced synthetic fuels made using renewable electricity and green hydrogen remain too costly for large-scale use.

Amid these global challenges, the Middle East and North Africa region is emerging as a promising new hub for SAF production. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and Egypt are investing heavily in green hydrogen, a key ingredient for synthetic SAF. With strong solar energy potential, existing infrastructure, and strategies aimed at international exports, these countries are well placed to support future fuel demand.

However, several challenges remain. While these countries have the resources to lead, national SAF policies are still underdeveloped, and there is little domestic demand to support early production. Without clear rules or incentives for airlines, large-scale plants may be hard to justify unless strong export contracts are secured. This uncertainty has already led to delays and cancellations of SAF projects elsewhere.

Even so, the potential impact of these efforts is significant. If all current SAF projects are completed, they could produce up to 48 million tonnes of fuel per year—more than enough to cover all expected EU airport fuel needs by 2030. But with fewer than 15 SAF projects globally reaching FID each year, the pace is well below what’s needed.

For the Middle East, the next five years are crucial. With government support and the right policies, the region could become a leader in the global aviation fuel market. But success will require moving beyond pilot projects and setting up the financial, legal, and commercial foundations needed to turn plans into large-scale fuel production.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-15.png,N,,2025-06-24 18:07:28.698251

“Fred Smith changed the world with his creation of the cargo airline industry, but he always credited business aviation with helping make FedEx the company it is today,” NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen said.

Bolen continued, “NBAA is proud that FedEx has been a member company since 1983, because the company has continually represented the values and professionalism NBAA has promoted since its inception.”

FedEx began its operations utilizing Dassault Falcon 20 aircraft, one of which is today displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia. Over time, FedEx operated the world’s largest fleet of Cessna Caravans.

In 2012, NBAA recognized Smith with its Al Ueltschi Humanitarian Award for his contributions to the international nonprofit ORBIS, which operates a “Flying Eye Hospital” and training center credited with restoring sight to more than 23 million individuals around the world.

Smith, a prominent spokesperson for NBAA’s No Plane No Gain program highlighting business aviation’s value, was featured in the advocacy campaign’s Business Leaders on Business Aviation publication.

A statement he made for the publication, which today is proudly displayed in the lobby of the company’s Memphis, TN headquarters reads:

“Business aviation has been an integral part of FedEx’s success since the day we were founded. The military calls it a ‘force multiplier,’ and that’s what business aircraft have been for FedEx. They’ve given us the capability to fight above our weight, and with the enormous global network we have in place today, they allow our people to move around the world in a much more efficient and productive fashion than would have been the case had we not operated with business aircraf”

Smith, a proponent for all forms of innovation in the aviation sector, was an early advocate for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In a March 2021 hearing of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Smith highlighted the work of FedEx with “industry, government agencies, academia and alternative fuel suppliers” to pursue the production and use of the fuel.

Smith also joined the U.S. Marines and served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War. He was also a philanthropist whose work and donations reflected his passion for aviation and the military.

THE International Air Transport Association (IATA) emphasises India’s potential for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to help mitigate carbon emissions, reports New Delhi’s Economic Times.

The organisation, with support from stakeholders such as Hemant Mistry, plans to launch the SAF Registry in 2025.

Amid rising air travel, IATA highlighted on Sunday that India has substantial capacity to produce SAF, which can significantly reduce carbon emissions.

In 2023, SAF production in India was around 0.5 million tonnes, but this needs to increase significantly by 2050.

The SAF Registry, set to be established by IATA, aims to boost the adoption of SAF by accurately tracking and reporting emissions reductions from its use.

Little to no ethanol will qualify for US aviation fuel credit

LITTLE to no ethanol will qualify for US sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) subsidies under a new pilot programme by President Joe Biden’s administration, which recently tightened climate requirements, reports Reuters.

This development could negatively impact the biofuel industry, which views SAF as ethanol’s most promising growth opportunity, especially as electric cars reduce its demand as a gasoline additive.

It could also impede Biden’s goal of producing 30 billion gallons of SAF by 2030, despite his earlier promise that 95 per cent of SAF – a biofuel that can be made from oils, waste, or grains-would come from farmers.

The specifics of how little ethanol will qualify for the subsidies under the pilot programme and the last-minute increase in requirements have not been previously reported.

Central to the issue is a US$1.25/gallon production tax credit included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, designated for SAF that achieves a 50 per cent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Why aviation chiefs fear net zero could cripple air travel

WHEN airlines committed to reducing carbon emissions in 2021, executives were confident that, having survived Covid crisis, they could also navigate the energy transition, reports London’s Daily Telegraph.

However, three years later, concerns are mounting among industry leaders.

Progress towards the goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 has been sluggish, with the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) falling significantly short of the required levels.

Last year, Virgin Atlantic conducted the world’s first 100 per cent SAF-powered flight across the Atlantic to showcase the fuel’s potential.

Despite this Virgin vice president Holly Boyd-Boland stated that as things stand, there is not going to be enough SAF to meet their goal of Net Zero 2050.

The scarcity of SAF and potential solutions will be key topics at IATA’s annual meeting in Dubai.

The event will gather hundreds of airline executives, as well as representatives from Airbus, Boeing, and other manufacturers.

Currently, SAF – a refined blend of waste oils, animal fats, and corn-derived ethanol-accounts for just 0.2 per cent of jet fuel use. UK carriers are mandated to increase this to ten per cent by the end of the decade to meet government requirements.

Rollins’ announcement rescinding the 2001 Roadless Rule, elected leaders and industry stakeholders praised the move.

Agriculture and Government Leaders Applaud USDA’s Rescission of the Roadless Rule

Governor Spencer Cox (UT): “I sincerely thank Secretary Rollins for taking this commonsense step. Utahns love our forests—they’re essential to our water and air quality, wildlife, outdoor recreation, economy, and way of life. But for more than two decades, the Roadless Rule has blocked us from responsibly accessing and managing over four million acres of forest. It’s prevented us from removing dead and dying timber, fueling catastrophic wildfires across our state. Ending this rule is a critical step toward healthier forests and safer communities.”

Governor Mike Dunleavy (AK): “This is another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development. Thank you POTUS and Secretary Rollins for continuing to roll back unnecessary regulations that stifle economic activity and send opportunity overseas.”

Governor Greg Gianforte (MT): “Under this outdated rule, nearly 58% of forest service land in Montana was restricted from road development and unable to be properly managed for fire risk. Thank you, Secretary Rollins and President Trump, for restoring common sense to active forest management.”

Senator Dan Sullivan (AK): “I welcome the decision by Secretary Rollins and President Trump to rescind the Roadless Rule and allow for proper management of US Forest System lands in Alaska. Since 2001, this rule has hindered Alaskans' ability to responsibly harvest timber, develop minerals, connect communities, or build energy projects at lower costs — including renewable energy projects like hydropower, which are especially critical to economic opportunities in Southeast Alaska surrounded by the Tongass National Forest. I am grateful that the Trump administration has once again rescinded this rule to put Alaskans back in the driver’s seat to make a living, support our families, and connect our communities while protecting our lands and growing our economy.”

Senator Steve Daines (MT): “Huge win for Montana, forest management, and wildfire mitigation. Thanks to the Trump administration and USDA for being committed to Montana-First priorities.”

Senator John Barrasso (WY): “Thank you Sec. Rollins for rescinding the 2001 Roadless Rule. For years, this overreaching regulation made it harder to treat our national forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires. Eliminating this misguided rule paves the way for the Forest Service to responsibly and proactively manage our forests for the better.”

Senator Cynthia Lummis (WY): “I applaud Sec. Rollins' move to restore commonsense resource management and remove prohibitions on road construction, reconstruction, and timber harvest, allowing for fire prevention and responsible timber production.”

House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (AR): ""This week's decision by Secretary Rollins is a massive win for restoring the health and resiliency of our federal forests, preventing catastrophic wildfire, and restoring access for the public and wildland firefighters. It acknowledges that we cannot lock up our forests and throw away the key – we need to actively manage and conserve our forests for cleaner air and water, better wildlife habitat, and safer communities. I thank Secretary Rollins and the Trump administration for repealing burdensome, overreaching federal regulations like this one.""

Representative Harriet Hageman (WY): “I commend Sec. Rollins and POTUS for taking decisive action to repeal the 2001 Roadless Rule. This outdated policy has long hindered effective forest management. I look forward to working with the USDA and local stakeholders to ensure our forests are managed responsibly, creating jobs, and preserving the resources that are vital to our way of life.”

Representative Pete Stauber (MN): “I applaud Sec. Rollins for rescinding the 2001 Roadless Rule, a harmful regulation that blocked responsible forest management and timber production, increasing the risk of catastrophic wildfires. This decision marks a significant victory for MN and for communities across the nation!”

Representative Doug LaMalfa (CA): “The Forest Service is finally beginning the process to repeal the 2001 Roadless Rule—a policy that’s done more harm than good in the West. As Secretary Rollins made clear, the rule has blocked responsible forest management for over two decades, preventing thinning, logging, and the ability to build roads that are critical for wildfire response and public safety. This was a Clinton-era regulation pushed through in the final days of that administration, backed by environmental activists with no stake in what actually happens on the ground. The result was more overgrown forests, more catastrophic wildfires, and fewer jobs in rural counties that rely on active forest work to sustain their economies. Repealing the Roadless Rule won’t fix everything overnight, but it’s a major step toward restoring common-sense forest management and giving local experts the ability to do their jobs.”

Representative Nick Begich (AK): “Today’s decision by the USDA to rescind the deeply flawed and outdated Roadless Rule is yet another a major victory for Alaska. Alaska’s forests are one of our state’s greatest natural assets and the 'Roadless Rule' has long stifled responsible forest management, blocked access to critical resources, and halted economic opportunity particularly in Alaska, where 92% of the Tongass National Forest was off-limits. The Roadless Rule was never about responsible conservation; it was about bureaucratic overreach that undermined the ability of local forest managers and communities to effectively manage their lands. I commend Secretary Rollins and President Trump for their leadership in advancing this commonsense reform. By removing these blanket prohibitions, the Administration is restoring the authority of local leaders to manage our forests correctly.”

Representative Ryan Zinke (MT): “The rescission of the outdated Roadless Rule is a victory for Montana, public lands, and forest management everywhere. As I've long maintained, one of the biggest obstacles to proper forest management and wildfire prevention has been unnecessary and overbearing regulations like this one. If you can't build a road, you can't fight fires, you can't cut trees, and you can't properly take care of our national heritage held in our public lands. I applaud the President and Secretary Rollins for their initiative to allow real and needed work to be done on our national forest land.”

Representative Troy Downing (MT): “Long overdue! The USDA's move to rescind the Roadless Rule is a critical step toward responsible forest management that will help reduce wildfire risk, protect watersheds, and support rural economies.”

Representative Eli Crane (AZ): “Smart. Thank you, Sec. Rollins!”

Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz: “The forests we see today are not the same as the forests of 2001. They are dangerously overstocked and increasingly threatened by drought, insect-born disease, and wildfire. Currently, nearly half of our roadless acres – over 28 million – are at high or very high risk of catastrophic wildfire and are in desperate need of treatment. I applaud Secretary Rollins for taking decisive action to provide us with the tools and decision space we need to truly care for our forests and, in turn, protect the people and communities we serve.”

American Forest Resource Council: “The Clinton-era Roadless Rule is a relic of the past—a 25-year-old policy that has failed to protect our forests and communities from the growing threats of wildfire, insects, disease, and climate change. Since the rule was imposed, an estimated 36 million acres of National Forest System lands have burned. It’s important to remember: the Roadless Rule is a rule, not a law passed or ratified by Congress, despite a quarter-century to do so. It has often undermined Congress’s intent to actively manage federal forests and reduce risks to public lands and nearby communities. Rescinding the rule does not upend environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act or the Endangered Species Act. While we are closely reviewing the details of this proposed recission, we are supportive of reforms that modernize stewardship and give public land managers the tools they need to implement their forest plans and restore the health and resilience of these forests before we lose more of them.”

Scott Jones, CEO, Forest Landowners Association: ""The Forest Landowners Association (FLA) applauds Secretary Rollins and the Trump Administration for rescinding the Roadless Rule—an important step in eliminating regulatory barriers that hinder forest management on public lands. This action will help reduce wildfire risk and promote healthier, more resilient forests through active, science-based management. We look forward to working with Secretary Rollins to advance policies that strengthen forest markets and keep working forests productive across all ownerships. Improved management on our national forests—many of which border private lands—will reduce the spread of pests, disease, and catastrophic fire, benefitting forests nationwide. FLA remains committed to partnering with the Trump Administration to ensure family forest owners have the certainty they need through enhanced disaster recovery tools and access to emerging markets, including woody biomass, mass timber, and sustainable aviation fuel. Together, we can sustain America’s forest legacy and strengthen the nation’s wood supply for generations to come.”

American Forest Resource Council: “Yesterday Sec. Rollins announced the rescission of the 'Roadless Rule,' a de-facto prohibition on road construction, reconstruction, and timber harvest on nearly 59 million acres of the National Forest System. We welcome urgent action to address the nation's wildfire crisis.”

American Stewards of Liberty: “The roadless rule has strangled the West. No more. Thank you Sec. Rollins.”

Resource Development Council for Alaska: “Good news coming out of the USDA today regarding rescinding the 2001 Roadless Rule!”

The gross export potential could range from $4 billion to $8 billion annually,"" Wagner added.
While Indonesia's domestic market has yet to support premium pricing for renewable fuels, international mechanisms provide strong incentives.
“The question is, how Indonesia can build production facilities to profit from these incentives elsewhere with sustainable production in Indonesia,” Wagner said.
Earlier this month, Indonesia and Singapore signed several memorandums of understanding on cross-border renewable energy trade and sustainable industrial zones in the Riau Islands.","Jakarta. Indonesia has the potential to generate up to $8 billion in annual export revenue from low-carbon fuels, leveraging its vast natural resources and strategic location, according to an energy expert speaking at the Jakarta Geopolitical Forum on Tuesday.

Thomas Wagner, head of the Energy Working Group at the European Business Chamber of Commerce (Eurocham) in Indonesia, said the country should begin developing its low-carbon fuel capacity now -- rather than waiting for ideal market prices or political conditions -- as the opportunity lies in growing global demand and regulatory incentives.

""Renewable resources are not limited, so there is no reason to wait until it gets the right price or the right political situation,"" Wagner said during a forum session livestreamed by the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry.

Export Potential in Biofuels and Low-Carbon Petrochemicals

Indonesia’s export prospects in the low-carbon energy space include sustainable aviation fuel, e-ammonia, bio-LNG, biomethanol, biomethane, and other products derived from renewable electricity. These are increasingly in demand in global markets seeking to cut emissions and meet climate targets.

Wagner pointed to Indonesia’s palm oil industry as a major untapped source of biomass. “The theoretical potential is about 280 million MMBTU a year if we include biomethane from empty fruit bunches, not only affluent biomass. That's equivalent to 8 million tons of biomethanol or 4-5 million tons of bio-LNG,” he said.

""These are massive figures. The gross export potential could range from $4 billion to $8 billion annually,"" Wagner added.

While Indonesia may not be the most cost-effective location for e-ammonia production -- with countries like Australia and the Middle East offering cheaper hydrogen -- it remains highly competitive in other low-carbon fuel categories.

Strategic Advantages and Infrastructure

Wagner noted that Indonesia already has the infrastructure to support such exports, including LNG terminals in Bontang, East Kalimantan, and methanol production facilities.

He also highlighted the geographic advantage of Indonesia’s proximity to the Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and the largest maritime refueling hub.

“International Maritime Organization (IMO) and EU emission targets can be met by refueling with low-carbon fuels in the Strait of Malacca, for example in Dumai if the fuel is there,” he said.

Indonesia could also deliver biomethane via pipeline to nearby markets such as Singapore, taking advantage of biomass availability in Sumatra.

However, Indonesia is not alone in this opportunity. Malaysia, on the other side of the Strait of Malacca with similar access to biomass in Sabah and Sarawak, and comparable export facilities, is also well-positioned to tap into the same regional and global markets.

While Indonesia's domestic market has yet to support premium pricing for renewable fuels, international mechanisms provide strong incentives. Wagner cited the IMO's net-zero program and the EU's maritime emissions regulations, which impose steep penalties on non-compliant fuels.

He also pointed to Japan's plan to replace up to 90 percent of its natural gas with renewable gas, and South Korea's open tenders for low-carbon hydrogen, which offer significant incentives.

“The question is, how Indonesia can build production facilities to profit from these incentives elsewhere with sustainable production in Indonesia,” Wagner said.

He stressed that exporting clean energy is not a new concept. Earlier this month, Indonesia and Singapore signed several memorandums of understanding on cross-border renewable energy trade and sustainable industrial zones in the Riau Islands.

“The longer we wait, the more we miss out. Use the resources to generate exportable goods, use internationally available incentives to get a premium price on these renewable goods, and then have all that infrastructure and production facility available as soon as there is demand domestically,” Wagner said.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a type of fuel that is produced from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste, or synthetic sources.","Introduction to Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact, with greenhouse gas emissions being a significant concern. One promising solution is the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which has the potential to significantly reduce the industry's carbon footprint. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the SAF supply chain, its implications on Aviation Environmental Law, and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Overview of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a type of fuel that is produced from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste, or synthetic sources. SAF is designed to be a drop-in replacement for conventional fossil-based jet fuel, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft engines without modification. The production of SAF involves converting feedstocks into a fuel that meets the stringent standards required for aviation fuel.

Importance of SAF in reducing aviation emissions

The aviation industry is responsible for around 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, and this number is expected to grow as air travel continues to increase. SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The use of SAF can help airlines meet their emissions reduction targets and contribute to a more sustainable aviation industry.

Brief history of SAF development

The development of SAF began in the early 2000s, with the first commercial flights using SAF taking place in 2011. Since then, there has been significant progress in the production and adoption of SAF, with several airlines and airports committing to using SAF in their operations. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has set a target of 2% of global aviation fuel being SAF by 2025.

SAF Production and Supply Chain

The production and supply chain of SAF is complex and involves several stages, from feedstock sourcing to fuel distribution.

Overview of SAF production processes

There are several production pathways for SAF, including:

Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis: This process involves converting biomass or waste into a synthetic gas, which is then converted into a liquid fuel.

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA): This process involves converting vegetable oils or animal fats into a fuel that meets aviation standards.

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ): This process involves converting alcohols, such as ethanol or butanol, into a jet fuel.

Feedstock options for SAF production

The choice of feedstock is critical in determining the sustainability and cost of SAF. Some common feedstocks include:

Biomass: Agricultural waste, forestry residues, and algae are all potential biomass feedstocks.

Waste: Municipal solid waste, waste cooking oil, and other waste materials can be used to produce SAF.

Synthetic sources: Power-to-liquid and other synthetic production pathways are being developed.

Logistics and distribution of SAF

The logistics and distribution of SAF are similar to those of conventional jet fuel, with some additional considerations. SAF must be stored and transported separately from conventional fuel to avoid contamination. The fuel must also meet strict quality standards to ensure safe use in aircraft.

The following flowchart illustrates the SAF supply chain:

Aviation Environmental Law and SAF

Aviation Environmental Law is a complex and evolving field, with various regulations and policies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of aviation.

Overview of Aviation Environmental Law

Aviation Environmental Law encompasses a range of issues, including greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution, and air quality. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is the primary international body responsible for developing standards and recommended practices for aviation environmental protection.

Regulations and policies supporting SAF adoption

Several regulations and policies are supporting the adoption of SAF, including:

ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA): This scheme allows airlines to offset their emissions by using SAF.

The European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED): This directive sets targets for the use of renewable energy in transportation, including aviation.

The United States' Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): This standard sets targets for the use of renewable fuels, including SAF.

Challenges and opportunities for SAF in Aviation Environmental Law

While there are several regulations and policies supporting the adoption of SAF, there are also challenges to be addressed. These include:

Ensuring the sustainability of SAF feedstocks

Developing consistent standards for SAF production and use

Addressing the higher cost of SAF compared to conventional jet fuel

The following table summarizes some of the key regulations and policies supporting SAF adoption:

Regulation/Policy Description CORSIA Allows airlines to offset emissions by using SAF RED Sets targets for renewable energy use in transportation RFS Sets targets for renewable fuel use

Challenges and Future Directions

While SAF has the potential to significantly reduce aviation emissions, there are several challenges to be addressed.

Technical challenges in SAF production and use

Some of the technical challenges in SAF production and use include:

Ensuring the quality and consistency of SAF

Developing more efficient production pathways

Addressing the compatibility of SAF with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure

Economic and policy challenges for SAF adoption

The higher cost of SAF compared to conventional jet fuel is a significant challenge to adoption. Policy measures, such as tax incentives or subsidies, may be needed to support the development of the SAF industry.

Future directions for SAF research and development

Research and development are ongoing to improve the production and use of SAF. Some areas of focus include:

Developing new feedstocks and production pathways

Improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of SAF production

Investigating the use of SAF in different aircraft engines and applications

The following equation represents the lifecycle emissions reduction potential of SAF:

Emissions reduction=Lifecycle emissions of conventional fuel−Lifecycle emissions of SAFLifecycle emissions of conventional fuel×100\text{Emissions reduction} = \frac{\text{Lifecycle emissions of conventional fuel} - \text{Lifecycle emissions of SAF}}{\text{Lifecycle emissions of conventional fuel}} \times 100Emissions reduction=Lifecycle emissions of conventional fuelLifecycle emissions of conventional fuel−Lifecycle emissions of SAF​×100

For example, if the lifecycle emissions of conventional fuel are 100 gCO2e/MJ and the lifecycle emissions of SAF are 20 gCO2e/MJ, the emissions reduction potential of SAF would be:

Emissions reduction=100−20100×100=80\text{Emissions reduction} = \frac{100 - 20}{100} \times 100 = 80%Emissions reduction=100100−20​×100=80

Conclusion

Sustainable Aviation Fuel has the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of aviation. Understanding the SAF supply chain and its implications on Aviation Environmental Law is crucial for supporting the adoption of SAF. While there are challenges to be addressed, ongoing research and development are helping to improve the production and use of SAF.

It’s time for Congress to provide the durable policy support that SAF producers need to secure America’s energy leadership.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has moved from the margins of energy policy to the forefront of America’s energy future. Once viewed as a long-shot innovation, SAF is now a commercially viable, rapidly scaling solution to power our aviation sector while revitalizing rural economies and advancing our national goals for energy dominance. As SAF production accelerates, Congress and the Trump administration have an opportunity to cement America’s leadership in aviation fuel innovations by extending long-term tax credits that support domestic SAF production.

This sector’s momentum is undeniable. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently reported that SAF production in the U.S. surged from 2,000 barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 25,000 barrels per day by February 2025. As of May, production capacity stands at roughly 30,000 barrels daily, and industry projections suggest we could approach 500,000 barrels per year by the end of 2025.

SAF’s explosive growth is a direct response to policy certainty and strategic investment—but we are only getting started. I recently spoke with Alison Graab, Executive Director of the SAF Coalition, about this issue. She rightly noted, “The biggest barrier we hear from our coalition members is the need for a longer-term market signal for SAF investment.” Without it, this American success story and the promise it offers to our country’s economy risks being outsourced.

That’s because SAF, at its heart, is an innovation and jobs engine. The entire SAF value chain—from feedstock cultivation to production and refining—offers new economic lifelines to American farmers and rural communities. These fuels are derived from a wide variety of sources, including agricultural residues, waste oils, and even woody biomass. SAF development creates stable demand for these materials, opening new revenue streams for growers and foresters. During our conversation, Graab concurred about the significant potential offered by SAF, “There are so many additional benefits that really offer a lot of opportunities to this administration and Congress.” Put simply, SAF can transform America’s heartland into an energy innovation engine.

Global demand for SAF is projected to soar as countries implement mandates and incentives to power their aviation sectors. As I spoke with Graab, she highlighted how the United States is well-positioned to lead, with more production facilities online than any other nation. “We can see the U.S. continue to grow that by helping to export and fulfill what other countries need in addition to the U.S.,” Graab emphasized. This growth offers America an important energy diplomacy tool and a new source of revenue through SAF exports. At a time when many nations are competing to develop cutting edge energy technologies, America’s ability to scale SAF production is a geopolitical advantage we cannot afford to squander.

Fortunately, Congress is awake to this challenge and has already taken an encouraging step in the right direction. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by the U.S. House of Representatives includes an extension of the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit through December 2031. This is exactly the kind of long-term policy signal investors need to deploy capital into SAF projects. Extending this credit is a critical win, but more must follow. We must ensure the SAF-specific tax credit structure remains robust, technology- and feedstock-neutral, and predictable over the next decade.

To deliver on SAF’s promise, policymakers must act boldly. Long-term certainty around 45Z and related credits is the clearest path forward. Equally important is for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to modernize its regulatory treatment of feedstocks like woody biomass to unlock hundreds of millions of gallons of potential fuels. The American SAF industry knows how to scale. We have the infrastructure, we have the feedstocks, and we have the know-how. Now we need Washington to follow through to unleash this potential to advance our American energy dominance agenda.

The opportunity before us is historic. SAF can power our economy, provide us with a vital diplomatic and international trade tool, and advance American energy dominance.

eRIN Program Overhaul: EPA proposes eliminating electricity generated from biogas used in electric vehicles (eRINs) as a qualifying fuel under the RFS program.
The Agency structured the proposal to ensure that if it decides to grant these exemptions, the result will not be to reduce the overall renewable fuel obligation, as has occurred in the past.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a landmark rule revising the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. This proposal – termed the ""Set 2"" Rule - marks the 20th anniversary of the RFS program and reflects a major policy pivot toward bolstering domestic renewable fuels production and exports and supporting U.S. agricultural producers. At the same time, the Set 2 Rule would eliminate the eRIN program in its current form.

RFS Program Background

The RFS program was established through the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as amended by the Energy Independent and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, to mandate a minimum volume of renewable fuel (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel, and advanced biofuels) to be blended into transportation fuel used in the United States. Companies that produce or import gasoline or diesel fuel used in the United States must blend renewable fuels or purchase credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to meet annual targets set by EPA. These annual targets, referred to as Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs), specify the quantity of each category that must be used.

Key Takeaways for Clients

Highest-Ever Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs): Trade associations representing both renewable fuels and the oil and gas sectors had jointly written to the EPA Administrator asking EPA to adopt ""strong, steady volumes"" under the RFS, citing investments in the industry and ""increasing demand in new markets such as marine, rail and aviation."" If finalized, the 2026-2027 requirements would establish the most ambitious RVOs in the program's history, aiming to significantly expand U.S. production of biofuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel; the Rule could also boost production of sustainable aviation fuel. The proposal maintains current volumes for ethanol and slightly reduces RVOs for cellulosic biofuel due to limited supply and production capacity.

Differentiation between Domestic and Foreign Fuels: The proposal introduces a new two-tier structure for RIN valuation, granting domestic biofuels and feedstocks full credit while assigning only 50% RIN value to foreign equivalents. This framework is designed to favor U.S. producers and limit the RFS compliance value for imports.

eRIN Program Overhaul: EPA proposes eliminating electricity generated from biogas used in electric vehicles (eRINs) as a qualifying fuel under the RFS program. This move signals a reorientation of the RFS away from supporting the electronic vehicle market and reinforces a focus on liquid biofuels.

Small Refinery Exemptions. There are over 150 petitions for small refinery exemptions currently pending before EPA. EPA states that it anticipates deciding its approach to the 2026-27 exemptions by the time the proposal is finalized. The Agency structured the proposal to ensure that if it decides to grant these exemptions, the result will not be to reduce the overall renewable fuel obligation, as has occurred in the past.

Energy Security Impacts: EPA estimates the proposal would reduce U.S. oil imports by approximately 150,000 barrels per day over 2026-2027. The U.S. is already a net exporter of petroleum products; the Set 2 Rule would further reinforce the nation's status as a net exporter of petroleum products.

Trade Implications: The Rule aligns with recent U.S. trade policy developments, including a new zero-tariff ethanol agreement with the U.K., reinforcing efforts to expand global markets for American-grown biofuels.

Next Steps

EPA will accept public comments until August 8, 2025, on the proposal following its publication in the Federal Register. EPA will host a public hearing on July 8 and July 9. Register for either hearing by emailing RFS-Hearing@epa.gov. We anticipate a final rulemaking later this year.

Customized options for more sustainable flying with SAF

The Lufthansa Group offers several special fares for corporate customers: With the “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare”, business customers can offset up to 30 percent of the CO₂ emissions calculated for their individual flight through the use of SAF in flight operations. The Lufthansa Group also offers companies the opportunity to invest in larger quantities of SAF through SAF bulk deals.

Background: The use of SAF in the Lufthansa Group

There is no refueling of individual flights with pure SAF. As a so-called “drop-in” fuel, SAF is compatible with fossil kerosene and can be blended with it without any problems. Before being transported to the airport, SAF is blended with fossil jet fuel or produced in a process known as co-processing (joint processing of biogenic residues with fossil oil) and then fed into the airport infrastructure. The Lufthansa Group ensures that the amount of SAF required to offset individual CO2 emissions is fed into the Lufthansa Group’s flight operations within six months of purchase. Over its entire life cycle, the SAF from biogenic residues used by the Lufthansa Group has a CO2 footprint that is around 80 percent lower than that of conventional kerosene made from fossil crude oil.",https://www.breakingtravelnews.com/images/sized/images/uploads/airline/Screenshot_2025-06-24_at_08.54.51-700x438.png,N,,2025-06-24 11:18:40.287899

The most liquid CPO futures contract for September on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange closed 2 ringgit per tonne higher at 4,102 ringgit ($966) per tonne, reversing morning losses when it closed 4 ringgit per tonne lower from the previous day’s settlement at 4,096 ringgit per tonne at the end of the morning session.

Front-month contracts for July and August edged lower while forward-month contracts rose by 2-22 ringgit per tonne at the close of the day.

Total traded volume was also lower than average at 42,836 lots versus the more typical daily average of 70,000 lots.

CPO futures also received support from higher Chinese vegoil futures, with the most active September palm olein futures contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rising by 0.45% to close at 8,538 yuan ($1,188) per tonne, while the equivalent soybean oil contract rose by 1.44% to close at 8,152 yuan per tonne.

The September rapeseed oil futures contract on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange also rose by 0.25% to close at 9,691 yuan per tonne.

Soyoil futures trading on the CME – a key driver in CPO futures movement in recent days – was also absent during Asian hours with the exchange closed for a US holiday, while crude oil prices were higher amid uncertainty over the outlook for the Israel-Iran conflict.

The Malaysian ringgit also eased slightly against the US dollar compared with Wednesday, making tropical oil relatively less expensive to holders of the US dollar, and thereby stoking buying interest.

Preliminary estimates for Malaysia’s June 1-20 palm oil exports were reported at 11.6%, 86,035 tonnes, higher than the previous month at 827,595 tonnes, according to cargo surveyor Intertek Testing Services, with finalized figures expected on June 20.

In the cash market, CPO was washed out $1,060-1,065 per tonne CFR India for July-September shipment earlier in the day, with the volume estimated at 5,000-6,000 tonnes. Discussions were relatively muted on Thursday, with limited buying ideas heard, while offers were around $1,065 per tonne CFR west coast India for July cargoes and $1,075 per tonne CFR WCI for August-September cargoes.

Buyers unhurried to pick up more cargoes

Import margins were considered unattractive at current offer levels, while buyers remained unhurried to pick up more cargoes, even with CPO currently the cheapest edible oil into India following the surge in soybean oil prices.

At origin markets, CPO discussions were heard at $1,025-1,040 per tonne FOB Indonesia for July shipment, while olein discussions were heard at $975-995 per tonne FOB for the same month.

In Europe, FOB Rotterdam rapeseed oil prices continued to strengthen on Thursday, with trading slightly quieter amid holidays in the US and Brazil.

For July loading, rapeseed oil offers strengthened to €1,115 per tonne from €1,110 per tonne on Thursday, while bids edged upward to €1,085 per tonne from €1,080 per tonne, indicating continued strength in demand.

In the August-September-October (ASO) period, offers were stronger at €1,045-1,052 per tonne, while bids rose over the day to €1,045 per tonne from €1,030 per tonne.

Forward values for November-December-January (NDJ) also increased. Offers bounced to €1,045-1,052 per tonne, while bids strengthened to €1,030-1,042 per tonne, narrowing the spread to ASO.

Sunflower oil market indications on Wednesday weakened in the forward months, but October-November-December (OND) prices gained, narrowing the backwardation in the market.

For the July-August-September (JAS) period, sunflower oil offers decreased to $1,215 per tonne FOB from $1,220 per tonne the previous day. Bids fell to $1,195 per tonne from Wednesday’s $1,205 per tonne.

The OND period saw offers emerge at $1,155 per tonne, while bids were made at $1,125 per tonne.

No European sunflower oil trades were reported to Fastmarkets on Thursday, while Ukraine-origin sunflower oil in the Black Sea was offered at $1,190 per tonne CIF Mersin for July shipment, which corresponds to Wednesday’s level, while July bids were heard around $1,160 per tonne.

Meanwhile, Russia-origin sunflower oil was reported offered at $1,180 per tonne CIF.

Overall, the market remained quiet, with most participants adopting a wait-and-see approach amid subdued liquidity.

Finally, spot buyers in Ukrainian ports continued to show ideas around $1,090 per tonne CPT deep-water ports, but sellers largely preferred to hold back and monitor market developments rather than commit to active sales.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/df/df/575093214236aab4d7d4558c95ac/vegoils-gettyimages-1328274815.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 15:13:30.346583

You can’t call that jet fuel sustainable if you do it using fresh oil.
“Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact).” In Malaysia the gap is even wider because the government subsidizes fresh cooking oil.
Restaurants can buy cooking oil on the cheap for 60 cents, use it a bit, and resell it for a dollar.
Buy the fresh oil for 60 cents, don’t use it, and sell it for $1.","I’ve written about how ESG adventures of airlines have gone bad. It usually involves fraud. Delta got caught up in a scandal ‘ESG but evil’.

They claimed to be carbon neutral. They’re an airline burning jet fuel but they were buying carbon credits. The carbon credits turned out to be not so good. The money disappeared. The carbon credits were fake. Deforestation benchmarks were completely fabricated. And they sold the same credits multiple times. The forest’s owner went on the record, to the New Yorker, “I don’t know what you’re going to report on this, and I hope to God it’s not all of it, because I probably will go to jail.”

But what if sustainable aviation fuel was actually causing more deforestation, and turned out not to be re-using oils?

Bloomberg‘s Matt Levine writes about the arbitrage where – thanks to subsidies for sustainable aviation fuel – used deep fryer oil costs more than fresh oil.

You can make jet fuel out of palm oil.

You can’t call that jet fuel sustainable if you do it using fresh oil. If you give used cooking oil a second life, that’s sustainable.

Airlines are pushing the narrative that this is the future of low emissions aviation – pivoting from fossil fuels and reusing resources – and getting governments to step up and pay for it.

So used oil is sold at a premium.

Restaurants use oil, and resell it at a profit!

You can take palm oil, put it in a deep fryer, use it to make french fries, reuse it again and again until it becomes gross and the fries taste bad, and then take the used oil and sell it to a refiner to make jet fuel. Also works with olive oil, soybean oil, lots of cooking oils. This is a very nice fact about the world!

Since used cooking oil can be marketed as sustainable to airlines and governments, it commands a premium – even though the energy content of both is the same. “Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact).”

In Malaysia the gap is even wider because the government subsidizes fresh cooking oil. Restaurants can buy cooking oil on the cheap for 60 cents, use it a bit, and resell it for a dollar.

If you don’t run a restaurant the trade is even better? Buy the fresh oil for 60 cents, don’t use it, and sell it for $1. “The refiner probably isn’t going to taste it” to know that it hasn’t been sitting in a deep fryer.

This trade actually increases the demand for palm oil and the resulting deforestation, rather than re-using palm oil. It turns out that’s what’s happening, “incidents of fraud is very high.”

Even without fraud, homes and restaurants in Malaysia now replace cooking oil after a single use in order to generate more ‘used’ oil to sell, rather than re-using it 3-5 times the way they’ve always done. And now you know why deep fried foods in Malaysia are so fresh!",https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/upscalemedia-transformed.webp,N,,2025-06-24 11:19:19.447902

Netherlands publishes RED III biofuels draft

Netherlands publishes RED III biofuels draft

London, 24 June (Argus) — The Dutch government's updated draft legislation to transpose the EU's revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) notably proposes abolishing double-counting renewable energy contributions from Annex IX feedstocks. The draft introduces a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction mandate for land, inland shipping and maritime shipping, but excludes aviation — which was included in a previous draft . The RED III mandate will take effect in 2026. Obligated parties have to fulfil the mandate by surrendering a sufficient amount of so-called emission reduction units (EREs) in each sector. The mandate's flexible credit allowance allows EREs generated in the land sector to be used to partly meet emission reduction obligations in inland and maritime shipping ( see table ), but EREs from inland and maritime shipping cannot be used by land sector suppliers to fulfil their compliance requirements. Fuel suppliers with overall consumption of more than 500,000 l/yr will need to incorporate a 14.4pc share of renewable fuels in their annual deliveries in 2026. This increases linearly, to reach 27.1pc in 2030. The amount of crop-based biofuels in the land sector will be limited to 1.4pc of the overall energy content of total consumption until 2030, and will not be accepted towards targets in maritime and inland shipping and aviation. The amount of Annex IX Part B biofuels — such as used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — that can be counted towards the mandate will be limited to 4.29pc in the land sector and 11.07pc in inland shipping. Obligated parties will be unable to claim EREs from Annex IX Part B fuels used in maritime shipping. The draft also introduces a minimum share of emission reductions that have to be achieved by Annex IX Part A and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO), for all sectors. RED III mandates that 5.5pc of all fuels supplied must be advanced biofuels, including at least 1pc RFNBOs by 2030. The Netherlands' draft decouples these targets, to reduce investment uncertainty ( see table ). Refineries that use renewable hydrogen in their production process can claim refinery reduction units — or RAREs — which can be used by a supplier to meet an RFNBO sub-target in various sectors. Correction factor delay The ministry will delay its plans to apply a ""correction factor"" of 0.4 to its ""refinery route"" stimulus for hydrogen demand, in order to ensure the measure does not undermine direct use of hydrogen in transport. The correction factor means the value of emissions reductions credits generated through the use of renewable hydrogen for transport fuel production would be limited to a certain percentage of those generated through direct use of renewable hydrogen or derivatives in transport. The government leaves the option open to impose a correction factor from 2030. Although the EU Fuel Quality Directive increases the maximum share of bio-based components to 10pc in diesel, the Dutch government said fuel suppliers must continue to offer B7 — diesel with up to 7pc biodiesel — as a protection grade, because of the large number of cars incompatible with B10. Companies will be able to carry forward any excess EREs to the next compliance year. Companies with an annual obligation can carry forward up to 10pc of the total amount of EREs needed to fulfil their obligation in a year, with registering companies allowed to carry forward 4pc. Dutch renewable fuel tickets (HBEs) carried into 2026 will be converted into EREs on 1 April 2026, the government said.

Following the introduction of the UK’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate, which came into force on 1 January, 2025 Alfanar, is signaling its broader commitment to scaling SAF production and investment in the UK. The Saudi engineering and construction firm has opened its new UK headquarters in central London.

“With the third largest aviation network in the world and a third of Europe’s carbon storage capacity, the UK is perfectly positioned to be a world leader in SAF production and a future hub for our European green fuel’s operation,” said Alfanar Chief Investment Officer, Mishal Al Mutlaq.

UK SAF mandate

As from the start of this year, the UK’s SAF mandate outlines that at least 2 per cent of jet fuel used on flights departing the UK must be SAF. This figure rises incrementally to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040, where it will remain pending future supply security. Alfanar is currently developing a waste-to-SAF production plant in Teesside to help meet this demand.

Alfanar’s new office in the UK capital will be home to its project development business, including the global hub for their transport decarbonisation business. Alfanar currently employs around 120 people across the UK.

Waste-to-SAF production plant in Teesside

Alfanar’s GBP 2 billion waste-to-SAF production facility in Teesside, known as Lighthouse Green fuels, is currently going through the Development Consent Order planning process and is slated for completion in 2029. The facility will be essential to decarbonising the UK’s aviation sector, producing 180m litres of SAF each year. That’s enough to power 27,000 short-haul flights.

With the UK currently processing its SAF revenue certainty mechanism bill through Parliament, the opening of Alfanar’s new base in the capital coincides with this development which will assure investors of the potential to deliver future SAF projects in the UK.

Vote of confidence

Minister for Investment, Baroness Poppy Gustafsson CBE, attended the opening, where she said Alfanar’s investment in the UK is a “major vote of confidence in not only our economy but this country’s green investment environment.”

She also noted that the UK is “serious about fostering the benefits of net zero, that’s why we’ve identified clean energy as a key growth sector in our upcoming modern Industrial Strategy.”

Meanwhile, Al Mutlaq welcomed the British Government’s steps to help deliver the assurances required to develop a UK SAF market. “With continued support, our Lighthouse Green Fuels project will cut aviation emissions whilst establishing a new British green industry in Teesside and attracting significant inward investment to the region and the UK,” he said.",https://www.regionalgateway.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Alfanar-opens-London-HQ-with-Baroness-Poppy-Gustafsson-CBE.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 11:19:27.968328

Until now.

Tax credits for wind and solar helped launch an upheaval in America’s utility sector, reduced the cost of renewables, fueled a surge in wind and solar installations, and drove a sustained decline in climate pollution from U.S. power plants.

Now they’re on the congressional chopping block.

Republican lawmakers are debating a mass repeal of clean energy tax credits that were passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Eliminating the credits would be the most significant climate rollback by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, who already have scrapped carbon dioxide limits on power plants, repealed California’s authority to set tailpipe standards, and halted permitting for new wind projects on federal lands or waters.

But in targeting tax credits for wind and solar, Republicans would end one of the few clean energy policies that historically enjoyed bipartisan support.

“There isn’t much that has been consistent or durable beyond those tax credits,” said Barry Rabe, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and longtime scholar of U.S. climate policy.

Initially conceived as a response to the 1970s oil crises, the credits have evolved over the decades from a means of reducing the costs of alternative energy technologies to America’s carbon-cutting tool of choice. They have been effective in transforming wind and solar from bit players into power-sector workhorses.

Wind and solar collectively generated about 16 percent of the country’s electricity last year, exceeding the output from coal for the first time. The rise of renewables has coincided with a sustained drop in American power plants carbon dioxide emissions, which have fallen 38 percent since 2005. Natural gas and improved energy efficiency also have played a key role in reducing coal generation and lowering emissions.

The success of wind and solar tax credits stand in contrast to other U.S. attempts to curtail planet warming pollution. Attempts to establish a national carbon price effectively ended with the demise of a 2009 cap-and-trade bill, which passed the House but failed in the Senate. Efforts to regulate power plant emissions have never been fully implemented. Rules for tailpipe emissions have gotten tougher, but their stringency frequently seesaws between Democratic and Republican presidential administrations.

Republicans have targeted the credits before, arguing they distort markets and drive up energy costs. But those efforts notably encountered resistance from Republicans or were used as a bargaining chip between the two parties. In 2015, Republicans and Democrats struck a deal to lift a decades-old ban on oil exports in exchange for an extension of renewable credits.

When Democrats took power in 2021, they focused on expanding the credits. Part of the reason was simple politics: Democrats at the time held only a narrow majority in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is needed to pass nonbudgetary bills. But the effort also reflected a belief that tax credits could drive down the cost of clean energy technologies, boost domestic clean energy manufacturing and create jobs.

The Inflation Reduction Act expanded the tax credits from wind and solar to everything from nuclear and geothermal to sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen. It enhanced existing credits for electric vehicles and carbon capture and sequestration. And it added bonuses for companies that bought American-made components, hired union labor and built in communities with fossil-fuel-based economies.

“Part of the premise of the IRA is politically you couldn’t do a price because public support wasn’t going to be there. You couldn’t do regulation because you couldn’t put it in the reconciliation in the Senate,” Rabe said. “But you could use subsidies and incentives and build a political constituency that would underpin support against any backlash. That so far doesn’t seem to be holding.”

It remains to be seen how far Republicans will go in repealing the credits. There are notable differences between the Senate and House bills thus far. Draft budget language released last week by the Senate Finance Committee would preserve credits for resources such as geothermal and nuclear, which can generate zero-carbon electricity around the clock, as well as subsidies for batteries. The House bill went further in eliminating those subsidies.

The bills also differ in how they would treat wind and solar. The Senate Finance Committee would phase out the credits by the end of 2028. The House version would require projects to begin construction 60 days after the bill’s passage and enter operation by 2028 to receive the money.

Critics of the credits argue they are wasteful, particularly given the precipitous drops in wind and solar prices over recent decades. Renewables are among the most cost-effective sources of new power generation, even without the subsidies.

But supporters maintain the federal assistance is still necessary to drive the rapid deployment of renewables that’s needed to cut emissions in time to avoid the worst impacts of a warming planet. Many advocates have couched their arguments in economic terms at a time when climate has fallen down lawmakers’ list of priorities, saying wind and solar are the best placed to help meet a rapid rise in electricity demand because they can be built faster than other energy resources.

“If you take away the PTC [production tax credit] and the ITC [investment tax credit] on deployment, energy bills will go up because 90 percent of what we built last year was solar and batteries,” said Leah Stokes, a prominent climate activist and professor who studies energy policy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

The PTC and the ITC are the two primary subsidies enjoyed by renewable projects.

Most analysts agree that renewable development will continue without the subsidies, but at a slower pace. Exactly how much slower remains an open question. A range of government institutions and research organizations have sought to compare the rate of clean energy deployments with and without the Inflation Reduction Act credits. Their findings vary, depending on the assumptions they make about a series of external factors, ranging from interest rates and natural gas prices to trade policy and grid interconnection rules.

A March study by the Electric Power Research Institute, which compared 10 models produced by different organizations, found that the credits remain a cost-effective tool for cutting emissions. It estimated the credits abatement cost at $96 per ton of carbon dioxide, lower than social cost of carbon estimates that range from $100 to $360 per ton of CO2.

“The carbon benefits of tax credits are lower than the cost by quite a large margin,” said John Bistline, a senior program manager at EPRI who authored the study. “What we see is that when you look at the average across models, the Inflation Reduction Act incentives tend to roughly double the amount of clean electricity capacity deployment over the next decade.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2e/8b/4e3e2711449e831aa7ce865df122/climate-wind-energy-71969.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 12:12:49.639695

The strategy, called Aviation East Manifesto, was launched last week at an event, hosted at Saxon Air, Norwich Airport. It brought together key regional stakeholders, innovators, policymakers and media.

The manifesto outlines a shared ambition to accelerate the adoption of electric and hydrogen aircraft, increase early access to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and lead the UK in developing commercial drone operations.

According to a statement released by Saxon Air, Aviation East has a unique geographical advantage: the rural and coastal landscape of Norfolk and Suffolk offers the ideal real-world testbed for emerging technologies.

“With open skies, lower congestion, and a pressing need for improved connectivity, the region is not only well-positioned to trial and scale innovation, but also to serve as a national model for how clean aviation can meet the specific needs of underserved communities.”

The launch also marked the inclusion of Evotech, based at Saxon Air, as the newest member of the Connected Innovation network, linking Norfolk and Suffolk’s most strategic innovation hubs and supporting region-wide collaboration in research and development.

Local MP, Alice Macdonald, shared her backing for the initiative in a House of Commons debate.

She said, “Recently, Norwich Airport, Suffolk and Norfolk county councils, and Saxon Air launched Aviation East: a vision to make East Anglia an innovation hub for sustainable aviation. Sustainable aviation fuel was referenced as one of the vital building blocks for that mission.

New York, 23 June (Argus) — Ontario is considering requiring that domestically produced renewable fuels make up 3pc of the province's diesel pool, an effort to help biodiesel producers struggling to adapt to policy changes in the US. Ontario late last week requested input on a proposal to supplement existing provincial biofuel blend requirements with a new mandate for Canadian production, similar to a domestic content rule that took force in British Columbia this year. Ontario already requires that renewables like biodiesel and renewable diesel make up 4pc of diesel consumption each year, but this proposal would require that three-fourths of that mandated volume come from biofuels produced in Canada. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks says the proposal is in response to a new clean fuel tax credit that took effect in the US this year, which can only be claimed by US producers. A US Department of Agriculture report late last year said that there were six remaining operational biodiesel plants in Canada and that the industry has historically sent almost all its fuel into the US, which up until this year treated foreign biodiesel as eligible for a federal tax credit. At the same time, US biofuels have increasingly entered Canada to meet demand from low-carbon fuel standards federally and in British Columbia. In those programs, higher-carbon fuels that exceed annual carbon intensity limits incur deficits that suppliers must offset with credits generated from approved lower-carbon alternatives. The Canadian biofuel industry has pushed officials to respond. British Columbia as a result began requiring this year that renewables make up a minimum 8pc of diesel fuels supplied in the province, up from 4pc, and that this mandated volume must come from Canadian producers starting in April. British Columbia-based renewable diesel producer Tidewater Renewables has also unsuccessfully pushed Canada to impose duties on US product. The Ontario environment ministry said the domestic mandate, if finalized, would be a ""temporary, time-limited measure"" that would last as long as US subsidies ""threaten Ontario's biodiesel industry."" The new US tax credit that excludes foreign refiners is currently set to lapse after 2027, but Republican lawmakers have floated using a massive budget bill they want to pass in the coming weeks to extend the incentive through 2031. While full regulatory text is not available, as is typical for this early stage of the Ontario rulemaking process, it appears the proposal would otherwise keep intact the general structure of the province's biofuel mandate. The program offers more credit to lower-carbon fuels, which led to a slightly lower than 4pc biofuel blend rate for the diesel pool in 2023, according to a report from trade group Advanced Biofuels Canada. The domestic content proposal would also not affect a separate mandate that biofuels make up increasing amounts of the gasoline pool through 2030.

Raft of issues impacting Spanish biodiesel industry

Barcelona, 23 June (Argus) — Fraud, uncertainty, competition from hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), changes to US biofuel regulations, technical issues and stubbornly weak margins are combining to negatively impact the Spanish biodiesel industry. Spanish producers continue to complain about weak margins, with widespread talk of low production levels and units halting completely. These sentiments have continued all this year. Some uncertainty over the EU's sustainability verification process, and its accreditation body the ISCC are also mentioned by companies. One producer said ""everyone is waiting, for the ISCC to take action to remove certificates."" Some of these certificates concern imports of feedstock such as used cooking oil (UCO) but also cargoes of HVO from the Asia-Pacific region. Competition between biodiesel and HVO for blending into diesel is not new, has previously been the subject of ire in France and appears likely to remain problematic in Spain. Fraud cases in excess of €500mn ($576mn) from 2023 remain outstanding, the end to the US' blenders tax credit — which has halted exports to the US — and operational issues with Spain's SICBIOS accounting system, are not helping the industry. The energy ministry this month extended the application for provisional tickets for the first half of the year to 31 August, as ""technical issues with the system have prevented the correct functioning of the SICBIOS software."" Spanish biodiesel imports have increased this year, pushing the country to being a net importer, which is rare. According to customs data, imports rose by 45pc on the year to 270,000t in January-April. The main increases came from the Netherlands, now Spain's largest supplier, which provided 105,000t, up from 70,000t on the year. Malaysia, Italy, Belgium and Malta all boosted supplies, shipping 25,000-40,000t. Cargoes labelled as Maltese are unusual and not supported by Argus tracking or Kpler data. Exports continued to drop sharply — to 190,000t in January-April, lower by 67pc year on year and a 10-year low for the period (see chart) . Spain has long acted as a distribution hub for imports from outside the EU, re-exporting cargoes to regional buyers, but these have all but halted. Exports of over 50,000t in April were the third lowest for any month since November 2017 — only January and March this year were lower. Such low exports are in line with apparent weak production — assessed by Argus using import, export, demand and stocks data. This fell by 53pc on the year to 435,000t in the first four months of this year.

We have also consistently championed the diversification of the sugar sector into renewable energy solutions.
Overall, Uttar Pradesh’s SAF policy could be more than a regulatory document; it is a signal of intent.
It positions the state, and its sugar sector, at the forefront of India’s next-generation biofuel revolution.","Uttar Pradesh is preparing to take a bold step toward redefining India’s bioenergy future by

unveiling its vision of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Manufacturing Promotion Policy 2025, the first of its kind in the country. The vision of the policy was unveiled by UP Government’s Chief Secretary, Manoj Kumar Singh during a roundtable at Invest UP. During the roundtable, key investors, policy experts, and senior government officials came together to explore SAF manufacturing opportunities, underscoring the state’s intent to position itself as a leading hub for green energy innovation.

The envisioned policy holds the potential to drive meaningful transformation, not only in India’s clean energy trajectory but also in the fortunes of UP’s sugar industry. By enabling the integration of agricultural waste into the SAF value chain, the policy aims to align environmental responsibility with rural economic revival. This initiative aligns with the state’s vision of becoming a $1 trillion economy and a leader in sustainable industrial growth.

From Ethanol to Aviation Fuel: The Next Logical Step

Ethanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Complementary Pillars of Clean Energy

India’s sugar industry has played a central role in driving the ethanol blending programme, enabling the country to make significant progress toward its E20 target. This shift has delivered multiple benefits: a steady revenue stream for sugar mills, reduced sugar surplus, improved payment cycles for farmers, and greater energy security. While the ethanol ecosystem continues to scale and evolve, it is equally important to explore parallel opportunities that can further strengthen the green energy transition and expand value creation for the sugar sector.

One such opportunity lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With global aviation facing increasing pressure to decarbonise, SAF is emerging as a high-potential, low-emissions alternative to conventional jet fuel. Much like ethanol opened up a second vertical for sugar mills, SAF can serve as a complementary third, unlocking even greater value from existing agricultural and industrial ecosystems while advancing India’s broader clean energy goals.

Policy Provisions with Transformational Potential

The proposed policy outlines an ambitious roadmap for SAF production in Uttar Pradesh, with a strong focus on agri-residues as feedstock. Notably, it includes byproducts from sugarcane processing, such as molasses and bagasse, as viable inputs for SAF, which could be a game-changer for the sugar sector.

To attract investment and spur adoption, the policy proposes a suite of incentives: capital subsidies, interest subventions, stamp duty waivers, and significant support for land acquisition. Developers setting up units in eastern UP and Bundelkhand would be eligible for up to 80% land subsidy, while those in central and western regions could avail 75%. These incentives have already drawn investor interest, with commitments worth over ₹3,000 crore under discussion, an encouraging sign for a policy still in its draft stage.

Opportunities for Sugar Mills and Farmers Alike

The policy’s inclusion of sugar sector residues marks a pivotal moment. It offers mills a chance to diversify revenue streams, strengthen margins, and reduce reliance on sugar prices. More importantly, if SAF production becomes a viable commercial vertical, it could further stabilise mill operations, resulting in more predictable, timely payments to sugarcane farmers.

The ripple effect would be felt across rural Uttar Pradesh. Biorefineries co-located near sugar mills could create skilled and semi-skilled employment and stimulate ancillary industries. For farmers, this represents not just better prices but a more integrated, future-ready agricultural value chain.

Challenges That Need Strategic Attention

Despite its promise, the upcoming policy’s success will depend on overcoming significant challenges. SAF production from lignocellulosic material such as bagasse involves complex biochemical or thermochemical processes that are still capital-intensive and commercially nascent. Moreover, SAF remains considerably costlier than traditional jet fuel, potentially slowing adoption unless supported by long-term financial mechanisms or carbon pricing frameworks.

Logistics present another hurdle. Efficient collection, aggregation, and transport of

biomass, especially from smallholder farms, require infrastructure that does not yet exist at scale. Additionally, for the policy to achieve its intended impact, it must integrate seamlessly with national biofuel mandates, aviation sector regulations, and India’s net-zero commitments.

Collaboration is key

Realising the potential of this upcoming policy will require robust collaboration between

Government, industry, and the farming community. Public-private partnerships can play a crucial role in accelerating infrastructure development, while targeted R&D investments will be essential to reduce the cost and complexity of SAF production. At the same time, farmer outreach—through education, fair pricing models, and consistent engagement—will be key to ensuring reliable, long- term supply of biomass feedstock.

At Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd., we see this policy as a positive move overall. If implemented effectively, it could give Uttar Pradesh an early advantage in this sector and provide additional momentum to the sugar industry. With a strong presence across UP’s sugar belt and extensive experience in sugar, ethanol, and co-generation, Triveni is uniquely positioned to support the SAF transition. We have state-of-the-art distilleries spread across Muzaffarnagar (MZN) – 2 facilities, Sabitgarh (SBT), Milak Narayanpur (MNP) and Rani Nangal (RNG) in Uttar Pradesh with cumulative distillation capacity of 860 KLPD. These facilities have the capability to produce Ethanol, Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA), Rectified Spirit (RS) and Denatured Spirit (SDS). The Company utilises a mix of sugarcane-based feedstocks as well as grain.

We have also consistently championed the diversification of the sugar sector into renewable energy solutions. As SAF approaches policy-supported adoption, we at Triveni Engineering are in a strong position to capitalize on emerging trends and drive profitable growth in the future.

Overall, Uttar Pradesh’s SAF policy could be more than a regulatory document; it is a signal of intent. It positions the state, and its sugar sector, at the forefront of India’s next-generation biofuel revolution. By building on the ethanol ecosystem, the policy can help unlock a cleaner, more diversified, and economically resilient energy future.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SAF-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-5.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 05:00:27.276281

Today, the vision is beginning to materialise. According to the June 2025 Global Project Tracker by the Mission Possible Partnership, there are now 22 SAF plants in operation globally, with a promising pipeline of 144 projects. This makes aviation one of the most advanced sectors in the global clean industrial transition, accounting for 20% of all clean industrial project announcements to date.

However, while the number of proposed plants is rising, the sector faces a hard reality: progress from announcement to actual construction remains slow. In the past six months, only one aviation project globally reached final investment decision (FID). That’s far from the pace required to meet decarbonisation targets. For aviation to align with net-zero pathways, SAF production must scale dramatically—and quickly.

Policy support takes the lead

Globally, momentum is building thanks to a growing chorus of mandates and incentives. In Europe, the ReFuelEU initiative has set binding SAF blending mandates of 2% by 2025 and 6% by 2030. The United States, meanwhile, is backing SAF with a patchwork of federal and state-level incentives, including tax credits and research funding. This policy support is beginning to move the needle—but only just. Of the 144 projects in the aviation pipeline, only seven have reached FID, and many are still struggling to lock in buyers or secure affordable feedstock.

The majority of SAF today still comes from biomass pathways such as HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), while advanced e-fuels produced through Power-to-Liquid (PtL) processes remain expensive and immature.

Against this backdrop, the Middle East is emerging as a potential game-changer. The Mission Possible Partnership identifies a “New Industrial Sunbelt” of countries with abundant solar energy and favourable production conditions. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and Egypt are all included in this emerging group. These countries are not only investing in green hydrogen—the base ingredient for synthetic SAF—but are also developing strong infrastructure, competitive energy prices, and export-oriented strategies. The MENAT region already accounts for 20% of the global ammonia project pipeline, much of it green, signalling strong alignment with future aviation fuel supply chains.

Challenges on the ground

Yet, the opportunity is not without its risks. While the region boasts natural advantages, policy frameworks remain fragmented, and domestic demand for SAF is still in its infancy. Without clear national blending mandates or incentives for airlines to adopt SAF locally, the Middle East may struggle to justify large-scale production purely for export.

Moreover, without long-term offtake agreements, many projects will remain stuck in planning, vulnerable to the same setbacks that have delayed or cancelled SAF facilities in Australia and Europe.

Still, the sector’s potential remains immense. If all announced SAF projects worldwide are completed, they would generate 48 million tonnes annually—enough to meet over 100% of projected EU airport fuel needs by 2030. But that is a big if. The current pace of less than 15 FIDs per year is far too slow. For SAF to truly take off, the industry needs a surge in financing, greater policy clarity, and, above all, demand certainty.

Middle East can be first mover

There is a window to act. The next five years will define whether aviation becomes a decarbonisation leader or a late mover.

For countries in the Middle East, the stakes are even higher. With abundant solar potential, vast land availability, and significant state-backed infrastructure investments, the region could position itself as a global hub for SAF production.

But to do so, governments and industry players must move beyond announcements and pilot projects. They must create the conditions—regulatory, financial, and commercial—for the first wave of SAF to become a mainstream fuel alternative, not just a niche solution.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/06/24/bornil-amin-dVFp_nt-OO4-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 05:00:35.203190
