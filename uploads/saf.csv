“Produksi biofuel global kini terganjal oleh menurunnya pengumpulan minyak bekas dan limbah, terutama sejak awal 2024,” ungkap Hammerschmidt.

Dalam Konferensi The 36th Palm & Lauric Oils Price Outlook Conference & Exhibition (POC 2025) yang digelar Februari lalu di Kuala Lumpur, Head of Vegoils and Biofuels Research dari Ceras Analytics, Artem Hammerschmidt, mengungkapkan bahwa ketegangan utama datang dari dua arah: perlambatan pasokan bahan baku dan pilihan kebijakan yang belum tentu berpihak pada keberlanjutan industri.

“Produksi biofuel global kini terganjal oleh menurunnya pengumpulan minyak bekas dan limbah, terutama sejak awal 2024,” ungkap Hammerschmidt. Kondisi ini diprediksi memicu defisit bahan baku yang lebih besar pada 2025 dan 2026, mendorong industri untuk beralih ke minyak nabati sebagai substitusi.

Di sisi lain, target ambisius dekarbonisasi dari Eropa, Amerika Serikat, hingga Indonesia telah mengangkat permintaan untuk biodiesel, renewable diesel (HVO), dan sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Secara keseluruhan, kebutuhan diperkirakan melonjak hingga 8 juta ton dalam periode 2025–2026.

Namun pertumbuhan ini menimbulkan pertanyaan besar, terutama di Eropa. Wilayah ini menerapkan kebijakan ketat yang hanya mengizinkan penggunaan feedstock dari limbah dan bahan baku maju untuk SAF dan biodiesel sektor maritim. Hal ini membuat Eropa sangat bergantung pada pasokan minyak limbah, yang jumlahnya semakin terbatas. Meski impor HVO dan SAF sempat menutupi penurunan volume biodiesel, kekhawatiran soal keberlanjutan pasokan tetap membayangi.

“Total kebutuhan bahan bakar bio untuk transportasi darat, udara, dan laut diperkirakan naik 2,5 juta ton tahun ini dan bertambah 1,3 juta ton lagi pada 2026,” papar Hammerschmidt.

Di Indonesia pun tidak luput dari tantangan. Pemerintah tengah dihadapkan pada kebutuhan untuk menambah produksi biodiesel sebesar 1,4 juta ton pada 2025, di tengah keterbatasan dana subsidi dari Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan (BPDP). Jika pemerintah memperluas subsidi ke sektor non-public service obligation (non-PSO), dana BPDPKS diprediksi akan habis pada akhir kuartal ketiga 2025.

Dalam situasi ini, muncul dua pilihan kebijakan: menaikkan penalti bagi perusahaan yang tidak mematuhi mandat biodiesel, atau meningkatkan pungutan ekspor sawit guna memperkuat pendanaan subsidi. Keduanya dinilai dapat membantu menjaga harga minyak sawit di pasar global tetap kompetitif.

Secara keseluruhan, kekurangan minyak bekas dan limbah mendorong lonjakan permintaan terhadap minyak nabati, termasuk minyak sawit, minyak kedelai, dan minyak biji rapa. “Dengan meningkatnya konsumsi, stok minyak nabati global diperkirakan akan terus menurun hingga akhir 2026,” kata Hammerschmidt.

New Aircraft

United Airlines’ new order will secure deliveries post-2030 and, in bolstering their Airbus portfolio, reinforce their goals of modernisation and enhanced sustainability.

The Airbus A231neo, known for its extended range and high fuel efficiency, will help United also work towards its long term goals of reducing emissions whilst simultaneously meeting customer demand. With United’s roster being predominantly Boeing, a step towards diversifying their aircraft may be to help keep them operationally flexible, but the push towards Airbus could also be a response to certification delays with the Boeing 737 MAX 10 which, due to the delays, may not be ready for delivery until 2027 or 2028.

United currently already has 37 Airbus A321-200NX in its fleet, 35 being owned and 2 being leased, with another 165 set to be delivered in the future.

United’s Bright Future

Along with the bolstering of its fleet, United also announced on May 30th 2025 that they will see a record number of flights from Chicago and its hometown hub of O’Hare International Airport. This announcement also follows the confirmation of its extended weekend services to Latin and Caribbean destinations later this year to destinations like Cozumel, Saint Martin and Guatemala City.

Omar Idris, United’s Vice President of O’Hare said:

“Building on the momentum of an anticipated-record-breaking summer, we’re taking things further this fall with our busiest flight schedule of the year — adding more flights and extending service to warm-weather destinations in the U.S. and around the world”.

United’s efforts to modernise their fleet with customer satisfaction and sustainability in mind, paired with its record-breaking activity consolidate it as a leading airline on a global scale.

It all starts with farmers having a conversation. Every relationship begins with two individuals communicating. It is actually that simple. Creating market demand for soybeans begins with two people talking about how to meet each other’s needs as one has a supply and the other a demand. When the supply and demand volumes get larger, the conversations grow as well. “For 35 years the United Soybean Board, funded by soybean farmers and their check-off, has been knocking on international doors, developing relationships, and driving innovation to ensure that there is opportunity for domestic demand as well as international,” said Lucas Lentsch, Chief Executive Officer of the United Soybean Board. “At the end of the day we are knocking on doors because of farmer investment.”

The Soybean Check-off funds research, promotion and education initiatives. Creating demand for soybeans is a function that aligns with all three of those. Creating soybean demand comes in many forms. “It is important to remember 60% of what we raise today is exported,” said Lentsch. “To give an example of how much we are really talking about, a great visual is 6 Panamax ships leaving the port every day filled with soybeans. You can also think of it as 45 truckloads of grain every minute that is being exported. That is the size and scale of a Panamax export vessel. A Panamax ship is just under 1000 feet long and a little over 100 feet wide. If you were to fill six of those a day, that’s essentially 45 trucks a minute to make that happen.” It is because of the importance of the volume of soybeans being exported, that farmers pay close attention when there are talks about global trade and tariffs.

Equally important is the creation and development of new domestic markets. “We are proud of the work that we have done to increase utilization domestically. We can talk about everything from soy firefighting foam that is safer for firefighters, to high oleic soybeans that have an extended shelf life for frying,” said Lentsch. “We also have discovered secondary benefits in roasted high oleic soybeans, through a farmer funded soy check-project, that is increasing the milk fat for dairy cattle when properly fed the soybean meal.”

While the Soybean Check-off does not get involved in policy directly, a lot of the work that is done goes into driving information and research that helps inform that policy making. “The biofuels conversation is alive and well,” said Lentsch. “You do not need to look any further than the opportunities in marine or rail. With the rail we have the six Class 1 carriers that are all committed to utilizing biofuels as they make pledges for 2025 and beyond. With sustainable aviation fuel we have an opportunity estimated at a little over 27 billion gallons, and as of today biofuels are only a little over 1% of that. There is huge upside potential. Unfortunately, a lot of what it is going to take to realize that potential has to do with things that are beyond our control.”

It is always important to keep in mind the bigger picture for perspectives on soybean usage. “If we’re not going to export part of that 60% that is currently going out, what are we doing to drive domestic demand?” asked Lentsch. “We know that between feed for animals, poultry and pigs are #1 and #2 customers, and between our oil utilization and the innovation in the pipeline of high oleic or other bio-based alternatives, soy oil is truly a drop-in replacement for petroleum. Simply stated, a petroleum use today is a is a soy oil replacement tomorrow, and that is a pretty positive spot for us as we look to the future.”",https://ocj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/soy-demand.png,N,,2025-06-08 15:56:46.861834

NEW DELHI: The need for producing Sustainability Aviation Fuel (SAF) extensively to meet the airline industry’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050 came up for extensive discussions during the recent annual meet by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The Association also announced that it would soon launch the SAF Matchmaker, which will connect the eco-friendly fuel suppliers globally with the airlines in order to usher in transparency in the SAF market.

With 30% of the operational costs of most airlines going towards buying fuel, where does India, the third biggest aviation market globally, find itself on the SAF front?

The Head of Net Zero Research & Programs at IATA, Preeti Jain, told this reporter, “The Jet fuel demand consumption in the world annually is 300 million tonnes but only one million tonnes of SAF have been produced globally last year and this throws open a massive opportunity. India has the potential to produce around 40 million tonnes of SAF by 2050. This is a real economic opportunity for rural Indian transformation and to fuel sustainable aviation growth and it must not be missed.”

Energy companies in India are looking at co-processing and investing in Ethanol-to-Jet plants to produce SAF. “There needs to be feedstock prioritisation and the government needs to start providing capital support without any delay in SAF plants,” she urged. India could position itself as a leading regional SAF hub in future. It would roughly cost 100 to 150 million US dollars to install one such plant.

“India’s leadership in biofuels is exemplary, with policy support making it the world’s third-largest producer of ethanol,” Jain elaborated. Continued policy momentum is crucial to channelising the country’s biomass and waste resources and adopting new technologies through incentives and research-focused grants, she added.

India is one of the feedstock hotspots in the world with 10% of global biomass feedstock available for SAF. “It is time for India to rationalise its existing feedstocks for aviation, a hard-to-decarbonise sector, and catalyse the SAF story,” the IATA top official added.

The substantial 19th-century property has a guide price of £975,000.

The Inn on the Green occupies a prominent position in Paignton, with the building extending to more than 27,300 sq ft and including a large adjoining car park.

The site, now vacant represents a significant redevelopment opportunity in a sought-after coastal location.

Located just a short walk from Paignton Pier and beach, the Inn on the Green enjoys uninterrupted sea views and easy access to the town centre’s amenities and attractions.

While the site is offered without planning consent, a previous application for conversion into a public car park was submitted but later withdrawn earlier this year.

Savills Auction has brought the property to market on behalf of a private client.

Steven Cane, Savills Auctions, said: ""The sale of the Inn on the Green presents a rare and exciting opportunity to acquire a substantial property in the sought-after seaside town of Paignton, Devon. Positioned on the coast of Tor Bay, this former hotel enjoys a prominent location with uninterrupted sea views, just a short walk from the pier and beach.

""We’re pleased to bring the hotel to market at our auction on June 17th. Offered with vacant possession, the property provides significant potential for development or asset management, subject to the necessary consents. And with a guide price that represents excellent value, we anticipate strong interest.""",https://www.insidermedia.com/uploads/news/images/inn_on_the_green_paington_savills_resized.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 11:57:04.426198

Departing from Toronto Pearson International Airport on the evening of June 6, 2025, and arriving in Prague the following day, the launch marks an exciting chapter in international connectivity between North America and Central Europe.

This new seasonal service, running through September 29, 2025, comes as part of Air Canada’s strategic plan to strengthen its European network while offering travelers more choice, convenience, and cultural access. Whether for leisure, business, or family travel, the Toronto–Prague route brings two vibrant destinations closer than ever before.

According to Mark Galardo, Executive Vice President & Chief Commercial Officer and President, Cargo at Air Canada, this new route is designed to appeal to a broad spectrum of travelers across the airline’s North American network, including those eager to explore Prague’s celebrated architecture, bohemian heritage, and UNESCO-listed old town, or for European travelers interested in discovering Canada’s rich natural and urban diversity.

A Gateway to One of Europe’s Most Enchanting Cities

Prague, the Czech capital, is famed for its medieval charm, cobblestone streets, and cultural landmarks like Prague Castle, the Astronomical Clock, Charles Bridge, and St. Vitus Cathedral. With this direct route, Canadian travelers can now reach one of Europe’s most visually stunning and historically significant cities without the hassle of layovers.

Simultaneously, Czech tourists can experience Canada’s renowned diversity, from the cosmopolitan energy of Toronto to the breathtaking wilderness of Banff, Vancouver, and the Rockies.

Air Canada’s European Expansion: A Summer of Strategic Routes

The Toronto–Prague flight is part of a broader summer expansion that includes several new and returning routes across Europe:

Montreal to Porto, inaugurated earlier this week

Toronto to Naples, launched in May 2025

Ottawa to London Heathrow, relaunched in April

Upcoming Montreal to Edinburgh route beginning at the end of June

These new connections reflect Air Canada’s effort to deepen international engagement, improve trade relations, and offer more robust tourism flows between Canada and Europe.

Flight Schedule and Aircraft Details

The new Prague route operates on the Airbus A330-300, a wide-body aircraft known for its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. The aircraft features:

Three cabin classes:

Air Canada Signature Class: Lie-flat seats, gourmet dining, and priority airport services

Premium Economy: Extra legroom, premium meals, and additional baggage allowance

Economy Class: Comfortable seating and full in-flight service

Flight AC934 departs Toronto at 21:40 on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, arriving in Prague at 12:10 the following day.

Flight AC935 returns from Prague at 13:40 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, arriving in Toronto at 16:50 the same day.

This schedule runs from June 6 to September 29, 2025.

Elevated Travel Experiences with Air Canada Signature Service

Air Canada continues to enhance its global image with award-winning service offerings. On the Toronto–Prague route, travelers can enjoy:

Air Canada Signature Class with lie-flat seats, priority boarding, and luxury meals crafted by top chefs

Maple Leaf Lounge access at major international hubs for eligible passengers

Aeroplan rewards, allowing passengers to earn and redeem points on flights, upgrades, hotels, car rentals, and more

In-flight entertainment, Wi-Fi, and multilingual service staff

These elevated services cater to both business and leisure travelers looking for comfort, connectivity, and exceptional service.

Why Prague? Strategic Benefits of the New Route

The selection of Prague as a new destination underlines Air Canada’s focus on connecting high-demand leisure and cultural cities. This route strengthens bilateral opportunities in several key areas:

Tourism: Prague continues to be one of the most visited cities in Europe, with over 8 million tourists annually. Canadians now have seamless access to this cultural gem.

Trade & Business: Improved air links foster greater business travel and potential for trade partnerships between Canadian and Czech companies.

Diaspora Travel: With a notable Czech diaspora in Canada, this route also supports VFR (visiting friends and relatives) travel.

Air Canada is also responding to growing demand from European tourists, many of whom seek adventure, natural beauty, and cultural variety in Canada.

Commitment to Sustainable Aviation

In line with its 2050 net-zero emissions goal, Air Canada emphasizes environmental responsibility. The Airbus A330-300 fleet is optimized for fuel efficiency, and the airline is investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fleet modernization.

This commitment supports both environmental stewardship and long-term operational efficiency, aligning with international aviation sustainability goals.

Booking and Loyalty Benefits Through Aeroplan

Air Canada’s loyalty program, Aeroplan, continues to stand out in the North American airline market. With this new route, members can:

Redeem points for flights to Prague and other European destinations

Use Points + Cash combinations for greater booking flexibility

Earn on flights, partner airlines, car rentals, and hotels

Access exclusive deals and bonus offers

As a member of the Star Alliance, Air Canada also provides easy connection to 45+ global airlines, enabling smooth multi-city European itineraries.

How to Book

Travelers can book flights directly via website or through the Air Canada app, travel agencies, and GDS platforms. Early booking is recommended due to limited seasonal availability and strong demand for summer travel.

Air Canada’s media center also provides visuals, updates, and route guides for agents, partners, and media outlets.

What This Means for Canadian and European Travel in 2025

This new Toronto–Prague flight is more than a convenience—it’s a gateway to culture, heritage, and opportunity. As travel rebounds across continents, airlines are investing in experiences that bring travelers closer to iconic destinations while supporting tourism recovery and international connectivity.

With its reputation for service excellence, broad international reach, and strong focus on sustainability, Air Canada’s Prague route stands out as a valuable addition to the 2025 transatlantic travel landscape.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Air-Canada-KRR-3.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 08:56:15.157009

A new report by the Africa Finance Corporation titled “State of Africa’s Infrastructure Report 2025,” which was obtained by Sunday PUNCH stated this.
It said, “In 2023, 55 per cent of Africa’s demand for petroleum products was met by imports.
As new energy infrastructure is built, it must also be resilient and capable of supporting future energy transitions.
With the right policy frameworks and blended finance models, Africa’s refinery network can be transformed into a critical foundation of the continent’s future energy resilience.","Nigeria and Angola are poised to spearhead Africa’s push for energy independence as the continent’s refining capacity is projected to climb to 90 per cent, up from just 45 per cent last year.

A new report by the Africa Finance Corporation titled “State of Africa’s Infrastructure Report 2025,” which was obtained by Sunday PUNCH stated this.

The report highlighted the shifting landscape in Africa’s energy sector driven by a wave of refinery investments, with Nigeria at the forefront, aided by the 650,000 barrels-per-day Dangote Refinery and the planned revival of state-owned facilities.

According to the AFC, Africa is edging towards self-sufficiency in petroleum products, stating that transportation, storage and distribution infrastructure must be upgraded to ensure fuel security.

If fully utilised, the report said refining capacity could meet up to 90 per cent of the continent’s fuel demand, compared to just 45 per cent last year.

The report revealed that over $16bn was needed for brownfield upgrades, modernising existing refineries to meet clean fuel standards and reduce reliance on imported fuels.

Simultaneously, greenfield investments, particularly in Nigeria and Angola, are critical for meeting future demand.

“First, brownfield upgrades: over $16 billion is needed to modernise existing refineries, meet clean fuel standards, and reduce reliance on imports. Second, greenfield investment is key to meeting future demand, with Nigeria and Angola emerging as new continental hubs,” the AFC stated.

It added that the two oil-rich nations were strategically positioned to anchor the continent’s refining resurgence.

Currently, Africa remains heavily dependent on fuel imports.

In 2023, 55 per cent of petroleum product demand was met through imports.

But the AFC believes this could fall drastically to 10 per cent, if existing and new refining capacity are optimised.

The report noted that the commissioning of Nigeria’s Dangote Refinery, alongside the phased reopening of the Port Harcourt and Warri refineries between 2024 and 2026, could significantly transform fuel security in the short term.

It said, “In 2023, 55 per cent of Africa’s demand for petroleum products was met by imports. However, if refining capacity were fully utilised, this number could drop to only 10 per cent.

“In that regard, the commissioning of the Dangote Refinery, along with the gradual re-opening of the Port Harcourt and Warri Refineries in Nigeria (2024-2026) could significantly transform the continent’s fuel security landscape in the short term.”

Still, the AFC cautioned that the Dangote Refinery alone will not be sufficient to meet Africa’s growing fuel demand, especially in light of prolonged refinery shutdowns in Libya and South Africa, as well as frequent disruptions in Egypt.

“More capacity addition is needed,” the report warned, calling for urgent attention to feedstock access, distribution infrastructure, and financing bottlenecks that currently hamper the sector,” he stated.

While Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil producer, the country has paradoxically been unable to consistently supply crude oil to its domestic refineries due to entrenched export contracts and limited local allocation.

The AFC further stated “the sector’s growth is closely tied to the modernisation of existing refineries in West and Central Africa, overcoming feedstock and financing challenges for new projects, and addressing critical infrastructure bottlenecks in transportation and distribution networks.

“To achieve fuel security and meet the continent’s increasing demand, Africa must prioritise investment in refinery upgrades, develop efficient distribution systems—including pipelines, railways, and diversified port infrastructure. As new energy infrastructure is built, it must also be resilient and capable of supporting future energy transitions. The successful integration of these elements will be crucial for achieving long-term fuel security and energy independence across the continent.

“Across West and Southern Africa in particular, a new wave of refinery investment can unlock efficiency, reduce fuel import bills, and enable countries to meet growing demand through cleaner, domestic production. With the right policy frameworks and blended finance models, Africa’s refinery network can be transformed into a critical foundation of the continent’s future energy resilience.

“Access to crude oil feedstock is another challenge that must be overcome, both for

producing and non-producing oil markets. Oil-producing companies mostly sell crude oil on the export market via long-term contracts and allocations with traders or financiers, leaving little space for the domestic supply. Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, is a good example given that it supplies crude oil to Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal’s refineries yet does not have enough oil to feed its facilities,” the AFC stated.

Beyond refining, the report stressed that transporting fuel by road was no longer sustainable, revealing that 83 per cent of petroleum products in Africa were moved by trucks, leading to congestion, higher costs, and logistical inefficiencies.

It called for a transition to railways and pipelines to ease fuel logistics.

Despite the cost-effectiveness of rail transport for bulk liquids, many existing railway-connected depots, especially in Cameroon, Angola, South Africa, and the DRC, require urgent rehabilitation and modernisation.

It also recommended designing multi-fuel adaptable pipelines that can support the future transport of sustainable aviation fuel, LPG, and hydrogen, thereby enhancing long-term infrastructure viability and attracting capital investment.

It noted, “Similarly, pipeline projects should be conceptualised by considering future reconversion opportunities to transport transitional fuels like sustainable aviation fuels, liquefied petroleum gas and hydrogen. By designing pipelines with multi-fuel adaptability and integration into broader logistics networks, developers can enhance project viability, attract long-term capital, and safeguard infrastructure against future market shifts.

“To be efficient and cheaper, fuel logistics must also move away from roads.

An assessment by CITAC and Puma Energy found that 83 per cent of oil products distributed in Africa were transported by trucks, leading to congestion and capacity constraints, given additional roads, loading and evacuation requirements.

This overreliance on trucking can be addressed with more efficient solutions like railways or pipelines, where feasible.

“Despite its cost-effectiveness and suitability for bulk liquid transport, the use of rail for petroleum products remains limited across Africa. Several markets—including Cameroon, Angola, the DRC, and South Africa—already have fuel depots and storage tanks connected to railway lines. However, several of these are state-owned assets in need of rehabilitation, asset integrity upgrades, and operational modernisation. In many cases, deteriorated rail infrastructure is the limiting factor. Yet, fuel transport volumes could serve as a reliable anchor to justify broader railway investments and revitalise national rail systems that support multi-sector logistics.”

In West and Southern Africa, a new wave of refining projects, if backed by effective policy frameworks and blended finance models can reduce import dependency and foster cleaner, domestic fuel production.

The report also stressed the importance of resilient, future-ready infrastructure to accommodate Africa’s eventual transition to cleaner energy sources, while still meeting near-term petroleum needs.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/03223610/DANGOTE-REFINERY.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 22:56:08.030087

Geburtstag. 2005 wurde es ins Leben gerufen, als die Treueprogramme Fréquence Plus von Air France und Flying Dutchman von KLM zusammengelegt wurden. Ziel war es, die besondere Beziehung und Verbindung der Reisenden zu den Fluggesellschaften der neuen Gruppe aufrechtzuerhalten und den Mitgliedern zu ermöglichen, ihrem Traumreiseerlebnis immer näher zu kommen.

Anfangs bestand Flying Blue aus Air France, KLM und Aircalin. 2010 schloss sich Tarom dem Programm an und 2013 folgte Transavia. Heute zählt das globale Treueprogramm fast 30 Millionen Mitglieder, nahezu 40 Partnerfluggesellschaften sowie mehr als 100 internationale und lokale Händler, bei denen Kunden Meilen sammeln und einlösen können.

Flying Blue wird regelmäßig als eines der besten Treueprogramme in Europa anerkannt. Der Reiseexperte Point.me hat es kürzlich zum „besten Airline Rewards-Programm der Welt“ gekürt, da es in nahezu allen wichtigen Kriterien, von der Großzügigkeit über die Qualität des Kundenservice bis zur Benutzerfreundlichkeit, Spitzenleistungen erzielt. Diese Auszeichnung spiegelt die Fähigkeit von Flying Blue wider, das Reiseerlebnis für seine Mitglieder zu verbessern und sich durch die Weiterentwicklung des Programms und seiner Dienstleistungen im Laufe der Jahre erfolgreich an sich ändernde Lebensgewohnheiten und Wünsche anzupassen.

Zu den wegweisenden Innovationen zählen u.a. die Einführung der neuen Ultimate-Stufe 2017 als Anerkennung für die Mitglieder mit einem sehr hohen Reisevolumen bei Air France und KLM, die Cash & Miles-Funktion, mit der Kunden verschiedene Zahlungsmethoden kombinieren können, und der Flying Blue Shop for Miles, mit dem Mitglieder seit 2018 bei ihren Online-Einkäufen bei einer Vielzahl von Partnern Meilen sammeln können.

Flying Blue entwickelt sich ständig weiter. 2022 wurde Flying Blue Family eingeführt, mit dem Reisende Meilen mit bis zu sieben Familienmitgliedern teilen können. 2023 und 2024 kamen Amazon und Uber zu der langen Liste der Partner hinzu, und 2023 präsentierte Flying Blue ein neues Logo. Dieses Jahr wird neben dem neuen Flying Blue Extra-Abonnement auch die mobile App Flying Blue+ in den Vereinigten Staaten und in Großbritannien eingeführt.

Zu guter Letzt bietet Flying Blue seinen Mitgliedern die Möglichkeit, ihre Großzügigkeit unter Beweis zu stellen, indem sie ihre Meilen nicht nur für Beiträge zu alternativen Treibstoffen (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel) einsetzen, sondern auch an NGOs und Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen spenden können. Im vergangenen Jahr spendeten die Mitglieder insgesamt 450 Millionen Meilen.

Heute können Mitglieder des Flying Blue-Programms auf der Grundlage der im Laufe des Jahres gesammelten Erfahrungspunkte (XP) einen von fünf Status erreichen: Explorer, Silver, Gold, Platinum und Ultimate, die ihnen verschiedene Vorteile bieten, von bevorzugtem Check-in und personalisierten Concierge-Services bis zu zusätzlichem Freigepäck, Zugang zu Flughafen-Lounges und Upgrades.

Anlässlich des 20. Geburtstags und als emotionale Hommage an ihre Mitglieder hat Fyling Blue eine neue, weltweite Kampagne mit dem Titel „Turning Miles into Memories, for 20 years“ (Meilen in Erinnerungen verwandeln, seit 20 Jahren) gestartet.

Parte da questa premessa Enilive, la società che per prima in Italia ha puntato sul biocarburante HVO, prodotto da materie prime al 100% rinnovabili e compatibile con gli attuali motori a gasolio. In Italia il combustibile, capace di tagliare dal 60 al 90% delle emissioni di gas serra (calcolare lungo tutto il ciclo di vita, rispetto al mix fossile di riferimento), viene prodotto nelle bioraffinerie di Enilive di Porto Marghera e Gela. Entrambi i siti industriali sono alimentati prevalentemente da materie prime di scarto e da residui.

La decarbonizzazione del settore dei trasporti può essere raggiunta con successo se si utilizzano, secondo il principio della neutralità tecnologica, tutte le soluzioni e i vettori energetici disponibili. E tra questi vettori, i biocarburanti Hvo hanno un ruolo fondamentale perché possono dare un contributo immediato alla riduzione delle emissioni, calcolate lungo l’intera catena del valore, del settore dei trasporti. Non solo su strada, ma anche per il trasporto aereo, marittimo e ferroviario. Grazie alla tecnologia proprietaria Ecofining, Eni dal 2014 produce un biocarburante da materie prime rinnovabili che può essere utilizzato in purezza nei motori diesel compatibili. Si chiama HVOlution: questo particolare combustibile oggi è disponibile in oltre 1.300 stazioni della rete Enilive in Europa.

A livello globale, le stime prevedono che la domanda di biocarburanti idrogenati aumenterà del 65% tra il 2024 e il 2028. Nel frattempo, la maggior parte degli Stati membri dell'Ue ha già stabilito aumenti annuali degli obiettivi di miscelazione dei biocarburanti a partire dal 2024, come parte degli obblighi previsti dalle direttive RED e, a partire dal 2025, dal ReFuelEU per il settore dell'aviazione. A gennaio di quest'anno Enilive ha annunciato l’avvio del primo impianto dedicato alla produzione di SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) nella bioraffineria di Gela, in Sicilia. Il SAF prodotto contiene il 100% di componente biogenica ed è idoneo a essere utilizzato in miscela con il jet fuel convenzionale fino al 50%. L’impianto di Gela ha una capacità produttiva di 400mila tonnellate l'anno, pari a quasi un terzo della domanda di SAF prevista in Europa nel 2025.

La controllata del Cane a sei zampe negli ultimi tre anni ha stretto accordi con diverse compagnie aeree per la fornitura di SAF, grazie alle prime produzioni realizzate in sinergia tra la bioraffineria Enilive di Gela e altri impianti Eni a partire da materie prime di scarto.

For corporations—especially multinationals in banking, retail, energy, and pharma—air travel is a necessity. But necessity must now be tempered with responsibility.

The question is no longer whether companies should address their aviation footprint. The question is how fast they can transform it.

Welcome to the era of sustainable aviation in corporate travel—a future shaped by science-based carbon targets, responsible travel policies, and innovative low-emission fuels. At McBride Corp México, we’ve worked alongside clients across sectors to reimagine executive mobility, logistics, and carbon strategies in line with emerging aviation sustainability standards.

This essay dives deep into how companies are building smarter, greener corporate travel systems—with carbon management as their compass.

The Business Travel Dilemma

Business air travel has long been a paradox for sustainability-conscious companies. On one hand, it fuels growth, connects global teams, and strengthens client relationships. On the other, each long-haul flight emits roughly 1 to 3 metric tons of CO₂ per passenger—the equivalent of driving a car for months.

As global sustainability frameworks like Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) become standard, corporate travel is being reevaluated through a climate lens.

Organizations that once set broad reduction goals are now setting granular KPIs: CO₂ per passenger-kilometer, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) uptake percentage, and offset integrity ratings.

From Policies to Practice: Greening Corporate Travel

Forward-thinking companies are embedding sustainability into their travel policies with real operational consequences. Common elements include:

Internal carbon pricing: Assigning a cost per ton of CO₂ to flights, influencing booking decisions.

Air-travel approval thresholds: Only flights above a certain carbon intensity or destination tier require senior approval.

Travel-free alternatives: Encouraging remote collaboration tools or regional hubs to replace non-essential flights.

Green vendor contracts: Partnering only with airlines that disclose SAF usage, carbon metrics, and net-zero commitments.

By 2026, many listed companies in the EU and North America will need to disclose such travel metrics as part of ESG reporting frameworks.

At McBride, our Carbon Management service helps clients map, measure, and optimize these changes with real-time dashboards and custom offset portfolios.

The Rise of Carbon Offsets in Aviation

Until alternative fuels become ubiquitous, carbon offsets remain the most widely used tool to address aviation emissions. But the conversation has matured. No longer are generic tree-planting schemes sufficient.

Leading firms now demand high-integrity, third-party verified carbon credits with co-benefits such as biodiversity preservation, indigenous community support, or water restoration.

Examples of next-gen aviation offsets include:

Blue carbon projects: Protecting mangroves and coastal ecosystems.

Biochar initiatives: Locking carbon in agricultural soil.

Tech-based removal: Direct air capture (DAC) and mineralization.

Yet offsets must not be seen as a guilt-free license to pollute. McBride advises clients to adopt a ""Reduce First, Offset Strategically"" policy, ensuring that emissions cuts are the priority.

Alternative Fuels: The Promise and the Barriers

If aviation has a future, it’s written in SAF—Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Produced from waste oils, agricultural residues, or even captured CO₂, SAF can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

SAF uptake is rising, with companies like Microsoft, Google, and DHL partnering with carriers to co-invest in fuel procurement. Still, SAF accounts for less than 1% of global aviation fuel, largely due to:

High cost (2–5x conventional jet fuel)

Limited supply and infrastructure

Regulatory complexity

To support adoption, McBride integrates SAF tracking modules within carbon inventories, helping clients both claim reductions and validate airline emissions disclosures.

We also facilitate group-buying consortia among clients, increasing SAF access and negotiating power across sectors.

Reimagining Executive Mobility

Sustainable aviation isn’t just about what you fly—it’s about whether you fly at all.

Innovative firms are building ""Virtual First"" mobility cultures, where physical travel is a last resort. They use:

Digital twins of global facilities for remote inspections

Holographic meetings and metaverse training

Carbon-based travel budgets by department

Some are also exploring flight class emission accounting—with economy seats emitting half the CO₂ of business class—and applying this to travel policy design.

The cultural shift is profound, and McBride supports clients in change management, internal communications, and aligning HR, finance, and sustainability teams around new norms.

The Role of Carbon Management in Sustainable Aviation

Every transformation needs a system. McBride’s Carbon Management framework integrates aviation sustainability with broader ESG goals through:

Corporate GHG inventory (Scopes 1, 2, and 3 air travel emissions)

Vendor benchmarking for airline sustainability claims

Science-based target alignment (SBTi and Net-Zero Standard)

Dynamic offset allocation with integrated SAF purchases

Annual reporting dashboards tailored to ISSB, CDP, and GRI

In our projects with firms in logistics, pharma, and IT, we’ve seen how embedding these tools unlocks data-driven decision making, cost efficiencies, and investor confidence.

Aviation and ESG Strategy Alignment

As ESG disclosures evolve from voluntary to mandatory, corporate aviation policies are now considered ESG material. Investors, insurers, and regulators look closely at how companies:

Disclose Scope 3 air travel emissions

Set science-aligned reduction targets

Demonstrate credible offsetting

Reduce absolute flight volumes year-over-year

A sustainable aviation program isn’t a siloed initiative—it’s an anchor for ESG leadership.

McBride embeds these principles into corporate ESG strategy, enabling clients to align with EU Taxonomy, CSRD, and other regulatory frameworks while reinforcing their corporate values.

Latin America: Strategic Leverage for Aviation Sustainability

While much of the SAF production and regulatory momentum is centered in Europe and North America, Latin America presents unique opportunities for aviation decarbonization:

Abundant bio-feedstocks for SAF (e.g., sugarcane bagasse, palm waste)

Untapped blue carbon projects in mangrove-rich coasts

Strong public-private interest in green aviation infrastructure

McBride has worked across Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Brazil to help clients build climate-aligned aviation supply chains, negotiate SAF sourcing, and align airport operations with circular economy principles.

The Road Ahead: Innovations in the Aviation Ecosystem

Emerging technologies may soon redefine corporate air travel:

Hydrogen-powered aircraft under development by Airbus and startups

Electric short-haul flights for regional commutes

Autonomous eVTOLs (electric air taxis) reducing urban flight emissions

While these are years from commercialization, forward-looking companies are scenario-planning today.

McBride provides strategic foresight analysis to help organizations prepare for technological shifts, policy reforms, and evolving stakeholder expectations.

Final Thoughts: From Altitude to Accountability

The future of corporate aviation is not flightless—it is flawless in impact, intentional in strategy, and aligned with a regenerative economy.

In an era where every ton of carbon counts, your organization’s flight decisions signal your true ESG priorities. Sustainable aviation isn’t just about fuel—it’s about future-proofing your brand, your compliance, and your leadership.

At McBride Corp México, we invite you to partner with us to build a climate-positive aviation model for your business—one that takes your ambitions sky high, without bringing the planet down.

Kim Reynolds on Friday signed into law legislation that outlines how the money will be spent, along with 24 other bills.

After three years of failing to advance legislation, Iowa lawmakers finally agreed on a spending plan for $56 million in national opioid settlement funds, as well as the tens of millions more expected to come to the state over the next decade-plus.

“The opioid crisis continues to impact Iowa families,” Reynolds said in a statement Friday. “I’m thankful the legislature reached an opioid settlement fund agreement this session to immediately distribute $29 million to providers and appropriate ongoing available funds to support early intervention, prevention, treatment and recovery.”

Under a compromise agreement among House and Senate Republican leadership and the governor’s office, lawmakers passed House File 1038 in May. The bill will allocate $29 million to fund 10 specific projects suggested by the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to address immediate needs or help expand services that are showing results in addressing opioid abuse.

The remaining $27 million will be split between HHS and the Iowa Attorney General’s Office, with 75 percent of settlement funds going to HHS and 25 percent to the Iowa AG’s office for crisis response, early intervention, treatment, and recovery for opioid addiction.

Opioids claimed the lives of 238 Iowans in 2023, according to state figures. Iowa’s annual opioid-related death rate peaked at 258 in 2021.

Open meetings law expansion

Penalties for violating the state’s open meetings laws will be increased and public information accessibility training will be required for most public officials under House File 706, which Reynolds signed into law Friday.

Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, who says the legislation aims to increase transparency in local and state government, originally introduced the legislation in 2024 in response to two events in Davenport. The first was the difficulty members of the public and media had accessing public records, including inspection reports, related to the 2023 partial building collapse in downtown Davenport. The second was when the city of Davenport approved a $1.6 million departure agreement with its city administrator without a public vote.

In April, the Senate amended the legislation to exempt security camera footage and identification card access system data for the Iowa Capitol building from open records requests.

The bill increases fines for public officials who do not follow the open meetings or records requirements from $100-$500 to $500-$2,500. The bill increases damages if a violation was knowingly committed from $1,000-$2,500 to $5,000-$12,500.

Under the legislation, newly elected or appointed public officials would be required to complete public records training provided by the Iowa Public Information Board within 90 days of taking oath or assuming office.

Tax incentive overhaul

Multiple state tax incentives will be repealed, adjusted and created, including ones awarded to businesses for research and development, under a bill singed into law by Reynolds.

Senate File 657 contains 17 provisions, including the creation of tax credits for film production and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the elimination of older credit programs.

It also overhauls the Research Activities Credit, a program that provides tax incentives to businesses, replacing it with the Research and Development Tax Credit Program. The new program, administered by the Iowa Economic Development Authority, will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that incur qualified research expenses in Iowa.

The creation of the Research and Development Tax Credit Program includes a provision that will allow the IEDA to take back credits awarded to businesses that close, lay off workers or knowingly employ individuals not authorized to legally work in Iowa.

Prohibiting ticket bots

The use of bots to purchase tickets or circumvent electronic queues or presale codes will be prohibited under Senate File 146, which Reynolds signed into law Friday. Bots are automated software programs that perform repetitive tasks over a network.

Similar legislation, dubbed “Taylor Swift bills,” came up in state capitols across the country after fans encountered difficulties purchasing tickets for Swift’s Eras tour in 2023 and 2024. Fans were either kicked out of the online ticket queue or were resold the tickets for much more than their face value.

The bill will require a ticket seller to report known violations of the bill’s provisions within five days of noticing one. It also requires the attorney general to establish an electronic reporting system to submit reports of bots.

The attorney general may bring civil action for using bots to obtain tickets, which could come with a civil penalty of up to $10,000.

Fetal development instruction

Reynolds signed a bill Friday that will require Iowa schools to include specific instruction and visual materials on pregnancy and fetal development, including a video, along with health curriculum for students in grades 5-12.

Senate File 175 will require schools to show:

Republicans amended the bill to prohibit schools from using “any book, article, outline, handout, video or other educational material” produced or provided by an entity that:

Previous, similar versions of the bill would have required schools use a specific video, titled “Baby Olivia” and produced by an anti-abortion rights organization, in schools’ human growth and development instruction. Medical and reproductive rights groups say the video provides scientifically inaccurate information.

Other bills

Other bills Reynolds signed on Friday include:

HF 189: Will require public schools to allow students enrolled in non-public schools to compete in extracurricular interscholastic athletic contests or competitions provided by public schools.

SF 288: Will provide more support for students at public universities in the state who are pregnant or who have recently given birth.

The credit distribution would be capped at $10 million and combined with the current Chemical Production Tax Credit.","DES MOINES — Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed legislation Friday that will repeal, adjust and create multiple tax credits, including ones awarded to businesses for research and development.

Senate File 657 contains 17 provisions, including the creation of tax credits for film production and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the elimination of older credit programs.

It also overhauls the Research Activities Credit, a program that provides tax incentives to businesses, replacing it with the Research and Development Tax Credit Program. The new program, administered by the Iowa Economic Development Authority, will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that incur qualified research expenses in Iowa.

The legislation passed the House 84-3 and in the Senate by 44-1.

Under the bill, qualifying businesses include those primarily engaged in sectors such as second-generation food innovation, crop protection, diagnostic analytics and immunotherapies, chip technologies and microelectronics, medical equipment and supplies, software and technology, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, consumer products and others.

The creation of the Research and Development Tax Credit Program includes a provision that will allow the IEDA to take back credits awarded to businesses that close, lay off workers or knowingly employ people not authorized to legally work in Iowa.

This provision comes from a bill introduced earlier in the session that would’ve clawed back Research Activities tax credits from businesses that implemented “mass layoffs” in 2024. The legislation was aimed at Deere & Co. after workforce layoffs over the past few years.

During Deere’s 2022 layoffs, it announced that work from the 250 jobs at the Waterloo facility would be moved to Ramos Component Works in Mexico, which was completed last year. The company has, however, repeatedly affirmed its commitment to U.S. manufacturing and has said the layoffs are responses to changes in the farm economy, not an effort to move jobs out of the U.S.

Republican Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, of Wilton, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said the provision will make sure that state funds don’t go to companies that lay off Iowa workers.

“Both provisions are designed to punish a company that knowingly hires undocumented immigrants and/or ships jobs out of the country or out of the state,” Kaufmann told reporters in May. “If you're doing either of those practices, you do not deserve our tax credits. I would have preferred a chainsaw approach. This is a scalpel approach, but at least it gives them (IEDA) a hammer.”

What else the bill does

The bill will also:

Repeal the Employer Child Care Tax Credit, which was established in 2022 to encourage Iowa businesses to address talent, recruitment and retention efforts through childcare benefits. Repealing the credit will increase general fund revenue by $740,000 in FY 2026 and $800,000 beginning in FY 2027.

Eliminate the High Quality Jobs Program. The program provides business assistance to offset some of the costs incurred to locate, expand or modernize an Iowa facility. The elimination will increase general fund revenue by $1.8 million in FY 2027.

Eliminate the Investments in Qualifying Business Tax Credit Program. The program is expected to increase general fund revenues by $1.3 million in FY 2027.

Repeal the Assistive Device Tax Credit. The tax credit is awarded to small business owners purchasing, renting or modifying an assistive device or making workplace modifications for an individual with a disability. The incentive was never utilized and repealing it will not have any financial impact on the state.

Create tax credit limits for the Workforce Housing Tax Incentives Program. The program, which provides tax benefits to developers to provide new housing, will receive an $8 million boost to a $43 million annual allocation.

Create the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production Tax Credit, which will be awarded to sustainable aviation fuel producers. The credit distribution would be capped at $10 million and combined with the current Chemical Production Tax Credit. The program is set to sunset in 2037.

Create the Iowa Film Production Incentive Program and Fund. The fund will be a two-year pilot program capped at $4 million in rebates to incentivize more in-state film production with tax credits. The rebates could be used for expenditures related to film production. The funding will be appropriated from the Sports Wagering Receipts Fund.

Moreover, the Government of India and the Reserve Bank must issue necessary directions to ensure time-bound transmission of this rate cut specifically to the sugar sector.
A Monetary Window to Structural Strengthening The RBI’s repo rate cut offers not just a fiscal relief, but a vital opportunity to reduce interest burdens, improve payment cycles, and reinvigorate diversification projects within the sugar sector.
Timely policy convergence between monetary institutions and government bodies is essential to revitalise the cooperative sugar sector — the economic and social lifeline of rural Maharashtra and several Indian states.","In a significant move aimed at stimulating economic activity and easing financial pressures, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reduced the Repo Rate by 0.5%, bringing it down from 6.00% to 5.50%. This monetary easing is particularly timely and impactful for the sugar industry, especially for cooperative sugar factories in Maharashtra and across India, which are reeling under severe financial burden due to high operational costs, and mounting interest liabilities.

Current Scenario: High Interest Costs and Heavy Borrowings

The average cooperative sugar factory in Maharashtra carries an annual working capital and term loan burden ranging from ₹300 to ₹500 crore. These borrowings are primarily used for:

-Cane procurement

-Manufacturing operations

-Ethanol and by-product production

-Ongoing infrastructure modernization

-Debt servicing of past liabilities

With interest rates hovering around 10% to 12% in recent years, the interest cost per MT of sugarcane crushed impacting the factory’s viability and ability to ensure timely cane price payments to farmers.

Impact of Repo Rate Reduction: Calculated Benefits

With the RBI slashing the repo rate by 50 basis points (0.5%), lending institutions are expected to pass on this benefit to industries, especially agri-based ones. Assuming the effective interest rate on working capital and term loans reduces from 11.00% to 10.50%, let’s assess the financial implications:

Thus, each factory stands to save ₹1.5 to ₹2.5 crore annually, translating into a direct relief of ₹25–₹30 per MT of cane crushed.

Broader Industry-Level Savings

a) With over 200 sugar factories operating across Maharashtra and many more across India, the cumulative interest cost relief for the sugar sector could exceed ₹300–₹400 crore annually, improving liquidity and helping units:

b) Ensure timely cane payments to farmers

Invest in ethanol capacity and green energy

C) Strengthen financial viability and repayment discipline

d) Comply with environmental mandates like ZLD

e) Strengthening Ethanol and Bioenergy Push

f) This interest rate relief also enhances the financial feasibility of ethanol, bio-CNG, and SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) projects. Lower capital cost directly improves IRR, making these green projects more attractive to private investors and cooperative entities alike.

g) Given the policy direction of achieving 20% ethanol blending and developing a future-ready green fuel ecosystem, such rate reductions must be seen as catalysts for long-term transformation.

Call for Action:

Equal Treatment for the Second Largest Agro-Industry. Though the sugar industry is not yet formally included under the RBI’s Priority Sector Lending (PSL) classification, it is in every sense a priority agro-processing industry — second only to the textile sector in size and rural employment generation. Its deep integration with agriculture, large-scale employment, and direct impact on rural incomes make it a crucial pillar of India’s agro-industrial ecosystem.

I Hence, all concerned commercial and cooperative banks must pass on the full benefit of the repo rate reduction to sugar factories — whether for working capital, term loans, or ethanol project financing.

Moreover, the Government of India and the Reserve Bank must issue necessary directions to ensure time-bound transmission of this rate cut specifically to the sugar sector.

Without such directive implementation, the intended benefit of the monetary easing may remain notional and fail to deliver tangible results where it is needed the most.

A Monetary Window to Structural Strengthening

Fake reviews on Amazon is a persistent problem that has been ongoing for many years. In 2020, a study by University of California, Los Angeles estimated that 30-40% of online reviews in certain categories on Amazon – particularly electronics, health and beauty and home goods – may be suspicious or fake.

This proliferation of disinformation is a growing issue given the significant influence it has on consumer choices.

The UK’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), estimates that around 90% of UK consumers use star ratings and online reviews, and as much as £23bn of UK consumer spending is potentially influenced by online reviews annually.

To crack down on this disinformation, the CMA launched an investigation into both Amazon and Google in 2021 over concerns that the two companies were breaching consumer law for not doing enough to protect people from fake reviews on their platforms.

As a result of this investigation, in January 2025 Google agreed to make significant changes to combat fake reviews and would report to the CMA over a three-year period to verify adherence to these changes.

Amazon has now followed suit, committing to put “rigorous processes” in place to detect and remove fake online reviews of products advertised on its UK site.

It has also committed to tackling ‘catalogue abuse’. This is where sellers hijack the reviews of well-performing products and add them to an entirely separate and different product. This falsely boosts the product’s star rating, misleading customers.

Amazon said it would additionally enforce tough sanctions on businesses that boost their star ratings via bogus reviews or catalogue abuse, including being banned entirely from Amazon’s UK marketplace.

Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, said: “These new commitments matter and help set the standard. They mean people can make decisions with greater confidence – knowing that those who seek to pull the wool over their eyes will be swiftly dealt with.”

“The undertakings from Amazon and Google, alongside our recently published advice to review platforms, paint a clear picture of what the law requires from businesses.”

The CMA is currently working to crack down on fake reviews on other review platforms to ensure they are complying with the strengthened laws around fake reviews.

Under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, which came into force in January 2025, the CMA can now decide independently whether consumer law has been infringed, rather than going through the courts.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-06/web_customers-reviews-feedback-on-amazon-product_Credit_Peace-loving_shutterstock_2268702027_1600x900.jpg?itok=QJn58ZEk,N,,2025-06-07 11:56:40.043371

Adopt sustainable fuel and help shape a cleaner, more sustainable future.","Posted on Jun 07, 2025 at 08:06 AM

In a world facing increasing environmental pressures and severe climate change, the transition to clean energy solutions is urgent. Many business owners, investors, and maritime operators are wondering: Is there a realistic and effective option to reduce carbon emissions without negatively impacting performance or costs? The answer is yes, and sustainable fuel is the essential solution to this dilemma.

Sustainable fuel is no longer an environmental luxury, but an economic and strategic necessity, especially in sectors where emissions reduction is difficult, such as shipping. Emission costs, rising conventional oil prices, and increasing environmental restrictions are all putting pressure on maritime companies to seek smart alternatives. This is where sustainable fuels emerge as a key element that changes the equation.

Definition and Transformative Role of Sustainable Fuels:

Basically, sustainable fuels are alternative fuels produced from renewable sources such as organic waste, vegetable oils, algae, and animal waste. These sources, called feedstocks, are converted using advanced technologies into biofuels such as biodiesel, ethanol, and even methanol. The goal? Reduce carbon emissions, enhance air quality, and lower marine pollution.

These fuels are derived from a variety of feedstocks, including used cooking lipids, animal fats, and food-processing residues. Not only do they lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over their lifecycle, but they also serve as a low-emission alternative to conventional fossil fuels.

Moreover, sustainable fuel supports existing marine engines with minimal adaptation, allowing vessels to operate efficiently without significant modifications; thus, while jet fuel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) have gained momentum in the aviation sector, similar innovations are now reshaping the maritime domain. Biofuel technologies originally developed for aircraft are influencing marine fuel advancements, enabling the integration of blended bio-components into ship operations as part of the broader shift toward sustainable shipping.

Environmental and Economic Significance of Sustainable Fuels:

With the growing need to mitigate GHG emissions, sustainable fuel becomes not only a tool for environmental benefit but also a strong business strategy. From the transportation sector to aviation, and from power generation to petroleum alternatives, the applications are diverse.

For example, Neste, a leading international player, and BP, a global oil and gas company, have launched initiatives to create sustainable fuels and enhance their worldwide production capabilities. Thus, these companies support programs that meet RFS (Renewable Fuel Standard) requirements and offer credits per gallon produced.

Statistics show that switching to biofuels can reduce emissions by over 80% compared to traditional fossil fuels. This energy transformation, supported by national policies and environmental associations, is also aligned with development goals for a sustainable future.

In addition, shipping management training courses in London now include modules on adopting sustainable fuel practices. These courses address critical topics such as feedstock selection, formula optimization, fuel cells, and hydrogen use for lowers emission strategies.

Challenges, Innovations, and Opportunities:

Despite the apparent benefits, challenges persist—particularly the high price and limited infrastructure, which remain significant barriers. Nevertheless, innovation and technology are driving rapid change, as new materials such as biomass, minerals, and liquid fuels are being tested. The outcome of these efforts can vary greatly depending on the plant type and the specific conversion pathway, highlighting both the complexity and potential of these emerging fuel solutions.

Projects funded by major international organizations explore corn-based, ethanol-rich biofuel options. Others focus on hydrogen-based solutions for vessels, ships, and airport logistics. As more facilities are built, scale and efficiency improve.

Moreover, the history of sustainable fuel has shown that what began as a niche concept is now a robust, pivotal, and scalable option. Types of fuels now feature co-processed, integrated formulations that can substitute legacy marine fuels in difficult-to-decarbonize maritime domains.

Companies that meet regulatory benchmarks and qualify under RFS schemes can benefit from institutional backing, credits, and mitigation incentives. These programs not only encourage compliance but also expand market access.

From PX (paraxylene) extraction in refining to wheels turning on biofuel, the entire life cycle is being reimagined. Sustainable fuels are not just a passing trend—they are a crucial actor in a growing industry with undeniable impact.

Conclusion: Why You Should Adopt Sustainable Fuel Now

If you're aiming to lower your carbon footprint, replace legacy marine fuels, and comply with maritime-wide regulations, the time to act is now. The advantages extend beyond environmental improvements—they encompass economic value, strategic repositioning, and technological advancement.

Whether you're managing a maritime operation, overseeing transportation, working in aviation, or involved in petroleum supply chains in the USA or elsewhere, be sure transitioning to sustainable fuel will help you future-proof your operations.

Don't wait for change—create it. Adopt sustainable fuel and help shape a cleaner, more sustainable future.",,N,,2025-06-07 08:56:09.346665

The problem of mandates Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on January 1.
“Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel,” IATA said.
Developing a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF: Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived.
Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production.","IATA says it expects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to reach two million tonnes (2,5 billion litres) or 0,7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

However, it has warned that government policies and compliance fees are currently increasing the cost of SAF, especially in Europe.

IATA DG, Willie Walsh, said while it was encouraging that SAF production was expected to double to two million tonnes this year, it would add US$4,4 billion (R78,8bn) globally to the fuel bill.

“The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Walsh.

The problem of mandates

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on January 1.

“Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is US$1,2 billion (R21,5bn),” IATA said in a press release.

IATA added that compliance fees were estimated to add an additional US$1,7 billion (R30,5bn) on top of market prices – an amount that could have reduced an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

“Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel,” IATA said.

Walsh said it highlighted the problem with the implementation of mandates before there were sufficient market conditions and before safeguards were in place against unreasonable market practices that raised the cost of decarbonisation.

“Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering US$4,7 trillion (R84,2trn) should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realise that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.

IATA has urged governments to focus on three areas:

Creating more effective policies: Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular.

Developing a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF: Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production.

Ensuring the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO₂ emissions: IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date, Guyana is the only state to have made its carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against its CORSIA obligations.",https://katakenya.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cropped-cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-07 10:56:33.096821

Thailand’s Vietjet has taken a bold and transformative step towards environmental responsibility with the launch of its groundbreaking Green Route programme. This innovative initiative aims to drastically reduce carbon emissions and drive sustainable aviation practices by expanding the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) across both domestic and international routes. The programme not only sets a new benchmark for the airline’s commitment to eco-friendly air travel but also aligns with the global push for greener skies. With its ambitious targets and cutting-edge approach, Vietjet is revolutionizing the aviation industry, making a powerful statement about the future of sustainable travel in Southeast Asia.

Vietjet Thailand has taken a significant step forward in its commitment to sustainable aviation with the official launch of its Green Route initiative. This new program marks a pivotal moment in the airline’s ongoing efforts to reduce its environmental impact and contribute to a greener future for the aviation industry. By expanding the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) across its commercial routes, Vietjet Thailand is making a clear statement about its dedication to responsible environmental practices and sustainable travel.

The Green Route initiative represents a bold move towards greener skies, with the airline focusing on the expansion of SAF usage across both domestic and international routes. This includes key services such as the popular flights from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and Bangkok to Phu Quoc, both of which are set to begin utilizing SAF starting in the third quarter of this year. The introduction of SAF on these routes marks a crucial step in the airline’s long-term commitment to sustainability and showcases Vietjet Thailand’s proactive approach to reducing carbon emissions in its operations.

Once fully implemented, the Green Route initiative will not only help reduce the airline’s carbon footprint but also lay the foundation for a broader push towards sustainable aviation in Southeast Asia. The initiative is a part of Vietjet Thailand’s ongoing strategy to adopt eco-friendly technologies and practices, ensuring that the airline stays at the forefront of global efforts to minimize the environmental impact of air travel.

In addition to introducing SAF on specific routes, Vietjet Thailand has set ambitious targets for the future of SAF usage within its operations. The airline aims to ensure that at least one percent of its fuel consumption comes from SAF by 2026, with the goal of reaching five percent by 2030. These targets are in line with the global aviation industry’s efforts to reduce emissions and meet the commitments outlined in international climate agreements, such as the Paris Agreement.

These benchmarks are important for the aviation sector, which is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions. The industry’s transition to SAF is seen as a crucial step in reducing its environmental impact while still meeting the growing demand for air travel. By committing to SAF, Vietjet Thailand is helping to drive positive change within the aviation sector and align with the broader global goal of achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century.

This new initiative builds on Vietjet Thailand’s recent accomplishments in the field of sustainable aviation. In July 2024, the airline achieved a historic milestone by operating its first-ever commercial flight using SAF. This flight, which was on the Bangkok–Da Nang route, marked the airline’s first step toward incorporating SAF into its regular operations. The successful operation of this flight using SAF demonstrated the airline’s technical readiness and highlighted the potential of SAF as a viable alternative to traditional jet fuel.

The launch of the Green Route initiative is a logical next step for Vietjet Thailand, following its successful SAF flight. It reflects the airline’s long-term vision for sustainable aviation, with a strong focus on implementing innovative solutions that contribute to the reduction of the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. The Green Route program not only strengthens Vietjet Thailand’s position as a leader in sustainable aviation but also serves as an example for other airlines in the region looking to implement similar environmentally friendly initiatives.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is widely recognized as one of the most effective solutions for reducing the aviation industry’s carbon emissions. SAF is made from renewable sources such as plant-based oils, waste materials, and other sustainable feedstocks, making it a more eco-friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel. Over its lifecycle, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a powerful tool in the fight against climate change.

The adoption of SAF by Vietjet Thailand aligns with the sustainability strategies of both governments and private sectors worldwide. Many countries and organizations are supporting the development and use of SAF as part of their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming. In addition to its environmental benefits, SAF can also contribute to energy security by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and encouraging the use of locally sourced materials.

The Green Route initiative also underscores the growing importance of sustainability in the aviation industry. As airlines around the world face increasing pressure to reduce their environmental impact, initiatives like Vietjet Thailand’s Green Route program are becoming more common. By setting clear targets for SAF usage and expanding its adoption across key routes, Vietjet Thailand is taking a leadership role in the global push for a more sustainable aviation industry.

Looking ahead, Vietjet Thailand’s Green Route initiative is set to be a key driver of the airline’s ongoing efforts to become more environmentally responsible. The successful implementation of SAF on its commercial routes will not only contribute to the airline’s sustainability goals but also help set a positive example for other airlines in the region. As the airline continues to expand its use of SAF and explore new eco-friendly technologies, it is clear that Vietjet Thailand is committed to making a meaningful contribution to a greener future for aviation.

Thailand’s Vietjet has launched its bold Green Route programme, setting a new standard in sustainable aviation. This initiative aims to reduce carbon emissions by expanding the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on key domestic and international routes.

Through initiatives like the Green Route program, Vietjet Thailand is not only demonstrating its commitment to sustainability but also positioning itself as a forward-thinking airline ready to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world. As the global aviation industry continues to evolve, the airline’s dedication to environmentally responsible practices will play a crucial role in shaping the future of air travel.

Some 4.5 million passengers a year travel between the UK and India, while around seven million travel between the US and India, said Weiss.
“We all know the journey that Virgin Atlantic has been on through the pandemic.
Weiss confirmed Virgin Atlantic is seeking compensation from Heathrow for the disruption caused by the airport closure, but says it is not doing so “out of spite” but out of a “shared vision for the future”.
The airline will “absolutely” meet that requirement this year, says Weiss, but highlights supply issues and the challenging adoption curve.","BTN Europe editor Andy Hoskins sat down with Virgin Atlantic CEO Shai Weiss at IATA’s 2025 AGM in New Delhi at the beginning of June to discuss the airline’s evolving footprint in India, its core transatlantic operations, Heathrow’s challenges, the pace of business travel’s recovery, and how NDC and alternative aviation fuels are shaping the airline’s future.

Virgin Atlantic’s name may pay homage to its core North American market, but its expanding network in India signals a commitment to long-haul growth across both east and west.

“We’ve been operating into India for 25 years and we now have one million seats a year,” says the airline’s CEO Shai Weiss. The growth has been rapid. “In 2019, we had only one flight to Delhi. Now we operate five flights a day to India [from the UK]. That shows you the opportunity here.”

That potential is underpinned by demographics and data that Weiss shared at a press conference in Delhi in which Virgin Atlantic, Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines and fast-growing Indian airline IndiGo announced a strategic partnership that will connect their networks.

Some 4.5 million passengers a year travel between the UK and India, while around seven million travel between the US and India, said Weiss. Meanwhile, less than 10 per cent of India’s population has a passport and the country’s economy grew by 7.4 per cent in the first quarter of the year. “The opportunity for growth here is phenomenal,” says Weiss.

Virgin’s footprint in India comprises twice-daily services from London Heathrow to both Delhi and Mumbai, while a daily service to the tech hub of Bengaluru took-off in April 2024. That route is performing “all to plan,” according to Weiss, despite the fierce competitive environment. “These are tough markets; there’s a lot of competition. As soon as we announce we’re doing something, you see others increase their capacity.”

The transatlantic picture

While India’s potential is future-facing, Virgin’s financial lifeline remains its transatlantic business, especially to the United States. Its 2024 financial results revealed “another year of record revenues, record EBITDA, record operating profits and a return to modest profit,” says Weiss.

“We all know the journey that Virgin Atlantic has been on through the pandemic. I think the most important number – beyond the customer satisfaction [score], which is always highest across our competitors – was the fact that our operating profit was £230 million, which gave us about a 7 per cent margin. That puts us on a page slightly ahead of easyJet and Air France,” he noted.

The airline's 2024 financial results also stated that 40 per cent of its revenue originated in the US – double that of a decade ago, says Weiss, though political developments in 2025 could threaten that achievement.

A “phenomenal” Q1 was followed in April by a “shakeup and great uncertainty” in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s drastic trade tariffs. “The volumes are there but what we’re seeing is a bit of pressure on price,” says Weiss. “I don’t think this year’s going to end up as we expected it to be... there's greater uncertainty yet to come. We're all waiting to see what happens with the stay of execution [on the tariffs].”

Weiss highlights his airline’s resilience, however, pointing to 9/11, the global financial crisis and the Covid pandemic as more significant challenges that the carrier has seen off. “Uncertainty comes and goes and we continue. When we look at our operation and how we run the company, there’s not much I would change. We compete hard and we’re doing quite well versus the competition.”

Corporate conundrums

Nevertheless, there is more work to be done, says Weiss, with announcements due later in the year “to explain some tweaks” that will support “greater profitability in the years to come”.

“We’ll talk in July; it’s nothing major,” says Weiss, who declined to provide further details. “It's very much the continuation of a premium carrier. It will reinforce our position as a premium carrier focused both on the leisure market as our traditional heartland, but over the last decade we've become a really solid business carrier too, of course, in line with Delta and Air France KLM.”

It's well-documented that, while premium leisure travel drove many airlines’ post-Covid recovery, corporate travel has been slower to return, with companies watching budgets and considering their sustainability strategies.

Nevertheless, Weiss remains optimistic about a full recovery in business travel. “Our target was to be in the mid-80s [per cent recovered] in 2024 and I think we’re there. When do we get to 100 per cent? That’s hard to say right now, but I do think we will get there, whether it’s this year or probably the next or following year.”

He continues: “Behaviourally, we're seeing that there is a real quest to meet and to make an impact on each other. The more time that passes since pandemic, the greater the desire to be together in person, so I'm not in doubt that we will get to 100 per cent.”

Speaking out on Heathrow

Weiss doesn’t pull any punches when it comes to discussing London’s Heathrow Airport. He, along with many airline CEOs, has been critical of the hub’s high costs, service delivery and monopoly position.

In February, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways’ parent company IAG, the Arora Group and the Heathrow Airline Operators’ Committee (AOC) came together to launch Heathrow Reimagined: A better hub for Britain, calling for ‘urgent and fundamental reform’ of the airport’s regulatory model.

Matters were made worse in March when a fire at a local substation caused a power outage that forced the airport to close for most of the day, exposing the airport’s vulnerable contingency plans.

In May, Weiss and Luis Gallego, the CEO of British Airways’ parent company IAG, conducted a rare joint interview with The Times in which they demanded greater influence in investment decisions and control of airport infrastructure.

Weiss confirmed Virgin Atlantic is seeking compensation from Heathrow for the disruption caused by the airport closure, but says it is not doing so “out of spite” but out of a “shared vision for the future”. He adds: “We’ve been very clear with our partners that the disruption cost us a lot of money. We expect them to do the right thing.”

The airline has reviewed the Kelly report into the incident and sees room for improvement. “The most important observation was on the resilience of [the airport's] energy systems. That needs addressing,” says Weiss.

But his criticism is constructive. “This is our home. Everything we’re doing is out of a shared vision for the future,” he says. “The point that we're making about Heathrow is about how you run an efficient airport in one of the most, if not the most attractive channel in the world, which we are a flag carrier at. We have a very strong partnership with Heathrow, [but] we want them to improve because it's important to us, our guests and the country.”

Virgin’s position on the addition of a third runway at Heathrow remains conditional. “Does the country deserve it? Yes. Should it be operated? Yes,” says Weiss. “The point is, how do you change the regulatory environment for better outcomes for consumers? And how do you incentivise Heathrow to be more efficient? If we get it right, it's a tremendous opportunity. The flip side is, if you just stay with the status quo, it's simply not fit for purpose.”

NDC's ponderous progress

The speed of airlines’ roll-out of IATA’s New Distribution Capability initiative has varied greatly, but Virgin is among the slower adopters. While others have moved quickly – sometimes too quickly – Virgin is gearing up to distribute NDC content via aggregators in the second half of this year. NDC content integrated via the GDSs is expected to follow, but the airline declined to provide further information when asked for more details on the roll-out.

“This is modern retailing. It's the ability to provide flexibility and ancillary services for individuals – whether through a TMC or directly – and to mix and match a journey that is fitting for them. This is all about personalisation,” says Weiss, admitting that “it is also a cost thing” that can help airlines’ reduce their distribution costs and increase revenues.

Weiss concedes that Virgin and its joint venture partner Delta Air Lines have “moved a bit slower than some of our competitors,” before adding that others “have gone too fast” – referring to American Airlines’ dramatic U-turn last year.

Virgin’s systems run on Delta’s technology and platform. “We benefit from that stability,” says Weiss, noting that full offer-order capabilities – what he calls “the holy grail” – will take time.

The alternative fuels dilemma

Virgin Atlantic continues to be a vocal leader in the adoption of alternative aviation fuels – commonly referred to as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – and proudly operated a flight between London and New York in November 2023 powered entirely by SAF.

Both the UK and EU have introduced SAF mandates which, in the first instance, require airlines to ensure 2 per cent of fuel used in 2025 is alternative aviation fuel. The airline will “absolutely” meet that requirement this year, says Weiss, but highlights supply issues and the challenging adoption curve.

“In the short term it’s actually ok, but then it gets complicated,” he says. “If you allow for HEFA, which is first generation bio SAF, it's going to be a bit easier to fulfil. Second generation fuel, which is supposed to come from ‘27 and ‘28 is not abundant at all. And that's really the point of our discussions with the government.”

In the UK, the alternative fuel mandate increases linearly to 10 per cent by 2030 and to 22 per cent by 2040. “It’s an ambitious plan and we think it’s going to be a problem in the UK. But the UK and Europe have not changed their opinions on it, and neither are we. My statement is always true: you make it, we'll fly it.”",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTNE/uploadedImages/BTN_Research/Shai%20Weiss%20CEO%20Virgin%20Atlantic%20300x300(1).jpeg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-06-07 06:57:18.517233

Alcohol-to-jet stuck on runway as US policy shifts

New York, 4 June (Argus) — Proposed changes to a US clean fuel tax credit may be a boon for farmers, but a future where ethanol is a major ingredient in jet fuel remains far off. The massive Republican budget bill currently advancing through Congress would extend the ""45Z"" credit, which offers larger subsidies to fuels as they produce fewer emissions. The proposal too would bar regulators from weighing indirect land use impacts , effectively upping subsidies for crop-based fuels like ethanol, in a win for agribusiness. Farm groups have hoped that such changes could open the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market to ethanol producers, otherwise at risk from an increasingly efficient and electric US vehicle fleet. Airlines too are eager for more diverse SAF sources since the main pathway nowadays, processing vegetable oils and animal fats, draws from more limited feedstocks. United Airlines government affairs director Tom Michels said at an OurEnergyPolicy forum earlier this year that the company hopes ethanol-based fuel ""could fulfill around a quarter of our future SAF needs."" But incentives in law and under the proposal, which passed the House last month, would do little to boost ""alcohol-to-jet"" output. While ethanol typically trades at a discount to gasoline, SAF is substantially more expensive than petroleum, making government support essential for uptake. The Republican caucus has a range of views, with clean energy advocates wary of phasing out subsidies, farm-state representatives intent on boosting biofuels, and conservatives committed to curbing government spending. Republicans plan to use a process called reconciliation that allows them to pass the bill without Democratic support. How policymakers implement 45Z will be crucial for a wave of alcohol-to-jet startups eyeing production this decade. That includes Gevo, whose plans for an integrated 60mn USG/yr plant in South Dakota are complicated by another company's struggles starting an interstate carbon pipeline. Meanwhile, people familiar with the matter say that LanzaJet's 10mn USG/yr alcohol-to-jet pilot project in Georgia — which opened last year but is not yet fully operational — is not currently producing any SAF. ""The suite of policies we would need to make ethanol-to-jet pencil out just does not exist right now,"" said Brian Jennings, chief executive of the American Coalition for Ethanol. RINs wear thin Ethanol-based SAF would likely still produce too many emissions to claim any 45Z subsidy even if the proposed emissions tracking changes took effect — since the pathway requires more energy-intensive processing to make fuel suitable for jet engines. Carbon capture could make up the difference, though few facilities have that capability. The lack of subsidy would compound barriers from the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners to blend biofuels or buy credits from those who do. Under the program, blending corn ethanol earns a Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit, but there is no certified pathway yet to offer RINs for corn-based SAF blending. Even if there were, advanced biofuel credits have traded recently at only a slight premium, reducing the incentive for ethanol producers to eye new markets. Argus last assessed current year D4 biomass-based diesel credits at 92.25¢/RIN and D6 conventional credits at 86.50¢/RIN, and they traded at parity much of last year. Meanwhile, the typical US dry mill ethanol producer would likely qualify for some 45Z subsidy if the Republican bill passed, adding to RIN benefits. Those plants would have to forgo both incentives to sell to SAF makers. It is unclear how producers of a more-expensive and less-subsidized SAF could compete on price. Gevo chief executive Patrick Gruber said that his company's integrated model — producing ethanol and SAF at the same sites — is less risky than buying ethanol from elsewhere. But there are other policy headwinds. A new South Dakota law to restrict eminent domain could derail Summit Carbon's planned multistate carbon pipeline, which dozens of biorefineries, including one Gevo facility, want to join. Gevo has purchased a North Dakota biorefinery that can already capture carbon on site, a potentially lucrative workaround to pipeline delays, and is eyeing SAF production there too. There is a RIN pathway for SAF from Brazilian sugarcane ethanol — a model that LanzaJet has pursued — but credit pricing makes economics challenging there too, adding to freight and tariff costs . Even then, the bill to change 45Z would restrict eligibility to North American feedstocks, upending LanzaJet's plans for Brazilian ethanol without making US alternatives more economical. ""45Z as currently drafted creates a disincentive for US ethanol to be used in SAF,"" said LanzaJet vice president of government and regulatory affairs Angela Foster-Rice. ""We are hopeful to get this issue addressed in the Senate bill."" Despite policy uncertainty, airlines have committed to procuring far more SAF and might be willing to pay a premium. But they are more likely to pay up for fuel they can at least use for SAF mandates in the EU and UK, which do not credit fuels from first-generation crops. US federal and state programs subsidize lower-carbon jet fuels but do not mandate usage. The floor is yours The Republican bill is still just a proposal, leaving the possibility for changes. The Senate reconvened this week with a goal of passing the bill before 4 July, and members have signaled they might take a different approach to clean energy subsidies than the House. Some biofuel lobbyists support shifting rules to benefit SAF — potentially by providing a higher ""floor"" credit for refiners that barely qualify or allowing alcohol-to-jet producers to claim the same benefit as upstream ethanol refiners. Under current rules, fuels may earn just cents per gallon. But such changes could rile trucking groups frustrated with 45Z already offering heftier subsidies to SAF and deficit hawks worried about the bill's mounting costs.

Shell diverts Ostra crude to USGC in rare move

Singapore, 4 June (Argus) — Two cargoes of May-loading Brazilian heavy sweet Ostra crude appear to have been diverted to the US Gulf coast for refining, instead of heading to their typical destination of Singapore for use in very-low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) blending, trading sources told Argus . Ostra crude has a gravity around 20-24°API and sulphur content close to 0.35pc, and is shipped from the 100,000 b/d Espirito Santo floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, connected to Brazil's offshore Ostra field. A cargo of Ostra crude loaded onto the Loire vessel from the Espirito Santo at the end of May and is currently declaring for discharge at the US Gulf coast, according to data from global trade analytics platform Kpler. The cargo is likely intended for refinery feedstock, traders said. And another cargo of Ostra crude loaded onto the Sonangol Kulumbimbi in early May, with the cargo expected to discharge in the Gulf coast this week, Kpler data show. These trade flows are unusual as Ostra crude — typically lifted by Shell at volumes of around 150,000t/month — is almost always shipped to the Singapore strait for VLSFO blending. The last recorded delivery to the US Gulf coast was in June 2023. Strong products crack spreads, particularly for gasoline and diesel, likely supported the decision to reroute the cargoes for refining in the US Gulf. Forward month VLSFO east-west spreads are hovering in the low $30s/t at present, making it unattractive to send cargoes east, a Singapore-based fuel oil trader said. A recent tightening in heavy crude supply in the US — driven by the discontinuation of Venezuelan crude exports and concerns about potential wildfire-related crude supply disruptions in Canada — may have also supported the rare exports. The diversion of around 150,000t of Ostra crude will tighten Singapore VLSFO balances for July, at a time when the arrival of replenishment supplies from Europe was due to offer some reprieve in the market. The Argus- assessed June-July and July-August VLSFO time spreads rose on the session, assessed at $7.50/t and $5.25/t, respectively, on 4 June, up from $6.75/t and $4.50/t on 3 June. VLSFO supplies are expected to remain tight throughout June, with the majority of European supplies — or around 4-5 Suezmax cargoes — due to arrive from early to mid-July onwards.

Mexico factory contraction extends into May

Mexico City, 3 June (Argus) — Manufacturing activity in Mexico contracted for a 14th consecutive month in May, though at a slower pace, according to a purchasing managers' survey. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 47.4 in May from 45.5 in April, marking the 14th consecutive month below the 50-point threshold between contraction and expansion, the finance executives' association IMEF said. The subindex for new orders increased by 2.7 percentage points to 44.4, recovering from a post-pandemic low in April. The production subindex rose by 3.1 points to 46.6, while employment held almost steady at 44.6. New orders and production have now been in contraction for 15 consecutive months, and employment for 16. The inventories subindex rebounded by 5 points to 51.2 in May, returning to expansion after one month in contraction. The upticks in May likely reflect firms restarting production to process backlogged orders previously paused because of US tariff uncertainty and re-build inventories as new orders also began to arrive last month, IMEF's head of economic studies Victor Herrera told Argus. ""The initial implementation of tariffs led many to put the brakes on production, but this was ultimately short-lived, as reorders started to come through,"" Herrera said. The non-manufacturing PMI — covering services, commerce and trade — also rose slightly to 49.4 in May from 49.1 in April, marking a sixth month in contraction, under 50. Within that index, new orders increased by 0.7 points to 48.8, production by 1.7 points to 49.5 and employment fell by 0.4 points to 48.5. IMEF, which compiles the PMIs with statistics agency Inegi, said both indexes remain in contraction and May data ""confirm the fragility of the Mexican economy at the beginning of the second quarter, in line with a weak growth trajectory and lack of sustained momentum.""

It is a similar story when looking at data centers.
Tim Walz said, “Data centers travel in packs, they travel in groups, and you get one and you get a big one.
Fighting for jobs, capital and a future tax base.
Walz and leaders of both parties to prioritize our state’s future economic opportunities in these industries.","Innovation has built Minnesota’s economy, and it depends on economic and regulatory certainty. Given international and national trends, innovation and certainty are more critical to grow Minnesota’s economy now than ever before.

That’s why in the final days of the legislative session, a broad range of business, labor and other economic champions of Minnesota are sounding the alarm. The state is risking significant future investment by not agreeing to and passing a tax bill that recognizes two emerging industries: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and data centers.

A report released last week from the Minnesota Chamber Foundation shows the importance of broad investment in future economic development. Two $5 billion megaprojects were announced for Minnesota in 2024, accounting for over 80% of the state’s total business capital investment commitments.

According to the report, “These two proposed projects alone — a SAF facility in Moorhead and a data center development in the south Metro — plan to bring $10 billion in new capital investments to the state. These projects are still in proposal stages, and final outcomes are not guaranteed. However, they represent among the largest expansions in the state’s recent history should they come to fruition.”

These projects would make Minnesota more economically competitive. Each sector would mean further investment in the decades to come. Politically speaking, each has broad bipartisan support.

Minnesota has been looked at as a SAF leader in the U.S. and around the world since it passed one of the first SAF tax credits in 2023. The state SAF tax credit enabled the newly created MN SAF Hub to make fast progress out of the gate in executing its strategy, and helped give Minnesota an early lead in the global SAF race. But other states are looking to seize on the economic development opportunities related to SAF as well.

Since Minnesota took action in 2023, Illinois, Washington, Colorado, Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa have all passed their own legislation to promote a SAF economy. Minnesota is leading, but the bipartisan SAF bill that has support from both the agriculture and environment communities is not guaranteed to pass — and if it doesn’t it would leave Minnesota to chase other states and lose our competitive edge.

It is a similar story when looking at data centers. A broad coalition of businesses, labor and environmental groups have worked together on data center legislation that will incentivize the responsible development of data centers, while protecting the environment and ratepayers. This same legislation has been endorsed by a broad,bipartisan coalition of legislators.

Just last fall, Minnesota was touting itself as a leader in attracting these future technology hubs to our state. Our weather and climate are advantages. At the groundbreaking for a large-scale data center last year, Gov. Tim Walz said, “Data centers travel in packs, they travel in groups, and you get one and you get a big one. And we’d had more before. And so we’ll be more to this.”

The data center tax incentive is scheduled to sunset and needs to be extended and modernized in order to be competitive with our peer states such as Iowa, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Just last week, Iowa announced a multibillion-dollar data center investment.

Both SAF and data centers mean jobs — construction jobs, high-tech jobs, across diverse sectors of agriculture, energy, AI, and transportation throughout the entire state.

Elected officials at the capitol are putting these investments at risk without taking action to support these industries in the tax bill. In an era of polarization, bipartisan legislation is worth fighting for. Fighting for jobs, capital and a future tax base.

We won’t stop working to keep investments coming to Minnesota. We call on Gov. Walz and leaders of both parties to prioritize our state’s future economic opportunities in these industries.

BC's SAF mandate faces global headwinds -,"Geoff Russ, Resource Works, Stewart Muir",,,,,https://resourceworks.com/doubling-down-on-sustainable-aviation-fuel-is-the-wrong-move-at-the-wrong-time/,"This is decidedly off-course from what is happening in the rest of the world, where SAF production is still limited, very expensive, and being sidelined.
British Columbia’s ambitious plan to require Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) targets is misguided and will put the province on the fringes of the airline industry.
Currently, BC’s SAF policy is aimed at cutting emissions caused by air travel to help the province meet its climate goals.
BC’s SAF policy aims to rapidly expand sustainable aviation fuel production and use, significantly cutting aviation-related pollution and carbon emissions.
Finally, economic studies show that the costs of SAF mandates always end up being passed on to consumers.","The BC Chamber of Commerce has passed a resolution saying that BC has uniquely strict rules in North America regarding SAF, with target mandates of 1 percent of jet fuel in 2028, which is set to rise quickly to 3 percent by 2030. This is decidedly off-course from what is happening in the rest of the world, where SAF production is still limited, very expensive, and being sidelined.

On January 1, 2026, the BC Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) will require a 2 percent reduction in carbon intensity (CI) for jet fuel, marking the first stage of a progressive increase that is part of BC’s broader effort to incorporate SAF into the aviation fuel supply.

British Columbia’s ambitious plan to require Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) targets is misguided and will put the province on the fringes of the airline industry.

Currently, BC’s SAF policy is aimed at cutting emissions caused by air travel to help the province meet its climate goals. Furthermore, the government has touted it as an opportunity to stimulate investment in clean tech, expand local economic growth, and generate modern aviation jobs.

Premier David Eby has touted his government’s work on SAF, particularly in collaboration with facilities like Vancouver International Airport (YVR).

“By working together on shared priorities, like promoting made-in-B.C. clean tech and expanding trade diversification while reducing pollution, we can maximize benefits for all British Columbians, while strengthening our province’s economic future,” said Eby last year.

BC’s SAF policy aims to rapidly expand sustainable aviation fuel production and use, significantly cutting aviation-related pollution and carbon emissions. It also seeks to stimulate clean-tech investment, creating local economic growth and resilient, sustainable aviation jobs.

First, SAF production around the world isn’t growing fast enough to meet these requirements set by BC. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says that only 2 million tonnes of SAF will be made around the world in 2025. This is only 0.7 percent of the world’s aviation fuel use. Willie Walsh, the Director General of IATA, said that the low availability of SAF has already caused compliance fees in Europe to skyrocket, making SAF almost five times more expensive than regular jet fuel.

The Financial Times (FT) reports that airline industry leaders in Europe, where SAF mandates have been put in place, are very sceptical and are pushing back. For example, leaders at Ryanair and Lufthansa have openly questioned whether the current SAF targets are realistic.

Their worries follow facts that were brought to light in earlier FT reports, which found that Europe’s SAF mandates made energy companies hesitant to make new investments or even stop them altogether, like Shell’s biofuels facility in Rotterdam, which is on hold. The situation is a warning for BC that making rules too soon can stop investments instead of speeding up the switch to green energy.

The Wall Street Journal has written extensively about how unclear it is what qualifies as SAF, which adds even more risk to the province’s ambitious goals. The differences between U.S. and European standards have made markets less clear and scared off investors. European rules say that crop-based SAF is not allowed, but the U.S. gives incentives for it. This makes the global market less stable. This lack of consistency in policy makes it even harder for Canadian producers to set up viable domestic SAF facilities, making the province even more dependent on expensive imports from a small number of international sources.

The Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (C-SAF) acknowledges that it is hard to increase production in Canada. Even though more than 60 airlines have signed on, Canada’s SAF market is still in its early stages. BC could needlessly harm the airline industry and the wider economy by enforcing strict rules without a strong local industry to support them.

The Chamber of Commerce is right to point out the economic risk. Airports like Vancouver International (YVR) are important for BC’s economy because they connect people and are vital hubs for importing and exporting. If BC airports don’t have enough domestic supply, overly aggressive mandates could make them less competitive. Smaller, regional carriers are already having a hard time making money, and now they are facing threats to their very existence. Last year’s failure of Lynx Air shows that rising fuel prices have real effects.

Also, BC’s policy too closely resembles European goals, which have proven too ambitious. The EU was once a strong supporter of SAF, but airlines are now strongly against it and warning about rising costs and limited SAF availability, which is leading to calls for policy changes. To stay competitive, airlines have even tried to make Europe’s strict carbon pricing and SAF rules fit in with less strict global standards. If Europe, which is a leader in climate change, has to rethink its rules, BC’s decision to go it alone looks even more wrong.

Finally, economic studies show that the costs of SAF mandates always end up being passed on to consumers.

For many BC communities, air travel is not optional. It’s the only lifeline for passengers, medevacs, time-sensitive goods, and perishable supplies. This, carbon pricing and SAF mandates hit harder in B.C. than in more road-connected provinces, potentially disrupting lifeline services and increasing costs for rural and Indigenous residents.

BC’s separate SAF mandate, as stated in the BC Chamber’s resolution, is not in line with what is happening in North America and around the world. Instead of encouraging real progress for the environment, the policy could hurt the economy and be meaningless. A better way to go about things would be to set timelines and goals that are in line with global standards, encourage domestic SAF production, and support technological progress before putting in place rules that BC’s economy can’t realistically handle.",https://resourceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/53603042355_16ad95af4d_k.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:56:33.414943

Dr Ramkrishna also added that government is supporting bioenergy sector by pushing various schemes for the sector and policy intervention.
“In the upcoming edition of India Bioenergy & Tech Expo, we have planned various zones such India CBG Tech Expo, Special Biomass Tech Expo, Ethanol, Waste energy, Bio mobility and biodiesel for all the stakeholders of bioenergy sector.
We are expecting more than 150 experts from bioenergy sector and 1000 delegates from India and also from other countries.
Also, we are expecting emerging entrepreneurs from bioenergy sector as there will be special support extended for them by MSME Ministry”, Boratkar informed.","“India should focus more on the production of Sustainable Aviation fuel as it will put us on global amp and India can become a hub for transition from India to Europe and South-East. It takes 2 litres of ethanol to make one litre of SAF. The development of SAF can be supported with right policy decisions and right technology at a place”, said Dr Pramod Chaudhari, President of Indian Federation of Green Energy and Executive Chairman, Praj Industries at the curtain raiser event of 2nd edition of India Bioenergy & Tech Expo held in Pune.

Dr Chaudhari pointed out the need for alternative to diesel in India and role of bioenergy sector in developing the alternate fuels to traditional fossil fuel. We need to promote biodiesel as an alternative to diesel in order to boost bioenergy sector and also to reduce carbon footprint in India. Raj Industries is working on the production of biodiesel and we have found new additives in this area, he said.

While highlighting the importance of agriculture biomass as a major contributor of raw material for the production of biofuel, Dr Chaudhari said that companies are working in the supply chain of biomass from last few years and with the right policy support and investment it is poised to grow. IFGE has chosen a right niche to support the movement in biofuel production.

Dr Y B Ramkrishna, Senior Vice President IFGE and Former Chairman, Working Group on Biofuel MoPNG emphasised the need to use of biological sources apart from feedstocks which can be considered as substitute to conventional fuels. We are looking at various sources which are considered as industry waste and can be converted into bioenergy. We are also looking at the low carbon fuels which will not only reduce the carbon footprint but also are sustainable and commercially viable options over traditional fossil fuel and a lot of R& D work is being conducted in this sector. We need to create an ecosystem in which all the wasted resources can be made available to the industry to convert it alternate biofuel. By practising this 100 per cent of country’s energy will come from bioenergy sector.

Dr Ramkrishna also added that government is supporting bioenergy sector by pushing various schemes for the sector and policy intervention. But still there are few gaps in the policies which needs to address and IFGE is addressing to these challenges and bridging the gap between the industry and government for the growth of bioenergy sector.

Vaibhav Dange, Founder Director IFGE informed the audience about the remarkable growth of bioenergy sector in India and IFGE’s contribution to the growth of the sector. He mentioned that India’s entire spectrum of bioenergy was displayed for the first time in the last year edition of India Bioenergy & Tech and that has added value of the bioenergy to the minds of the policy makers, industry leaders and created a buzz among the industry stakeholders.

Ravi Boratkar, Founder Member IFGE and Director of MMActiv Sci-Tech Communications informed the audience about the structure of 2nd International Conference & Exhibition on bioenergy and Technologies and new initiatives of IFGE which will be the part of upcoming 2nd edition of India Bioenergy & Tech Expo.

But not all SAFs are created equal. With a potential to slash aviation’s CO₂ emissions by more than 90%, e-kerosene (also known as e-SAF) is the only scalable and sustainable option in the long term.

Despite a strong regulatory framework under the Fit for 55 package and ReFuelEU Aviation, e-SAF projects in the EU have yet to reach Final Investment Decision (FID). This is due to high capital and operational costs, a lack of long-term offtake agreements, and insufficient revenue certainty — a market failure that existing EU mechanisms have not been able to resolve.

The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) presents a unique and timely opportunity to correct this imbalance. By focusing its support on the most strategic SAF pathway – e-SAF – the STIP can catalyse the deployment of clean aviation fuels while boosting the EU’s industrial competitiveness, energy independence, and jobs.

To do so, the STIP should embed a comprehensive mechanism, such as a European Hydrogen Clearing House (EHCH). The EHCH would operate through double-sided auctions, matching fuel producers and buyers (e.g. airlines), while ensuring price stability and demand aggregation. This would de-risk production through long-term contracts and contract for differences for e-SAF, enabling scale-up while ensuring alignment with the EU’s competitiveness goals.

Plus, wine production emits greenhouse gases, particularly from packaging and grape cultivation.
While it’s only a small amount per bottle, this quickly adds up considering billions of gallons of wine are consumed annually.
“Our vineyards are planted with grasses and legumes and benefit from the practice of green manuring,” Matricardi said.
Innovative tradition As the world’s second-largest producer of wine, Italy’s wine industry was valued at $21.5 billion annually.","Welcome to 3p Happy Hour! As we all eye the exit door on Friday afternoons, we're raising our glasses to the sustainable wine, beer and spirits brands serving up stiff sips with less environmental impact while benefiting communities.

In the wine-making world, Italy is a full-bodied behemoth, boasting 590 grape varieties and a 4,000-year-old history of wine production. When the Greeks settled there in the 8th century, they aptly named it the land of wine. Stateside, we’ve fully embraced this tradition, importing the most Italian wine of any country.

Despite the delights of a floral, brick-red Barolo, the industry uses large amounts of pesticides and water, while also creating waste like leftover grape skins, seeds and pulp. Plus, wine production emits greenhouse gases, particularly from packaging and grape cultivation. While it’s only a small amount per bottle, this quickly adds up considering billions of gallons of wine are consumed annually.

Thankfully, some organizations in the industry are taking the environment as seriously as their Chianti collection. Mezzacorona Group, a community of nearly 1,600 winegrowers and farms in northern Italy, has sustainability at its core. Representing a variety of brands like Mezzacorona, Rotari and Nota, this cooperative is focused on mitigating wine’s environmental footprint. From cover crops to packaging, it’s helping the environment while still offering the perfect pasta pairing.

Mezzacorona Group

Founded in 1904, Mezzacorona was the first winegrowers’ association established in northern Italy, located in the mountainous Trentino-Alto Adige region bordering Switzerland and Austria. Members supply grapes to Mezzacorona’s sustainable winery, where they are transformed into a variety of products, from Pinot Grigio to sparkling wine and grappa. Members actively set policies and strategies for the organization, while receiving information and training in return.

Another noteworthy principle is the group’s strong commitment to the environment. “At Mezzacorona, generations of families have chosen to operate with respect to the environment, adopting sustainable and integrated production techniques, thus producing genuine products,” Lucio Matricardi, a winemaker at Mezzacorona, told TriplePundit in an email. “A passionate and skillful team of oenologists [experts in wine making] and agronomists work day-by-day in close contact with our vine growers following the entire product life cycle in the vineyards, care during harvesting, and up to the bottling phase.”

Members are also certified under a voluntary national program aimed at minimizing pesticide, fertilizer and water use. “In 2016, all our winegrower members obtained the Ministerial Certification SQNPI — Italy’s National Integrated Production Quality System — for their grapes. And in 2017, this certification was obtained for all our Controlled Designation of Origin wines,” Matricardi said. “A double recognition that guarantees, through a series of controls throughout the supply chain, that our work is sustainable from the land to the winery, from the vineyards to the bottle.”

Widely recognized throughout the European Union, these certifications are renewed every three years.

Cultivating change

Mezzacorona’s sustainable approach starts in the vineyard, where a number of techniques minimize its footprint.

“Sustainability is woven into Mezzacorona’s DNA — from the careful cultivation of its vineyards to the final bottle on the shelf,” Matricardi said. “In the fields, we practice low-impact viticulture [the cultivation and harvesting of grapes].”

The cooperative prioritizes soil health by using cover crops and green manure, which is the practice of growing and incorporating plants into the soil.

“Our vineyards are planted with grasses and legumes and benefit from the practice of green manuring,” Matricardi said. “This naturally adds organic matter to the soil. In addition, mechanical operations are kept to a minimum to avoid soil compaction.”

Green manure improves soil fertility, thereby reducing the need for synthetic fertilizer. It also increases the soil’s ability to hold water while preventing erosion and weed growth.

Mezzacorona also preserves hedgerows and stone walls in its vineyards to provide shelter for plants and animals. In turn, hedgerows reduce erosion, minimize wind damage to crops, and provide habitat for the natural enemies of crop pests, reducing pesticide use.

But winemaking is also a thirsty endeavor. Researchers estimate that producing a standard 750 ml bottle of Italian wine uses anywhere from 451 to 1193 liters of water, with over 97 percent of that used in the vineyards. To address this, Mezzacorona adopted drip irrigation, which delivers water directly to the base of a plant. The practice can reduce water use compared to traditional systems such as sprinklers. But one drawback is the expense of installing and maintaining these irrigation systems.

From sprays to sustainability

Besides the vineyard, Mezzacorona is addressing other skeletons in the Chardonnay closet. For instance, Sangiovese is noted for its hints of leather and tart cherry, not pyrimethanil and fenhexamid. Researchers have found that wine can contain residues of over two dozen pesticides, mainly fungicides and insecticides. While helping to eliminate diseases, insects and weeds, these chemicals can damage the soil, pollute the air and water, and harm wine growers, workers and neighbors. Plus, they can lower the quality of the wine itself.

Mezzacorona still uses pesticides, but strives to minimize their use with a technique called mating disruption, where vineyards are flooded with female pest pheromones to attract males. With pheromones throughout the area, the likelihood of a male finding a female is lowered, consequently reducing their population size. The technique has lowered the densities of a serious pest, the vine mealybug, in California vineyards.

Mezzacorona has other sustainable measures swirling in its glass, too. “In our case, we have chosen to adopt sustainability standards such as the Equalitas certification, which allows us to monitor our carbon dioxide emissions and work to reduce them through targeted improvement actions,” Matricardi said.

The Equalitas certification focuses on the social, environmental and economic aspects of sustainable winemaking. The program has environmental requirements for soil biodiversity, carbon and water footprints, pesticide and fertilizer use, and social practices like workers’ rights, anti-discrimination policies and training programs.

And since most of wine’s carbon footprint comes from the production and transport of glass bottles, the cooperative is lightening up its packaging, too. “Over the years, we have significantly reduced the weight of our bottles,” Matricardi said. “We also use certified paper for our labels and recyclable cardboard packaging.”

While a positive move to mitigate carbon emissions, lighter glass bottles still have a higher carbon footprint compared to other types of packaging.

Innovative tradition

As the world’s second-largest producer of wine, Italy’s wine industry was valued at $21.5 billion annually. Fortunately, sustainable wine is set to capture a growing segment of that market, with 57 percent of consumers saying they prefer wines that disclose their carbon footprint in a survey from the food and beverage industry software company Tastewise. And nearly three-fourths of consumers said they are more likely to trust a brand that promotes its environmental impact. Environmentally-conscious organizations, like Mezzacorona, are one sip ahead of the competition.

“Our farmers have deep roots in the region,” Matricardi said. “And their commitment to the land runs generations deep, making sustainability a shared priority driven by genuine care and long-standing connection.”

“We hope you find this year’s Market Outlook insightful and engaging.”","‘HEFA tipping point’ in sight, after 2030, demand is set to outpace the HEFA SAF production potential, urging the industry to shift towards a more diversified set of SAF policies and pathways

Beyond 2030, SAF demand is expected to nearly triple to 40 Mt (13.2Bgal) by 2035, driven by accelerated mandates. With expected SAF capacity being 18 Mt (6 Bgal) in 2030, this creates a 26 Mt (8.6 Bgal) gap to be addressed in just five years. Co-processing and renewable diesel is expected to contribute up to 6 Mt (2 Bgal), but the majority will need to come from additional capacity

Supplied volumes doubled to 1 Mt (0.3 Bgal) in 2024 compared to 2023 levels, the EU and UK mandates started in January 2025, and approximately 60 airlines set specific SAF targets for 2030. As investment continues to flow into the industry, SAF is strengthening its role as the cornerstone for the decarbonization of the aviation industry.

5 June, 2025 Amsterdam – SkyNRG releases fifth Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market Outlook, developed in close collaboration with ICF today. This year’s edition highlights both the progress made and the important steps still needed to ensure a resilient, scalable SAF industry capable of meeting long-term decarbonization goals.

“It is with great pride that we present SkyNRG’s fifth Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market Outlook,” said Maarten van Dijk, CEO and Co-founder of SkyNRG. “This year’s edition is particularly special, as it has been developed in close collaboration with ICF. While the report continues to guide our internal strategy, we also hope it contributes to broader market understanding and momentum.”

Key findings and outlook

The SAF market is experiencing a period of rapid development. In 2024, supplied volumes doubled from the previous year. The start of the EU and UK SAF mandates in January 2025 marked a critical step, with projected global demand reaching approximately 2 million tonnes this year.

Looking ahead to 2030, demand could rise to over 15 million tonnes, with significant contributions from both mandated and voluntary commitments. However, the report also highlights that nearly 82% of current SAF capacity relies on HEFA technology, which is limited by available feedstocks. This indicates a need to scale up alternative technologies and feedstock pathways to meet future demand.

“To capture longer-term dynamics, we’ve extended our analysis to reflect what is needed through 2050,” van Dijk added. “Robust policy frameworks and targeted support, for offtakers, technology developers, and infrastructure players are essential to keep SAF growth on track.”

Collaborative industry insight

Dan Galpin, Global Aviation Lead at ICF, emphasized the collaborative nature of this year’s effort and the evolving landscape:

“It has been our pleasure to work with SkyNRG on this flagship SAF Market Outlook report. With mandates now in effect in the EU and UK, and more ambitious policies taking shape globally, the SAF market is entering a new phase. Hundreds of projects have been announced, showing strong confidence. Continued policy support remains key to realizing long-term goals.”

A strategic moment for SAF

The report’s findings underscore both the progress to date and the strategic opportunities ahead. As SAF demand is expected to nearly triple again between 2030 and 2035, achieving that growth will depend on expanded investment, supportive regulation, and supply chain coordination.

“The challenge is massive, but the rewards can be even bigger,” van Dijk concluded. “We hope you find this year’s Market Outlook insightful and engaging.”",https://skynrg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5107-1024x753.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 14:57:27.200945

Charlotte-based technology conglomerate Honeywell, Samsung’s engineering subsidiary Samsung E&A, chemicals company Johnson Matthey and chemical engineering firm Gidara Energy have joined together to create a strategic sustainable aviation fuel technology group, Honeywell announced Thursday.

The four companies, organized as the SAF Technology Alliance, aim to create a new technology offering to help scale and deliver a full-service SAF production chain to take the fuel from a waste feedstock to a final product.

The new SAF-focused alliance will look to scale the use of gasification and the Fischer-Tropsch process — a chemical reaction that makes synthesis gas — in SAF production in the near term, according to the release. SAFs still made up less than 1% of global jet fuel use last year and are growing at a ""disappointingly slow” rate, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Dive Insight:

Currently, each of the four companies that compose the alliance have expertise in one or more aspects of the SAF production process, but the group estimates that the combined resources and integrated solution will reduce the time between a feasibility study and facility startup by 15%, according to the June 5 release. The SAF Technology Alliance also said their modular, integrated solutions should reduce capital expenditures by 10%, based on a theoretical schedule and cost analysis conducted by the companies.

Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions CEO Ken West said that the “end-to-end SAF alliance demonstrates the power of collaboration to address the world’s energy demands.” The four companies will create a non-exclusive product for clients that combines Gidara’s expertise in gasification and synthesis gas production; Johnson Matthey’s catalysts and technology to convert syngas to fuels; Honeywell’s technology and digital automation; and Samsung E&A’s expertise in global engineering, procurement, production and project execution.

“As demand for SAF increases, the technology to expand available feedstock options becomes increasingly vital,” West said in the release. “This comprehensive alliance provides refiners with a strategic approach to quickly execute their vision.”

Maurits van Tol, CEO of Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies, said the group is looking to target “the common challenges faced by SAF producers” to, ultimately, accelerate global SAF deployment.

The alliance said it will first focus on scaling the use of gasification and the Fischer-Tropsch method because it will enable the use of biomass and municipal solid waste as a feedstock, and such production methods are “increasingly important.” The International Energy Agency estimated in 2023 that waste-, residue- and nonfood energy crop-derived biofuels could meet 40% of all biofuel demand by 2030.

Samsung E&A CEO Hong Namkoong said the combined expertise of the companies will create a “resilient and scalable” SAF supply chain, and Gidara Energy CEO Norbert Kamp said the group will help unlock “the value of waste to meet the growing demand for SAF.”

The SAF Technology Alliance comes as both airlines and globalshipping companies are looking to invest in and procure SAFs to drive down their emissions.

Uttar Pradesh is making a bold move with its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Manufacturing Promotion Policy-2025, the first of its kind in India. This initiative aims to convert agricultural waste-like sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, and wheat straw-into bio-jet fuel, creating new revenue streams for farmers while advancing India's green aviation goals.

The policy is expected to attract ₹3,000 crore in investments, with over 18 companies expressing interest in setting up SAF production units in the state. It also offers capital subsidies, state GST reimbursements, land waivers, and interest subsidies to incentivize industry participation.

The policy offers capital subsidies, GST reimbursements, and land waivers to attract private players.

Beyond economic benefits, this policy aligns with India's climate commitments, helping reduce carbon emissions and promoting energy security. With Uttar Pradesh's strong logistics infrastructure, including five international airports, the state is positioning itself as a hub for SAF production.

This could be a game-changer for India's aviation sector.

India's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) policy is ambitious, but it differs from global approaches in key ways. While India leverages agricultural waste like sugarcane bagasse and rice husk, making it cost-effective and farmer-friendly, The EU and UK have blending mandates requiring airlines to use SAF, but these have led to high costs due to supply chain inefficiencies.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) warns that SAF production is too low globally, covering just 0.7% of airline fuel needs. India accounts for ~2.5% of global aviation fuel demand, with significant room for SAF expansion.

While India focuses on bio-based SAF, global efforts also explore hydrogen fuel and electric aircraft, though these technologies are still in early stages.

Deutsche Aircraft has announced its new generation of turboprop aircraft, the D328eco, designed to compete with ATR’s 42-600 aircraft in the regional space. It will mark the first time a commercial aircraft has been designed and manufactured in Germany since its predecessor,the Dornier 328, entered service in 1993.

The D328eco will be fitted with the latest Pratt & Whitney turboprop, the PW127XT-S, an engine which claims to reduce maintenance costs by 20%, and cut fuel burn by 3% compared to the previous generation. This, combined with the use of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is presumably what gives the aircraft the appendage ‘eco’, and separates it from its competition.

“A very proud moment”

In a roll-out event in the airline’s hangar on May 28, Deutsche Aircraft’s CEO, Nico Neumann, took the time to speak with LARA editor, Rob Munro, stressing that it was “a very proud moment for the whole Deutsche Aircraft team to bring the aviation [production] entirety back to Germany”.

When asked about the market for the D328eco, Neumann said: “on one side [there’s] the replacement market, so that is all the aircraft flying [in] that segment which are going into retirement age. Then we have [the] gross market in the multi-mission, multi-role segment, [for example] flying hospitals, search and rescue, border control”. Neumann also pointed to the less saturated markets for regional aircraft, like India, where the new turboprop is likely to be popular.

Reality bites

Despite Neumann and his team’s undoubted pride in their shiny new creation, there are some in the industry who are keen to inject some cold, objective reality into the proceedings.

“There is demand for smaller turboprops, but this generally emanates from the used sector, as the ATR42-600 is the only in-production aircraft currently servicing the sub-50-seats segment,” Jonathan Mcdonald, Manager of Classic and Cargo Aircraft at IBA, told LARA. “The ATR42-600 is by no means a poor performing product; moreover, it is ordered as a niche among operators that do not need the 72 seats plus of an ATR72-600”.

He points out that only 70 ATR42-600s have been delivered over a 14-year period, amounting to a somewhat paltry average of five aircraft a year.

“This supports the notion that most operators looking to acquire a new passenger turboprop will pursue the avenue of 72 seats plus,” says McDonald

Deutsche Aircraft is also keen to promote the new turboprop’s ability to run on 100% SAF but McDonald feels this might not be the unique selling point they are hoping for.

“If some…less developed jurisdictions either cannot access SAF or find the fuel diversification challenging, this could be an issue for Deutsche Aircraft, with would-be operators continuing to use older models instead and therefore limiting re-marketing prospects for the D328eco,” he says.

Rugged reliability

One of the major attractions of regional turboprops is their rugged reliability and this very strength could be a barrier to entry for the D328eco, competing to replace older programmes such as the SAAB 340 series and Dash 8-100/Q200/Q300 which are still performing well despite their age..

“Most of these programmes have some form of life extension program in place, and operators are taking advantage of this,” says McDonald. “Despite their age, these older turboprops can still be operated very efficiently, and their operator’s operational modus operandi is centric to these types. To transition to a newer model would be a huge logistical exercise and investment.”

To summarise, Deutsche Aircraft’s enthusiastic and dynamic launch of this smaller turboprop regional aircraft has been met with considerable positivity and admiration but its practical appeal to operators remains to be proven.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8.png,N,,2025-06-06 11:57:03.464106

The collaboration will focus on creating new commercial models that balance the requirements of SAF producers and buyers by introducing novel pricing and offtake structures that provide greater access to SAF.

The MoU outlines plans for evaluating commercial models that support SAF procurement, designed to acknowledge the value of LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) fuel pathway.

LanzaJet CEO Jimmy Samartzis said: “Scaling SAF requires flexible, forward-thinking commercial models that work for both producers and consumers.

​“This collaboration with ATOBA Energy is about building the kind of aligned ecosystem we need to drive innovation, catalyse investment, and accelerate SAF deployment globally. It’s another step forward in ensuring that the value of next-generation technologies like ours can be realised at scale because the future growth and sustainability of aviation depends on it.”

ATOBA focuses on facilitating the development of SAF production through its comprehensive management of upstream and downstream SAF offtake portfolios.

The company’s approach involves off taking from a variety of producers who utilise different production technologies such as HEFA, Alcohol to Jet, Gas-Fischer Tropsch, or Power to Liquids.

This strategy helps mitigate technological and pricing risks related to these diverse SAF production pathways.

Furthermore, ATOBA facilitates long-term offtake agreements among airlines, jet-fuel distributors, SAF producers, and financial institutions. These agreements are vital for scaling up the industry.

LanzaJet’s ATJ technology benefits from such commercial models, which help maintain the integrity of its value proposition and promote more sustainable growth pathways.

The alliance will draw on their respective strengths – Gidara’s proficiency in gasification and syngas, Johnson Matthey’s catalysts and technology know-how, Honeywell’s process tech and digital automation and Samsung’s global EPC and project experience – to streamline the entire SAF production chain, from feedstock to final product.

By collaborating, the companies plan to introduce a new joint technology offering that leverages the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) production process and aims to unlock abundant, globally available feedstock options to help meet growing demand for SAF and support energy security.

The joint approach aims to expedite project timelines and provide customers with a single point of accountability for project execution and product guarantees, ensuring communication, coordination and reliability throughout the SAF production process.

With the resources of all four companies, the integrated and modular solution is expected to reduce the time between feasibility study and facility startup by more than 15% and could reduce capital expenditures by up to 10%.

Over the near term, the collaboration aims to scale the use of gasification and FT SAF production methods, while enabling biomass and municipal solid waste to be used as feedstocks.

As the SAF industry is potentially hamstrung by the limits of traditional feedstocks, this production method is becoming increasingly important, with the International Energy Agency reporting that biofuels produced from waste and non-food energy crops will meet more than 40% of total biofuel demand by 2030.

Ken West, President and CEO, Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said, “As demand for SAF increases, the technology to expand available feedstock options becomes increasingly vital. This comprehensive alliance provides refiners with a strategic approach to quickly execute their vision.”

Dr Norbert Kamp, CEO of Gidara Energy, said it is not just providing a technical solution but helping clients and communities realise the potential of waste as a catalyst for a future supported by cleaner energy sources.

It will give producers price stability and should support sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the UK by helping to de-risk investment in production.

This is something that Logistics UK has been calling for for some time, so it is good for the sector that the government is listening to industry as it continues its journey towards net-zero emissions.

On the same day, the government also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers, which should also help the aviation industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year.

The mandate specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030 should be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

Sustainable aviation fuel as a drop-in fuel is a vital alternative to traditional kerosene jet fuel, reducing aviation lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%.

It also lowers other harmful pollutants, such as particulate matter and sulphur oxides, contributing to better air quality around airports and reducing the aviation sector’s overall environmental impact.

With no zero-emission alternative currently viable for long-haul flights, SAF is the most significant opportunity to reduce aviation emissions in the medium term.

SAF is now a proven technology and is used in aircraft today, therefore, attention must turn to addressing barriers around costs and increasing production to meet rising demands.

It will be essential to expand feedstocks beyond HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids derived from oils or fats) to include other sustainable sources such as waste and these options should be explored without passing along costs to industry.

Producing SAF domestically in the UK carries several economic and strategic advantages. First and foremost, producing SAF in the UK will increase availability, addressing a key concern around security of supplies, as well as helping to reduce overall costs as the industry is scaled up.

Domestic production of SAF can have wider national benefits too, such as stimulating economic growth by creating new jobs across the supply chain, from feedstock production to fuel distribution.

This has the potential to benefit local economies, particularly in rural areas where biomass feedstocks are sourced, and in industrial regions where new SAF production facilities are established.

A key challenge for emerging SAF projects is the uncertainty of revenue streams, which can deter investment and hinder the growth of the industry.

This is why the government must ensure the bill passes through parliament as quickly as possible to ensure a revenue certainty mechanism is operational as soon as possible, given the SAF mandate is already effective and has been since the beginning of this year.

By integrating SAF into the fuel supply chain and adopting higher SAF blends, the aviation industry can make significant progress towards achieving international climate targets and support the UK’s commitment to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/0/8/11208_alexandra_herdman_logistics_uk_source_30_5_25_678145.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 12:57:08.446072

NEW DELHI: US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has undertaken a commitment that all of its commercial planes will be 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatible by 2030. With India one of its major markets, the company is making initial steps for creating an enabling environment for a SAF ecosystem.

Brian Moran, Chief Sustainability Officer at Boeing, in an interaction with ET Infra, highlighted that India has a lot of potential for development of a SAF ecosystem and Boeing is keen to share all the resources and experience that it has gathered over the years in partnership with the Indian government.

Advt

Recently, the aircraft major entered into a partnership with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd to explore opportunities to scale up SAF production in India, support the certification of domestically produced SAF, and advocate policies to develop a robust SAF ecosystem in the country.

“We have been very engaged on the technology side, which is where we control the airplane and work with our suppliers. But we also engage with energy companies in doing feedstock assessment, regional studies because different regions have different potential for feedstock,” said Moran, adding that over the years Boeing has undertaken feedstock assessments in countries such as Brazil, Southeast Asia, Japan.

Boeing is currently working with the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for undertaking a new study on India for capacity building in the development and deployment of SAF.

“What is really exciting here in India is the breadth of feedstock. From used cooking oil to municipal solid waste in the future, to e-fuels or power to liquid fuels, you really have the range of potential here in India.” said Moran.

Food vs Fuel

While the adoption of SAF by the global commercial airline industry will become mandatory from 2027 onwards, the food vs fuel debate lingers on, which highlights whether farmland or crops should be diverted for fuel production rather than focus on food security.

Advt

“It should never be a debate because if you compete with food, your aviation fuel is not sustainable. It is an important discussion, but our position is this fuel should not compete with food,” said Moran.

Moran highlighted that there has been lots of advancement in cropping and agriculture that actually helps the food supply, and not compete with it.

“There is a whole science around regenerative agriculture where some of the new types of crops being grown that you can use for SAF, can be grown out of cycle. So you grow food and then in the periods of time when that land is not used, you can use these cover crops to produce fuel and it is actually good for the soil. It regenerates the soil quicker,” said Moran.

India SAF Adoption

Boeing customers in India-Air India, Akasa Air and SpiceJet-will be looking forward to taking deliveries of aircraft which are SAF compatible as the Indian government undertakes steps to adhere to international norms on SAF adoption.

“The good news is that today's (Boeing) aircraft are certified up to 50 per cent (SAF compatible). So we have a long way to go. By 2030 we want to make sure that all of our aircraft can have 100 per cent (SAF compatible),” said Moran.

The adoption of SAF by the Indian aviation industry will be necessary to be in compliance with ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation or CORSIA obligations, a carbon offset and reduction scheme.

The offsetting requirement for most aircraft operators, including Indian airlines for international operations, will mandatorily come into effect from 2027 onwards. The Indian government has set an indicative target of 1 per cent blending of SAF in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) initially for international flights with effect from 2027 and to be gradually increased to 2 per cent in 2028 and to 5 per cent by 2030.

Last session, a similar bill was sent to the House Government Operations Committee after passing the Senate.
Opponents included the Small Business Association of Michigan, the Detroit Regional Chamber, Michigan Chemistry Council, the Michigan Waste and Recycling Association, and the Michigan Manufacturers Association.
“To date, the Michigan Department of State has produced more than 3,300 pages of materials and posted them on our website for all to see,” Hardmon said.
“There was precisely no money in the state school aid act, nothing to address the teacher shortage, even though it was rife, from fiscal year 2020 and before.","A handful of metro Detroit municipalities testified in support of hazardous waste legislation in a Senate committee on Thursday after their local disposal sites accepted hazardous waste from an Ohio train disaster and the Manhattan Project.

Without warning, Republic Industrial and Energy Solutions in Romulus accepted toxic debris from the 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, for underground injection. Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy inspections later found violations at the facility related to improperly labeled signs and malfunctioning alarm systems.

Less than a year later, the Wayne Disposal landfill in Van Buren Township initiated a transfer of radioactive soil and concrete from several nuclear test sites as part of a planned hazardous waste facility expansion.

Van Buren, Romulus, Canton, and Belleville filed an injunction after finding out, and a judge subsequently issued a restraining order on the move in September 2024.

Backed by Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton.), the community’s leaders since have been working on legislation to manage the toxic materials coming into their backyards.

SB 246, taken up for testimony in the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, would overhaul hazardous waste management in the following ways:

Hazardous waste disposal (“tipping”) fees would increase from $10 a ton to $25 a ton. Michigan has some of the lowest tipping fees in the country, Camilleri said, which is why it regularly receives waste from across state lines. Canton Township Supervisor Anne Marie Graham Hudak said this would encourage waste to be disposed of at sites in other, less-populated areas.

Technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM) disposal would be prohibited above extreme thresholds, and its tipping cost would go up. Van Buren Township Supervisor Kevin McNamara said this would still allow things like radioactive medical waste to be thrown away in Michigan but would protect against nuclear waste.

All hazardous waste facilities and expansions would be postponed for five years to allow for the development of a statewide hazardous waste plan. The plan would restrict the amount of waste dumped in Michigan to the amount of waste it produces and would create stricter siting requirements, Camilleri said.

SB 247 would impose a 0.417 fee per gallon on the type of hazardous waste disposal wells holding materials from the East Palestine derailment in Romulus. Revenue from the fee would then go toward waste management grants for the city, distributed by EGLE.

Last session, a similar bill was sent to the House Government Operations Committee after passing the Senate.

“I’ve had countless conversations with residents and local municipal leaders who are horrified about potentially harmful material being transported to their communities on their roads and disposed of in their backyard,” Camilleri said. “Frankly, it is ridiculous that these facilities are located at dense population centers in the first place.”

Since similar legislation was introduced in 2024, Camilleri said he has negotiated a fair price hike for tipping fees with the governor’s office. Revenue generated by the fee increase would fund resources to enforce the bill and its regulations.

The bill did not receive a vote.

Supporters included the Michigan Environmental Council, the Huron River Watershed Council and the Wayne County Executive. Opponents included the Small Business Association of Michigan, the Detroit Regional Chamber, Michigan Chemistry Council, the Michigan Waste and Recycling Association, and the Michigan Manufacturers Association.

The House filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on Thursday in the Court of Claims for failing to comply with a subpoena issued by Rep. Jay DeBoyer and the House Oversight Committee.

“Our commitment to bring accountability to Lansing is not just lip service,” DeBoyer (R-Clay) said in a statement. “After going years without legislative oversight, Benson has clearly grown comfortable operating independent of the other, co-equal branches of government.”

Department of State Spokesperson Cheri Hardmon said on Thursday Benson was glad the House had finally taken the issue to court.

“Since the beginning of this saga, Secretary Benson has asked lawmakers to let a court review their request for sensitive election information that, in the wrong hands, would compromise the security of our election machines, ballots and officials,” Hardmon said is a statement. “We are glad they have finally acted accordingly and look forward to a court of law resolving this dispute.”

DeBoyer also said in his statement that the House has attempted to get Benson to cooperate through requests, offers and other legal routes.

“Her continued defiance now brings us to the courtroom, where we will continue to diligently work to deliver government transparency for the people of Michigan,” he said.

Benson and her staff have turned over some of the requested information but have refused to turn over other materials they argue are sensitive and, if publicly released, could be used to interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment, or impersonate a clerk on Election Day.

“To date, the Michigan Department of State has produced more than 3,300 pages of materials and posted them on our website for all to see,” Hardmon said. “Let’s be clear – the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee is demanding information that could be used to interrupt the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment of impersonate a clerk on Election Day.”

The lawsuit requests a declaratory judgment from the court that the Michigan House has issued a valid subpoena that Benson must comply with and requests an injunction prohibiting Benson or the Department of State from modifying any relevant records.

“Government actors, regardless of their title, all have a responsibility to uphold their constitutional oath and adhere to the law,” DeBoyer said. “Yet, Jocelyn Benson, one of the most powerful office holders in Michigan, must instead be brought to court and forced to comply with Michigan statute. We will not let her disregard for the law keep us from delivering results to the people we represent.”

Hardmon said the department remained committed to transparency but would not compromise election security.

“We look forward to working with a judge to come to a resolution that will resolve this dispute,” she said.

A coalition of education advocacy groups are looking to put a new option for school funding on the ballot in 2026: raising the state income tax rate on Michigan’s highest earners, with the possibility of generating $1.7 billion annually in K-12 revenue.

The Invest in MI Kids initiative seeks to amend the Constitution to change Michigan’s 4.25% flat income tax rate to require individuals earning over $500,000 and couples earning over $1 million to pay 5% of their income in state taxes. According to taxpayer data compiled by the Department of Treasury, fewer than 60,000 of the 4.9 million people who filed income tax returns in 2021 reported an income over $500,000.

Organizers of the initiative said placing a higher financial burden on the wealthiest residents of the state would help close the funding gap in Michigan’s education system, which advocates estimate is roughly $4 to $5 billion annually. Increased revenue to the School Aid Fund, they said, would allow the state to support new funding for priorities like career and technical education, recruiting and retaining teachers, and reducing class sizes.

“Michigan’s flat tax system was designed for the ultra-wealthy, not working families,” said Molly Sweeney, Organizing Director of 482 Forward, one of the coalition’s founding partners. “That’s why we’re coming together to rewrite the rules so those who aren’t paying what they owe in taxes finally chip in to support the services we all rely on – especially public education.”

Jase Bolger, President and Chief Executive Officer of the West Michigan Policy Forum, today issued the following statement after it was reported that petition language was filed for a ballot proposal that would create a 5% income tax surcharge on individuals who earn $500,000 annually:

West Michigan Policy Forum Chief Executive Officer Jase Bolger in a statement panned the proposal, saying workers and kids deserve better.

“Way too many kids in Michigan can’t read, but it’s clear these adults can’t do simple math. Today in Michigan, the more you make the more you pay,” Bolger said. “But worse is that this proposal would drive Michigan further in the wrong direction. While states that are growing are overwhelmingly cutting taxes on work, or don’t tax work at all, this would double down on Michigan’s lagging policies that have led to the fastest growing unemployment rate in the country.”

Invest in MI Kids is supported by education organizations including the Michigan Education Justice Coalition and Fund MI Future, a coalition of groups including the Michigan League for Public Policy and Progress Michigan.

“This is about fairness, plain and simple,” Fund MI Future organizer Charlie Cavell said in a statement. “When you include sales tax and other taxes, working and middle-class families in Michigan actually pay a higher percentage of their income in state taxes than the top 1 percent. That’s upside-down. Our ballot initiative will restore balance and ensure that those at the very top finally contribute to our schools and communities like the rest of us already do.”

Organizers said the coalition aims to gather 600,000 signatures, exceeding the 2026 requirement of 446,198 signatures for a constitutional amendment measure to appear on statewide ballots.

A similar surcharge was approved by voters in Massachusetts in 2022, requiring taxpayers who make over $1 million annually to pay more towards public education and transportation infrastructure.

A draft petition will likely come before the Board of State Canvassers at the board’s June or July meetings.

Superintendent of Public Instruction Michael Rice and State Board of Education President Pamela Pugh responded to a volley of criticisms from Republican members of the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, defending the Department of Education’s budgetary requests and progress made in student achievement in recent years, even as many areas still require improvement.

Rice and Pugh gave a presentation to the committee on MDE’s Top Ten Strategic Education Plan and the state’s progress in meeting each one, noting improvements that include a record high graduation rate in 2024, progress toward Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s 60 by 30 goal for postsecondary education and increases in both Advanced Placement course enrollment and Advanced Placement test scores.

They also emphasized record enrollment in the Great Start Readiness Program and Michigan’s #1 rating in preschool quality, as well as the successes seen in teacher recruitment and retention upon continued investment in the Grow Your Own program. Rice said these improvements to Michigan’s education system in recent years reflect legislative changes and budgetary attention being paid after decades of neglect.

“There was precisely no money in the state school aid act, nothing to address the teacher shortage, even though it was rife, from fiscal year 2020 and before. It wasn’t until fiscal year 2021 that you invested anything in addressing the teacher shortage, and those were small dollars in ’21 and ’22,” Rice said. “It wasn’t until ’23, based on the recommendation of the department, that you began to consider and ultimately invest in addressing the teacher shortage, $1 billion in the last three years to teachers.”

Still, Rice said, most of the investments in addressing teacher retention and other aspects of education improvements are in their infancies and can only provide partial or rudimentary evidence for their impact.

“What have the results been? Well, the results are fledgling, because the funding is fledgling,” Rice said.

The main ask MDE currently has for the Legislature is mandating Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling, or LETRS training. Rice and Pugh said it would be a significant step in improving literacy proficiency for younger students.

Upon the presentation’s completion, the committee’s Republican members were quick to critique MDE and its leadership for Michigan’s low spot in national rankings for literacy proficiency. Rice noted that the most frequently cited test result by legislators, the National Center for Education Statistics’ Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, is based on only a small sample of students from each state and has different metrics for proficiency than other standardized tests taken by students in Michigan.

On the College Board’s PSAT testing that most 8th graders in the state take, 64% of Michigan students score at or above proficiency for their grade level, compared to 25% on the NAEP test.

Republican committee members, however, called the scores “unacceptable” and representative of “failure” on behalf of the department, arguing that Rice and Pugh should not have come to the Legislature asking for additional funding without concrete evidence of improvement in literacy metrics.

“The funding asks that you have made today have been not an education-related fund requests,” Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) said. “You can focus on reading, writing, and arithmetic and getting back to the basics. I encourage the department to focus on that.”

Tensions rose when Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay) inquired about a resolution the board passed in March condemning executive orders from President Donald Trump seeking to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in schools. Pugh defended the resolution, which she brought before the board.

“When we talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion, I’m talking about the superintendents who said at the end of our board table and talked about the special needs children who they are concerned will not be able to get the education that they need and deserve, educators who sat at the end of our board table from all over the state, from rural areas, talking about if they don’t have diversity, equity, and inclusion reflected up in the budget, or that has to be cut, that they may not be able to transport their children to the classroom,” Pugh said. “Reading the resolution and comprehending it, I know that’s a little difficult, but education is about making sure that our children have safe spaces where they can be supported to be able to learn, and that is what we’re talking about when we talk about DEI.”

Pugh said many of the initiatives that the federal government currently defines as DEI are critical to meeting children’s needs in school.

“Their needs are to be able to read and do math,” DeBoyer shot back. “That’s what their needs are, and we’re failing.”

Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) appeared to argue in favor of large class sizes after Rice detailed the department’s requests for the Legislature to address class sizes becoming exorbitantly large in recent years.

“The greatest generation, 1920, you know, the classroom sizes were 30, 40, 50 kids,” he said. “That produced the greatest generation. And if you’re worried about crowded classrooms, I think I offer this as a solution. Offer a voucher program and let parents choose to spend their money on programs, home school, programs with no strings attached, and that will reduce the amount of individuals in public education, because more families will be using their money to seek alternative means that might be more effective.”

Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) said he “has a problem” with referring to an age of school segregation and widespread illiteracy as an example to emulate in 2025.

“Literacy rates are higher today than they were in 1920,” Wegela said.

Rice reiterated several times the past four years of increased school funding, after decades of chronic underfunding, cannot be expected to yield immediate results without ongoing and increasing support from the state. Pugh likened Michigan’s history of education funding to dropping a brick on someone’s foot – “once you lift the brick off, the bones don’t go back together right away.”

Rice and Pugh cited the state’s new literacy and dyslexia laws as proof of the drawn-out nature of education policy showing results – negotiation and work during the lawmaking process took years, and the policies won’t be fully implemented in all Michigan schools until the 2027-28 school year, they estimated. Still, they argued, it’s worth continuing to invest in additional support and offer targeted funding to address specific problems.

“We’ve shown many metrics that have increased, that’s number one. Number two, all metrics have not increased, and we’ve acknowledged where those metrics haven’t increased relative to literacy,” Rice said. “We’ve pushed forward a plan with the legislature in concert. We’ve said we need every teacher to provide the state to do LETRS training without exception.”

Wegela asked Rice to assess what impact a budget process exceeding the statutory deadline of July 1 might have on local school districts. Rice said if the Legislature continues to drag its feet, schools will be forced to make staffing decisions based on an incomplete financial picture for the upcoming fiscal year.

“Local school districts have a responsibility to pass a budget by June 30. They don’t get to punt, and they’re going to pass budgets that are going to be unduly conservative because they don’t know what’s going to come out of this institution,” Rice said. “The result of that is going to be some real challenge in terms of staffing up classrooms. People who have opportunities elsewhere are going to take those opportunities and go, whether they’re in the private sector or in another state.”

Michigan could become a leader in producing sustainable aviation fuel that airlines want moving forward as they eye lower emissions by approving tax incentives to get the market off the ground, officials said during committee meetings in both the House and Senate.

On Tuesday, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee discussed HB 4424 and HB 4425, sponsored by Rep. Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd) and the Senate Natural Resources and Agriculture Committee discussed SB 235, and SB 236, sponsored by Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Sen. Joe Bellino (R-Monroe).

The bills would create a sustainable aviation fuel incentive program to provide corporate income tax credits to produce the product in Michigan. The program, which would sunset after 10 years under the bills, would be capped at $4.5 million in the first year and $9 million in subsequent years.

Supporters said the bills would benefit Michigan farmers and rural communities as it would provide another use for corn and other crops, as well as a financial incentive. Airlines would also benefit as they look to limit their emissions in the next 30 years.

“Our airline industry can either buy this product out of state or have it blended it out of state, or we can provide the opportunity … for our farmers and ethanol producers to enter this market,” Neyer said.

Major airlines are all hoping to decrease emissions in the coming decades and other states have already passed tax incentives for sustainable aviation fuel, Sarah Gonzales with the Delta Airlines told the House panel.

Gonzales said Delta alone purchases 4 billion gallons of fuel annually and in the next 30 years wants all 4 billion gallons to be sustainable fuel. She said no state has cornered the market yet on the fuel type.

“We truly imagine Michigan has all the right tools at our fingertips to …be the leader in the market,” she said.

John Delmotte, president of the Michigan Corn Growers Association, said the aviation fuel legislation is the best thing he’s seen in years for the rural economy. The benefit to farmers will also help others in rural communities, he said.

“Michigan’s corn farmers are facing challenging economic times. The price of corn is down by more than 40% since 2022, while the price of everything else from inputs to logistics has gone up significantly,” he said in written testimony. “In addition, farmers are facing increased pressure from developers who want to purchase farmland and move it out of production. Having access to new and innovative markets is critical to ensuring that our family farmers can stay in business and keep that land in agriculture. A strong SAF market represents an opportunity to make sure farms stay profitable and can continue to be passed down through the generations.”

Nichole Keway Biber, an organizer with Clean Water Action, spoke in opposition to SB 235 and SB 236. She told committee members that the bills subsidize industries and likely do not reduce overall emissions.

“This is no time for false climate solutions that divert investments and focus away from achieving real … sustainability,” Biber said.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/hazardous-waste_featured-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 12:57:12.905675

New SAF alliance integrates full supply chain: Honeywell, Johnson Matthey, GIDARA Energy, and SAMSUNG E&A form a non-exclusive, end-to-end alliance to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from biomass and municipal waste.

Accelerated project timelines, lower costs: Integrated technology reduces time to market by over 15% and cuts capital expenditure by up to 10%.

Supports feedstock diversification and energy security: Leverages globally available waste streams to meet rising SAF demand and reduce reliance on food-based biofuels.

Four global industry leaders—Honeywell, Johnson Matthey, GIDARA Energy, and SAMSUNG E&A—have formed a strategic technology alliance to deliver a comprehensive, modular solution for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from biomass and municipal solid waste.

The alliance addresses a key bottleneck in the SAF market: the need for a scalable, feedstock-flexible, and streamlined production chain. The joint solution incorporates Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology and enables a single point of accountability across the SAF value chain—from gasification to fuel delivery.

“The launch of our innovative end-to-end SAF alliance demonstrates the power of collaboration to address the world’s energy demands,” said Ken West, President and CEO, Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions. “As demand for SAF increases, the technology to expand available feedstock options becomes increasingly vital.”

Driving Efficiency and Speed

The collaboration is designed to cut project development time by over 15% and reduce capital expenditure by up to 10%, giving SAF developers a faster, more cost-effective route to commercialization.

“The alliance targets the common challenges faced by SAF producers and offers a new way forward with greater speed and lower capital expense,” said Maurits van Tol, CEO of Catalyst Technologies, Johnson Matthey. “Bringing such leading expertise together is critical in supporting our customers to reach the final investment decision.”

Fully Integrated Expertise

Each partner brings a distinct strength to the alliance:

GIDARA Energy: Gasification and syngas production for feedstock conversion.

Johnson Matthey: Syngas-to-fuel catalysts and processing technologies.

Honeywell: Digital automation and process technologies.

SAMSUNG E&A: Global EPC capabilities and project execution excellence.

“This alliance exemplifies what’s possible when expertise and ambition come together,” said Dr. Norbert Kamp, CEO, GIDARA Energy. “We are helping clients and communities realize the potential of waste as a catalyst for a future supported by cleaner energy sources.”

“At SAMSUNG E&A, we believe delivering end-to-end SAF solutions requires more than innovation—it demands strong alliances,” added Hong Namkoong, President and CEO of SAMSUNG E&A. “We are building a resilient and scalable SAF value chain that will drive the future of sustainable aviation.”

Long-Term Market Relevance

The alliance’s focus on non-food, waste-based feedstocks aligns with long-term market trends. The International Energy Agency projects that biofuels from waste and non-food energy crops will meet over 40% of total biofuel demand by 2030, underscoring the relevance of this partnership.

While Honeywell has announced its intent to acquire Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business, both companies clarified this is a separate matter from the SAF alliance.

The alliance builds on Honeywell and Johnson Matthey’s existing collaboration on synthetic fuels, including methanol-to-jet and FT pathways, and is designed to scale rapidly with demand.

This partnership focuses on delivering an integrated, end-to-end solution that transforms biomass and municipal solid waste into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) using the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis process. The vision? To streamline the entire journey, from raw waste to refined fuel, by combining each company’s unique expertise into a seamless, unified system.

At the heart of this collaboration lies a clear division of roles: Gidara Energy brings its cutting-edge gasification technology to convert diverse waste streams into syngas, the essential building block for synthetic fuel. Johnson Matthey provides the sophisticated catalysts and FT technology required to chemically transform syngas into liquid hydrocarbons, fuel ready for aviation use. Honeywell steps in with robust process infrastructure and advanced digital automation, ensuring all stages integrate smoothly and efficiently. Meanwhile, Samsung E&A oversees the engineering, procurement, construction, and overall project execution, serving as the anchor for on-the-ground delivery.

What sets this alliance apart is its unified accountability. Rather than a patchwork of vendors and subcontractors, the companies offer a single, coordinated point of contact, cutting through the complexity that traditionally bogs down SAF projects. Their combined approach aims to slash development timelines by over 15% and trim capital expenditures by up to 10%, addressing two of the biggest hurdles facing SAF adoption.

Samsung E&A’s chief executive, Hong Namkoong, said: “At Samsung E&A, we believe that delivering end-to-end SAF solutions requires more than innovation—it demands strong alliances with world-class technology providers.

“By integrating these advanced technologies and leveraging our proven engineering…we are building a resilient and scalable SAF value chain that will drive the future of sustainable aviation.”

Globally, the alliance plans to target governments and aviation fuel producers eager to adopt lower-carbon alternatives that can be deployed more quickly and cost-effectively. But the backdrop is complex. In the UK, the EU, and beyond, airports face tightening mandates to increase the SAF content in jet fuel to meet legally binding climate targets. However, despite broad industry support, especially for long-haul flights, the promise of SAF is shadowed by controversy.

Supply struggles to keep pace with demand and many production projects have stumbled financially. Critics question whether existing production pathways truly offer meaningful carbon reductions when considering the whole lifecycle. Issues like competition with food crops, deforestation linked to crop-based fuels, and the high energy demands of synthetic fuels risk undermining SAF’s environmental credentials.

As regulatory pressure intensifies, the industry faces a critical pivot point. Reliance on traditional feedstocks, such as used cooking oil or palm derivatives, is increasingly viewed as unsustainable. The race is on to develop next-generation feedstocks and production methods, solutions that can deliver genuine, scalable climate benefits without unintended trade-offs. This alliance, with its integrated and technology-driven approach, aims to be at the forefront of that shift.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c9eb1d76af5caf79d3fa20f9a5452c92.jpg/v1/fill/w_791,h_627,al_c,q_85/c9eb1d76af5caf79d3fa20f9a5452c92.jpg",N,,2025-06-06 10:56:18.364187

Scrutiny mounts over SAF

In markets including the UK and EU, airports are being mandated to increase the proportion of SAF in jet fuel provisions, in a bid to curb aviation’s emissions in line with legally binding climate goals.

But SAF, which is supported across the aviation industry and in the long-haul space in particular, has become increasingly controversial.

Demand is not yet ready to meet predicted supply needs, with many production projects faltering financially. And critics are increasingly questioning whether many current production methods actually deliver meaningful climate benefits across the fuel lifecycle.

Concerns range from competition with food production and deforestation linked to crop-based fuels, to the high energy demands of synthetic alternatives that could divert renewable power from more effective uses.

To integrate the farm economy with green energy, the Yogi Adityanath government 2.0 is drafting ‘Uttar Pradesh Sustainable Aviation Fuel Manufacturing Promotion Policy 2025’.

The state has already received 18 investment proposals to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore from companies looking to set up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) units in UP under the proposed policy.

The roadmap aligns with UP’s vision of becoming a $trillion economy with a major focus on manufacturing and green energy on the back of ‘Make in UP’ and ‘Made in UP’ roadmap.

The proposed policy aims at providing impetus to rural income by using biomass and grain-based feedstock such as sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, wheat straw and surplus food grains for generating aviation fuel.

UP, which is India’s top agricultural producer, is working on a roadmap to augment its portfolio of clean energy such as compressed bigas (CBG) to pare consumption of fossil fuels amid growing energy demand.

Some of these firms are Greenko, AM Greens, Balrampur Chini Mills, E20 Greenfuels, New Era Clean Tech and the Malbros Group.

Meanwhile, the UP government is holding consultations with key stakeholders including investors and energy majors to finalise India’s first SAF promotion policy before it is approved by the Yogi cabinet.

The proposed policy will accelerate UP’s green energy transition, thus putting money into the hands of the farmers while fostering a green ecosystem, according to UP chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh.

The policy will provide a host of incentives on land and capital investment to attract investment in the SAF domain.

Boasting India’s largest network of air, rail, road and expressway infrastructure, including five international airports, UP offers seamless logistics and market connectivity to investors.

Meanwhile, state industry interface ‘Invest UP’ has floated an Expression of Interest (EOI) inviting global SAF technology providers and clean energy innovators to join the ecosystem.

Moreover, the Yogi government is wooing investors with incentives, ‘Ease of Doing Business’ pitch and UP’s advantages as a production hub owing to its vast agri base, robust infra and proactive industrial policies.

At the centre of this shift is intermodal transport, a logistics model that uses more than one mode of transport but ensures the cargo stays in the same load unit throughout the journey.

It’s not a new concept, of course. Goods have always changed hands and vehicles, from carts to ships to wagons, but intermodal transport gained its full meaning in the 1960s with the standardisation of ISO containers. These made it possible to move cargo efficiently across long distances without unpacking or repacking between transport stages.

The aim today is clear: to create faster, more efficient and cleaner logistics solutions that cut emissions while keeping goods moving. DHL, under Julian Neo’s leadership in Malaysia and Brunei, is focusing on expanding infrastructure and operational capabilities to support this approach.

In pursuit of sustainability

Each mode of transport has its pros and cons. Road is fast and flexible but produces higher emissions; rail is more sustainable but relies on available infrastructure; ships move large volumes but are slow; and air is the fastest and cleanest at point of delivery but emits more CO2 per shipment.

Intermodal logistics attempts to get the best of each mode by combining rail or sea for the main leg, with shorter road journeys where required. This is particularly important in the context of Scope 3 emissions, which businesses are now under increasing pressure to reduce.

Through the GoGreen Plus programme, DHL allows customers to cut the carbon emissions linked to their shipments by investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“The main obstacle to the adoption of SAF is high costs, as production capacity remains limited,” explains Julian. “In 2022, we announced one of the largest SAF deals to date—a collaboration with bp and Neste to purchase further SAF through 2026.

“According to a Bloomberg article, DHL Group leads the world in SAF adoption, getting more than 3% of the aviation fuel in our own fleet of aircraft from sustainable aviation fuels in 2023. To achieve this, the company purchased more lower-emission jet fuel than all US airlines combined. Around 15% of the global supply of SAF in 2023 was purchased by DHL.”

DHL uses a ‘book and claim’ method to separate the environmental benefit from the physical supply chain, meaning businesses can claim a verified reduction in emissions, even if they’re not shipping from a location where SAF is currently used.

If the main transport leg is powered by rail or sea – and if SAF is used in aviation segments where necessary – then businesses can reduce emissions even in long-distance or complex supply chains.

""Sustainability now occupies a higher place in the customer agenda than ever before,” adds Julian.

This shift is backed by policy as Malaysia’s government prepares to introduce a carbon tax by 2026, targeting sectors such as energy and steel. The move is set to push logistics providers to integrate cleaner transport options across all stages of the supply chain.

Solving barriers to wider adoption

Using different carriers across a journey introduces complexity in pricing, tracking and accountability. That’s where logistics providers like DHL step in, offering end-to-end services from a single source, ensuring full visibility and carbon reporting.

“For many of our customers, the largest contributor of their Scope 3 emissions is upstream and downstream transportation and distribution activities,” says Julian.

“Businesses rely on complex logistics networks as part of their operations. Freight, delivery and packaging form the three main elements of any ecommerce company’s footprint.”

Digital tools now support this, too. DHL’s Carbon Dashboard simulates different shipment options to show their environmental impact. Its GoGreen portfolio also includes real-time emissions tracking, individual carbon reports and optimisation services that help businesses choose the most efficient and sustainable path for their freight.

“GoGreen Plus allows customers to ‘inset’ their supply chains through investment in SAF,” continues Julian. “As a result, the buyer owns the environmental benefits without physically possessing the fuel. They will also receive an independently-verified certificate to certify their claim.”

Momentum is growing, with more than 90,000 customers in Asia-Pacific already signed up to GoGreen Plus in its first year. Some, like AFFIN Group, are targeting emission reductions of up to 70%.

Julian concludes: “By allowing for greater accessibility, we can help to build demand and accelerate production towards scaling up global supply where it is needed to effectively reduce the carbon footprint of the transportation sector and make progress towards climate change mitigation.”

For companies operating in or through Malaysia, DHL’s approach means they can access cleaner fuels and intermodal efficiencies even before local SAF production starts in 2028.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/6caf7d63f14928d4b7a4a23c0165db88:16a3c3ffc16aaa89a80850786fee362c/b849454e-0d8b-4a79-bbab-1a2a6e04f974.jpeg.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 07:56:46.000125

Reuters said the move is consistent with Trump’s goal to slash regulations on oil and gas development and increase domestic fuels production as part of his energy agenda.

Last year the administration of Joe Biden prohibited oil and gas leasing on 10.6 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, while limiting development on more than 2 million additional acres.

The NPR-A is a 23-million-acre area on Alaska’s North Slope that was set aside in 1923 as an emergency oil supply for the US navy. The land, Reuters said, was opened to commercial development in the 1970s and is now managed by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management.

Companies active in the reserve include ConocoPhillips, Santos Ltd., Repsol SA, and Armstrong Oil & Gas Inc. ConocoPhillips is developing its 600-million-barrel Willow project, with first production expected in 2029.

While groups lauded the Biden rule for protecting animal habitats and the way of life of Indigenous communities, critics said it would cost jobs and make the US reliant on foreign sources for energy.

“Congress was clear: the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska was set aside to support America’s energy security through responsible development,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “The 2024 rule ignored that mandate, prioritizing obstruction over production and undermining our ability to harness domestic resources at a time when American energy independence has never been more critical.”

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the North Slope accounts for just over 3% of US oil production.

A 2020 assessment of Alaska’s Central North Slope by the US Geological Survey found there to be an estimated $3.6 billion barrels of oil and 8.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. This assessment is for undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources in conventional accumulations.

As of 2020, 18 billion barrels of oil had been transported through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, most of which was produced from the Central North Slope, states the USGS.

Most of the lands are owned by the State of Alaska and Alaskan native corporations.

The assessed area includes the Prudhoe Bay field, which lies between the National Petroleum Reserve to the west, the Brooks Range to the south, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the east. Within the giant field, the largest in North America and the 18th biggest worldwide, just over half of the 25 billion barrels of oil in place can be recovered with current technology, states BP Exploration, the operator of the field and 26 percent owner. ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. and ExxonMobil each owns 36 percent.

Trump officials, along with government and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, visited Prudhoe Bay on Monday, June 2.

An Associated Press story via The Globe and Mail, said that President Trump wants to double the amount of oil moving through Alaska’s pipeline system, and build a new natural gas project that would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas (LNG) overseas.

For years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.

While everyone wants to look for a solution to cut down on aviation emissions, the work done towards it is not matching the speed of execution needed, and so, I wonder if things are working in the right direction or not.

How is aviation looking at lower emissions?

In 2021, commercial aviation came together to state that they would go to net zero by 2050 in an initiative that was brought together by IATA, the aviation industry representation body.

There were three major ways to cut down emissions, broadly. First, keep the current aircraft fleet young, which means the fuel consumption goes down because newer engines such as the CFM-LEAP and Pratt & Whitney’s GTF technology consume 15-18% lesser fuel than the earlier classic engines. The upgrades are broadly a decade old now and continue to mature.

The second technique was to look at the increased use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the main term

used by the aviation industry to describe a non-conventional (fossil-derived) aviation fuel. Current technology allows fuel to be

produced from other alternative sources, including non-biological resources; thus, the term is adjusted to highlight the sustainable

nature of these fuels.

The third approach has been to move away from combustion engines altogether, where alternative technologies are being explored, such as hydrogen-powered aircraft, electricity-powered aircraft and so on. Airbus, in 2021, launched the ZeroE initiative, where, every year, it intended to showcase the work done towards moving in this direction. They were working towards hydrogen-powered aircraft, electric powerplants and more, to eventually decide on what technology to move forward with.

Apart from all of these methods, aviation companies such as seat makers and others are continuously working on making more sustainable products to be fitted on board, and also upcycling whatever they remove from aircraft, rather than just throwing it away.

SAF is floundering

Sustainable Aviation Fuel has been around for a long while now, but production is still abysmally low. The input (feedstock) availability seems to be the challenge. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has updated its outlook on the ramp-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in 2025. According to the latest figures, global SAF output is expected to reach 2 million tonnes (2.5 billion litres) next year—double that of 2024, but still only 0.7% of total fuel consumption by airlines.

The problem lies with Europe’s SAF mandates

Most of the available SAF is currently being directed towards Europe, where both the European Union and the UK introduced SAF mandates starting January 1, 2025. However, this policy has come with unintended (and expensive) consequences.

To meet these new mandates, airlines are expected to procure around 1 million tonnes of SAF in Europe alone in 2025, costing an estimated USD 1.2 billion at market rates. But that’s not all, compliance fees and markups imposed by SAF suppliers could add another USD 1.7 billion to the bill. That makes SAF nearly five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel in the region. That cost has landed on our air tickets, as well. For instance, here is the extra I paid for a 1-hour travel ticket inside Europe a couple of months ago.

IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, said this on the sidelines of the IATA AGM earlier this week,

While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate

IATA argues that the money being spent on compliance costs could have been better utilised, specifically, in abating an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

Willie also said, in the press conference held later,

I think there is great concern that we’re not making sufficient progress, not as airlines, but as the value chain that needs to support the airlines transitioning to Net Zero in 2050. And that’s the reason we’re calling it out. We clearly want to see more coordinated action on the part of governments. I think we’re not being helped by countries and regions with mandates without accompanying incentives to stimulate production. I think we’ve been able to demonstrate that mandates have really not done anything to promote the additional production of sustainable aviation fuels, but have merely added additional costs with no environmental benefit. And that’s a great concern for all of the CEOs in the airline industry. I think we’re also concerned that a number of the key players who have said nice words about net zero in 2050 aren’t matching those words with actions. And we’ve made clear from the very beginning that the airline industry will not be able to achieve net-zero in 2050 unless everybody in the wider value chain supports the industry in doing that. So I think today, today it’s, you know, I use the word sounding the alarm. I think it is a wake-up call. We still have time to get there, but we do need to see more action on the part of all of the partners in the value chain to make sure that the industry can get there.

Of course, the unavailability of SAF in real usable quantities means that airlines are unable to use it meaningfully. For instance, Pieter Elbers, on behalf of IndiGo, said there was no point SAF was going to be used in India until it was produced here.

It doesn’t make any sense for us to start shipping in SAF from outside the country to India and then to say, we’re great, we’re having a bit of SAF, doesn’t make any sense.

Where are we with alternative technology?

One of the most prominent works has been going on with the CFM RISE project, which tests technologies that could be available by the second half of the next decade. The programme goals include improving fuel efficiency by more than 20 per cent compared to today’s most efficient engines, as well as ensuring compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to provide further emissions reductions.

Airbus promised entry into service in 2035 of the various technologies it started to work on in 2020. However, as the WSJ reported earlier this year, the OEM, after spending 1.7 Billion Euros, has cut down on funding and reassigned part of the talent assigned to the R&D were moved to other projects. This means a delay of up to a decade to the launch of the “sustainable aircraft”.

Bottomline

While it’s encouraging that SAF production is set to double in 2025, the economics and policy frameworks still present serious challenges. IATA is sounding the alarm on the European model of mandates that push costs higher, and is instead pushing for smarter, global-scale solutions. On the other hand, the emergence of new technologies has also slowed down for the time being, with major vendors putting their plans on ice to do R&D on the new aircraft technologies, while they focus on filling up the current backlog.

What do you make of the sustainability ambitions of the aviation industry? Do you think it is floundering as well?

This plant, located in Cartagena, has the capacity to produce HVO and other biofuels from raw materials of organic origin.
The agreement joins similar ones signed with different companies, in order to reduce transport emissions through our 100% renewable fuels.","HVO or hydrobiodiesel is a biofuel that is produced from organic waste such as recycled vegetable oils and animal fats. Unlike conventional biodiesel, which is obtained by a chemical process of transesterification (a method that converts oils or fats into biodiesel by exchanging components with an alcohol), HVO is produced by hydrogenation. This process improves the quality of the resulting fuel by removing impurities, increasing its stability and performance, and producing a fuel with better combustion properties.

In practice, hydrogenation involves the addition of hydrogen to oils and fats under high temperatures and pressure, removing oxygen and creating a chemical structure similar to that of diesel of mineral origin, but with a significantly smaller carbon footprint. This feature is one of the main attractions of hydrobiodiesel.

Achieving a low-carbon future depends, to a large extent, on innovation. In the renewable fuels sector, the types and applications we develop at Repsol stem from this commitment to the search for innovative solutions. Within this chapter, however, it is worth distinguishing between synthetic fuels or e-fuels - still in the experimental phase - and biofuels, which are already a reality and are available in an increasing number of our service stations in the iberian peninsula.

An example of this is Repsol Nexa Diesel, formulated on the basis of the company's HVO, 100% renewable and which also has the premium additive package. It is important to note that being the leading producer of HVO in the iberian peninsula, as well as the first marketer for the end customer of 100% renewable fuels in Spain, is the result of years of research in our R&D center, Repsol Technology Lab. In fact, we have the first large-scale 100% renewable fuel plant in the iberian peninsula, a project that represents a new step towards mobility aimed at reducing carbon emissions. This plant, located in Cartagena, has the capacity to produce HVO and other biofuels from raw materials of organic origin.

Another example of technological innovation is biofuels for aircraft (biojet, or SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel), which are the main lever to reduce CO2 emissions in the aviation sector, since in their entire life cycle they avoid up to 80% of them. Recently - together with Iberia - we have signed an agreement with Inditex that allows Repsol's SAF to represent 5% of the fuel that Iberia uses to transport Inditex merchandise on its flights.

The materialization of these and other actions is observed in agreements such as the one reached with the Sesé logistics and transport group. Under the agreement, Repsol will supply eight million litres of hydrobiodiesel over the next two years to vehicles in the company's fleet. The agreement joins similar ones signed with different companies, in order to reduce transport emissions through our 100% renewable fuels.",https://www.repsol.com/content/dam/repsol-corporate/cabeceras-seo/cabecera-seo-movilidad/HVO.png,N,,2025-06-06 07:57:13.262319

Achieving Airport Carbon Accreditation Level 5 in 2023, Schiphol is the only airport among Europe’s five busiest hubs to reach this milestone.
“We are proud of these achievements and the teams involved in ensuring our commitment to more sustainable aviation,” Pronk adds.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel Schiphol recognises that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is currently the most viable option to reduce aviation emissions in the short term.
With its ambitious goals and concrete actions, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport is proving that sustainable aviation is not just a vision but a reality in the making.","As the aviation industry grapples with the urgent need to decarbonise, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) emerges as a beacon of sustainable innovation. With a vision of achieving zero waste and zero emissions by 2030, the Dutch airport is taking bold steps to transform its operations and infrastructure in alignment with global environmental goals. As one of Europe’s busiest hubs, Schiphol’s commitment to sustainable practices sets an important precedent for the global aviation industry.

In 2023, Schiphol became the first airport in the world to have its long-term net-zero targets validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). “Schiphol has set ambitious sustainability goals, including zero emissions by 2030 for Scope 1 and 2, and net-zero for Scope 3 by 2050,” says Denise Pronk, Head of Sustainability at Schiphol.

Achieving Airport Carbon Accreditation Level 5 in 2023, Schiphol is the only airport among Europe’s five busiest hubs to reach this milestone. “We are proud of these achievements and the teams involved in ensuring our commitment to more sustainable aviation,” Pronk adds.

Greener ground operations One of Schiphol’s most groundbreaking initiatives is the electrification of its ground operations. Partnering with KES, Schiphol is testing an Iron Flow Battery that supports electric ground power units (E-GPUs) by providing a consistent, substantial supply of electricity. With a maximum storage capacity of 500 kWh, the battery helps alleviate pressure on the energy grid while enabling aircraft to turn off their Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) that run on kerosene.

“Electric ground equipment is becoming ever more popular at Schiphol,” says Pronk. “But there are challenges, such as needing additional personnel to charge e-GPUs and managing battery charge levels during busy operations.” Despite these challenges, transitioning to electric ground support equipment, including electric buses that reduce emissions and improve air quality, is a crucial step toward creating a greener airport environment.

Harnessing renewable energy Since 2018, Schiphol has powered its operations with 100% Dutch wind energy, thanks to a partnership with energy supplier Eneco. The airport is also expanding its use of solar energy, including a major solar panel farm that powers the entire P3 parking garage.

A significant shift away from natural gas is also underway. Pronk shares that Schiphol has implemented Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems to drastically cut gas consumption. Between 2010 and 2024, the airport reduced its gas usage by almost 70 million cubic meters—equivalent to the consumption of 46,000 households.

Terminal 3 has been equipped with ATES since 2019, significantly reducing gas dependence. In 2024, Schiphol continued its efforts to phase out natural gas with the successful delivery of a central ATES system at the Schiphol Central Business District. Almost all piers are now equipped with TES systems, and Pier E will be fully integrated with ATES by 2025. Looking ahead, Terminals 1 and 2 are set to implement ATES by 2030. Additionally, new buildings such as Pier A and the new Pier C are being constructed gas-free as standard, reinforcing Schiphol’s commitment to sustainable and resilient infrastructure.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Schiphol recognises that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is currently the most viable option to reduce aviation emissions in the short term. According to Pronk, blended SAF can reduce CO₂ emissions by 70% to 90% compared to fossil kerosene. However, it is not yet fully sustainable, as current HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) SAF production is limited due to supply constraints and production challenges.

“In the short term, blended SAF is the best option to reduce emissions, but R&D is needed to develop e-SAF, like synthetic kerosene, which has the potential to be produced in volumes that are needed to decarbonise the global aviation industry,” says Pronk.

Zero-waste ambitions and community engagement Beyond energy and fuel, Schiphol is tackling waste through a comprehensive zero-waste roadmap, collaborating with business partners to monitor and reduce waste production. One of the airport’s key strategies is setting up a monitoring system to track zero-waste goals, prioritising waste streams based on mass and their CO₂ footprint. This approach allows Schiphol to identify areas that need improvement and work with partners to reduce waste generation at the source.

“We have developed a monitoring system to track our zero-waste goals. We prioritise streams based on the mass produced and their CO₂ footprint. Many of our actions are based on reducing these streams,” says Pronk.

To gain deeper insights, Schiphol conducts targeted waste scans in various areas of the terminal, identifying specific products and passenger behaviours that contribute to waste. These scans help the airport understand which items are most problematic and how to address them effectively. For example, single-use plastic items commonly discarded by passengers have been identified, prompting Schiphol to collaborate with partners to find more sustainable alternatives.

“We also conduct waste scans to gain insights into different areas within the terminal. This helps us identify products to address with business partners and understand passenger behaviours that need to be nudged to avoid and reduce waste,” Pronk explains.

Schiphol also recognises the importance of engaging with the local community to address environmental concerns, particularly noise pollution. The airport has taken proactive steps to encourage airlines to use quieter aircraft, offering reduced fees for quieter models and imposing higher charges on older, noisier planes. As of 2025, the loudest aircraft will be banned from operating at Schiphol.

To further support local communities affected by aviation activities, Schiphol has set up a €10 million annual Environmental Fund that will run until 2031. The fund is dedicated to quality-of-life improvements in the surrounding areas, demonstrating the airport’s commitment to balancing operational growth with community well-being.

Partnerships and future vision Collaboration is key to Schiphol’s strategy, exemplified by its leadership in the TULIPS program. This consortium, funded by the European Union, brings together 32 European partners, including airports, airlines, knowledge institutions, and companies, to develop sustainable solutions that align with the European Green Deal.

The TULIPS program aims to reduce CO₂ emissions from mobility and promote sustainability at airports through 17 concrete demonstration projects. These projects include testing an Iron Flow Battery and a hydrogen Ground Power Unit, as well as demonstrating solutions for unattended charging of electric aircraft. Additionally, Schiphol is conducting trials with electric trucks for the ‘last mile’ at the airport and experimenting with heat storage systems for buildings.

In line with its commitment to circularity, Schiphol is also working on improving the circular use of materials, addressing both passenger waste and construction waste as valuable resources. Plans are underway to conduct trials for the large-scale supply of more sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and further demonstrations of hydrogen-powered ground handling equipment—all of which play a vital role in achieving the airport’s sustainability targets.

“Collaboration with partners is crucial, learning from other airports and sectors. Integrate sustainability in everything you do. It takes effort and time, but in the end, it pays off handsomely for everyone,” emphasises Pronk.

With its ambitious goals and concrete actions, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport is proving that sustainable aviation is not just a vision but a reality in the making. As other hubs look to follow suit, Schiphol stands as a model of how the aviation industry can adapt and thrive in a more sustainable world.

The global aviation sector is on the cusp of transformation—not just due to climate mandates but because of an emerging realization: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is as much about geopolitical stability and economic resilience as it is about decarbonization. The shift is less about environmental compliance and more about strategic empowerment.

The Rise of SAF: Numbers Tell a Story

Forecasts now place the aviation biofuel market at nearly 49 billion USD by 2030, rising from 38.7 billion USD in 2024. Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) are projected to anchor this growth with a valuation of 18 billion USD by 2030. Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil is also gaining ground with a 4.1 percent compound annual growth rate. While the U.S. remains the largest market, China’s pace is notable, expanding at 7 percent annually.

From Mandate to Market Momentum

Global regulations such as CORSIA and the EU RefuelEU initiative initially propelled SAF into public discourse. But these frameworks have now sparked a wider momentum. What was once a compliance necessity is becoming an industrial policy strategy. SAF is increasingly tied to employment, innovation, and rural development—embedding it within national growth agendas.

Feedstock Diversification: Beyond the Usual Suspects

One of the most promising shifts is the evolution of feedstock strategies. The industry is moving past used cooking oil and tallow to explore lignocellulosic biomass, municipal waste, and even algae. This is not only expanding fuel pathways such as Fischer-Tropsch and Alcohol-to-Jet but also creating a robust buffer against agricultural market volatility.

Airports and Airlines: A Unified Front for Change

Airports like Schiphol, Frankfurt, and LAX are becoming hubs for SAF distribution, investing in infrastructure upgrades to support blending, storage, and compliance tracking. Meanwhile, airlines—especially flag carriers and climate-conscious budget operators—are locking in long-term offtake agreements, signaling a commitment to scale rather than experimentation.

Policy Synergy is the Real Accelerant

While technological innovation plays a key role, it’s the synchronization of policy across energy, transport, and agriculture that is proving most catalytic. Blending mandates, tax credits, and roadmap strategies in places like the U.S., Canada, and Japan are creating predictable market conditions that draw private capital and de-risk investment.

Industry Collaboration: De-Risking Through Partnership

Joint ventures between airlines, refiners, and clean tech developers are no longer speculative. They are structured with price floors, forward contracts, and even blockchain-based traceability systems to ensure scope 3 emissions accounting. These models are paving the way for credible carbon claims and investor-grade sustainability reporting.

The Bigger Picture: SAF as Infrastructure, Not Alternative

Perhaps the most underappreciated development is the reframing of SAF as core infrastructure. When treated as such, it draws funding from climate bonds, national infrastructure plans, and multilateral banks—not just voluntary offset markets. This reframing allows SAF to compete on capital grounds, not just carbon.

Conclusion: From Fuel to Foundation for Resilient Aviation

The aviation biofuel story is no longer about offsets and optics. It is about reshaping the very foundation of how aviation intersects with energy, economy, and the environment. This strategic repositioning—from sustainability project to infrastructure imperative—is the real insight.

As the world moves toward net-zero, SAF stands not merely as a transitional tool but as a foundational element in building an aviation system that is both future-ready and resilient.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-23.svg,N,,2025-06-06 05:56:25.780560

Dr Chaudhari pointed out the need for alternative to diesel in India and role of bioenergy sector in developing the alternate fuels to traditional fossil fuel. We need to promote biodiesel as an alternative to diesel in order to boost bioenergy sector and also to reduce carbon footprint in India. Raj Industries is working on the production of biodiesel and we have found new additives in this area, he said.

While highlighting the importance of agriculture biomass as a major contributor of raw material for the production of biofuel, Dr Chaudhari said that companies are working in the supply chain of biomass from last few years and with the right policy support and investment it is poised to grow. IFGE has chosen a right niche to support the movement in biofuel production.

Dr Y B Ramkrishna, Senior Vice President IFGE and Former Chairman, Working Group on Biofuel MoPNG emphasised the need to use of biological sources apart from feedstocks which can be considered as substitute to conventional fuels. We are looking at various sources which are considered as industry waste and can be converted into bioenergy. We are also looking at the low carbon fuels which will not only reduce the carbon footprint but also are sustainable and commercially viable options over traditional fossil fuel and a lot of R& D work is being conducted in this sector. We need to create an ecosystem in which all the wasted resources can be made available to the industry to convert it alternate biofuel. By practising this 100 per cent of country’s energy will come from bioenergy sector.

Exhibit A: wood pellets.

These compact cylinders aren’t flashy or trend on social media. For the uninitiated, they are carriers of renewable carbon and energy, sourced from responsibly managed forests; a real, scalable, domestic resource that delivers energy security, climate value, and rural jobs while sustaining and growing forests. Wood pellets are emerging as one of the smartest plays in America’s energy and climate portfolio.

The Math Works

Let’s be clear: climate solutions need to scale. We need terawatts of clean power, gigatons of carbon removal, and a replacement for fossil carbon in sectors where options are limited. Think steel mills, cargo ships, aviation fuel, and cement plants — industries that can’t rely on solar panels and wind turbines.

Enter forest biomass. Every year, America’s 360 million acres of privately-owned forests grow more wood than we harvest. Driven by strong markets for wood products, these forests are powerful carbon sinks that have been growing since the 1950s when regenerative forestry practices became the norm.

Responsible forest management, the kind that thins out fuel for wildfires, not only keeps forests healthy but also supplies feedstock for wood pellets. These pellets burn clean, emit fewer particulates than coal, are carbon-neutral, and have the potential to be carbon-negative when sourced sustainably. In other words, we’re turning forest byproducts into a strategic asset instead of a forest fire risk and ensuring more investment into our nation’s forests.

Valued at $1.75 billion, the U.S. led the world last year in wood pellet exports — heating homes and decarbonizing power grids from Cambridge to Copenhagen. That’s not just a climate win. It’s a geopolitical and economic one. Furthermore, there are ample opportunities to increase use domestically.

The Digital Surge: Data Centers Meet Biomass

Data centers are growing at breakneck pace. From streaming to AI, every click and query demands energy. These facilities already consume nearly 3% of global electricity, and that figure is climbing fast. In the U.S. alone, data center energy demand is expected to double by 2030.

While tech companies make pledges to run on “100% renewable,” achieving this goal is challenging. Intermittent renewables like wind and solar can’t always deliver the 24/7 baseload power data centers require. Wind and power are not the silver bullet many had hoped, because expensive batteries must be manufactured and installed to account for their lack of reliability. Meanwhile, wood pellets offer a firm, dispatchable, renewable fuel that can complement the grid and provide the consistent power backbone data infrastructure needs, without the carbon price tag of fossil fuels.

Speed is also a challenge. AI infrastructure is being developed on start-up timelines, but the grids meant to supply power are often hampered by multi-year planning cycles and limited capacity. Utilizing the existing biomass fleet or retrofitting coal-fired power stations to run on sustainable biomass bypasses these time-intensive and costly barriers. These sites are already grid-connected, often already have relevant permits, and crucially a coal-to-biomass conversion can be completed in under two years.

A Carbon-Negative Future? Biomass is the Feedstock

There’s another dimension to this story. Biomass isn’t just an energy source; it’s a carbon solution. Engineered carbon removal technologies like Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) require a steady, sustainable feedstock to function at scale. That feedstock needs to be renewable, reliable, and available today. Wood pellets fit that bill.

When wood pellets are used in BECCS systems, they generate power and remove CO₂ from the atmosphere at the same time, locking it away underground or turning it into usable materials like concrete, fuels, or even long-lived bioplastics. That’s negative emissions. Not net zero. Below zero.

With private markets pouring billions into carbon removal innovation, the need for biogenic carbon is accelerating. Whether it’s carbon-negative electricity, sustainable aviation fuel or green hydrogen, they all have one thing in common: they start with a reliable renewable carbon stream. Wood pellets and woody biomass are poised to play a major role in supporting these emerging technologies.

Missing the Forest for the Trees

Despite all this, woody biomass, like all energy, eventually finds itself in the crosshairs. Critics claim it’s just “burning trees,” a false narrative that ignores both the science and the forests. Sustainable biomass doesn’t chop down protected, old-growth forests. It’s sourced from working forests, the type that are deliberately selected and sustainably managed to produce our dimensional lumber and furniture. Except biomass utilizes the lowest-value fiber that comes off these tracts.

As America’s pulp and paper industry has declined, shuttering dozens of mills and shedding thousands of jobs over the last decade, wood pellets have offered a new market for low-value wood. This fiber has little economic value and without a buyer will often rot, burn, or get landfilled. Using this wood isn’t deforestation, it’s responsible forest stewardship. In fact, without reliable markets like biomass, private landowners will sell and convert their forests for more lucrative returns like agriculture, golf courses, and residential developments.

Investing in Rural America

The benefits of the wood pellet industry go beyond carbon math. This is a sector that brings real jobs to rural America. It supports forest owners, loggers, truckers, and working forests. This is climate action with a hard hat, not a hashtag.

If we’re going to win the climate war, we have to include the states in America’s wood basket where trees grow, people work the land, and decarbonization isn’t an abstract ideal.

Wood pellets are real, scalable, renewable and a true American resource.

In a world increasingly distracted by hype, maybe it’s time we doubled down on solutions that deliver quietly, reliably, and sustainably. One of the smartest is hiding in plain sight — in our forests.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/68/688590_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 04:58:04.708352
