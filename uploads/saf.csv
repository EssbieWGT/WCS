Environment

Last week as global aviation executives gathered in Paris for the bi-annual Paris Air Show, while sustainability was on every lip at Le Bourget airport, most did not have a lot to show for what they had done in the decade since global community reached a so-called historic agreement in Paris a decade earlier, to save the world from climate change, with the Paris Climate Agreement. A decade on, almost on every single count, the world as a whole is completely out of step with what is needed and what was indeed promised at the same grounds of Le Bourget in December 2015.

The champagne flutes have barely been cleared from the chalets at Le Bourget. The roar of the latest fighter jets and sleek airliners still echoes in the memories of attendees. The Paris Air Show 2025, aviation’s glittering biennial showcase, concluded with the usual fanfare celebrating human ingenuity and global connection. Yet, this year’s spectacle unfolded under a starkly different shadow, the looming 10th anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement, signed at the same hallowed grounds of Le Bourget in December 2015.

The dissonance is deafening. While the world pledged to hold global warming “well below 2°C,” the aviation industry, basking in its post-pandemic resurgence, has been taking the world on an accelerated flight towards a climate crash.

The Soaring Contradiction: Growth versus goals

In 2015, aviation accounted for roughly 2-3 pc of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. A significant, but seemingly manageable, slice of the pie. The optimism of Paris suggested technology and cooperation could tame this sector. A decade on, the reality is starkly different.

Despite efficiency gains, total aviation CO2 emissions have surged. Pre-pandemic levels were breached rapidly. In 2024, emissions were estimated to be over 20 pc higher than in 2015. Air travel demand is booming, particularly in Asia, and air cargo remains the lifeblood of global commerce.

The industry, via the International Air Transport Association (IATA), committed to NetZero Carbon by 2050. However, projections paint a daunting picture. Without drastic intervention, aviation emissions could double or even triple by 2050 compared to 2019 levels. Reaching net-zero from that peak, while demand continues to grow, requires a revolution, not incremental change.

By focussing solely on aircraft exhaust vastly underestimates aviation’s footprint since global airports serve as gigantic carbon hubs, with their massive terminals, sprawling runways, energy-intensive lighting, heating, cooling and ground operations make airports significant emitters. While some aim for ‘NetZero airport operations’, this often excludes the core activity or the planes themselves.

Another aspect that the aviation industry has tried to cover up is the Scope 3 emissions, which are those emissions with a direct link to the industry, but where industry itself is not the emitter.This is aviation’s dirty secret, often omitted from industry reports, such as passenger ground transport as billions of journeys are undertaken by car, taxis, and buses ferrying people to and from airports daily. Similarly, the trucks and vans transporting goods to consolidation centres and final destinations, which again are omitted and the in-flight footprint as vast quantities of single-use plastics, such as cups, cutlery and packaging, food production and waste, which are often high-emission meats and dairy, duty-free goods and printed materials.

Beyond the civil aviation, military flights, largely excluded from international climate agreements and reporting, contribute significantly to global aviation emissions but operate with near-zero public scrutiny or pressure.

A Decade of Delay: The lagging green transition

Air Shows around the world buzz with promises of a sustainable future such as hydrogen concepts, electric vertical take-off vehicles (eVTOLs), and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) logos emblazoned everywhere. Yet, the pace of tangible progress has been glacial.

SAF is the industry’s primary near-term hope. However, current global production meets less than 0.2 pc of total jet fuel demand and scaling up faces immense hurdles due to high costs, which are 3-5 times that of conventional fuel, limited sustainable feedstocks which are those that avoid competition with food crops or lead to deforestation, and lagging policy support for production. While airlines announce SAF offtake agreements, they represent tiny fractions of their overall consumption. The 2025 Air Show saw more SAF pledges, but few concrete breakthroughs on scaling production.

Similarly, the aviation industry’s promises for a technological change to go sustainable through new modes of powering aircraft have so far remained pipedreams. Certainly, hydrogen and battery-electric propulsion hold promise, but primarily for smaller, shorter-range aircraft decades from mainstream adoption. Wide-body, long-haul flights, the biggest emitters, will rely on liquid fuels for the foreseeable future. Efficiency improvements in conventional engines are incremental, easily outpaced by traffic growth.

The industry is also facing an infrastructure inertia as retrofitting airports for widespread SAF use, hydrogen storage, or electric charging requires massive investment and planning and is lagging far behind the rhetoric.

Another challenge is a lack of cohesive policy. A global carbon pricing mechanism for aviation (like CORSIA) remains weak, complex, and riddled with loopholes. Kerosene tax exemptions persist in most countries, a massive implicit subsidy for fossil fuels and regulations on non-CO2 effects (contrails) are nascent.

Shared responsibility for a sky-high problem

Achieving anything close to aviation NetZero by 2050 demands action far beyond aircraft manufacturers:

The industry in its entirety, with airlines, manufacturers and airports, must move beyond lip service and PR. This means a massive and accelerated investment in SAF production by aggressively funding production facilities and accepting higher fuel costs in the short term.

Airlines also need to accelerate retirement of older, inefficient aircraft, even if financially painful. They must also seek operational optimisation by investing in AI for flight path optimisation, such as reducing contrails, single-engine taxiing, weight reduction.

The industry must also adopt transparent full-scope reporting with mandatory accounting and reduction targets for Scope 3 emissions and revolutionising the passenger experience by drastically reducing single-use plastics, offering genuinely sustainable food options by default, enabling seamless low-carbon ground transport links.

Passengers:

Not just the airlines or the aviation industry, but the passengers must also play their part in combatting carbon emissions. Frequent flyers, who are less than 20 pc of the population, but cause 80 pc of passenger emissions, must confront their impact. They can opt to fly lesser by choosing rail for short-haul, embracing virtual meetings, taking fewer but longer trips. They can also fly smarter by opting for

newer, more efficient aircraft types, where possible, and preferring airlines with strong SAF commitments, as well as direct flights and of course by packing light.

Passengers also need to scrutinise offsets to which they contribute, often because they were egged on by the airline. But offsets are not a get-out-of-jail-free card; they must be high-quality, permanent, and additional and used by airlines after they have achieved significant emission reductions.

For their part, cargo shippers and recipients must integrate aviation emissions into their own supply chain carbon accounting and actively seek lower-carbon logistics options through consolidation, slower shipping modes where feasible, demanding transparency and action from freight carriers.

The governments, of course, have the biggest role and responsibility in getting the airlines and the aviation industry to keep their commitments. They must stop coddling the industry and need to end fossil fuel subsidies by imposing a tax on kerosene, which fuels conventional aircraft today.

The governments should also strengthen regulations and mandate increasing SAF blending ratios, enforce strict efficiency standards, regulate non-CO2 emissions.

They can also fund research and development and creation of modern infrastructure as substantial public investment in SAF, hydrogen, and electric aviation infrastructure is crucial.

The governments also need to integrate defence in sustainability by adding military aviation in national emission inventories and set up their reduction plans. For this, defence aviation must be brought into the climate fold, subject to transparency and ambitious decarbonisation targets.

Carbon credits and farmers: A lifeline or a distraction?

The aviation industry heavily promotes carbon offsetting and carbon credits as part of its net-zero pathway. Purchasing credits from projects like reforestation or soil carbon sequestration on farms is attractive as it allows for continued fossil fuel use while claiming NetZero emissions. However, this is fraught with peril as offsets are not a substitute. Offsets must be supplementary to deep, direct emission cuts within aviation itself. Relying on them excessively is greenwashing.

They also need to look at issues of permanence and leakage by seeing whether the carbon stored in trees or soils truly stay locked away for centuries and if preventing deforestation in one area just pushes it elsewhere.

There is also an urgent need for ensuring the integrity, additionality or the issue that the project being sought to cover with offsets would happen anyway, and accurate measurement of carbon credits remains difficult and controversial.

While high-integrity carbon removal credits will be necessary to counterbalance aviation’s hardest-to-abate emissions, they are not the answer. They are a potential component of a solution predicated on the industry slashing its direct emissions by 70-80 pc or more through technology, efficiency and SAF.

Missing the landing strip of NetZero by miles

he honest answer to the question whether the aviation industry will actually meet its stated goal of NetZero by 2050, based on the trajectory of the past decade, is highly doubtful. The scale of transformation required is unprecedented. The relentless growth in demand, the slow pace of SAF scale-up, the immense technological challenges for long-haul flight, the lack of stringent global policy, and the vast hidden Scope 3 emissions create a colossal mountain to climb.

Reaching net-zero would require an immediate and drastic acceleration in SAF production and deployment, reaching 50-70 pc of fuel use by 2040. It would also need a fundamental shift in consumer behaviour towards reduced flying, especially among frequent flyers and revolutionary technological breakthroughs in hydrogen or battery tech for large aircraft, commercialized at scale within 15-20 years.

All these would need unprecedented global political cooperation imposing tough regulations and ending subsidies and an honest accounting and mitigation of the entire aviation footprint, including Scope 3 and defence.

Beyond the Air Show Gloss

The Paris Air Show 2025 showcased the industry’s ambition. But ambition without commensurate action and accountability is merely spectacle. The decade since the Paris Agreement has been one of soaring rhetoric and soaring emissions, a true climate crash course. The aviation industry stands at a precipice. It can continue its current path, relying on distant technologies and questionable offsets while emissions balloon, making its 2050 NetZero pledge a cruel joke. Or, it can embrace a radical transformation, backed by genuine investment, tough policy, and a shared acknowledgment that the era of unfettered growth on fossil fuels is over.

A world interconnected by flights is precious and mandatory but preserving that connection without cooking the planet demands more than shiny prototypes at an air show. It demands a revolution, starting now. The next decade cannot be another climate crash. It must be the decade of aviation’s genuine, urgent, and accountable ascent towards sustainability. The future of flight and indeed the future of our planet depends on it.",https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Australia-India-Film-Council-announced-the-appointment-of-Shreerupa-Mitra-and-Achala-Datar-to-its-National-Board-3-1024x576.png,N,,2025-06-28 08:02:43.563382

The entire amount rounded up goes directly towards the additional purchase of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With this option, Condor is expanding its offering for more responsible travel and responding to the results of a survey conducted by Condor, in which customers expressed a preference for more opportunities to invest smaller amounts in SAF.

After entering the flight and passenger details, guests can select in the payment overview whether they would like to voluntarily round up their payment amount to the next round amount of 10, 20, 50 or 100 euros. This round-up amount will be invested in SAF in the future and Condor will refuel additional quantities of SAF above the legally prescribed minimum amount.

Condor has also been offering a climate contribution since last year. Guests can make a voluntary contribution during or after their booking to support SAF and certified climate protection projects. Those who want to make a future contribution when choosing their fare can consciously opt for the new Green Fare. This can be booked on all routes and in all booking classes. The flight-specific kerosene-related CO₂ emissions of the respective booking class of the flight serve as the basis for the scope of support for climate protection projects and the use of additional SAF.

Condor also supports the aviation industry’s goal of being CO₂-neutral by 2050. Fleet renewal is making a significant contribution to this. Since March 2024, only brand-new A330neo aircraft have been used on Condor’s long-haul routes. The modernization course is currently being continued on short and medium-haul routes with 43 A32Xneo orders.",https://aeronewsglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cropped-Group-1.png,N,,2025-06-28 03:58:04.238812

Pima Animal Care Center’s dog kennels are full, with July 4 just a week away. The shelter is offering multiple ways for the community to help be part of the solution for shelter dogs this Fourth of July.

Fireworks can be frightening and overwhelming for pets, particularly dogs. As a result, more pets are lost on July 4 than any other day of the year, and PACC typically takes in 250-300 dogs in the week following the holiday. PACC urges pet owners to prepare now to keep their pets safely indoors during the fireworks and ensure that they are microchipped and wearing an ID tag, both available for free at PACC ahead of the holiday.

“We have a community full of people who absolutely love their furry family members. If you’re one of those, please remember to bring the dog inside in the evenings, even in the run-up to the Fourth of July,” said Steve Kozachik, PACC’s director. “People will be shooting off fireworks ahead of the 4th so plan ahead to protect your pups by bringing them indoors through the holiday.”

The expected influx is especially concerning, as the shelter is already over capacity with more than 500 dogs in the facility. In an effort to create kennel space, PACC is offering a $5 a day stipend to anyone who fosters a dog that weighs 40 pounds or more. The stipend is generously provided by Friends of Pima Animal Care Center, the shelter’s non-profit partner, and will be paid up to 14 days. PACC aims to place 100 large dogs into foster homes before the holiday and will provide food, toys, and calming aids for foster pets.

Dogs and puppies are also currently free to adopt.

For those interested in helping make the holiday more peaceful for shelter pets, PACC is hosting its first Stars, Stripes, and Stories event at the shelter, 4000 N. Silverbell Road, from 6 to 8 p.m. on July 4. This community reading event will allow members of the public of all ages to read to the shelter dogs in an effort to calm them during the noisy celebrations. In addition, dog ice cream shop Bark ‘n’ Berry will be on site serving ice cream to the dogs as a summer treat, sponsored by Tucson Veterinary Urgent Care.

PACC is open on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from noon to 7 p.m., on Wednesday from 1:30 – 7 p.m., and on weekends from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The shelter will be closed to the public on July 4, with the exception of the Stars, Stripes, and Stories event. To see all available pets and services, please visit pima.gov/animalcare.

The Pima County Small Business Commission (SBC) was created in 2003 to advise the Board of Supervisors on current and proposed County policies affecting small business. It also helps facilitate communication between the County and small businesses by providing a forum for issues to be brought to the attention of the Board of Supervisors.

We will be featuring each of the Small Business Commissioners in our newsletter. This month’s feature is Carmen Jones, an appointee of Supervisor Matt Heinz of District 2.

What is your business and what do you do?

I work for a non-profit organization called JobPath as a Workforce Success Manager.

How long have you been in business?

JobPath has been in business since 1998 to address workforce needs of the community.

In the hustle and bustle of your daily routine, what does a typical day look like?

Working with students, speaking with employers to understand their needs, attending community events, and developing programs that will help students become successful in not only their professional lives, but personal lives as well.

Why did you join the Small Business Commission?

I wanted to make a difference. I have a different perspective because I work in workforce development, and feel like I offer a little bit of the perspective of job seekers, while also being able to understand the needs of employers. I learn so much from my fellow commissioners because they are in the trenches.

Reflecting on your journey with the Small Business Commission, what brings you the greatest satisfaction?

The awards that we give out each year. Small businesses are so important to our community, and to be able to highlight what they are doing within our community and celebrate them, it is the best part of what we do!

Other than serving on the Small Business Commission, how else do you give back to the community?

By being involved with more organizations, such as AAUW and SHRM of Greater Tucson’s workforce committee, and just trying to strengthen individuals through education and the development of life skills.

Don’t see your perfect fit listed here? There are hundreds more dogs to choose from at Pima Animal Care Center.

Rubi Munoz Castro can tell you exactly when her dream of becoming an aviation technician first took flight.

As a 33-year-old single mother of two young children, Castro was living from paycheck to paycheck and struggling to pay the bills. She wanted to do something more with her life, but she didn’t have any goals for her future.

The answer came from an unexpected place. While working at an aircraft cleaning company, Castro found herself watching how the mechanics worked on the planes. She’d always liked working with her hands, and soon her interest quickened.

“People kept telling me, you can be a mechanic,” she said. “I started hanging around with the mechanics more, and I started learning a bit more. I think it started there.”

Then she came to the Pima County Kino One-Stop Career Center, looking for help getting her Airframe & Powerplant license, which would enable her to work on a plane’s frame and engine.

“I knew they had a lot of good resources,” Castro said. “I fell in with some wonderful instructors that helped me with creating a professional resume.”

The One-Stop Center also helped her apply for the H-1B One Workforce Grant, designed to help unemployed or underemployed workers gain the skills they need to pursue careers in high-demand industries.

“I applied for the H-1B program, and I was accepted the same day,” Castro said.

Pima County was one of the recipients of the grant, which was awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor in January 2021 to public-private partnerships across the country.

Through the grant, the County partnered with Cochise County, Santa Cruz County and Goodwill Industries of Southern Arizona to support training for high-skilled jobs in the aerospace, information technology, advanced manufacturing, and logistics industries.

“Pima County provided job placement assistance and helped participants connect with local employers and secure employment after completing training,” said Byron Christopher, a community and workforce coordinator at Pima County’s Community & Workforce Development Department.

The grant, which provides funding for both testing fees and on-the-job training wages, gave Castro the boost she needed to launch her new career.

Last summer, she began her on-the-job training as an aviation structures technician – also known as a sheet metal technician – at Ascent Aviation. At the same time, she started going to school at Pima Community College to get her certificate in nondestructive testing (NDT), which means testing aircraft components without damaging them.

Working full time and attending classes while raising two kids wasn’t easy, but Castro looked at it as a challenge, not an obstacle.

“I made a lot of sacrifices and had to study harder, stay focused, and remind myself daily of why I was doing this,” she said. “My kids were – and still are – my greatest motivation. I wanted to show them that anything is possible with dedication and heart.”

After completing her certification, Castro was offered a full-time position as an NDT technician at Ascent Aviation.

“That’s when everything began to shift,” she said. “I began growing – not just in my career, but as a person with gaining confidence in my field.”

Now, she spends her days inspecting aircraft to ensure that they are safe, scrutinizing recent repairs for signs of cracks, corrosion, or other damage.

The H-1B One Workforce Grant ends June 30, but Christopher said its legacy will endure through the impact it had on the community – and the individuals who were able to develop important skills and pursue the careers of their choice. Individuals can still get that kind of help at the One-Stop Center, which continues to offer a wide range of employment services and assistance.

As for Castro, her first visit to the One-Stop Center turned out to be only the first stop on her flight to success.

“I’m thinking of continuing my studies further, because growth never stops,” she said. “This journey wasn’t perfect, but it was mine. I’m proud of who I’ve become.”",https://content.civicplus.com/api/assets/964e45a5-0978-4a14-b0a3-11c76f85cbd0?width=32&height=32&mode=crop,N,,2025-06-28 08:02:52.913552

The Senate is pressing ahead with plans to take up the sweeping budget reconciliation package, informally dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” as early as this weekend. A motion to proceed could come Saturday, with a marathon “vote-a-rama” session likely starting Sunday and stretching into Monday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and President Donald Trump have both warned Senators that the chamber will not adjourn for the July 4 recess until the bill is passed. While the Senate Ag Committee successfully revised its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provisions to secure approval from the Senate parliamentarian, the bill’s Medicaid savings — totaling up to $290 billion — remain in limbo after being struck down by the parliamentarian. Negotiations on Medicaid language are ongoing. Even if the Senate manages to pass the package by early next week, Republican leaders face further hurdles in the House, where some members have already signaled opposition to accepting the Senate’s version. With razor-thin majorities in both chambers, GOP leadership faces a tough road to final passage.

White House downplays July 9 trade deadline as Trump holds tariff power... The White House signaled the July 9 deadline for trade negotiations is “not critical,” emphasizing President Donald Trump’s authority to unilaterally set tariff rates if U.S. trading partners do not present acceptable agreements. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration has sent “friendly reminders” to dozens of countries to submit their best trade offers before the current tariff pause expires. Leavitt reiterated that negotiations are ongoing and the 90-day suspension of “reciprocal” tariffs — introduced after market volatility in April — remains in effect. She underscored that if partners do not act, the president can “simply provide these countries with a deal,” highlighting Trump’s readiness to impose country-specific tariffs, some as high as 50%, should talks stall. The administration maintains it is on track to secure tailored, beneficial deals, but Leavitt made clear that Trump’s executive authority allows for swift unilateral action if needed. Of note: Trump could still extend the date at which reciprocal tariffs would take effect if no agreements were reached. Stephen Miran, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said the U.S. is prepared to extend tariff deadlines for countries that are negotiating in good faith and making tangible progress in trade talks. As noted, the current self-imposed tariff deadline is July 9, marking the end of a 90-day negotiation window. Miran indicated this deadline is “not critical” and could be pushed back for countries that are sincerely working toward a deal. “You don’t want to jeopardize a deal that is underway and making genuine, sincere strides by imposing a tariff bomb on it,” he said.

EU weighs lower tariffs on U.S. goods to secure Trump trade deal... The European Union is actively considering cutting tariffs on a range of U.S. imports as part of a strategy to quickly clinch a trade deal with President Trump, according to reports. EU leaders met in Brussels on Thursday evening to debate how far they are willing to go to win over the Trump administration, with options including reducing nontariff barriers, increasing purchases of American goods like liquefied natural gas and cooperating with the U.S. on economic concerns about China. The pace of negotiations has accelerated following Trump’s threat in May to impose 50% tariffs on the EU, a move he paused to allow talks to continue until July 9. Many European officials now believe Trump’s 10% baseline tariffs are likely to remain and are seeking product-specific exemptions to limit the economic impact. Germany and Italy are leading a push for a rapid preliminary agreement that could be expanded in future negotiations, focusing especially on relief for industries hardest hit by existing tariffs — such as cars, chemicals, machinery and steel. However, reaching a deal remains politically fraught. Some member states are wary of signing an agreement seen as overly favorable to the U.S., and differences persist over U.S. demands for changes to EU digital and environmental regulations. While the U.S. recently circulated a draft “agreement on reciprocal trade,” EU officials see it as an opening offer rather than a final text, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has insisted the bloc’s sovereign decision-making is “absolutely untouchable.” Despite some progress, significant sticking points remain — particularly over nontariff barriers and the future of sectoral tariffs targeting EU automobile and steel exports. The EU is also preparing potential countermeasures, with an approved package of tariffs targeting $24 billion in U.S. imports and a second list in development that could reach $102 billion if negotiations collapse. Bottom Line: Whether a deal is reached will likely hinge on Trump being able to declare a political victory and EU member states agreeing on the scope and substance of the final compromise.

Senate parliamentarian clears key SNAP and cost-share reforms... The Senate parliamentarian has approved the Ag Committee’s revised provisions for state cost-share and SNAP eligibility for non-citizens, confirming they comply with the Byrd rule and may proceed as part of budget legislation. The updated plan gives states flexibility to use either their fiscal year (FY) 2025 or 2026 payment error rate to determine their cost-share requirement starting in FY 2028, shifting in later years to a rolling formula based on the rate from three years earlier. States with payment error rates above 6% will be required to contribute a set share of SNAP benefit costs, with error rates published annually each June. The reforms aim to incentivize states to improve program accuracy and ensure resources are directed to those most in need. Of note: The Senate Ag Committee’s updated farm bill plan would reduce federal agriculture spending by about $186 billion — most of it from SNAP. This figure is less than the initial $211 billion proposed cut but still far exceeds the committee’s original $1 billion savings target. Meanwhile, the House Ag Committee is pursuing even deeper reductions, totaling $295 billion.

Wizz Air has earned a remarkable distinction by being named the Most Sustainable Low-Cost Airline at the prestigious World Finance Sustainability Awards for five consecutive years. This recognition underscores the airline’s unwavering commitment to sustainability and its ongoing efforts to lead the aviation sector in adopting eco-friendly practices.

The award is a testament to Wizz Air’s consistent global leadership in sustainability. As a key participant in the Alliance for Zero Emission Aviation (AZEA), the airline has been at the forefront of promoting zero-emission aviation technologies and practices. Through its active involvement in initiatives like COP29, Wizz Air has been vocal in advocating for policy changes and technological advancements that can help reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry.

A key pillar of Wizz Air’s sustainability approach is its dedication to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The airline has set an ambitious target to ensure that 10 percent of its flights are fueled by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. This initiative is crucial for minimizing aviation’s environmental impact, as SAF serves as a highly effective alternative to traditional jet fuel, significantly lowering carbon emissions. Beyond its SAF initiatives, Wizz Air has also embraced a range of operational practices designed to further reduce its environmental footprint. These include the use of single-engine taxiing to improve fuel efficiency and the incorporation of electric ground power to cut down on emissions from airport operations.

The airline’s approach to sustainability is deeply integrated into its operational model. Wizz Air has prioritized fuel efficiency across its fleet and continuously invests in modern, fuel-efficient aircraft. This includes the widespread use of the Airbus A321neo, an aircraft known for its superior fuel efficiency and lower carbon emissions compared to older models. At present, 61 percent of Wizz Air’s fleet is made up of A321neo aircraft, with the remainder of its fleet also comprising relatively new planes, resulting in an average fleet age of only 4.7 years. This younger fleet plays a significant role in reducing the airline’s overall carbon emissions.

Wizz Air’s sustainability efforts have also extended beyond its operations to influence the wider aviation ecosystem. The airline believes that achieving net-zero emissions in aviation requires collaboration across various sectors, including policymakers, fuel producers, and the aviation industry as a whole. Wizz Air has been a strong advocate for innovation in the sector, and its recently launched Net Zero Roadmap outlines the steps the airline plans to take in its journey towards achieving net-zero emissions. The roadmap emphasizes the importance of technology development, such as the ongoing advancements in electric and hybrid propulsion systems, and the scaling up of SAF production.

In terms of carbon emissions, Wizz Air has set an impressive benchmark for the industry. In 2024, the airline achieved the lowest carbon emissions per passenger kilometre, recording just 52 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometre. This figure positions Wizz Air as a leader in sustainable air travel, showcasing the effectiveness of its fleet renewal strategy and its commitment to maintaining one of the most fuel-efficient fleets in the world.

A major factor behind this achievement is the airline’s strategic emphasis on fleet modernization. By utilizing fuel-efficient aircraft such as the A321neo, Wizz Air has made significant strides in reducing its environmental footprint. This is complemented by the airline’s operational efficiencies, including optimized flight paths and advanced fuel management techniques. Additionally, Wizz Air’s average fleet age of 4.7 years plays a crucial role in maintaining low emissions per passenger kilometre, as newer aircraft tend to be more fuel-efficient and produce fewer emissions.

Wizz Air’s continuous sustainability efforts are integral to its larger commitment to environmental stewardship. As part of its long-term strategy, the airline continues to invest in cutting-edge technologies and operational practices that drive sustainability across every facet of its business. Wizz Air’s efforts to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 are ambitious but achievable, given the airline’s current trajectory and its strong focus on innovation.

The airline’s leadership in sustainability has not gone unnoticed. With a robust set of measures in place to reduce its environmental impact, Wizz Air is setting an example for other airlines to follow. By continually investing in sustainable technologies, advocating for policy change, and driving innovation within the aviation industry, Wizz Air is playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of air travel, making it more sustainable, and aligning itself with global goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

To conclude, Wizz Air’s repeated accolades as the Most Sustainable Low-Cost Airline emphasize its steadfast dedication to environmental stewardship and its pioneering role in transforming the aviation industry. With its ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, the airline’s advancements in fuel efficiency, fleet enhancements, and the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel are creating a solid foundation for a more sustainable future in air travel.

The use of plant oil to power cars, accompanied by the distinct French fry smell. But what if pig excrement were used instead? Would you fly in a pig-poo powered plane?

Currently, the process of creating jet fuel from pig poop eliminates the smell associated with the waste from pigs. The goal is to use carbon-based organic matter, of which Earth has excessive amounts. While pig poop may seem like an unusual option, small studies have proven it to contain all the necessary components to create a synthetic aviation fuel. Consequently, pigs may prove to be the key needed to help decrease greenhouse gases caused by plane travel in the upcoming years.

Yes, Pig Poop Is Being Transformed Into Synthetic Aviation Fuel

Today, planes are powered by specialized petroleum-based fuel. Not only is the fuel expensive, but it is also harmful to the planet. As a result, alternatives have been explored for years. One of the most promising appeared to be plant-based oils. However, using plants to make fuel competes with the world’s food supply. Consequently, plant-based oils may not be able to create enough jet fuel to be a sustainable option.

One thing that there is a never-ending supply of is pig poop. The waste has been used in some countries as biofuel. But now, that excrement can be transformed into aviation fuel, reducing the waste on Earth and decreasing carbon dioxide and other byproducts that have led to the global warming crisis in recent decades.

The U.S. Department of Defense has sponsored a grant via BioMADE, a Manufacturing Innovation Institute, to create jet fuel from pig fecal matter. The $600,000 project is being spearheaded by Prathap Parameswaran, recipient of the Fornelli Engineering Professorship and associate professor of civil engineering at Kansas State University’s Carl R. Ice College of Engineering. Parameswaran will be working with both Iowa State University and the Quasar Energy Group to bring the concept of turning pig poop into aviation fuel to reality.

“Synthetic aviation fuels are a strategic resource for the U.S. Department of Defense,” Parameswaran explains to K-State Today. “While there are other ways to turn waste into fuel, many rely on federal incentives or are inefficient. The use of anaerobic membrane reactors shows real potential as a promising platform; it just needs to be piloted effectively.”

Turning pig waste into jet fuel on a large scale, theoretically, would have an incredibly positive impact on the planet. But just how is this feat going to be accomplished?

How Pig Poop Is Transformed Into Synthetic Aviation Fuel

The process of turning pig poop into aviation fuel relies on the use of anaerobic membrane reactors. The anaerobic membrane reactors are the same as those used in wastewater treatment plants to break down waste. In those cases, the organic matter is converted into biogas. In the case of pig excrement, however, the organic matter is being turned into jet fuel instead.

Before being turned into synthetic aviation fuel, the waste is “separated and purified.” It is then that the organic matter begins the process of being transformed via “ketonization and hydrodeoxygenation.” According to Parameswaran, the goal of the current study is to prove that the anaerobic membrane reactors will work in the way they are believed to, which could lead to a major transformation in the fuel used to fly aircraft in the near future.

“Our role in this project is to validate the use of anaerobic membrane reactors as a platform for transforming these waste products, including fats, oils and greases, into biomanufactured aviation fuel precursors,” Parameswaran explains to K-State Today. “We are essentially running pilot-scale production of this novel technology, while conducting the vital research and development to validate its versatility and scalability.”

Turning the excess organic matter found around the globe into fuel is not only a novel concept but also necessary for the future of the planet. This is why many have been toying with the concept for years and are now taking it seriously to reach a goal that is only a few years away.

Why Synthetic Aviation Fuel Is Being Produced

Synthetic aviation fuel is being created in response to the Sustainable Fuel Grand Challenge. The challenge has set out to decrease the amount of “conventional” aviation fuel significantly by 2030 and to meet 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand with sustainable alternatives by 2050.

To meet this challenge, the following standards need to be met:

A minimum of a 50% reduction in life cycle emissions compared to conventional fuel

3 billion gallons per year of domestic sustainable aviation fuel by 2030

35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel to satisfy 100% of domestic demand by 2050

The problem with creating synthetic aviation fuel in the past was that there was not the right combination or correct percentage of essential hydrocarbons. But thanks to using pig poop and other substances, it appears that scientists are on the right track to meeting their goal within the next five years.

Other Substances Being Used To Create Synthetic Aviation Fuel

It is not only pig waste that is being considered to create aviation fuel. Human waste has been making headlines for the last several years as an alternative to traditional aviation fuel as well.

Scientists from the United Kingdom’s Firefly, a green company spin-off from Green Fuels, has created jet fuel from human poop. The fuel, which to date has only been made in small batches, has been proven to create a 90% smaller footprint than the fuel used to fly planes currently.

The company plans to produce synthetic fuel on a larger scale once an application for the “fuel qualification process” is approved. The goal is to have a facility operational before 2030, producing over 10 million gallons of synthetic jet fuel annually.

Another substance being considered to create synthetic aviation fuel is plastic. If this were to come to fruition, it would be a huge step in not only decreasing carbon emIf this were to come to fruition, it would be a huge step in not only decreasing carbon emissions but also reducing the amount of plastic found in landfills.

Polystyrene is the plastic being used in studies to create a synthetic aviation fuel. Created nearly 95 years ago, the flexible plastic is one that many recognize on prepackaged foods. While the plastic can be recycled, there is no excellent way to separate it from the larger plastics that can also be recycled. Consequently, it winds up in landfills, waiting to biodegrade for hundreds of years.

Scientists from the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center, part of the Prairie Research Institute at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, have discovered a method to convert the 2.5 million metric tons of polystyrene disposed of in landfills annually into aromatic hydrocarbons, a key component of traditional aviation fuel. This not only reduces carbon emissions from aviation fuel but has also proven to be a cheaper method of producing it.

By utilizing both organic products and plastics, it may be possible to realistically meet the Sustainable Fuel Grand Challenge by 2030. If this is done, it will be a significant step forward in reducing carbon emissions and making the planet a healthier place, while still maintaining the current level of aviation travel.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/a_z_animals_articles_974/6727dc55e29ed29616d13c7a1c589a77,N,,2025-06-27 20:01:25.918939

(DTN) -- A federal court vacated a 2024 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule the Texas Corn Producers, Texas Sorghum Producers and the National Sorghum producers contend unfairly penalized ethanol in federal fuel-economy calculations.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sided with the ag groups this week, ruling against EPA's use of an ""Ra factor"" when certifying fuel economy in newer vehicles. The Biden administration implemented the factor for E10 gasoline in 2024, which replaced the use of E0 in testing with E10. The court found the value set for E10 was ""arbitrarily low"" and penalized ethanol.

The nature of test fuels is important because it affects measured fuel-economy values, essentially determining whether automakers meet fuel-economy standards.

The ag groups argued the EPA's use of a 0.81 factor undervalued ethanol's contribution to fuel economy. The groups contend that a factor closer to 1 was more accurate.

A low Ra factor for ethanol essentially pushed automakers to adopt more electric-vehicle and higher-efficiency engine technologies, rather than using ethanol to comply with the standards.

""EPA's Ra Rule is unreasonable and unreasonably explained,"" the Fifth Circuit said in its ruling. ""The agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act by ignoring comments that flagged flaws in EPA's determination of the Ra factor. We therefore grant the petition for review and vacate the challenged portion of the Ra rule.""

The court also took the agency to task for not considering public and industry input in conducting a rulemaking.

""EPA offered zero response to extensive comments about the test program's insufficient sample size,"" the Fifth Circuit said. ""That is fatal to the rule because those comments, 'if true and adopted,' would require a change to the rule.""

The court criticized EPA's ""half-hearted defense"" of the rule as ""lipstick on a pig,"" concluding the agency ""identifies no evidence to support (its) 'trust-us-we're-the-experts' response.""

Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, said in a statement that the court's decision was a ""meaningful win"" for farmers.

""The court's ruling restores fairness and transparency to how ethanol is treated in fuel economy rules and holds the government accountable to sound science,"" he said.

David Gibson, executive director of the Texas Corn Producers, said ethanol should be considered by the EPA as a solution to clean air.

""This ruling ensures ethanol isn't penalized by flawed methodology and it gives the current EPA administration a fresh opportunity to get this right,"" Gibson said.

Wayne Cleveland, executive director of Texas Sorghum Producers, said the court ""affirmed what growers have long said, that the science matters and so does the way agencies engage with it.""

Food waste is an underdeveloped source for production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The prescreening tests (tier alpha and beta) show the average carbon number of the distillation cut (150° to 230°C) of upgraded fuel is 10.6, close to the value of 11.4 for average conventional jet fuel, and the specifications of properties including surface tension, viscosity, heating value, flash point, and freezing point were found to meet the standards of SAF. The metal carbide nanocatalysts were reusable in upgrading tests, and the activity of deoxygenation was retained.

INTRODUCTION

Large-scale production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) (1, 2) from wet wastes is crucial to achieve the target of reaching net zero carbon emission by 2050 (3). This is because SAF has less safety concern than other alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen and has a volumetric energy density (34 MJ/liter) 4.0 to 6.9 times higher than hydrogen. Thus, SAF has been considered the only net zero mechanism for long-haul wide-body aircrafts over the next several decades (4). In addition, SAFs are drop-in compatible with all existing infrastructure and aircraft. Therefore, the existing extensive infrastructure in aviation and their current regulatory compliance can be leveraged under the aviation decarbonization strategy with SAFs.

Triglyceride, lignocellulosic biomass, and sugar/starch are three typical sources for SAF production (5). While lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock is cheaper than the other two, it requires expensive and complicated processing (6, 7). Sugar including starch is mainly used for generating light fuels consisting of short carbon chain components and requires multistep conversions, including fermentation (to produce alcohols), dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation (8). Catalytic hydrotreating of triglyceride feedstock, on the other hand, can be a relatively simple approach, in which hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), hydroisomerization, and hydrocracking can simultaneously take place (9). Other than the benefit of facile processing, using triglyceride-based wet waste as feedstock also increases energy recovery (10, 11), valorizes unwanted bioresources, and alleviates water contamination caused by organic substances (12).

A major class of biocrude oil is made from triglyceride-based wet wastes through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) (9, 13–15) and will be used in this study for upgrading to SAFs. A standard set of specifications derived from conventional fuels has been established to prescreen if an upgraded product is suitable as SAF precursor (16). An important criterion is, unlike diesel fuel, a SAF precursor should not contain oxygen, which must be removed to prevent corrosion of jet engine by oxygen-containing compounds such as organic acids. Oxygen also adversely increases density and viscosity of a biocrude oil. The optimal number of carbons in hydrocarbons for aviation fuel, which affects the flash and freezing point of a fuel, is typically in the range of C8 to C16. The preferred jet fuel consists of oxygen-free organics of paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes, and aromatics (17). Higher heating value (HHV), which can be estimated by elemental (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen) contents of a fuel, is another key parameter and should be close to that of Jet A. In short, it is essential to develop scalable and highly reactive catalysts and to demonstrate their use in the production of SAF precursors using real biocrude based on the studies using model compounds (18, 19).

Transition metal carbides (TMCs), such as beta phase molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C), have unique catalytic properties because of their platinum-like electronic structures (20, 21). Recently, β-Mo2C catalysts were shown to exhibit HDO activity comparable to platinum and palladium using model compounds such as oleic acid and guaiacol (18, 22–24). Both metal-like hydrogen adsorption sites and Brønsted acid hydroxyl sites on β-Mo2C surface were thought to be beneficial to the HDO reaction (24, 25). These carbide catalysts also resist poisoning and corrosion from impurities under harsh conditions using model compounds (22–24, 26, 27). While these studies are extremely useful, model reactions are far from sufficient to evaluate the suitability of wet waste–derived biocrude for SAF because the complexity in composition of biocrude oil cannot be replicated by model compounds (22, 23). In addition, using model compounds one cannot evaluate the whole ranges of specifications of the fuel, including viscosity, freezing point, flash points, to name a few (28). Hydrodeoxygenation of HTL biocrude oil from food waste has been demonstrated using alumina-supported metal alloy catalysts, including CoMo and NiMo. Sulfided CoMo/Al2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts were used previously to produce SAF from HTL biocrudes of food waste at 400°C, 1500 psi, and 0.5-hour−1 weight hour space velocity (13). The upgraded biocrude achieved 93% deoxygenation using CoMo catalysts and 91% using NiMo catalysts, increasing to 98% after taking the jet fuel cut. In addition, a two-stage hydrotreating approach using CoMo for demetallization and mild hydrotreating, followed by NiMo for more severe hydrotreating, achieved 97% deoxygenation of HTL biocrude from food waste, producing a diesel-rich product (9). Thus, investigation of Mo2C-based nanocatalysts in the upgrading of real biocrude oil is much needed to establish the proper processing pathways to the SAF production from wet waste–derived biocrudes (29, 30).

Herewith we report the use of zeolite-supported iron–β-Mo2C nanocatalysts in the upgrading of real biocrude oil, derived from wet food waste by HTL, to a SAF precursor that meets all essential criteria in the FAA standard tier beta test. In our approach, β-Mo2C nanocatalysts were dispersed onto zeolite supports (25, 31, 32) to enhance the catalyst dispersion, thus giving rise to a high HDO activity (19). Zeolite Socony Mobil–5 (ZSM-5) was chosen as the catalyst support for its capability to dispersing molybdenum carbide (25) and to produce high aromatic yields with low coke formation (33). Iron (Fe) was used as the cocatalyst and incorporated into the metal carbide to promote cracking (34–38). Previously, Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were reported to exhibit good cracking performance and a Fe loading amount as low as 5 weight % (wt %) could be sufficient to modify the overall acidity (37). The 3-nm Fe-containing β-Mo2C nanoparticle catalyst on ZSM-5 (Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5) was synthesized via carburization method at 600°C. This catalyst exhibited excellent HDO activity, resulting in complete removal of oxygen from the biofuel and an increase in hydrogen-to-carbon atomic (H/C) ratio to 1.96. Tier beta test indicates upgraded biocrude oil satisfied all key specifications of SAF prescreening standards, including surface tension (at 22°C), density (at 15°C), viscosity (at −20° and −40°C), lower heating value (LHV), flash point, and freezing point. In this context, we successfully produced 100% SAF precursors from food waste–derived biocrude oils using non-noble metal nanocatalysts.

RESULTS

Compositional and structural characterization of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5

The Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst was synthesized at 600°C via the carburization method. For safety consideration, freshly made Mo2C catalyst was passivated using 2% O2 in the tube furnace before the characterizations and subsequent catalytic studies (see Materials and Methods for detail). The atomic ratio of Fe to Mo in the precursor is 5%. The stated amount of Fe cocatalyst was chosen on the basis of the prior study, in which 5 wt % on ZSM-5 provided the suited acidity for cracking with low coking effect (25, 33–38). Our experience study indicates a temperature of 600°C or above was required to produce Mo2C. Inductively coupled plasma optical atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) shows the catalyst contains 1.30 wt % Fe and 41.9 wt % Mo, which is close to the nominal amount of 1.26 wt % Fe and 43.1 wt % Mo in the reactant mixture (table S1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) study indicates the as-made catalyst consists of phase-pure β-Mo2C on ZSM-5, with no diffraction from Fe-containing species (Fig. 1A). Mo2C nanocatalyst without Fe was made following the same synthetic procedure except without the addition of iron (III) nitrate. This Fe-free sample exhibits enhanced crystallinity of Mo2C, judging by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and peak intensity (Fig. 1A). The addition of Fe effectively reduced the crystal domain size of Mo2C. The FWHM and positions of XRD peaks for ZSM-5 are similar in the three samples, suggesting no major change in zeolite structure. This structural stability is beneficial for the dispersion of metal precursors and the formation of metal carbide nanoparticle catalysts (25, 39). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) study shows the ZSM-5 particles have an average size of ~2 μm, which are made of aggregates of ~200-nm crystallites (fig. S1). This hierarchical morphology retained for Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts (fig. S2).

The Mo2C nanoparticle catalysts were further examined by both SEM (Fig. 1B) and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. 1C). The microscopic data show that the size of catalyst particles can be as large as ~30 nm, although the primary nanoparticles are only a few nanometers in size. The XRD Rietveld refinement data indicate the crystal domain size is about 3.0 nm (fig. S3 and table S2). The small sub–5-nm Mo2C crystallites were observed to disperse evenly over the ZSM-5 support, judging by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and STEM micrographs (figs. S4 and S5). The fast Fourier transform analysis indicates the lattice observed in HAADF-STEM has a d-spacing of 0.27 nm, which correspond to Mo2C (100) and of 0.22 nm to the (101) facet (Fig. 1C and fig. S6). These results show the carburization could successfully produce carbide nanoparticles with size optimal for catalysis, which is advantageous over the commercial Mo2C (figs. S7 and S8). STEM energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) shows both Fe and Mo elements are dispersed uniformly across the catalyst particles. (Fig. 1D and fig. S9).

Upgrading and characterization of biocrude oil

The upgrading of biocrude oil was performed using a Parr reactor as illustrated in Fig. 2A. The biocrude oil derived from the HTL process was mixed with freshly prepared Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst at a catalyst/biocrude mass ratio of 6:100. All catalytic upgrading was conducted at 400°C in pressurized H2 for 2 hours, unless otherwise stated. Elemental analysis data indicate the oxygen content in the oil decreased from 6.74 to ~0 wt % after the upgrading using Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5, showing a complete deoxygenation (Fig. 2B and table S3). After the hydrodeoxygenation process, 6.6 ml (or 4.8 g) of SAF precursor could be obtained from 10 ml of the biocrude oil (density: 0.857 g/ml). This result corresponds to a conversion of about 56 wt % from pretreat biocrude to SAF precursor, similar to the conversion to hydrocarbon from volatile fatty acids derived from the biobased chemicals through the anaerobic digestion (40). The hydrogen content increased from 12.26 to 14.08 wt %, corresponding to an increase of HHV from 41.80 to 46.51 MJ/kg, which is comparable to that of Jet A (table S4). The substantial improvement in oil quality could also be readily observed from the color change of oils before and after the treatment (fig. S10). To understand the effects of processing variables such as temperature and hydrogen pressure, we conducted upgrading experiments in the absence of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst while keeping all other conditions the same. The oxygen content decreased to 1.70 wt %, which was equal to about 75% of deoxygenation. The hydrogen content of oil, however, only slightly increased to 13.0 wt %. We analyzed the H/C ratio of the upgraded oil, which is a measure of the degree of saturation of organic compounds after the catalytic hydrogenation. Our results show after the treatment by Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst, the oil product exhibited an H/C ratio of 1.96, much higher than that of 1.82 if no catalyst was used. Noticeably, the upgraded oil exhibited the H/C ratio, thus the heating value, comparable to that of Jet A. The oil produced after treatment with commercial Mo2C, however, shows no improvement or even worse than the raw biocrude oil in H/C ratio and oxygen content, with 9.8 wt % O and 12.0 wt % H. Our study shows the nanometer-sized Mo2C particle and zeolite/Fe compositions in the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts are necessary to achieve high HDO activity.

We further investigated the distribution of boiling point of the upgraded oils by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (fig. S11A). The weight percentage of upgraded oil after treatment using the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 nanocatalysts are preferably in the low-temperature regions, with decreased distribution in temperature range above 250°C, as contrast to those treated without catalyst or with the commercial Mo2C (fig. S11B). The weight distribution heatmaps of different oils were obtained by calculating the integral of percentage weight over different temperature ranges (Fig. 2C and table S5). A decrease of weight distribution was observed in the range of 250° to 300°C for all oil samples after the catalytic treatment. This result suggests long carbon chain substances in the oils were cracked in pressurized H2 at 400°C. Weight distribution above 350°C slightly increases for upgraded oils using no catalyst or the commercial Mo2C, which could be caused by the polymerization reaction during upgrading. These two oil products also exhibit relatively uniform weight distributions across 100° to 300°C, while the upgraded oil using the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the predominant fraction is in the temperature range of 150° to 250°C. Because the wet waste–derived biocrude oil is composed of a mixture of different components, an overall weight distribution towards the lighter range increases the percentage of distillation cut that meets the SAF standards (table S6). In a different classification (fig. S11C), our catalytic treatment could upgrade the “diesel-like” raw biocrude oils into “kerosene/gasoline-like” fuels, noting the property of Jet A is regarded as gasoline-like (41).

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was carried out to study the distribution of molecular weight of compounds in various oils (fig. S12 and table S7), which is directly related to the length of carbon chains. An interval of 100 Da was used in our calculation of the number-weighed molecular weight (Fig. 2D). The molecular weight distribution between 100 and 300 Da was given special attention, since carbon chains in the range of C8 to C16 are preferred for SAFs. In the raw biocrude oil, a total of 25.9 wt % was found to locate in this range of molecular weight distribution, while 8.0 and 22.9 wt % were found for the oil products after treatments without the catalyst and with commercial Mo2C, respectively. After the treatment with Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst, 59.4 wt % of the upgraded oil was found in this molecular weight distribution, which is comparable to that of Jet A (62.1 wt %). The upgraded oil has lower molecular weights in all intervals above 300 Da. Table S7 summarizes the number-averaged molecular weights (Mn) and mass-averaged molecular weights (Mm) of all oils tested. Upgraded oil using the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst has a Mn of 254 Da, which is comparable with that of Jet A (242 Da) and much lower than those of raw biocrude oil (404 Da) and the oil product obtained using the other catalysts (522 and 389 Da). The substantial reduction in molecular weight results in the change in density of the oils after the upgrading treatments (table S8). Among all oils tested, raw biocrude oil has the highest density of 0.853 g/ml, and the upgraded oil using Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 has the lowest density of 0.783 g/ml.

Prescreening results as a SAF precursor

The property of hydrocarbon in the product was analyzed on the full distillate range fuel using two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) using the standard methods described elsewhere (Fig. 3A) (42). The full distillate of upgraded biocrude oil ranges from C5 to C21, with an average carbon number of 11.2 close to that of the conventional jet fuel (11.4), and exhibits a bimodal distribution peaked around C8 and C18, consisting of n- and iso-alkanes (69.7%), cycloalkanes (21.5%), and aromatics (8.8%). While the average carbon number is similar to that of jet fuel, the bimodal carbon distribution needs further treatment to pass the ASTM D4054 evaluation. Thus, it is pragmatic to extract the most suitable fraction of the upgraded oil for SAF certification tests.

We obtained the target fraction from the full range biocrude oil by performing distillation, which was executed from 150° to 230°C, focusing on meeting the flash point and freezing point specification limits of the final fuel because these two properties are crucial to address aviation safety issues (43). The front end of distillation is determined to be 150°C, matching that of the conventional jet fuel to ensure a comparable flash point. The back end of the distillation, however, is truncated at 230°C, instead of 260°C for jet fuel, due to the concentrated n-alkanes in the obtained biocrude oil. Freezing point of fuels is typically dominated by molecules having the highest freezing points in oil (44), normally the heaviest hydrocarbon species. Higher carbon number n-alkanes generally have higher freezing points than their isomerized counterparts. The inclusion of C14 to C16 components in the SAF cut is detrimental to the increase of freezing point. Thus, we reduced the back end of the distillation range to ensure a proper freezing point. The yield of SAF precursors from the temperature range of 150° to 230°C is ~15 wt %.

Figure 3B illustrates the analysis of hydrocarbon types of the distilled SAF precursor. The average carbon number of the SAF fraction is 10.6 compared to 11.4 for conventional jet fuel. Compared to the full range oil, the SAF precursor has higher contents of cycloalkanes (25.4%) and aromatics (12.1%), with a distribution peaked around C10. Tier beta prescreening was conducted on the distilled SAF fraction, evaluating properties such as surface tension, density, kinematic viscosity, LHV, flash point, freezing point, and distillation curve. The derived cetane number (DCN) is predicted from estimation due to the volume limitation. These properties are critical for combustor figures of merits and operability limits (17). Aligning the SAF precursor within the specification limit can mitigate risks at the earliest stage of conversion technology development. As shown in Fig. 3C, our SAF fraction demonstrated excellent surface tension, smaller than 24 mN/m at 22°C, which is better than the experience range of conventional jet fuel. The viscosity at −20° and −40°C also outperformed the conventional jet fuel. The density of obtained SAF precursor is relatively low compared with the conventional fuel but still within the acceptable range. Low values in these properties enhance combustor operability limits and are attributed to the cutoff point of 230°C, which excludes heavier fractions (>C14). Energy density of this oil is much higher than the other cuts, as suggested by the LHV ~43.50 MJ/kg, which can be attributed to the high concentration of n- and iso-alkanes. The flash point of SAF precursor is well fitted within the experience range, suggesting a close resemblance with conventional jet fuel regarding the light components. The freezing point is superior because of the approach of excluding >C14 substances. Thus, an optimal distillation range was identified for this fuel to achieve a balance between SAF yield and control of specific properties, such as freezing point. Tier alpha property predictions indicate a high DCN value for the SAF fraction, which could result from the richness of n- and iso-alkane content. Overall, the obtained distillate cut reached the threshold for key physical properties set for SAF, indicating that Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 is an appropriate catalyst for converting food waste–derived biocrude oil to high-quality SAF product, and other conversion pathway and processing protocol need to be further developed.

Figure 3C summarizes the results of an overall assessment performed by evaluating the distillation curve, which contrasts against that of the conventional jet fuel. Our SAF precursor falls in the experience range up to ~60 wt %, with the heavy section slightly deviating from the target due to the lack of C14 to C16 components in the distillate to meet the freezing point specification, which is related to the high concentration of n-alkane (52.2%). From an economic perspective, the current conversion pathway is attractive because besides the SAF precursor, the C4 to C8 cut can be used for gasoline and the C14 to C21 cut as biodiesel. Heavier fraction (C22 and above) in the biocrude can be upgraded for marine fuel or lubricant. We noted that a multistep approach was previously developed using methane as a feedstock to produce n-paraffin SAF designed as a 10 vol % blend (40). In that process, instead of directly upgrading biocrude, methane was converted into mixed volatile C2 to C8 fatty acids (VFAs) via anaerobic digestion. Ketonization over ZrO2 and hydrodeoxygenation over Pt/Al2O3 were then carried out to convert the wet waste–derived VFAs into normal paraffins.

Compositional and structural stability of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst

We investigated the stability of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 by reusing this catalyst for multiple runs (Fig. 4A). In a standard test, after the reaction, the solids including catalyst were separated from the upgraded oil by centrifugation, washed by acetone, and dried at 80°C in a vacuum oven. The Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 after the first upgrading test, which is denoted as Cat-1, was collected and separated from the upgraded oil (i.e., Oil-1) and used as the catalyst for the second upgrading. No reactivation of catalyst was needed, and all reaction conditions were kept the same for all the catalytic upgrading study (Fig. 4A). Figure 4B shows the HDO activity of reused Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts by analyzing the elemental contents of three upgraded oils. No oxygen was detected in all three upgraded oils, suggesting ~100% deoxygenation efficiency (table S9). The hydrogen content of upgraded oils decreased slightly from 14.08 wt % (Oil-1) to 13.74 wt % for Oil-2 and 13.85 wt % for Oil-3. The H/C molar ratio changed from 1.96 (Oil-1) to 1.90 for Oil-2 and 1.90 for Oil-3. The reused Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts (Cat-1 and Cat-2) were still active to produce upgraded oils with the HHV that is comparable to Jet A (~ 46.10 MJ/kg; table S4). Elemental analysis results indicate density of the three upgraded oils is consistent (0.779 to 0.783 g/ml; table S10). Both Oil-2 and Oil-3 exhibited higher carbon content. TGA results show the boiling point distributions for all thee upgraded oils are concentration in the range of 150° to 250°C (Fig. 4C; figs. S13, A and B; and table S11).

XRD and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to examine the structures of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst after each run of upgrading of biocrude oils. The XRD study shows β-Mo2C and ZSM-5 phases retained for all reused Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts (i.e., Cat-1, Cat-2, and Cat-3) and no identifiable coke formed (fig. S14). The morphology and particle size of post-upgrading Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts did not show major difference from that of the freshly prepared (fig. S15). Rietveld refinement analysis indicates the average size of Mo2C nanoparticles remained to be in the range of sub–3 nm (fig. S16 and table S12), which were also observed in the high-resolution electron microscopic images (fig. S17). Surface composition of the reused catalyst was investigated by comparing the valence state of Mo and C based on the XPS study (fig. S18 and table S13). The intensity of Mo(II) peaks for Cat-1 at 231.8 eV (3d3/2) and 228.6 eV (3d5/2) is comparable to that of fresh catalyst. Carbon peaks in the carbides were observed for both Cat-1 and fresh catalysts and no detectable change of surface Mo2C nanoparticles after the upgrading run, indicating good structural and compositional stability.

The XPS Fe 2p data show Fe2+ or Fe3+ 2p1/2 (~724 eV) and 2p3/2 (~710 eV) signals appeared in the Cat-1 sample besides the Fe0 2p3/2 (~707 eV) in the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 (fig. S18) (45, 46). This observation indicates the nanocatalysts could be oxidized either during or after the upgrading process, suggesting that the structures of Fe species might change in the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5. We also performed TGA analysis of fresh Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 and Cat-1 to further study coke formation (fig S19). The mass loss curves for both samples show comparable curves in terms of the weight loss in the entire temperature range. In the temperature range between 270° and 400°C, Cat-1 exhibits larger derivative in weight gain than that of the fresh catalyst. These data suggest the oxidizable species in Cat-1 such as carbide and iron could take up oxygen faster than the freshly made catalysts, in agreement with the XPS Fe 2p data. Nevertheless, the Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst is readily reusable for oil upgrading, suggesting that the highly reducing condition of hydrodeoxygenation reaction is highly tolerable of initial structure changes, and catalysts can be regenerated in situ during the process.

DISCUSSION

This work demonstrates the feasibility of catalytic upgrading of wet waste–derived biocrude oil into SAF precursors using zeolite-supported Mo2C nanocatalyst. We found that Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited excellent HDO activity to fully deoxygenate the biocrude oil produced from HTL process. We achieved a yield of 56 wt % for SAF precursor from pretreated biocrude, equivalent to a food waste to SAF production yield of 23 wt %, based on a yield of 59 wt % from food waste to biocrude and a loss of 30 wt % during the pretreatment of biocrude (47–49). The upgrade oil exhibits the HHV over 46.10 MJ/kg comparable to Jet A. This high performance can be attributed to the nanometer-sized Mo2C catalyst on Bronsted acid–based zeolitic supports, which remain compositionally and structurally stable in the stability tests. This work develops low-cost metal carbide catalysts and demonstrates their potential in converting biocrude oils, oleochemical-based fermentation products, and crop residue-derived biomass into SAF candidates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chemical and materials

Ammonium molybdate (para) tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 99%, A13766] and the reference beta-phase molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C, 99.5% metals basis, 012192.36) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate ( ≥98%; ACS reagent, 216828) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Zeolite ZSM-5 (ammonium, 045880.22) and quartz wool (fine, 4 μm; 451040100) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Methane [ultra-high purity (UHP)], hydrogen (UHP), argon (UHP), compressed air (breathing quality grade), and nitrogen were purchased from Airgas. Acetone (ACS grade, A18-4) was purchased from Fisher Chemical. Jet A sample was obtained from a local airport. Biocrude oil was produced from HTL via our laboratory-made continuous plug-flow pilot reactor using food waste as feedstock, as detailed in previous work (47–49). In summary, salad dressing waste (62% lipid, 30% carbohydrate, 2% protein, and 6% ash) was obtained from a local food processing plant and homogenized to a solids content of 20 wt %. The food waste was converted at 300°C and 11 MPa, with a retention time of 20 min, yielding 59 wt % biocrude by mass. Before upgrading, the HTL biocrude oil was washed and distilled to remove salt (mainly Na and K), excess water, and ash. In all experiments, deionized (DI) water (resistivity of 18.25 MΩ·cm at room temperature, Millipore) was used.

Synthesis of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5

The metal precursor was prepared via the wet impregnation method. In a 100-ml flask, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (171.6 mg), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (1.5 g), and ZSM-5 (1.0 g) were added to 20 ml of DI water. The mixture was heated at 80°C (250 rpm) for 8 hours in an oil bath using a hotplate stirrer (VWR 7x7 Ceramic Hotplate Stirrer, 97042-714). After water evaporated, the remaining mixture was further dried at 80°C in a vacuum oven (VWR Symphony Vacuum Oven, catalog no. 414004-582) overnight. The dried solids were collected and ground into a fine powder. The powder precursor (1.0 g) was loaded into a quartz tube, which was placed inside a vertical furnace. Quartz wool was used as a support for the powder precursor in a vertically placed tube. After the assembly, the quartz tube was purged with a flowing gas mixture of CH4/H2 (flow rate ratio: 8/32, 40 sccm in total). The subsequent carburization step was programmed to firstly reach 300°C at a rate of 4°C/min and then to 600°C at 1°C/min. The temperature was then kept at 600°C for 2 hours. After the furnace was naturally cooled to room temperature, the quartz tube was purged by N2 for 10 min (90 sccm). The N2-protected solids were carefully transferred from the quartz tube to a test tube (length > 10 cm) filled with Ar to avoid exposure of catalyst to air. The test tube was then sealed with Parafilm for future usage in oil upgrading. The time of storage was typically <24 hours. Considering the pyrophoric nature of metal carbide nanoparticles, we synthesized the catalyst right before the upgrading tests. For material characterization, the as-made catalysts were passivated in 2% O2 (a mixture of 10 sccm compressed air and 90 sccm N2) for 1 hour after the purge by N2 in the furnace for 10 min. The sample can be safely removed from the quartz tube. [Caution: Freshly made molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are highly reactive if they are not passivated and ignite upon their exposure to ambient air.]

Structural and compositional characterization of catalysts

XRD patterns were obtained using Rigaku Miniflex 600 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα x-ray source (λ =1.54056 Å). The size analysis based on XRD patterns were conducted using a profile fitting software, TOPAS, provided by Bruker Corporation. This software was used to obtain the volume-weighted mean crystallite sizes (LVol-IB) calculated from Scherrer equation based on Rietveld refinement results. SEM images were obtained from Hitachi S-4800 SEM. TEM micrographs were from JEOL 2100 Cryo microscope. High-resolution STEM and EDS studies were conducted using FEI Themis Z advanced probe aberration corrected analytical scanning/transmission electron microscope. The mass contents of Fe and Mo in the samples were determined by ICP-OES using a PerkinElmer Optima 8300 system. XPS data were obtained using Kratos Axis Supra+ Photoelectron spectrometer, and the corresponding data analysis was performed using CasaXPS software. The identification, deconvolution, and assignment of XPS peaks were based on the references provided in an XPS handbook (45, 46). The XPS data were analyzed after the calibration using the adventitious carbon peak at binding energy of 284.80 eV. The deconvolution of overlapped peaks in Mo 3d spectra was carried out using the principle of spin-orbit splitting ratio for 3d spectrum, i.e., 2:3 for the signals from 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively.

Catalytic upgrading tests of biocrude oils

Upgrading tests of biocrude oils were carried out using a 100-ml Parr 4598 reactor with a Parr 4848 reactor controller. The biocrude oil (10 ml) was added to an Ar-protected, freshly prepared, non-passivated Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst (~0.5 g) in the test tube. The mixture was stirred and transferred to a 100-ml stainless steel reaction chamber, which was then assembled in the Parr reactor. The reactor was purged with ~500-psi H2 three times before it was pressurized to 1500-psi H2 (~20°C), followed by a heat treatment at 400°C for 2 hours. The heating rate was set at ~25°C/min. The maximum pressure in the reactor was ~2200 psi at 400°C. After the reaction, the reactor was quenched in cold water for 10 min. The upgraded oils and used catalysts were collected and separated by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min (Beckman Coulter Inc., Allegra X-30 Series). The used catalysts were washed with acetone three times before drying in the vacuum oven overnight. For control experiments using commercial Mo2C or ZSM-5, all reaction conditions were kept the same other than the catalysts used. The weight of individual components, other than the total amount of catalysts, was also kept the same, i.e., ~0.5 g of Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 was replaced with ~0.23 g of commercial Mo2C or ~0.27 g of commercial ZSM-5 in the control upgrading tests, according to the theoretical value based on feeding ratio (table S1). When performance was tested with the used Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5, all reaction conditions were kept the same other than the catalyst. The amount of used Fe-Mo2C/ZSM-5 for the upgrading test is 0.5 g. No pretreatment or reactivation of used catalysts was conducted.

Characterization of biocrude oils and analytical methods

The elemental content was determined using CE440 CHN analyzer from Exeter Analytical. The oxygen content was calculated by the difference, i.e., 100-∑(C+H+N) (wt %). The HHV of biocrude oils was calculated using Dulong’s formula (50). The boiling point distribution of oil samples was obtained using a Q50 Thermogravimetric Analyzer from TA Instruments. The sample was placed in a heating chamber purged with N2, which could mimic the distillation processing. The samples were heated from room temperature to 600°C at a rate of 20°C/min in N2 flow at atmospheric pressure. The TGA data analysis was performed using Universal Analysis 2000 software, provided by TA Instruments, Waters LLC. The distribution of molecular weight of the compounds in biocrude oils was studied by performing MALDI-TOF-MS using Bruker Autoflex Speed LRF instrument. The scan range of mass spectra is between 50 and 1500 Da. The Mn, Mm, and polydispersity index (I) were calculated using the following equations

Mn=∑(Mi×Ni∑Nj)=∑(MiNi)∑Nj

(1)

Mm=∑[Mi×MiNi∑(MjNj)]=∑(Mi2Ni)∑(MjNj)

(2)

I=MmMn

(3)

where Mi and Ni are the mass (in unit of Da) and background-corrected abundance of the ith oligomer, respectively. The background baseline is determined on the basis of averaged noise level of the mass spectra. The polydispersity index (I) measures the dispersion of molecular weights of chemical compounds in the oil, i.e., I of one suggests a homogenous weight distribution, and larger I values (i.e., I > 1) imply widely dispersed weight distribution.

Hydrocarbon type analysis was performed using two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC), of which detailed setup can be found in a previous work (42). The oil went through distillation using a Micro Spinning Band from B/R Instrument, which offers excellent theoretical plates and minimal dead volume. The distillate cut was executed from 150° to 230°C based on the flash point and freezing point specification limits (43).

Bonn climate talks leave mountain to climb for Belem

Deepening divisions between developed and developing countries promise to make Cop 30 an arduous summit, writes Rhys Talbot Paris, 27 June (Argus) — Progress in technical discussions at the UN climate conference in Bonn, Germany, still leaves much work for the incoming Brazilian presidency ahead of November's Cop 30 summit in Belem if it is to deliver a strong outcome on emission cuts. After a rocky start in Bonn this month, with a two-day fight over the agenda, negotiators delivered texts across a number of areas relating to emission reductions. The Brazilian Cop takes place 10 years after the Paris agreement, in which states agreed to limit global warming to well below 2°C and preferably 1.5°C, and two years after Cop 28 in Dubai, when they undertook the global stocktake (GST) to measure progress on reaching Paris goals and pledged to phase out fossil fuels. The annual Bonn talks are intended to allow negotiators to prepare the ground for political decisions to be made at Cop. But this year, even those discussions that have advanced well have tended to produce large texts with many mutually exclusive options in brackets, reflecting incompatible positions that will have to be worked out by policy makers between now and the end of the Belem Cop. The main arena for considering fossil fuels, a discussion of the meaning of the GST, has left a heavily divided text to Belem. Developed countries have argued for a longer, more extensive process, while some parties — including China, India and Saudi Arabia — have tried to limit the scope, duration and outputs of the sessions. And the texts do not directly address the elephant in the room — countries are this year delivering their nationally determined contribution (NDC) documents laying out their plans to cut emissions. Those plans are likely to be insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C. And the Brazilian presidency will have to grasp the initiative to find a way to ensure advances on the Paris and Dubai goals. The leader's summit to be held immediately before Cop could offer a chance for movement. The release of a keenly awaited synthesis report of NDCs on 24 October could offer a spur to this summit. ""People will want a reaction from our leaders"" when the report comes out, Cop 30 executive director Ana Toni said. But Brazil rejects the idea of a cover decision at the end of Belem as a home for discussion of fossil fuels. And the presidency has been reluctant to attack fossil fuels head on. ""This is not an item of negotiation, the GST is,"" Toni said. Brazil must wrangle a fractious conference including major fossil fuel producers such as India, Saudi Arabia and Russia which resist any action on the topic, as well as facing criticism over its own plans to increase oil and gas production . Climate finance fight Climate finance permeated the Bonn talks, with developing countries trying to steer various work programmes towards the issue, while developed countries attempted to limit discussion. Developing countries said the finance settlement reached last year at Baku does not meet developed countries' obligations under the Paris agreement, as well as being far short of actual needs. And in parallel, they expressed their frustration with carbon border adjust mechanism (CBAM)-type arrangements planned for the EU and UK, and projected for Canada. Developed countries see these as essential to protecting their domestic industry and preventing carbon leakage, given their high carbon costs, but developing countries say the costs will fall mostly on them. These two issues appear likely to crop up again as stumbling blocks at Belem that the presidency will have to tackle with political engagement beforehand. Brazil has promoted Cop 30 as an ""implementation"" Cop, with no one particular agenda item dominating. This gives the country the arduous task of having to make concrete progress on many items, rather than focus on one headline target.

German draft RED III consolidates cover crop use

London, 27 June (Argus) — Intermediate crops are set to be considered an advanced feedstock for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Germany, according to the environment and climate ministry's draft bill to amend the Federal Immission Control Act, which aims to implement the EU's renewable energy directive (RED III) into national law. Cover, or intermediate, crops — defined by the European Commission as crops that are grown on areas where only one food or feed crop harvest takes place, require no additional land use, and maintain soil's organic matter content — are to be considered advanced feedstocks for the production of SAF, in accordance with RED III's Annex IX Part A. This means that SAF derived from cover crops will contribute to Germany's minimum advanced biofuels sub-quota, which is proposed to rise to 3pc by 2030, up from the current 2.6pc goal, under draft legislation. Germany's draft implementation proposes an end to double-counting of advanced feedstocks, which could increase demand for products including cover crops. But for non-SAF biofuel production, per Annex IX Part B, cover crops would be considered a non-advanced feedstock. Under Germany's draft legislation, this would be classed as a waste-based feedstock, and would face a cap on volumes that can count towards the mandate, revised up to 2.8pc by 2039, from the current 1.9pc. Although these feedstocks would be single-counted towards the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction quota, the draft amendments stating that biofuels produced from these materials are ""considered to be twice their energy content"" in the calculation of RED III targets a share of renewable energy within the final consumption of energy in the transport sector of at least 29pc by 2030.

SEA biodiesel industry seeks funds to decarbonise

Singapore, 27 June (Argus) — Regional biodiesel associations from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia called for stakeholder support to further decarbonisation goals during the 5th Palm Biodiesel Conference in Bangkok over 23-24 June. Thai electrification shift competes with biodiesel industry Thailand has been driving a shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) under the 30@30 policy, targeting at least 30pc of total motor vehicles produced annually by 2030 to be EVs, while support for biodiesel producers is waning, said Thai biodiesel producer association Chairman Sanin Triyanond. Thailand will no longer subsidise the price of biofuels such as biodiesel under the oil fund act after 24 September 2026, said Supatchalee Sophonthammaphat, an official with the Thai department of alternative energy development and efficiency (DEDE). Triyanond called for both the EV and biodiesel industries to coexist, citing a study that said an EV and biofuel energy mix was recommended for the country. A low biodiesel blend target in Thailand resulted in only 30pc of Thailand's 11.7mn l/d in installed biodiesel capacity being utilised, and high operating costs across its 14 registered companies, Triyanond said. When domestic crude palm oil (CPO) stocks fall below 200,000t, local prices also increase in comparison to the global price, he added. This raises the cost of production when biodiesel producers import CPO as it is subject to 143pc import tax and exempt from export duties in Thailand. Thailand manages CPO supplies and prices by altering its volumetric blend target for biodiesel under the alternative energy development plan (AEDP). However, the biodiesel industry has been struggling with a low blending policy and feels that the stock management program needs to be redesigned to better support producers. Indonesia needs more investment to hit B50 biodiesel blend goal Indonesia is targeting 15.6mn kl of domestic biodiesel consumption in 2025 and has been conducting road tests for a higher B50 biodiesel blend with fossil diesel this year. To meet higher biodiesel blend ratios in subsequent years, new investment from the private sector and policy support from the government on pricing, funding and legislation is needed to drive infrastructure upgrades and capacity expansions, said deputy of promotion and communication at the Indonesian biofuels producer association (APROBI) Ravi Farkhan Pratama. For suppliers, complex logistics resulting in higher costs for transporting biodiesel to remote regions remain, said manager of biofuel and additive supply chain at PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Adi Rachman. A price disparity between public service obligation (PSO) and non-PSO (NPSO) biodiesel blends in the market poses a challenge in ensuring each fuel is supplied to the right customer group, he added. The PSO sector includes state-owned firms that serve the public. Fuel suppliers in this sector receive subsidies from the oil plantation fund management agency (BPDPKS) to fund the difference between palm oil-based biodiesel and the indexed price of diesel, while non-PSO fuel suppliers do not. Biodiesel plants in Indonesia have been running at an average 80pc of Indonesia's 20.9mn kl/yr installed capacity across 24 producers this year, said Pratama. Indonesia consumed about 20pc of annual CPO production under the B35 blend mandate in 2024. This year's B40 biodiesel blend mandate could eat into exports and other avenues including food use, Pratama added. Any further increase to blending mandates would exacerbate how palm supplies are distributed between food and fuel. There are also additional costs around infrastructure upgrades such as coating pipelines and storage tanks, said Rachman. A move to a B50 blend mandate would likely happen in 2027 or later, said head of B40 road test and B40 commercial test team at LEMIGAS research and development center of oil & gas technology, ministry of energy and mineral resources Cahyo Setyo Wibowo at the event. Malaysian biodiesel producers push for higher blending mandates Malaysia's B20 biodiesel blend mandate set in January 2020 has been limited to Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Labuan and Sarawak in the transport sector. A separate 7pc biodiesel blend is required in the industrial sector, first mandated in July 2019. President of Malaysian biodiesel association Tee Lip Teng sought a nationwide B20 implementation for on-road fuels, and a B30 blend ratio by 2030. However, Tee said that a capital expenditure of more than 600mn ringgit ($142mn) would be required to achieve a full B20 nameplate biodiesel production capacity in Malaysia. On the other hand, the country is set to introduce a carbon tax as early as next year, allowing palm oil methyl ester (PME) prices to be more competitive, he added. Lower palm oil prices in relation to gasoil amid oil market uncertainty and during the upcoming peak palm production season could also drive voluntary blending. But fossil diesel continues to be subsidised for qualified businesses in the transportation and logistics sector, increasing the funding burden needed to subsidise PME in these sectors. While PME production continues to face challenges, Tee cited the potential to expand waste-based biodiesel production in Malaysia. Biodiesel exports out of Malaysia rose up to 2019 before declining afterward due to the EU ban on palm-based biofuels, Tee said. Majority of the biodiesel exported now comprises used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) and palm oil mill effluent oil methyl ester (Pomeme) rather than PME, he added. First generation biodiesel producers should be incentivised through government grants to retrofit their plants to use waste-based oils to complement their existing palm oil feedstock, Tee said. Other alternative feedstocks carrying a lower levelized cost of production such as palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) should be considered as a feedstock of choice, said general manager for strategy and sustainability at Petronas Dagangan Berhad Ms. Harlina Pikri.

Australian oil seed tree carbon credits to aid biofuels

Sydney, 27 June (Argus) — A potential inclusion of oil seed tree harvesting into the remake of an expiring Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) method could bring much-anticipated support to Australia's nascent biofuels sector. Australia's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has recently advised industry proponents to investigate the potential of adding oil seed harvesting to the remake of the Reforestation and Afforestation 2.0 method, US agricultural innovation firm Terviva senior manager of commercialisation Kevin Swanepoel told Argus on 27 June. The method credits emission reductions to forest growers and landholders who establish and maintain trees on land previously used for agricultural purposes. It will expire on 30 September 2025, and Terviva and its partner, Japanese refiner Idemitsu Kosan, will participate in the consultation processes around a potential remake of the method. Idemitsu and Terviva, alongside Australian mining company Stanmore Resources, have been working on a trial plantation of pongamia trees in Queensland. The companies are eyeing the crop as a potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). They are also exploring the use of pressed pongamia oilseed cake as livestock feed, as well as the potential creation of ACCUs from the carbon sequestration of the trees. The firms ultimately aim to convert the carbon sequestration benefits of pongamia into ACCUs, Idemitsu said in a separate statement. But no approved methodology currently exists within the ACCU framework to support this pathway, the firm added. Proponent-led pathway The industry had high expectations about an expression of interest submitted by mining firm Rio Tinto in 2024 for the creation of an ACCU method under the new proponent-led model . The proposed ""Sequestration of Carbon from Oil Seed Trees"" method would involve planting perennial oil seed tree species and crediting the carbon sequestration associated with living biomass and potentially soil carbon. The proposal would use pongamia as an example species, with other oil seed species to be included over time. The oil seeds resulting from these plantations would be harvested and used in biofuel production. The Emission Reduction Assurance Committee (Erac) considered the proposal to have ""excellent alignment"" and deemed it ""ready for imminent development"", but noted support for development would come only ""if or when resources permit"". The Australian government prioritised four other methods instead, but said expressions of interest could be re-submitted in the next rounds under the proponent-led pathway. The DCCEEW did not reply to questions on when the next round will be opened or whether there would be a minimum or maximum number of methods to be prioritised. Industry participants said no dates have been indicated by the government. Options outside the proponent-led route Rio Tinto also did not comment on its next steps for the proponent-led pathway, although it has been progressing with a pilot study to explore the potential of pongamia seed oil as a feedstock for renewable diesel output . The pilot, in partnership with Australian wood-fibre processor and exporter Midway, involved the acquisition of approximately 3,000 hectares of land in north Queensland and the planting of pongamia saplings. Support is required to incentivise the production and use of biofuels at scale to grow the industry in Australia, Rio Tinto said in 2024 in a paper about diesel transition. One of the options would be creating pathways for renewable diesel farming projects to be recognised under the ACCU scheme. ""This could serve the dual purpose of supporting development of Australia's biofuels industry , while expanding ACCU supply to help meet expected demand from facilities under the safeguard mechanism ,"" it added. Remaking expiring methods offers the government the opportunity to add new activities to be credited under the ACCU scheme outside the proponent-led route, Midway carbon projects manager John Lawson said. The reforestation and afforestation method has a limited number of projects over its history, so adding seed oil crops and harvest activities could improve uptake of the method with minimal changes to the method required, he added. ""There is a growing group of project developers interested in and actively working on options for implementing changes like these,"" he said.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The SAF Matchmaker is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.

IATA UNVEILS SAF MATCHMAKER PLATFORM

The platform will indeed help to speed up SAF usage since airlines will be better able to secure supplies of SAF.

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

That said, SAF Matchmaker will aid the scaling up of SAF by addressing three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).",https://sustainabilityinthesky.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/airbus-saf-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 18:06:20.697604

In its latest sustainability report, Singapore Airlines Group reported that total emissions rose more than 13% over the past financial year, from 18.8 million tonnes of CO₂e to 21.4 million tonnes. The airline, which has orders for over 70 new planes, pointed to strong passenger demand and ongoing airspace restrictions, which have forced longer flight routes, as key reasons behind the increase.

The company’s CEO, Goh Choon Phong, said its investment in newer aircraft, which the industry says emits up 25% less carbon, will help in plans to reduce emissions to almost zero by 2050.

“Our long-term commitment to investing in and operating new-generation aircraft puts us in a strong position,” Goh said. “As of 31 March 2025, the average age of the Group’s operating fleet was seven years and eight months, well below the global average of 15 years.”

Rising Costs From Climate Rules and Compliance

At the same time, the carrier warned that complying with international climate regulations could come at a significant cost in the years ahead.

It estimated the global aviation carbon offsetting scheme, known as CORSIA, which most airlines are a part of, could cost the airline around $150 million by 2030.

CORSIA requires airlines to purchase credits if their emissions exceed 85% of their 2019 levels, with the goal of offsetting the climate impact of growing international air travel.

In its report, the airline flagged its scope 1 emissions, which are mainly made up of fuel, as the main driver of future compliance costs.

Singapore Airlines pointed to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a long-term solution. SAF can reduce emissions by around 65% compared to traditional jet fuel, according to the sector. The airline called SAF “a critical lever for decarbonisation” and said it would continue to support its development and use.

Managing Climate Risks

The airline said that other climate-related risks, such as extreme weather and infrastructure threats, currently have a limited financial impact.

However, it estimated that direct costs from these risks could reach up to around $35 million by 2030.

As part of its preparations, Singapore Airlines said it has invested in flood prevention measures at Singapore Changi Airport, including flood barriers and new drain sensors.

Redefining aviation Otto Aviation has raised nearly $200 million for the Phantom 3500 and is about to launch a B Series funding round.","Otto Aviation (Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.) has launched the Phantom 3500 business jet. Touted as “the first true aircraft of the sustainability era,” the aircraft reportedly offers up to 60% lower fuel burn and 90% less emissions when using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compared to similar-sized jets (such as the Bombardier Challenger 3500 or Embraer Praetor 500 and 600). This is partly due to its design, achieving transonic super-laminar flow with the help of AI-supported aerodynamics and a seamless composite fuselage. Also enabling the aircraft’s sustainability is the Williams International (Pontiac, Mich., U.S.) FJ44-4 QPM engine, which can use 100% SAF and integrates the auxiliary power unit (APU).

The Phantom 3500’s design will further reduce aerodynamic drag and also improve fuselage integrity by eliminating windows. Instead, HD display panels will offer what CEO Paul Touw describes as a “super natural infotainment system” that eliminates glare and augments the view from every seat, including a synthetic environment similar to Google Earth and streaming of movies that “goes way beyond just a window.”

As explained on the Otto Aviation website by Matt Thurber, editor-in-chief of Aviation International News (AIN), the Phantom 3500 airframe is all-composite, and Leonardo (Rome, Italy) will build the fuselage at its facility in Grottaglie, Italy.

The Phantom 3500 will offer seating for nine with a cabin height of 6 feet 5 inches (~2 meters) and is designed to cruise at over 600 miles per hour with a range of up to 3,500 nautical miles at altitudes of 51,000 feet. Operating costs are expected to be half those of other super-midsize jets.

Otto Aviation announced it will build the aircraft at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, investing $430 million and relocating its headquarters to the site. Initial flight tests are planned for early 2027, with certification and entry into service expected by 2030.

Development history, laminar flow design

According to Thurber’s article, Otto Aviation has been working on the Phantom 3500 for 3 years, moving forward from its previous development of the Celera 500 aircraft. By January 2025, the company had completed the Phantom 3500’s conceptual design and systems requirement review. It then began announcing suppliers, including Advanced Integration Technology (AIT, Plano, Texas, U.S.) as its tooling and automation partner for production systems. AIT will provide assembly and joining systems, metrology tools and scalable automation cells.

Thurber also reports the Phantom 3500 design is supported by $25 million worth of wind tunnel testing, according to Touw. This includes wing cross-section tests at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California and high-speed tests at the European Transonic Windtunnel (ETW, Cologne, Germany). All of the tests were successful, says Touw, noting the company’s drag predictions and ETW results were within a couple of percent, giving confirmation of the super-laminar flow design.

“Natural laminar flow allows us to make the wing bigger without the consequence of more drag,” Touw notes in Thurber’s article. “Because of that big wing, we can take off and land out of shorter runways than a Challenger 3500 or Praetor 500/600 or Cessna Latitude or Longitude. The aircraft is also lighter… so the airplane’s wing tanks get smaller, the landing gear gets smaller, the engines are smaller, the structure is smaller. So per pound, it’s also less expensive to manufacture.”

According to Touw, the Phantom 3500’s wing is swept 23° and will have leading-edge slots that help to keep almost 90% of the wing in laminar flow. With this reduction in skin friction drag, the wing can then be larger, able to fly higher with lower wing loading compared to most business jets. Otto Aviation has not yet announced who will build the composite wing.

Touw expects to complete the Phantom 3500’s preliminary design review in October 2025 and then begin building the first of four test vehicles required for certification. First flight is currently scheduled for 2027. The single-pilot jet will be certified under FAR Part 23 regulations, anticipated in 2030.

Production facility, RTM versus SQRTM

Currently located at Meacham Field in Fort Worth, Texas, Otto Aviation has announced it will build a factory in Jacksonville, Florida. Thurber reports the company plans to rely on RTM to produce its carbon fiber-reinforced composite airframe, noting that Airbus uses a similar process to manufacture major structural components for the A220.

Actually, the process used to make the A220 wings is resin transfer infusion (RTI) which was first developed at the old Shorts Brothers facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by Bombardier for its C Series 100-150 seat commercial jetliner. That aircraft is now the Airbus A220, while the Belfast facility was later sold to Spirit AeroSystems (see CW’s plant tour) but is now part of Airbus.

Source | Otto Aviation

Another important note is that the Otto Aviation website actually specifies SQRTM (same qualified resin transfer molding). As explained in “SQRTM enables net-shape parts” and “... combines prepreg with RTM,” this process uses a prepreg layup instead of a dry fabric preform, with the RTM process injecting the same resin that is used in the prepreg, but in liquid form. It thus avoids the need for qualifying new materials and should help speed certification yet still enable automation and aerospace-grade quality control. Note that RTM has been qualified for a number of flying parts, including the LEAP engine fan blades and fan case and the A320 spoilers, as well as the structural grid for the A350 passenger door and the A350 horizontal tail plane (HTP) leading edge produced by Aernnova ICSA.

Thurber says Touw admits that the tooling needed to manufacture the Phantom 3500 will be expensive. However, he believes eliminating labor involved with metal manufacturing (cutting, drilling and riveting) will be more efficient and that robotic manufacturing will also help to keep costs down.

Redefining aviation

Otto Aviation has raised nearly $200 million for the Phantom 3500 and is about to launch a B Series funding round. Thurber predicts the program could require more than $1 billion to reach certification and production.

SABR Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) is a coalition of stakeholders that have invested in building out America's first advanced biofuel — biodiesel.","ALEXANDRIA, Va., June 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- NATSO, representing truck stops and travel centers, American Trucking Associations (ATA), Association of American Railroads (AAR), National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), National Energy & Fuels Institute, Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR), and SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel Marketers, commended the Senate Finance Committee for its tax reform package that would establish equal tax treatment for all advanced biofuels.

The Senate's proposed tax and budget reconciliation legislation would modify the '45Z' Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to restore tax parity between sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other advanced biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel effective Oct. 1, 2025. Modifying '45Z' to be technology-neutral marks a critical step in revitalizing U.S. biofuel production, which has dropped sharply since the credit took effect in January.

""We give the Senate a lot of credit for reconfiguring '45Z' to be truly technology neutral. SAF should be incentivized at the same rate as all other biofuels. An equal incentive – 'parity' – will result in more gallons of biofuel being produced and consumed, all at a lower cost for taxpayers,"" said David Fialkov, Executive Vice President of Government Affairs for NATSO and SIGMA. ""Importantly, this provision reduces the overall cost of the '45Z' tax credit while also incentivizing more over the road fuel production – helping to lower prices for consumers. A win for everyone.""

""A level playing field for sustainable aviation fuels versus over-the-road biofuels is critical to restoring the biodiesel market,"" said Matt Durand, NACS Deputy General Counsel. ""Today, the biodiesel market is failing due to tax policy. Unless we act to ensure biodiesel is no longer disadvantaged, the market may never recover. NACS strongly supports the Section '45Z' parity proposal and urges the Senate to retain it.""

The Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided a higher tax credit of up to $1.75 for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. The higher aviation fuel tax credit signed into law by President Biden, coupled with the expiration of the Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit at the end of 2024, has decimated America's advanced biofuel supply chains.

Equal tax treatment between alternative biofuels represents a significant step toward the much-needed certainty that will encourage biofuel production and consumption. SAF is more costly than biodiesel and renewable diesel and results in the production of less gallons of overall fuel. Under the Senate legislation, SAF would have access to the same credit as all other fuels and producers will be able to gravitate toward the most efficient fuels in the market.

SEA biodiesel industry seeks funds to decarbonise

Singapore, 27 June (Argus) — Regional biodiesel associations from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia called for stakeholder support to further decarbonisation goals during the 5th Palm Biodiesel Conference in Bangkok over 23-24 June. Thai electrification shift competes with biodiesel industry Thailand has been driving a shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) under the 30@30 policy, targeting at least 30pc of total motor vehicles produced annually by 2030 to be EVs, while support for biodiesel producers is waning, said Thai biodiesel producer association Chairman Sanin Triyanond. Thailand will no longer subsidise the price of biofuels such as biodiesel under the oil fund act after 24 September 2026, said Supatchalee Sophonthammaphat, an official with the Thai department of alternative energy development and efficiency (DEDE). Triyanond called for both the EV and biodiesel industries to coexist, citing a study that said an EV and biofuel energy mix was recommended for the country. A low biodiesel blend target in Thailand resulted in only 30pc of Thailand's 11.7mn l/d in installed biodiesel capacity being utilised, and high operating costs across its 14 registered companies, Triyanond said. When domestic crude palm oil (CPO) stocks fall below 200,000t, local prices also increase in comparison to the global price, he added. This raises the cost of production when biodiesel producers import CPO as it is subject to 143pc import tax and exempt from export duties in Thailand. Thailand manages CPO supplies and prices by altering its volumetric blend target for biodiesel under the alternative energy development plan (AEDP). However, the biodiesel industry has been struggling with a low blending policy and feels that the stock management program needs to be redesigned to better support producers. Indonesia needs more investment to hit B50 biodiesel blend goal Indonesia is targeting 15.6mn kl of domestic biodiesel consumption in 2025 and has been conducting road tests for a higher B50 biodiesel blend with fossil diesel this year. To meet higher biodiesel blend ratios in subsequent years, new investment from the private sector and policy support from the government on pricing, funding and legislation is needed to drive infrastructure upgrades and capacity expansions, said deputy of promotion and communication at the Indonesian biofuels producer association (APROBI) Ravi Farkhan Pratama. For suppliers, complex logistics resulting in higher costs for transporting biodiesel to remote regions remain, said manager of biofuel and additive supply chain at PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Adi Rachman. A price disparity between public service obligation (PSO) and non-PSO (NPSO) biodiesel blends in the market poses a challenge in ensuring each fuel is supplied to the right customer group, he added. The PSO sector includes state-owned firms that serve the public. Fuel suppliers in this sector receive subsidies from the oil plantation fund management agency (BPDPKS) to fund the difference between palm oil-based biodiesel and the indexed price of diesel, while non-PSO fuel suppliers do not. Biodiesel plants in Indonesia have been running at an average 80pc of Indonesia's 20.9mn kl/yr installed capacity across 24 producers this year, said Pratama. Indonesia consumed about 20pc of annual CPO production under the B35 blend mandate in 2024. This year's B40 biodiesel blend mandate could eat into exports and other avenues including food use, Pratama added. Any further increase to blending mandates would exacerbate how palm supplies are distributed between food and fuel. There are also additional costs around infrastructure upgrades such as coating pipelines and storage tanks, said Rachman. A move to a B50 blend mandate would likely happen in 2027 or later, said head of B40 road test and B40 commercial test team at LEMIGAS research and development center of oil & gas technology, ministry of energy and mineral resources Cahyo Setyo Wibowo at the event. Malaysian biodiesel producers push for higher blending mandates Malaysia's B20 biodiesel blend mandate set in January 2020 has been limited to Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Labuan and Sarawak in the transport sector. A separate 7pc biodiesel blend is required in the industrial sector, first mandated in July 2019. President of Malaysian biodiesel association Tee Lip Teng sought a nationwide B20 implementation for on-road fuels, and a B30 blend ratio by 2030. However, Tee said that a capital expenditure of more than 600mn ringgit ($142mn) would be required to achieve a full B20 nameplate biodiesel production capacity in Malaysia. On the other hand, the country is set to introduce a carbon tax as early as next year, allowing palm oil methyl ester (PME) prices to be more competitive, he added. Lower palm oil prices in relation to gasoil amid oil market uncertainty and during the upcoming peak palm production season could also drive voluntary blending. But fossil diesel continues to be subsidised for qualified businesses in the transportation and logistics sector, increasing the funding burden needed to subsidise PME in these sectors. While PME production continues to face challenges, Tee cited the potential to expand waste-based biodiesel production in Malaysia. Biodiesel exports out of Malaysia rose up to 2019 before declining afterward due to the EU ban on palm-based biofuels, Tee said. Majority of the biodiesel exported now comprises used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) and palm oil mill effluent oil methyl ester (Pomeme) rather than PME, he added. First generation biodiesel producers should be incentivised through government grants to retrofit their plants to use waste-based oils to complement their existing palm oil feedstock, Tee said. Other alternative feedstocks carrying a lower levelized cost of production such as palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) should be considered as a feedstock of choice, said general manager for strategy and sustainability at Petronas Dagangan Berhad Ms. Harlina Pikri.

Australian oil seed tree carbon credits to aid biofuels

Sydney, 27 June (Argus) — A potential inclusion of oil seed tree harvesting into the remake of an expiring Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) method could bring much-anticipated support to Australia's nascent biofuels sector. Australia's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has recently advised industry proponents to investigate the potential of adding oil seed harvesting to the remake of the Reforestation and Afforestation 2.0 method, US agricultural innovation firm Terviva senior manager of commercialisation Kevin Swanepoel told Argus on 27 June. The method credits emission reductions to forest growers and landholders who establish and maintain trees on land previously used for agricultural purposes. It will expire on 30 September 2025, and Terviva and its partner, Japanese refiner Idemitsu Kosan, will participate in the consultation processes around a potential remake of the method. Idemitsu and Terviva, alongside Australian mining company Stanmore Resources, have been working on a trial plantation of pongamia trees in Queensland. The companies are eyeing the crop as a potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). They are also exploring the use of pressed pongamia oilseed cake as livestock feed, as well as the potential creation of ACCUs from the carbon sequestration of the trees. The firms ultimately aim to convert the carbon sequestration benefits of pongamia into ACCUs, Idemitsu said in a separate statement. But no approved methodology currently exists within the ACCU framework to support this pathway, the firm added. Proponent-led pathway The industry had high expectations about an expression of interest submitted by mining firm Rio Tinto in 2024 for the creation of an ACCU method under the new proponent-led model . The proposed ""Sequestration of Carbon from Oil Seed Trees"" method would involve planting perennial oil seed tree species and crediting the carbon sequestration associated with living biomass and potentially soil carbon. The proposal would use pongamia as an example species, with other oil seed species to be included over time. The oil seeds resulting from these plantations would be harvested and used in biofuel production. The Emission Reduction Assurance Committee (Erac) considered the proposal to have ""excellent alignment"" and deemed it ""ready for imminent development"", but noted support for development would come only ""if or when resources permit"". The Australian government prioritised four other methods instead, but said expressions of interest could be re-submitted in the next rounds under the proponent-led pathway. The DCCEEW did not reply to questions on when the next round will be opened or whether there would be a minimum or maximum number of methods to be prioritised. Industry participants said no dates have been indicated by the government. Options outside the proponent-led route Rio Tinto also did not comment on its next steps for the proponent-led pathway, although it has been progressing with a pilot study to explore the potential of pongamia seed oil as a feedstock for renewable diesel output . The pilot, in partnership with Australian wood-fibre processor and exporter Midway, involved the acquisition of approximately 3,000 hectares of land in north Queensland and the planting of pongamia saplings. Support is required to incentivise the production and use of biofuels at scale to grow the industry in Australia, Rio Tinto said in 2024 in a paper about diesel transition. One of the options would be creating pathways for renewable diesel farming projects to be recognised under the ACCU scheme. ""This could serve the dual purpose of supporting development of Australia's biofuels industry , while expanding ACCU supply to help meet expected demand from facilities under the safeguard mechanism ,"" it added. Remaking expiring methods offers the government the opportunity to add new activities to be credited under the ACCU scheme outside the proponent-led route, Midway carbon projects manager John Lawson said. The reforestation and afforestation method has a limited number of projects over its history, so adding seed oil crops and harvest activities could improve uptake of the method with minimal changes to the method required, he added. ""There is a growing group of project developers interested in and actively working on options for implementing changes like these,"" he said.

Mexico’s trade balance swings to surplus in May

Mexico City, 26 June (Argus) — Mexico's trade balance returned to surplus territory in May, as higher crude export volumes helped to offset drags on manufacturing from US tariffs. Mexico recorded a $1.03bn trade surplus in May, statistics agency Inegi reported Thursday, swinging from a $88mn deficit the previous month. Total exports in May were valued at $55.5bn, while imports reached $54.4bn. The surplus was wider than Mexican bank Banorte's forecast of $279mn. The balance reflects the trade deficit in oil-related products narrowing to $2.11bn in May from $2.87bn in April, as well as a rebounding surplus in non-oil trade to $3.14bn from $2.78bn in April. Mexico ran a $2.04bn trade surplus for the January-May period, including a $10.96bn surplus in non-oil trade and a $8.92bn deficit in oil-related trade. This reflects the longer-term trend of growing non-oil exports set against widening deficits of oil-related goods. Manufacturing exports — especially autos — have been the most affected by US tariffs enacted in March and April. Despite US exemptions tied to trade treaties, Mexico still faces an average effective US tariff rate of 11.9pc — the eighth highest globally and the highest in the western hemisphere, according to Fitch Ratings. The auto industry is also participating in negotiations to soften steel and aluminum tariffs to prevent further supply chain disruptions. Manufacturing exports fell by 0.6pc in May after a 0.7pc drop in April. Auto exports declined by 1.3pc in May, following a 4.8pc fall in April. Inegi reported a 10.3pc annual drop in the value of auto exports to the US in May, after an 8pc decline in April. Exports had surged 6.5pc in March as companies rushed shipments ahead of tariff implementation. Agricultural exports contracted by 2.6pc in May from the previous month after rising 2pc in April, while non-oil mining exports contracted 2.9pc after surging 26pc in April. Oil-related exports totaled $2.06bn in May — $1.33bn in crude and $722mn in refined products — compared with $1.83bn in crude alone in April. This comes despite a stronger peso and lower oil prices. Mexico's crude export mix averaged $57.88/bl in May, down $2.94/bl from April and $16.51/bl below the year-earlier level. Crude export volumes rose to 743,000 b/d from 693,000 b/d in April but remained below the 930,000 b/d exported in May 2024.

US reps resist Senate approach to biofuel credit

New York, 26 June (Argus) — A coalition of US House members is pushing the Senate to scrap planned changes to a tax credit that the biofuel industry sees as crucial for profitable production. Republicans in both chambers have looked to use a fillibuster-proof budget bill to keep but modify the Inflation Reduction Act's ""45Z"" tax credit, which increases subsidies for fuels with lower emissions. But some farm-state House members are displeased with the Senate's approach , including less-punitive treatment of foreign feedstocks and substantial cuts to subsidies for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). ""We respectfully urge you and your committee to revise the language around 45Z to reflect the House language,"" seven House Republicans, including three on the House tax-writing committee, wrote Wednesday in a letter to Senate Finance Committee chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho). Both the House and Senate bills would prevent tax officials from factoring in indirect emissions from land use changes, a win for crop-based fuels like corn ethanol, and would extend 45Z four more years through 2031. But the House bill, which passed the chamber narrowly last month, would also strip eligibility from fuels derived from feedstocks outside North America starting next year. The Senate Finance draft, on the other hand, cuts subsidies for fuels from foreign feedstocks by 20pc while still allowing them some credit. The issue is highly contentious across the biofuel supply chain. Farm groups say that recently fast-rising imports of used cooking oil and tallow are hurting demand for domestic crops that can also be refined into renewable diesel. Refiners insist that flexibility around feedstocks is essential for scaling up biofuel output. The House lawmakers say that the Senate language would ""subsidize imported feedstocks"", some of which come from countries that ""actively discriminate against our domestic biofuels industry"". The House letter also asks the Senate to retain additional subsidies for SAF, which they say are critical given the fuel's typically higher cost of production. Under current law, road fuels are eligible for up to $1/USG and SAF up to $1.75/USG, plus inflation adjustments for all types of fuel — but the Senate Finance draft would eliminate that jet fuel premium. Notably, the House lawmakers say they prefer the Senate's more lenient approach to tax credit ""transferability"", which allows smaller companies without enough tax liability to instead sell tax credits to other businesses. President Donald Trump has pushed lawmakers to send him the budget bill before 4 July, but lawmakers still disagree on key details with just days before that self-imposed deadline. Along with fighting over energy policy, some conservatives are wary of the package's potential impact on the federal budget deficit and want more sweeping cuts to government spending. The letter was signed by representatives Michelle Fischbach (R-Minnesota), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Max Miller (R-Ohio), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Brad Finstad (R-Minnesota) and Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa).

In a significant step forward, Michigan has introduced a state-level incentive program aimed at jumpstarting local SAF production. The new legislation—supported by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle—offers targeted tax credits for producers and blenders that can meet stringent emissions and sustainability criteria.

The program is part of a broader shift toward state-led climate and energy action, as federal direction under the Trump administration remains uncertain. While the Michigan initiative establishes a modest tax credit cap of $4.5 million in its first year, it lays the groundwork for regional market development—an essential piece of a national SAF strategy still waiting for clearer federal support.

SAF: A Scalable, Drop-in Solution

SAF is derived from renewable or waste-based feedstocks—such as agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon—and can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. It’s also compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure, enabling airlines to cut emissions without significant capital investment.

But production volumes remain limited. While U.S. airlines have committed to bold SAF procurement targets, the supply chain is still in early stages of scale-up. This is where state action becomes critical.

Industry Expands Despite Federal Policy Ambiguity

Across the U.S., SAF producers continue to ramp up operations:

World Energy is expanding its Paramount, CA facility to become one of the largest SAF hubs in North America, aiming for 250 million gallons per year.

Gevo Inc. is building its Net-Zero 1 facility in South Dakota, expected to produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually with the help of carbon capture and renewable energy.

LanzaJet, headquartered in Illinois, is completing its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Georgia with support from Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Energy.

Neste has expanded its U.S. footprint with SAF supply agreements at San Francisco and Los Angeles airports and a new Houston terminal.

Honeywell UOP and Chevron continue to scale up SAF production through co-processing infrastructure.

Trump Administration: Mixed Signals on SAF

Federal support, however, has become less consistent under the current administration. In February 2025, the Department of Energy (DOE) approved a $1.44 billion loan guarantee for Montana Renewables to expand its SAF facility in Great Falls—signaling at least some support for the sector. But that move contrasts with broader federal inaction:

On his first day in office, President Trump froze funding for numerous climate and energy programs, including clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This freeze has placed the future of SAF-related federal tax credits in limbo, creating deep uncertainty for developers and investors.

The administration has also rebranded SAF as ""synthetic aviation fuel"" in public documents—a rhetorical shift some interpret as a pivot toward domestic fossil-based alternatives.

While Trump has praised SAF as an economic boon for rural America and farmers, especially those producing corn and soy feedstocks, critics note the absence of any cohesive SAF strategy or commitment to lifecycle GHG accounting standards.

This has created what many in the industry describe as a “policy vacuum” at the federal level—one that is now being filled by states like Michigan, California, and Illinois.

What’s Next for SAF in the U.S.?

As SAF production technologies mature and airline demand continues to rise, the question is not whether the U.S. will expand its SAF market—but how quickly and under what regulatory structure. States that proactively support SAF may gain a competitive edge in attracting clean energy investment and positioning their airports as hubs for low-emissions travel.

With uncertainty clouding the future of federal tax credits and lifecycle emissions standards, industry players are increasingly turning to state programs, private capital, and long-term offtake agreements to derisk investments.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250625-172807-49c-A%20modern%20aircraft%20flying%20over%20green%20fields%20with%20a%20biofuel%20facility%20in%20the%20foreground%2C%20symbolizing%20sustainable%20aviation..jpg,N,,2025-06-27 13:09:57.065696

In contrast, Indonesia has a more aggressive policy, mandating a 40% palm oil blend in its biodiesel.
This strategy aligns with the nation’s climate goals and efforts to diversify its palm oil market.
Concerns about a potential oversupply in the market have also emerged due to higher palm oil stockpiles and increased production.
On Thursday, palm oil prices closed at 4,020 Malaysian ringgits ($951) per tonne, a dip from last week’s highs that were influenced by tensions between Israel and Iran and a nearly 20% surge in crude oil prices.","Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer of palm oil, is reportedly considering increasing the amount of palm oil used in its biofuels, a move that would mirror the policies of top producer Indonesia, according to industry sources, reports The Hindu Businessline.

Currently, Malaysia requires a 10% palm oil blend (B10) for transport fuels and a 20% blend (B20) for industrial use. In contrast, Indonesia has a more aggressive policy, mandating a 40% palm oil blend in its biodiesel.

Malaysia is also actively researching and developing palm-based aviation fuel, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and advanced biofuels. This strategy aligns with the nation’s climate goals and efforts to diversify its palm oil market. Industry insiders suggest that rising crude oil prices, often triggered by global political tensions, tend to boost interest in biofuels as an alternative energy source. This could lead to increased demand for palm-based biofuels in regions like Southeast Asia, India, and West Asia, spanning both transportation and industrial energy sectors.

The potential for higher biofuel demand alongside existing food security concerns presents a complex challenge for the global community.

Malaysia’s approach is consistent with that of other nations, such as the United States, which has reportedly proposed allowing refineries to blend a record amount of biofuel into gasoline and diesel next year. Brazil also recently decided to raise its biodiesel blend in diesel from 14% to 15%, effective August 1.

However, a cap on edible oil prices has been observed due to weaker immediate demand from major buyers like India, with signs suggesting that India’s soybean oil imports might decrease.

Concerns about a potential oversupply in the market have also emerged due to higher palm oil stockpiles and increased production. On Thursday, palm oil prices closed at 4,020 Malaysian ringgits ($951) per tonne, a dip from last week’s highs that were influenced by tensions between Israel and Iran and a nearly 20% surge in crude oil prices.

While Malaysia’s B20 biodiesel blend is currently in use only in specific areas, the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities noted in February 2025 that significant funding for infrastructure improvements would be needed to expand the B20 program nationwide. The industry is generally hoping for government financial support, but the government currently has no plans to provide it.

Malaysia introduced its National Biodiesel Programme in 2019, making B10 mandatory for the transport sector and B7 for the manufacturing sector in the same year. However, the B20 program has yet to be fully implemented across the country, being limited to areas such as Labuan, Langkawi, and parts of Sarawak in East Malaysia.

Malaysia exports biodiesel primarily to the European Union (which accounts for over 80% of its biodiesel exports), China, and Singapore, according to the Malaysian Biodiesel Association.

While some in the industry are optimistic about the future of biodiesel and partnerships with private companies, others remain cautious due to price instability. Indonesia’s mandatory B40 biodiesel program, for instance, led to tighter global supplies and made palm oil more expensive than competing oils like soybean oil.

As a result, palm oil’s share in India’s total edible oil imports dropped to 43% (from 58% in the previous year) during the first seven months of the 2024-25 oil year. However, Malaysian palm oil industry leaders view this decline as a temporary market trend, influenced by India’s domestic policies supporting oilseed expansion and diversification of edible oil sources.

Malaysian palm oil production is predicted to see a moderate increase in 2025 and 2026, thanks to better weather, replanting with higher-yielding crops, and improved harvesting efficiency through machinery and advanced technology. However, challenges like labor shortages and unpredictable weather patterns, along with slow adoption of new technology, could limit productivity gains.

“We anticipate prices to remain moderately strong into 2026 due to global political tensions affecting edible oil supply chains, fluctuating prices of rival oilseeds like soybean oil and sunflower oil, currency movements, and biofuel mandates,” the source stated. “However, uncertainties in demand from major importing countries might cause short-term price swings.” Palm oil production is particularly sensitive to weather and labor availability, which can lead to more frequent price changes.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Palm-Oil.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 15:06:21.087251

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has unveiled a groundbreaking platform designed to connect airlines with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers, a key step in accelerating the industry’s transition to more environmentally friendly fuels. The initiative, known as the SAF Matchmaker, is part of a broader effort to increase the availability and use of SAF within the aviation sector, which is pivotal in meeting global sustainability goals.

Bridging the Gap for SAF Procurement

The SAF Matchmaker platform is designed to simplify the procurement process for SAF by providing a centralized hub where airlines can easily find and connect with SAF suppliers. The platform streamlines the procurement process, reducing both the complexity and costs often associated with sourcing SAF. It aims to ensure a more efficient, transparent, and accessible SAF market, which is critical to meeting the aviation sector’s ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The platform functions as a matchmaking tool, allowing airlines to post requests for SAF while suppliers can offer their available quantities of the fuel. When a match is made, the parties can move their negotiations offline to finalize details such as price and payment terms. Initially, the SAF Matchmaker is available only to airlines and SAF suppliers but is expected to expand in the future to include buyers from non-aviation sectors as well.

Enhancing SAF Market Connectivity

IATA’s SAF Matchmaker addresses three core challenges currently facing the aviation industry in its pursuit of greater SAF adoption: efficiency, connectivity, and visibility. By providing a platform where all stakeholders can connect without additional fees, the initiative aims to expedite the procurement process, making it faster and more straightforward.

The SAF Matchmaker enhances connectivity by allowing SAF producers to post information on available or planned volumes of fuel. Airlines, in turn, can register their interest in purchasing specific SAF quantities. The platform also allows users to access detailed information about the available SAF, including its feedstock, location, technology used in production, emissions reductions, and compliance with major environmental frameworks such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

Facilitating a Sustainable Future for Aviation

The SAF Matchmaker platform is part of a larger strategy to build a fully functioning market for sustainable aviation fuel. This platform aims to reduce the barriers to SAF adoption by improving transparency and facilitating smoother connections between airlines and suppliers. By doing so, it plays a crucial role in driving the growth of the voluntary SAF purchasing market, which is essential for the aviation industry’s sustainability goals.

The Current Landscape of SAF Adoption

Sustainable aviation fuel has been slowly gaining traction in the aviation sector since its first use in a commercial flight back in 2008. While SAF still accounts for less than 1% of global aviation fuel consumption, demand has been steadily increasing. In 2023, SAF consumption surged to more than 600 million liters, doubling the previous year’s figures. With a robust growth trajectory, production is expected to exceed 2.7 billion liters in 2025, more than double the 1.3 billion liters anticipated for 2024.

This rapid growth underscores the momentum behind SAF adoption and highlights the crucial role that platforms like the SAF Matchmaker play in enabling airlines to source sustainable fuel more easily and efficiently. By helping to streamline the procurement process, the SAF Matchmaker is set to become a key tool in supporting the aviation sector’s transition to a more sustainable future.

Looking to the Future of SAF

The SAF Matchmaker platform is a significant step forward in the effort to scale up the use of sustainable aviation fuel. As the global aviation industry works towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, initiatives like this one are essential in creating a more sustainable and resilient fuel market. The platform not only simplifies the process of buying and selling SAF but also provides crucial visibility and transparency, making it easier for airlines to make informed decisions about their fuel supply.

With increasing demand and production of SAF, the aviation industry is on a clear path to a greener, more sustainable future. The SAF Matchmaker platform is poised to play a pivotal role in driving this transformation by ensuring that airlines have access to the fuel they need to meet their sustainability targets while reducing their environmental footprint.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__71596-38.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 11:09:19.945770

In a revolutionary move, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

Under the new facility, when there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues – efficiency, connectivity and visibility.

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market.

ATR designs and manufactures turboprop aircraft used by regional airlines across the globe.","Something unusually precise is unfolding beneath the surface of regional aviation, an effort not aimed at headlines but at dismantling the logistical and regulatory blocks that have kept cleaner fuels out of everyday service. It’s not about pledges or posturing, but execution.

ATR, the long-established manufacturer of regional turboprops, has entered a targeted partnership with ATOBA Energy designed to make sustainable aviation fuel a realistic option for smaller airlines. Announced at the Paris Airshow, the agreement addresses a core issue often overlooked in broader aviation decarbonisation plans: the structural barriers preventing SAF adoption outside major hubs.

Regional carriers have faced a unique set of constraints. While SAF offers up to 80 per cent lifecycle emissions reduction, its availability remains patchy, its cost high, and its delivery infrastructure concentrated in a few locations. ATR’s collaboration with ATOBA tackles these challenges head-on through a dual approach, improving physical access to SAF at regional airports and embedding flexible systems for tracking and claiming its environmental impact.

The technical innovation lies in combining direct fuel logistics with a “book-and-claim” accounting model. This system, in line with internationally recognised emissions frameworks, allows airlines to take credit for SAF emissions savings even when the fuel is not delivered directly to their location. It’s a model designed to scale, offering immediate environmental benefits without waiting for infrastructure to catch up.

For ATR, this initiative isn’t a side project. It forms part of its broader 2030 goal to make its aircraft fully SAF-capable. That commitment requires more than engine adaptations, it demands a full ecosystem capable of supporting SAF uptake across a fragmented and globally dispersed user base. By working with ATOBA, a specialist in SAF aggregation and distribution, ATR is putting commercial practicality at the centre of its decarbonisation strategy.

The implications are significant. While much of the aviation sector’s sustainability conversation is dominated by large carriers and long-haul routes, regional aviation accounts for a vast number of daily flights across diverse geographies, many of them underserved by current fuel systems. Bringing SAF into these markets not only reduces emissions at scale, it also introduces consistency into a space that’s often left behind in regulatory frameworks.

What makes this approach notable from an investor perspective is its blend of ambition and operational realism. ATR isn’t just responding to pressure; it’s building systems. Delivery chains, emissions attribution models, and technical integration platforms are all part of a replicable blueprint, one that other segments of the industry could adopt if proven effective.

Moreover, ATOBA’s role adds financial and structural depth. As a SAF aggregator, it brings the purchasing power and contracting stability smaller carriers often lack. Their ability to pool demand, secure long-term supply, and manage regulatory interfaces reduces friction and enhances the bankability of sustainable fuel solutions. Together, they’re creating the kind of framework that enables action, not just intention.

This project’s timing also matters. With regulators moving toward mandatory SAF targets and carbon accounting tightening, the ability to offer airlines a turnkey path to compliance becomes not just attractive, but essential. ATR is positioning itself not merely as an aircraft supplier, but as a partner in regulatory readiness—an enabler of futureproof operations in a constrained and competitive market.

The real value here is strategic optionality. Regional airlines typically have limited leverage in fuel sourcing and limited capital to navigate environmental compliance. By removing access barriers and embedding SAF capability into both aircraft and supply systems, ATR enhances the resilience and relevance of its product offering. Investors would do well to watch how this model performs, not just in emissions savings, but in market adoption and repeatability.

What ATR and ATOBA are building is more than a single programme; it’s a modular, standards-based framework for making SAF viable in regions where demand exists but access has stalled. If successful, it could form the basis for broader transitions, not only for ATR customers, but for regional aviation as a whole.

Aviation fuel mandates, designed to propel the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), promise to reshape how the industry tackles climate challenges. But the path to achieving these goals is anything but straightforward.

The EU and UK are setting a precedent with their SAF mandates, requiring airlines to blend at least 2% of SAF into their jet fuel supply by 2025. At face value, the numbers sound achievable. Just over 1.2 million tonnes of SAF will be needed between the two regions. However, considering the EU’s jet fuel consumption hovers around 46 million tonnes annually and the UK at 11.9 million tonnes, the scale of transformation required is monumental.

But 2025’s mandate is just the start. The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation is targeting 6% SAF by 2030 and an ambitious 70% by 2050. Meanwhile, the UK is aiming for 10% by 2030, and while their trajectory is slightly different, the ultimate pressure to decarbonize is no less intense.

How, then, will these mandates be met? What hurdles might lie ahead for the aviation industry, and where do the opportunities begin to emerge?

The SAF production puzzle

New mandates aren’t just increasing SAF quotas but are also pushing for technologies like synthetic SAF and alternatives to the dominant HEFA pathway. While necessary for the long-term roadmap, these advancements come with their own cost and scalability concerns.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

A “matchmaker” platform that links airlines with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers has been launched by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The initiative is aimed at boosting uptake of SAF within the aviation sector and comes as industry and government collaborates to increase its availability.

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market,” explained Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP sustainability and chief economist.

“The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.

“The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

How does it work?

IATA’s SAF Matchmaker initiative provides a central platform for those seeking to buy and sell SAF.

Specifically, it helps facilitate SAF procurement between airline customers and the energy companies producing the fuel by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, the SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as off-take agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only.

In the future, other sustainable fuel buyers in non-aviation related industries are also expected to be able to use it.

Why is it needed?

IATA says the platform is needed to address three key challenges: efficiency, connectivity and visibility.

The airline association says it will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees.

This in turn will drive further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

IATA’s platform will enhance connectivity by enabling SAF producers and suppliers to post available or planned SAF volumes, while airlines will be able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes.

However any trade will be done away from the platform.

The platform also provides information regarding the available SAF, volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

How much SAF is currently being used?

Since the first flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) took off in 2008, demand for the low-carbon fuel has steadily grown.

To date, around 500,000 flights have used SAF blends.

While SAF still makes up less than 1% of global aviation fuel consumption, usage surged in 2023 to over 600 million litres, doubling the previous year.

The upward trajectory is expected to continue, with production forecast to exceed 2.7 billion litres in 2025, more than double the estimated 1.3 billion litres in 2024, highlighting the rapid scaling of the sector.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AdobeStock_675386331-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 08:02:34.012352

The announcement follows a meeting between Ecology Minister Aziz Abduhakimov and Haruki Yamasaki, CEO of Le One Co., Ltd, where both parties discussed joint efforts to implement an innovative environmental technology pilot.

Le One Co., Ltd has secured a $4 million grant from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). The funding, awarded for the 2025–2030 period, is part of NEDO’s international program supporting advanced Japanese technologies that contribute to decarbonization and green energy transitions.

The project will involve the construction of a pilot plant in Uzbekistan that will convert organic waste into biogas and then into methane. In addition to generating renewable energy, the initiative aims to address environmental challenges by cutting greenhouse gas emissions, safely managing waste, producing biohumus for agriculture, and using advanced Japanese cleaning and purification technologies.

“This project promotes the use of biogas as an alternative energy source, reducing environmental impact while creating an efficient waste management system,” the ministry said in a statement. “The technology supports our broader goals of sustainable development and moving toward a low-carbon economy.”

The two parties agreed to prepare and sign a memorandum of understanding between Le One Co., Ltd and Uzbekistan’s Agency for Waste Management and Circular Economy. The document will define the responsibilities of both sides and serve as the foundation for the project’s launch.

Phillips 66 CEO Mark Lashier echoed the sentiment at another event this week.","U.S. refiner Phillips 66 has begun supplying British Airways with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for its flights out of California, with 5 million U.S. gallons already delivered in recent months. The fuel, produced at Phillips 66’s renewable fuels facility in Rodeo, California, has been sent monthly to Los Angeles International Airport since December, reports Argus.

The agreement strengthens British Airways’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, although the deal’s pricing and future volumes remain undisclosed. Phillips 66 confirmed the ongoing monthly deliveries but did not elaborate further.

This deal follows a similar agreement announced last December, under which Phillips 66 began supplying SAF to United Airlines at airports in California and Illinois. The Rodeo refinery, which was converted primarily to renewable diesel production in early 2024, has since expanded its SAF output.

While the U.S. currently lacks mandates requiring the use of SAF—unlike the UK and European Union—it offers several financial incentives that support production. SAF producers in California can benefit from the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and a new federal clean fuel tax credit launched this year provides higher rewards for fuels that deliver greater emission reductions.

Phillips 66 produces SAF from a variety of domestic and international feedstocks, including vegetable oils, waste animal fats, and used cooking oil. The company is also exploring co-processing renewable feedstocks at its U.S. refineries, in addition to existing operations at its 221,000 b/d Humber refinery in the UK, where it has previously supplied SAF to British Airways.

Despite record SAF production in the U.S. this year, output of other biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel has declined. This drop is largely due to uncertainty surrounding future blending mandates and changes to the clean fuel tax credit.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration proposed record biofuel blend mandates but also suggested cutting credits for fuels made from imported feedstocks—common inputs at major coastal refineries. In Congress, both House and Senate Republicans have floated changes to the SAF tax credit, with a draft Senate bill proposing a future reduction in the extra incentive SAF receives compared to road fuels.

“Policy has been moving around, and that’s the real struggle,” said Brian Mandell, executive vice president of marketing and commercial at Phillips 66, speaking at the Reuters Global Energy Transition 2025 conference in New York.

Phillips 66 CEO Mark Lashier echoed the sentiment at another event this week. “Policy is getting clearer, but there’s still a lot of elements out there that we’re watching very carefully,” he said at the JP Morgan 2025 Energy, Power, Renewables, and Mining Conference.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-7.png,N,,2025-06-27 11:09:54.019750

The U.S. states of Florida and Texas alone generated more private jet flights and emissions than the entire European Union.
In Europe, the gasoline put in cars is taxed, but jet fuel — whether for commercial or private flights — is not.","The battle against climate change is also a class struggle: the ultra-rich generate far more emissions, while the poorest suffer the worst consequences. A clear example is private jets, which are increasingly used despite being the most polluting means of transport. A study by the NGO International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), published this Friday, delves into this issue: each private jet generates, on average, as many greenhouse gases (GHG) per year as 177 cars or eight heavy trucks — while transporting far fewer people or goods.

The report shows that private aviation emitted as many emissions in 2023 — the latest data available — as all the flights departing from Heathrow Airport, the largest in Europe. The researchers also estimate that the 95 jets flying to Venice for Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s wedding will generate 5,000 tons of greenhouse gases.

In the report, the researchers identified 3.57 million private flights in 2023, with each aircraft emitting an average of 810 tons of GHG annually — equivalent to the emissions of 177 cars or nine heavy trucks. Dan Rutherford, one of the researchers, notes via email: “Private jets are a significant, and largely untaxed, source of GHG pollution. Given the wealth of their users, governments should consider taxing their emissions to generate revenue to support aviation decarbonization and climate change mitigation.”

Private aviation grew significantly in 2021 and 2022, coinciding with the reduction in commercial flights in the post-COVID era. According to the study’s authors, private jets emitted approximately 23.74 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) — the unit used to measure greenhouse gases — in 2022, representing almost 4% of total civil aviation emissions. In 2023, that figure dropped to 19.5 million tons of CO₂e, although it is 25% higher than the figure from 10 years ago. As the number of commercial flights increased, this figure represents a lower percentage of all aviation emissions (just over 2% of the total).

What could be the reason for this slight decline? According to the researcher, “the figures suggest that private aviation activity is more volatile than commercial aviation, perhaps because it is less profit-driven: airlines have a strong incentive to optimize the number of trips their planes make each year by adjusting prices; private planes are likely to simply remain parked when demand drops.” Furthermore, 2023 was the year in which conventional commercial air routes returned to pre-pandemic levels.

If emissions from private jets represent such a small percentage of the total, why should we be concerned? “It’s better to analyze this from an equity perspective,” Rutherford responds. “Climate damage falls most heavily on the poorest, especially in the Global South, while private aviation is used for discretionary travel by the ultra-rich, and is largely untaxed. It makes sense to tax private jets to raise revenue to support decarbonization and adaptation.”

The ICCT shows that in 2023, two-thirds of global private jet flights departed from U.S. airports, accounting for more than half (55%) of the estimated GHG emissions from these aircraft. France and the United Kingdom were a distant second and third, with 2.2% and 2.1% of flights, respectively. The U.S. states of Florida and Texas alone generated more private jet flights and emissions than the entire European Union.

Short private flights

The researchers note that private planes are typically used for relatively short distances: half of the flights covered distances less than 900 kilometers (560 miles), while 75% were less than 1,500 kilometers (932 miles). Flights of more than 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) accounted for only 5% of the total. The average flight time was 85 minutes (less than an hour and a half).

For this reason, the ICCT is calling for these flights to be replaced by high-speed trains on all possible routes, as train times are very competitive over short and medium distances. Furthermore, they are calling for governments to tighten fuel efficiency (CO₂) requirements for new private aircraft and to mandate the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) for these flights, as is already beginning to happen with commercial aviation.

In Europe, the gasoline put in cars is taxed, but jet fuel — whether for commercial or private flights — is not. For this reason, the organization is calling for taxes to be imposed on private jets, which would help generate revenue for climate financing “by targeting passengers who are ultra-wealthy and less price-sensitive, allowing tax rates to bridge the 2-5 times cost gap between conventional jet fuel and renewable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), without heavily impacting commercial aviation.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/6VV4IB3YVVETJIZYEGIMP262JI.jpg?auth=03d28cd3f59ddab68f1d8b1d00cf3ed6d380f3bb0c0d8bafeb25590dcd7b9918&width=1200,N,,2025-06-27 08:02:39.812940

The national carrier revealed the plan during the launch of its 2024 Sustainability Report on June 26 in Nairobi. CEO Allan Kilavuka said Kenya Airways signed a memorandum of understanding with a local SAF producer and identified degraded former mining land in Kwale County to grow trees for feedstock.

“We want to be part of production… We shall have to come up with a framework of manufacturing capacity not only for sale for export but also for our local consumption,” he said as quoted by The Standard.

Fuel accounts for 30–35% of Kenya Airways’ operational costs and 64% of its emissions.

“The cost of SAF is estimated currently to be around four to five times the cost of traditional jet fuel… someone has to pay for it, and that is the passenger,” Kilavuka said.

To support carbon offsetting, the airline has planted 1.2mn trees and plans to maintain that number annually. The move supports climate goals under CORSIA and Africa’s Agenda 2063.

Kenya Airways’ plan aligns with a global shift towards SAF amid growing climate pressures. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF demand could reach 17mn tonnes annually by 2030, representing 4–5% of total jet fuel use. Yet current supply accounts for less than 0.2%, with minimal contribution from Africa.

Kilavuka said the airline, which is 48.9% owned by the Kenyan government, 38.1% by a consortium of local banks, and 7.8% by Air France–KLM, has also deployed 12 electric ground units and is working with the African Airlines Association to optimise routes.

He also highlighted KQ’s progress on gender inclusion. “As we talk right now, eight percent of our pilots are women,” Kilavuka said.

Principal Secretaries Festus Ng’eno and Teresia Mbaika praised the national carrier’s efforts, including its SAF initiative, emissions cuts, and commitment to the Fly Kenyan Policy.

In May 2023, it became the first African airline to use SAF on a long-haul flight. Kenya Airways also operates a pyrodiesel plant converting plastic waste.

As bne IntelliNews reported, the airline posted a KES 5.4bn ($41.70mn) net profit in 2024—its first since 2013—driven by a 6% revenue rise and stronger passenger and cargo performance.",https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdnoir.png,N,,2025-06-27 08:03:15.098559

What is Aviation Fuel?

What Aviation fuel refers to any fuel used to power airplanes or aeroplanes, primarily Jet A, Jet A-1, Jet B, and aviation gasoline (avgas). The chemical formula, composition, autoignition temperature, and flash point vary depending on the type. These properties are key to ensuring safe engine performance under extreme conditions.

Types of Aviation Fuel

Jet A/Jet A-1: Widely used in turbine engines. Jet A-1 is common in international operations due to its lower freezing temperature.

Jet B: A naphtha-kerosene blend suitable for cold climates. It is nearly clear and can be described as straw-colored.

Avgas (aviation gasoline): Used in small piston-engine aircraft; it contains lead and comes in different colors of aviation fuel (e.g., blue for 100LL).

Cryogenic Fuels: Including hydrogen fuel, being explored for future emissions-free flights.

Diesel: An emerging alternative, especially for use in smaller aircraft.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): A type of biofuel made from renewable sources, which aims to reduce carbon emissions.

Sustainable (and Alternative) Aviation Fuels

To reduce carbon emissions, biofuels such as carinata sustainable aviation fuel, non-oil seed crop sustainable aviation fuel, and non-food oilseed sustainable aviation fuel are being developed. These alternative fuels promise lower lifecycle emissions and can even be blended with traditional fuels.

The United States, India, and the EU are investing in SAF research and supply infrastructure. Airlines and FBOs (fixed-base operators) are increasingly participating in carbon offsetting programs.

General Aviation

Nearly every airport offers at least minimal services, primarily fuel. Typically, FBOs service general aviation aircraft. Many pilots rely on AirNav to locate fuel availability and price along with other important information about operations, communication, and runways. For example, in New Smyrna Beach (KEVB), pilots can see there is both Jet A fuel and 100LL avgas available on site.

Epic’s training aircraft run on 100LL because they have spark-ignition piston engines. The “100” indicates the octane rating, and “LL” stands for low lead. It is the most common fuel in general aviation. Fun fact: Manufacturers dye this fuel blue so pilots can tell it apart from other aviation fuel.

If you come across green fuel, that is 100/130 avgas. The octane rating is 100 under lean mixture conditions and 130 under rich mixture conditions.

Aviation Fuel Supply Chain

A robust system supports the global aviation fuel supply, including:

Brokers and suppliers manage the market.

Fuel trucks deliver to airports and to aircraft on site.

Fuel pumps, hoses, and tanks maintain safety.

Filter systems prevent fuel contamination.

Fuel cards and tracking sheets record logistics and taxation.

“Misfueling” or “Wrong Fueling” Accidents

When someone puts the wrong fuel into an aircraft, there is a potential for engine failure and crashes. There are too many of these to list, but we do go over this in pilot training and aircraft mechanic training. Some of these incidents include:

2021 – Beechcraft Baron 58: A fueler at the airport did not notice the “avgas only” sticker and fueled with Jet A, resulting in a crash that seriously injured the pilot.

2020 – Aero Commander 500 Shrike: An Alaska forestry plane on its way to fight forest fires crashed into a pond after taking off because the fuel vendor put the wrong fuel in. Passing teenagers who saw the crash rescued the four on board. Although the pilot signed the receipt, he did not notice it showed the wrong fuel.

2019 – Piper Aerostar 602P: A Tampa surgeon’s plane crashed killing him and his flight instructor because a fueler put Jet A In his plane instead of avgas.

This handful of examples is why we train our linemen at Epic along with our pilots and mechanics to be aware of how easily misfueling can occur.

“Our motto is ‘Safety First’ at Epic, and this includes how we operate on the ramp as well as in the classrooms and cockpits. We train our line crew members in safety procedures regarding aircraft fuel, and both pilots and aircraft mechanics receive training in fuel safety procedures.” –Josh Rawlins, Chief Operating Officer and Aircraft Mechanic Program Director

The 10 Most Common Reasons for Misfueling

Using the wrong fuel can cause serious engine damage or failure. That’s why FAA regulations, pre-flight inspections, and quality control procedures all emphasize fuel type verification. Sadly, investigators have traced many accidents and near-misses back to this simple but critical step.

These are the most common reasons someone might put the wrong fuel into an aircraft:

1. Miscommunication Between Pilot and Fueler

Verbal instructions may be unclear or misunderstood. Incorrect assumptions may be made without verifying fuel type.

2. Similar Appearance of Aircraft

Fuelers may assume a plane uses a certain type of fuel based on appearance (e.g., assuming all small planes use avgas), especially if aircraft models look alike.

3. Inadequate Labeling

Mistakes are more likely if the fuel caps or tanks aren’t clearly labeled with the required fuel type. If a label is worn or faded, replace it.

4. Use of Similar Fuel Nozzles

Jet fuel and avgas nozzles are sometimes not properly differentiated (though Jet A nozzles are wider by standard). If adapters are used, they can bypass this safeguard.

5. Fuel Truck Error

The wrong truck may pull up to the aircraft, especially at busy FBOs or during shift changes without proper documentation checks.

6. Human Error or Fatigue

Fatigue, distraction, or complacency by ramp personnel can lead to skipped verification steps. Focus for safety!

7. Unfamiliar Aircraft or Procedures

Pilots or ground crew may be unfamiliar with a specific aircraft’s fuel requirements (e.g., rental planes or chartered aircraft), increasing the risk of error.

8. Language Barriers or International Procedures

Although English is the universal language for pilots, that is not the case for ground crews. In non-English-speaking regions or international operations, differences in terminology or labeling can cause confusion.

9. Incorrect Assumptions by New Staff

New fuelers may incorrectly generalize (e.g., assuming all turbine engines use Jet A without checking specifics).

10. Poor Recordkeeping or Lack of SOPs

When pilots or others fail to follow or document proper checklists or refueling protocols, the chance of error increases.

Aviation Fuel Safety and Performance

Aviation fuel must withstand extreme temperature ranges and pressures. The autoignition temperature and flash point are crucial for safety. Jet fuel, for example, burns at very high temperatures, which supports high-speed, high-altitude airplane operations.

Refining processes remove impurities and create consistent grades. Each grade has a unique performance profile, which affects how an aircraft is fueled and serviced.

Cost and Fuel Efficiency

Aviation fuel is expensive due to refining, global demand, and taxation. Price may be listed per gallon, litre, pound, or unit of energy density. You can use an online fuel calculator to estimate consumption, rate, and carbon emissions.

Fuel additives improve burn efficiency and engine performance. Advanced engines also focus on maximizing fuel efficiency to reduce operating costs.

Comparing Aviation Fuel to Gasoline

Is aviation fuel the same as gasoline? Not quite. While avgas shares similarities with automotive fuel, it’s more refined and contains additives to support high-altitude performance. Jet fuels, based on kerosine, are entirely different, optimized for turbine engines.

Avgas 82UL is an unleaded aviation fuel with an octane rating of 82. It’s made for aircraft that can run on lower-octane fuel and is similar to car gasoline. Such aircraft are either approved by the manufacturer to use it or have a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) that allows the use of automotive gasoline (mogas) with a specific octane rating.

Aviation Fuel Jobs and Opportunities

The aviation fuel industry supports thousands of jobs in refining, service, supply, and analysis. As emerging technologies take hold, new roles in alternative fuels and SAF development are expanding. Here at Epic, our line crew takes care of refueling aircraft among many related tasks.

The Future of Aviation Fuel

Most of us in aviation agree that the future of aviation fuel lies in cleaner, more sustainable sources. With new technologies, increased awareness of carbon emissions, and investments in SAF, the aviation industry is shifting toward a more environmentally responsible model.

Understanding aviation fuel, its types, cost, and use, is key for everyone from pilots and mechanics to passengers concerned about carbon offsetting. As we explore alternative fuels and cutting-edge systems, the evolution of aviation fuel will remain central to the airplane industry’s innovation. As new products emerge, I will circle back and update this article.

Hi there. I have questions regarding flight training. For a beginner, what would the process be? Is 23 too old to start this type of trade school? You don't need any prior training or college, correct? Could you please email me and let me know the answers to my questions. The length of time it would take to complete courses to fly for airlines or something like that in the future? What kind of planes do you have ? How long does it take and what are all the fees? Do you guys have scholarships or financing options? How does that work? Is there like a tuition form you could send me as well with the break down? Is it all included or are there additional fees for gas and the instructors - what is the estimate for those fees ? I couldn't see it on your website. I am just trying to gather information for the best option for us. We have help just need to supply options to decide. I'll be in contact after we narrow our best options. Thank you for your time.

In the global movement toward decarbonisation, few sectors face as formidable a challenge as aviation. High energy density requirements and global mobility needs have made it difficult to reduce emissions without compromising operational efficiency. Yet, an emerging solution is offering a credible path forward: Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF.

Unlike conventional jet fuels, SAF is derived from renewable sources—such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-food biomass. What makes SAF particularly transformative is its compatibility with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure. This allows it to be adopted without significant operational disruption, which is a critical advantage in a sector where safety and consistency are non-negotiable.

Why SAF Matters: More Than Just a Drop-In Fuel

The benefits of SAF extend far beyond its green credentials. SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent when compared to traditional jet fuel. This makes it one of the most effective tools available for helping aviation reach its net-zero target by 2050.

Because SAF blends can be used in today’s aircraft without any modifications, they offer a practical and scalable way to decarbonise flights in the short- to medium-term. More importantly, SAF enables airlines to maintain their connectivity and economic contributions while progressing toward environmental benchmarks.

An Australian Milestone: SAF Takes Off from Proserpine

A noteworthy example of SAF in action comes from Queensland. In a landmark move, Viva Energy has partnered with Virgin Australia to supply SAF for a series of flights departing from Proserpine Airport between March and July 2025.

This partnership signifies more than just a supply contract. It is an operational demonstration of how SAF can be embedded into routine flight schedules. The blend used in these flights includes 30 to 40 percent synthetic fuel derived from waste and residue feedstocks, ensuring that environmental benefits are realised without compromising performance or safety.

The Economics of Scale: Affordability Through Collaboration

One of the primary challenges in SAF adoption has been cost. As a newer fuel type with limited production infrastructure, SAF is currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel. This is where collaborations like the one between Viva Energy and Virgin Australia become pivotal.

By piloting SAF in commercial settings, these stakeholders are gathering crucial data and laying the groundwork for economies of scale. Greater uptake and diversified production pathways could drive down costs over time, making SAF not only a sustainable choice but also a competitive one.

Infrastructure Investment: Preparing for Tomorrow’s Demand

Realising the full potential of SAF requires more than feedstock and intent—it demands infrastructure. To this end, Viva Energy has secured 2.39 million Australian dollars in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. This funding will be used to refurbish an existing fuel tank at the Pinkenba Terminal, converting it into dedicated SAF storage for Brisbane Airport.

This is a significant move. It signals the shift from pilot projects to scalable supply chains. By integrating SAF into existing pipeline distribution systems, stakeholders are future-proofing aviation fuel logistics and enabling greater accessibility across the network.

Innovation in Tracking: The Book-and-Claim System

Adopting SAF at scale also requires transparent accounting. To address this, Viva Energy is introducing a book-and-claim system. This mechanism allows sustainability certificates to be traded independently of physical SAF deliveries, enabling companies to claim environmental benefits even when direct SAF usage is not feasible.

The approach is especially useful for international carriers and corporations looking to support decarbonisation without logistical constraints. In effect, it makes the sustainability impact of SAF more universally accessible.

The Strategic Outlook: Why This Matters for the Industry

The partnership between Viva Energy and Virgin Australia—and the associated infrastructure and certification mechanisms—demonstrate a comprehensive vision for SAF adoption. It is not just about fuel. It is about building a commercially viable, environmentally aligned aviation system that can scale.

As Nick Adams, General Manager for Aviation at Viva Energy, aptly points out, SAF will play an increasingly important role for commercial airlines aiming to meet both regulatory expectations and growing consumer demand for responsible travel.

Conclusion: A Collective Ascent Towards Sustainable Flight

The trajectory of SAF is not merely a technical evolution—it is a systems-level transformation. From feedstock to fuel tank, from airport to airspace, the integration of SAF is a testament to what is possible when industry, innovation, and policy align.

These developments are not isolated. They are signposts in a larger journey toward sustainable air travel. As more airports, fuel suppliers, and airlines align on this front, the feasibility of net-zero aviation becomes less a vision and more a grounded strategy.

The road ahead will require continued investment, cross-sector collaboration, and transparent governance.

The total emissions for aviation in 2024 were 38.4 MtCO2e, marking a return to pre-pandemic levels.
This increased in 2024, and as a proportion of all jet fuel used in UK aviation rose substantially, from 0.7% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024.
The UK has a mandate to achieve 10% by 2030, however, and so the CCC said that the overall rise in aviation emissions are “posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets”.
The evidence was presented to the UK Government’s Environmental Audit Committee earlier this month.","Aviation emissions are continuing to rise, the Government’s independent advisors have warned.

In its assessment of the Government’s progress on reducing emissions, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) found that while overall emissions fell 2.5% in 2024, the tenth consecutive year of sustained reduction in emissions, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic years 2020 and 2021, emissions in the aviation sector increased by nine percent in 2024.

The total emissions for aviation in 2024 were 38.4 MtCO2e, marking a return to pre-pandemic levels. The Government’s 2022 Jet Zero Strategy (JZS) and CBDP, and the Seventh Carbon Budget Balanced Pathway all require emissions to stay flat and start decreasing slowly over the rest of the decade.

The CCC says “Limiting emissions in this way will be difficult if passenger numbers increase without sufficient counterbalancing uptake of low-carbon solutions.”

One of these is the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This increased in 2024, and as a proportion of all jet fuel used in UK aviation rose substantially, from 0.7% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024.

The UK has a mandate to achieve 10% by 2030, however, and so the CCC said that the overall rise in aviation emissions are “posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets”.

Although business travel has continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the CCC said that the “most significant driver of aviation emissions since 1990 has been rising demand for international flights, particularly leisure.”

The increase in demand for leisure flights has also been powered by a rise in demand for ‘medium haul’ destinations from the UK.

The New Economics Foundation has identified that as a result of carbon taxes on intra-European flight (through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), there has been a significant increase in leisure flights to ‘medium-haul’ leisure destinations such as Turkey, Greece, the Canary Islands, Morocco, Egypt, Albania, and Saudi Arabia.

The Foundation predicts this trend will increase as the ETS rates increase next year, pushing up prices on short haul flights within Europe and so, ironically, increasing emissions from leisure flights as these increase in duration.

The evidence was presented to the UK Government’s Environmental Audit Committee earlier this month.

GSNR is a nonprofit public benefit corporation established by rural counties to address the urgent issue of catastrophic fires from overgrown and under-managed forests. The group’s initial plans focused on the conversion of woody biomass gathered as part of forest treatment and restoration activities into wood pellets that would be exported for use in large-scale power production and similar applications. The plans included the development of a 700,000-metric-ton-per-year pellet plant in Lassen County and a 300,000-metric-ton-per-year facility in Tuolumne County, along with storage infrastructure at the Port of Stockton.

GSNR in early 2024 signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Drax US BECCS Development LLC “for the joint exploration of sustainable biomass opportunities with a focus on advancing forest resilience and promoting green energy initiatives worldwide.”

In October 2024, GSNR announced the release of a draft environmental impact report (DEIR), as required by the California Environmental Quality Act, for the proposed wood pellet project. The DEIR specified that the MOU with Drax was explicitly non-binding and did not commit Drax to purchase or use any quantity of wood pellets or otherwise become involved in GSNR’s project.

Documents published ahead of GSNR’s June 25 board of directors meeting indicates that the organization received more than 5,500 public comments in response to the DEIR and had identified three viable paths forward for the project.

Under one option, GSNR would have continued with the development of the two proposed full-scale wood pellet plants, updating the project based on the findings of CEQA analysis and comments received. Under another option, GSNR would paused further development at both proposed project sites.

The board, however, voted to move forward with a plan revise the scope of the project, which could include reducing the size and throughput of both facilities while transitioning from producing wood pellets for export to the production of wood chips for domestic use. GSNR noted wood chips could have applications in domestic alternative energy production, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marine biofuels, or in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) applications. Alternatively, wood chips can be used to produce wood products, such as oriented strand board.

According to information published by GSNR, the pivot to wood chip production would significantly lower the project’s capital costs and environmental footprint. The reduced scale of the wood chip project configuration may also facilitate CEQA review and permitting, and expedite site development timelines, improving the feasibility of near-term deployment, the group explained.

Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97.
They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.
Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.
By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero.","As you wait in the departure lounge for your flight this summer, you may notice your aeroplane being pumped full of fuel ahead of takeoff. And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels , and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 litres per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritise climate action over their very tight profit margins .

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Bulent camci/Shutterstock

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the UK wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonise aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",,N,,2025-06-26 20:03:37.234028

With deep roots in aerospace innovation and a thriving clean tech ecosystem, Washington state is one of the leaders in the nation in advancing SAF technologies, infrastructure, and investment.

What is SAF and Why Does It Matter?

SAF is a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from non-petroleum feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste, algae, and even captured carbon. When blended with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel (typically at levels between 10% and 50%, depending on the specific SAF and regulatory approvals), SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, without requiring modifications to current aircraft engines or airport fueling systems. This drop-in compatibility makes SAF a scalable and immediate solution for sustainable air travel.

What are SAF Made Of? The Diverse Feedstock Landscape

While SAF is increasingly being integrated into existing airport fuel supply chains, dedicated “SAF hubs” emerge as strategic locations for production, blending, storage, and distribution. The “sustainable” in SAF refers to the renewable nature of its source materials. SAF can be produced from a wide array of feedstocks through various technological pathways:

Used Cooking Oil and Animal Fats (HEFA Pathway): Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) are currently the most mature and widely used pathway. This involves refining waste oils, greases, and animal fats.

Agricultural and Forestry Residues: Waste products from farming (like crop residues and forestry residues) and forestry operations can be converted into SAF.

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW): Non-recyclable household and commercial waste, including food scraps, yard waste, and packaging materials, can be transformed into jet fuel, diverting waste from landfills.

Algae: Certain types of algae can be cultivated and processed to produce biofuels suitable for aviation.

Purpose-Grown Energy Crops: Non-food crops grown on marginal lands can be used as dedicated feedstocks for SAF.

Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ): This pathway converts alcohols, such as ethanol (derived from corn, sugarcane, or cellulosic biomass) or isobutanol, into jet fuel.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) or eFuels: A newer and promising technology that involves synthesizing captured carbon dioxide (from industrial sources or direct air capture) with green hydrogen (produced using renewable electricity) to create synthetic liquid hydrocarbons.

The choice of feedstock and production technology significantly influences the overall carbon reduction potential of the SAF.

How Do SAF Hubs Work?

SAF hubs function as nexuses in the SAF supply chain:

Feedstock Sourcing: Hubs are often strategically located near sources of viable feedstock or with good transportation links to receive them.

Production: Dedicated refineries or retrofitted conventional refineries utilize various approved technologies (HEFA, AtJ, PtL, etc.) to convert feedstocks into SAF.

Blending: The neat SAF is then blended with conventional jet fuel to meet current certification standards (e.g., up to a 50% blend).

Storage and Distribution: The blended SAF is stored and then distributed to airports through existing pipelines, tankers, or dedicated fueling infrastructure.

“Book and Claim” Systems: Many regions also utilize “book and claim” systems. This allows an airline or corporation to purchase SAF certificates (SAFc) representing the environmental benefits of a certain volume of SAF, even if the physical fuel is not delivered to their specific location. The actual SAF is used by an aircraft operator at an airport where it is physically available. This system helps aggregate demand, fund SAF production, and allows entities to meet their emission reduction goals regardless of their geographical proximity to SAF supply.

Washington State: A National Leader in SAF Innovation

From cutting-edge research labs to first-of-their-kind production facilities, Washington is home to a growing ecosystem of SAF pioneers. Here are key players driving this momentum:

Economic Development Through Clean Aviation

SAF market is projected to exceed $6.9 billion in the U.S. by 2030. With Greater Seattle’s aerospace supply chain, skilled talent, and abundant clean energy, the region is uniquely positioned to capture a significant share of that market. SAF innovation is already spurring job creation, attracting international investment, and strengthening our region’s leadership in next-generation fuels. These efforts support both metro and rural communities, from Moses Lake to Walla Walla to the Puget Sound.

Incentives: Fueling the Growth of SAF

Federal programs such as the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge aim to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030. Washington’s policy leadership, including state tax incentives up to $2/gallon, complements the national framework, creating fertile ground for SAF innovation and commercialization.

Investment Landscape: Who is Investing in SAF?

Significant investments are flowing into the SAF sector from a diverse range of players:

Airlines: Major carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air France-KLM, British Airways (IAG), Qantas, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines are making substantial investments in SAF through direct procurement agreements, equity stakes in SAF producers, and partnerships to develop new production facilities.

Energy Companies: Traditional oil and gas giants like Shell, Neste, TotalEnergies, and ExxonMobil are leveraging their refining expertise and infrastructure to become major SAF producers. They are investing in new facilities and retrofitting existing ones.

Specialized Biofuel Companies: Dedicated SAF producers and developers like Gevo, World Energy, Fulcrum BioEnergy, and LanzaTech are attracting significant capital to scale up their innovative production technologies.

Private Equity and Infrastructure Investors: Firms such as Bain Capital (investing in EcoCeres) and Brookfield Asset Management (investing in Infinium) recognize the long-term potential of SAF and are injecting substantial capital into SAF projects and infrastructure.

Aircraft and Engine Manufacturers: Companies like Boeing and Airbus are actively involved in SAF development, testing, and investing in SAF initiatives to ensure compatibility and promote adoption. Honeywell is also a key technology provider and investor.

Governments: Beyond incentives, governments are directly investing in research and development and providing financial backing for pioneering SAF projects.

The World Economic Forum highlights the need for an estimated $19-45 billion in capital expenditure by 2030 to meet SAF production demands.

A clean fuel standard could incentivize the development and use of lower-carbon fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel, and even electrification through tax credits.
HDOT says it plans to prepare a legislative package for lawmakers ahead of the 2026 legislative session that could include a clean fuel standard.","A clean fuel standard may be on the horizon as the state works to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from its transportation sector.

Switching to lower-carbon fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel for air travel, is one of the strategies included in the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation's forthcoming emissions reduction plan.

That plan is a requirement of a landmark settlement agreement the state reached with a group of youth plaintiffs last summer who claimed the state hadn't done enough to reduce climate pollution from the transportation sector. HDOT is expected to release a draft of the plan on Friday.

HDOT director Ed Sniffen told lawmakers on Wednesday that transitioning to lower-carbon fuels and electrification across air, marine, and ground travel will have the ""biggest impact"" of all the emissions-reduction strategies that have been evaluated.

Domestic aviation is responsible for about a quarter of the state's total emissions.

The aviation industry has already been working to swap out jet fuel with lower-carbon alternatives, and many airlines that service Hawaiʻi including Hawaiian and Alaska have set their own emissions-reduction goals.

But sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive than conventional fuel and in limited supply, and Sniffen said the state's timeline to achieve net-zero emissions is more aggressive than those set by the airlines.

""It's difficult for industry to swallow. There's going to be additional costs that come to them, additional costs that come to all of us as users,"" Sniffen said.

Sniffen said HDOT has had conversations with stakeholders in the aviation, marine, and ground transportation sectors about the hurdles in the state's transition away from fossil fuels.

""I will say none of the industries are pushing back and saying, 'This is not important.' They're just saying, 'We got to see how we do this so we can afford it,'"" he added.

A clean fuel standard could incentivize the development and use of lower-carbon fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel, and even electrification through tax credits.

HDOT says it plans to prepare a legislative package for lawmakers ahead of the 2026 legislative session that could include a clean fuel standard.

""The state needs to take some action, similar to states such as California and Washington, to make these fuels competitive in the market,"" said Nicholas Nishimura, a rising junior at Waipahu High School and a member of HDOT's youth council, which has been working with the department on its greenhouse gas reduction plan.

Nishimura cautioned that the transition away from imported gasoline and jet fuel may raise costs for Hawaiʻi consumers.

With the help of the University of Hawaiʻi, HDOT is currently conducting an analysis of the possible financial impact of a clean fuel standard on Hawaiʻi residents, which will be provided to lawmakers ahead of the next legislative session.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e1b08fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x2948+0+451/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F09%2F03%2F592aecd84218986d4f955187c96d%2Fap100607016266.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 18:08:27.646333

The goal is clear: to simplify, accelerate, and bring transparency to the SAF procurement process in a market that is still developing.

A Solution for Three Key Challenges

SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical needs in the sector:

1. Efficiency in SAF Procurement

The platform centralizes SAF requests and offers, eliminating barriers and additional costs. This significantly reduces the time and complexity airlines face when searching for suppliers, thereby fostering the growth of the voluntary SAF market.

2. Direct Connectivity Between Stakeholders

Producers and suppliers of sustainable fuel can post available or projected volumes, while airlines register their interest in acquiring specific quantities. When a match is made, the parties can take negotiations offline to finalize details such as pricing and payment terms.

3. Market Visibility and Transparency

The system provides detailed information about each available SAF batch: volume, feedstock used, location, production technology, associated emission reductions, and compliance with international regulations such as CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) or the EU Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

→ EASA and IATA Launch Global Plan to Mitigate GNSS Interference Risks

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, highlighted the strategic impact of this tool: “To achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. SAF Matchmaker demonstrates IATA’s commitment to building a fully operational market that facilitates SAF adoption, reducing costs and barriers for airlines.”

Exclusive Platform, for Now

In its initial phase, SAF Matchmaker will be available exclusively to airlines and SAF suppliers. However, IATA anticipates that other buyers, such as corporations from sectors not directly related to aviation, may join later.

UK in formal talks to avert biofuel plant closure

London, 26 June (Argus) — Associated British Foods (AFB), the multinational food and ingredients group, has said it will shut its 416mn litres/yr Vivergo bioethanol plant near Hull, eastern England, before 13 September unless the UK government agrees to urgent support measures. The company confirmed that ""formal negotiations"" with the government are now under way to find a ""sustainable solution"". But with the outcome uncertain, it has already stopped purchasing wheat feedstocks as of 11 June and begun consultations with staff ""to effect an orderly wind-down"" once existing contractual obligations are met. ABF said the government would need to provide ""both short-term funding of Vivergo's losses and a longer-term solution"" to avoid closure. The future of the plant ""will depend on whether the negotiations deliver a credible route forwards"", it said. The closure threat follows a UK-US trade agreement that removes import tariffs on up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol — roughly equal to total UK demand. Domestic producers say the deal has made the UK market unviable by allowing cheaper US imports to undercut local output. Paul Kenward — chief executive of ABF Sugar, the division of ABF that includes Vivergo Fuels — told MPs earlier this month that the trade deal effectively hands the UK market to US exporters. He proposed raising the UK's ethanol blending mandate from E10 to E15, saying this would give the industry ""room to breathe"", and also suggested a support package worth £75mn/yr ($100mn) for up to two years to help the sector adjust. Vivergo previously told Argus that an E15 mandate could boost demand by 660mn l/yr and highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors. German-owned Ensus, which operates the UK's only other bioethanol plant at Wilton on Teesside, has also warned of potential closure. The firm told Argus that it received a letter from the government's minister for business and trade acknowledging the economic challenges it faces as a direct result of the US trade deal. Ensus said it welcomed the government's recognition of its request for regulatory changes that could help the UK industry remain viable, along with the need for interim financial support.

Brazil looks to Cop 30 as progress slow at Bonn

Bonn, 26 June (Argus) — Technical climate talks at Bonn, to prepare for political negotiations at the UN Cop 30 summit in Belem, Brazil in November, look set to end with little progress on mitigation — actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions. As negotiations continue, the incoming Brazilian presidency has signalled it is seeking new avenues as formal processes have become bogged down. New nationally determined contributions (NDCs), countries' climate plans to 2035, due this year, were not formally discussed in Bonn. Few nations have submitted them, so far, and commitments will once again likely be insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The Paris agreement seeks to curb the temperature rise to ""well below"" 2°C, and to pursue a 1.5°C limit. Brazil on Wednesday called the NDCs a ""portrait"" of where states see themselves in 2035, saying that if it does not look good ""we will need to work together to improve it."" Brazil and the EU may be pinning hopes on the leaders' summit at Cop 30 to cut through the logjam. The EU ""sees value in having a political space for high-level discussions"" in response to the NDC synthesis report, it said. This report — due to be released on 24 October — will sum up countries' NDCs as long as they are submitted by September. This could provide a focal point for action ahead of the conference. Another avenue to find progress which Brazil has pushed is the ""action agenda"", a programme of voluntary initiatives by national and sub-national governments as well as civil society and private businesses, which runs alongside the formal negotiations between states. There are hopes that the states seeking to push mitigation the most could create a ""coalition of the willing,"" according to Andreas Sieber of environmental non-governmental organization (NGO) 350.org. This would generate momentum for initiatives which then make the leap to the negotiated process. This was the case for the pledge to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, which originated in the action agenda at Cop 28 in Dubai in 2023 but then made it into the formal outcomes of the summit. By engaging first with willing states, Brazil avoids obstructions, typically from large oil exporters. Baku 2.0 But so far in Bonn, progress on a key element for mitigation — a programme to discuss the meaning of the global stocktake (GST) — has bogged down. The GST, conducted in Dubai in 2023, was a review of the progress on reaching the goals of the Paris accord. It expressed the need to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. But talks on the GST have stalled since, and one delegate expressed a fear that the talks could be entering the same realm as the mitigation work programme (MWP), another workstream which has delivered little progress. Ensuring that discussion of options continues between Bonn and Belem will be key to lay the ground for solid outcomes once decision-makers are in the room, with some sensing a shift to more positive engagement. But frustrations over a new $300bn/yr climate finance target for developing nations could resurface in Brazil. Developing and developed countries were at loggerheads on climate finance and mitigation into the last minutes of the Baku summit. Brazilian climate agency Observatorio do Clima said the focus on finance at Bonn was much more prominent than the incoming Cop presidency expected, with Cop 30 risking ""becoming a Baku 2.0"". Meeting the priorities of many developing countries — more, better and accessible finance — may prove difficult. The Brazilian presidency said today that the Baku to Belem roadmap — a workstream decided on last year to work out ways to increase finance on to $1.3tn/yr — was supported by developing countries. But their priorities differ from those of G20 countries, the Brazil presidency said, implying that agreement may be hard to find. In the absence of the US, which did not send a delegation to Bonn, Brussels and Berlin have emerged as new blockers to talking about increasing finance, according to Victor Menotti of NGO Demand climate justice.

Australian gas firm sued over ‘greenwashing’ claim

Adelaide, 26 June (Argus) — Australia's competition regulator is suing gas distributor Australian Gas Networks (AGN) in the federal court, alleging ""greenwashing"" occurred in an advertising campaign in 2022 and 2023. AGN misled customers when it ran ""Love Gas"" TV and digital advertisements claiming that gas in its network would be renewable within a generation without holding reasonable grounds that would be the case, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. ""It is not currently possible to distribute renewable gas at scale and at an economically viable price,"" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said on 26 June. ""We allege even though AGN knew the future of renewable gas was uncertain, it made an unqualified representation to consumers that it would distribute renewable gas to households within a generation."" AGN, a major gas distribution firm owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK, forms part of the firm's Australian Gas Infrastructure (AGIG) business. The distributor services more than 1.3mn customers via about 27,000km of distribution networks and 1,300km of gas pipelines. The firm strives to provide clear and accurate communications about the role and benefits of natural gas today and renewable gas into the future and that the company will defend the claims in court, a spokesman for AGIG said. AGIG, an early developer of small-scale green hydrogen blending in gas networks, plans to start operations of its 10MW Hydrogen Park Murray Valley project in late 2025. A 1.25MW project in South Australia's state capital Adelaide began operations in 2021 . Canberra promised to police claims about emissions more strictly, pledging millions of dollars in 2023 to fund regulatory oversight of fossil fuel producers and distributors . The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's first court action for alleged greenwashing was against Mercer Superannuation and concluded in August 2024. The federal court fined the pension fund A$11.3mn ($7.4mn) for misleading statements about seven ""Sustainable Plus"" investment options. The court found that the options included investments in 15 companies involved in fossil fuel sales, such as BHP, Glencore and Whitehaven Coal.

In a meeting of the mines and energy ministry and national energy policy council CNPE today, the government decided to move forward with an increase in ethanol blending rates into gasoline to 30pc to make E30, and to blend 15pc biodiesel into diesel to create B15. CNPE is evaluating the feasibility of raising ethanol blends to a 22-35pc range and biodiesel blends to a 13-25pc range, mines and energy ministry's biofuels department director Marlon Arraes said during Argus ' Biofuels & Feedstocks Latin America Conference, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. National oil and gas institute IBP declared its support for the ethanol and biodiesel blend increases, while asking for more autonomy for hydrocarbons regulator ANP to improve quality monitoring and ensure safety to final consumers. The fuel of the future program, introduced to the Congress on September 2023, spurred more than R53bn ($9.6bn) of investments in biodiesel to achieve a 25pc mix by 2026, as well as R24bn invested in ethanol to reach a 35pc blend that same year, Arraes said. Investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) through advanced geological techniques reached R140bn, while investments in biomethane and products such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel reached bring that total up to R260bn. Cost competitiveness, feedstock supply risks and regulatory instability remain hurdles to a wider biofuel framework in Brazil, he said. The fuel of the future program avoided 705mn metric tonnes (t) of CO2 equivalent, Arraes said, mostly from CCUS and biodiesel investments. ""We need to engage in our way to produce biofuels and sustainable energy to deliver to society the cheapest decarbonization that we can"", he added.

Initiated by the Chinese General Consulate in Frankfurt and co-organized by Xinhuanet and other Chinese and German organizations, the second Sino-European Corporate ESG Best Practices Conference is held here with aim to pay tribute to the companies that have fared well in putting the ESG concept into practice and promote further cooperation between Chinese and European companies in this regard.

ESG is no longer an add-on, but a strategic element of modern corporate management. It helps identify risks early, set standards, and build long-term, stable partnerships, said Thorsten Giehler, head of Economy, Employment, Social Development of Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, a service provider for international cooperation for sustainable development and international educational work.

Giehler called on stakeholders to work on clear, practical rules which can provide guidance and planning security to facilitate the application of ESG.

Huang Yiyang, Chinese Consul General in Frankfurt, believed that the function of ESG should go well beyond a technical jargon and be considered as a solution for the future.

As staunch defenders of the ideas of multilateralism, open cooperation and green transformation, China and Europe should stand out and join hands to provide leadership and confidence for the global cause of ESG at a time of rising uncertainties, Huang stressed in a speech made on Wednesday night.

As a co-organizer of the conference, Xinhuanet intends to boost the dissemination and applications of the ESG concept among Chinese and European companies, Chu Xuejun, chairman of the board of Xinhuanet Co., Ltd. told Xinhua. It will not only be beneficial for China and Europe to achieve a win-win result in green transformation, but also set a solid stage for further and deeper economic and trade cooperation between the two sides, Chu added.

With a case detailing the joint initiative with Air China, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Technical Pathway Challenge for Chinese Universities, Airbus Germany turned out to be one of the winners at the conference.

""This recognition highlights both the project's impact and the strong partnership between China and the EU,"" said Anna Lisa Junge on behalf of Airbus Germany.

""Today's recognition inspires us to go further. We look forward to deepening our cooperation with Air China and other partners, advancing SAF and broader ESG practices -- in China, and for the globe.""

ESG application cases in areas including environment protection, social responsibility, corporate management, scientific and technological innovation, education and training, and other ESG-related innovative practices, have been submitted to the conference for review by a committee consisting of Chinese and European experts.

The two-day event also featured CEO dialogues, application case study, discussions and roadshows, with leading Chinese and European companies looking to explore the possibility of putting the ESG concept into better mass practices. ■",,N,,2025-06-26 17:07:26.809618

Sponsored by Senate Majority Floor Leader Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, and Sen. Joseph Bellino, R-Monroe, Senate Bills 235–36 would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of SAF—a move that would support Michigan’s farmers and economy while reducing the state’s carbon footprint.

“It has been an exciting process to partner with my colleagues across the aisle and across the chamber on this legislation, which not only aims to support Michigan farmers but—in continuing what was outlined in the Clean Energy Future plan—would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,” Singh said. “This legislation will open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the connection between our agricultural sector and the state’s energy goals.”

SAF is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced using biobased renewable products manufactured from crops like soybeans or corn.

By providing a $1.50-per-gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce or blend sustainable aviation fuel, this legislation would directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning SAF.

Additional incentives are available if greater emissions reductions are reached.

There is a maximum incentive cap of $4.5 million annually in the first year, and $9 million each year after.

“Access to sustainable, reliable and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” Bellino said. “I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.

With environmental concerns rising and governments pushing for cleaner, greener alternatives, sustainability is now a central focus for aviation companies, professionals, and stakeholders alike. It is no longer a niche area of expertise, but a foundational aspect that every aviation professional must understand and act upon.

According to Marie Owens, Senior Vice President of Sustainability & Chief Economist at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainability is “a very existential issue for our industry and for the world in its approach to our industry.” This statement underscores the importance of sustainability in aviation and highlights the urgency of action as the industry grapples with rising environmental pressures.

The Need for a Collective Approach

The aviation sector has long been aware of its environmental impact, but the scale of that impact—and the responsibility to address it—has grown significantly in recent years. Governments worldwide have set ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the aviation sector is no exception. The European Union’s aviation emissions trading system (EU ETS), the United States’ climate commitments, and similar initiatives from other nations highlight the growing regulatory pressure on the industry to reduce carbon footprints.

Governments have also taken steps to encourage greener practices by providing funding and support for research into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), electric aircraft technologies, and more efficient air traffic management systems. The UK, for instance, recently launched its Green Aviation Strategy, which includes a roadmap for net-zero emissions by 2050. These actions reflect an undeniable truth: sustainability is not optional but essential to the future of aviation.

In this context, the role of aviation professionals is more critical than ever. Professionals across all levels of the industry—from engineers and pilots to policymakers and sustainability officers—must work collectively to advance the sector’s sustainability agenda.

Training: A Vital Step Toward Sustainability Expertise

As sustainability becomes increasingly central to the aviation industry, governments and aviation organizations are emphasizing the need for specialized training to equip professionals with the skills necessary for this transformation. The IATA recognizes that moving toward sustainability requires not only investment in technologies and infrastructure but also in people. Professionals with expertise in sustainable practices are in high demand.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, has long advocated for environmental responsibility within aviation. In 2019, ICAO established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which is a global market-based measure aimed at helping the sector offset its emissions. This initiative further underscores the growing need for professionals who are well-versed in sustainability principles, carbon offset programs, and green aviation technologies.

Training programs and courses designed to promote sustainability awareness and expertise are essential to help professionals keep pace with the evolving needs of the industry. Whether it’s understanding how to integrate sustainable aviation fuel into flight operations or navigating the regulatory landscape of carbon emissions trading, training will be crucial for professionals who want to remain competitive in the workforce.

Three Key Steps to Enhance Your Sustainability Skills

As aviation faces growing demands to meet sustainability goals, professionals must adopt a proactive approach to ensure their skills align with industry needs. Below, we outline three key steps that aviation professionals can take to build a sustainable skill set and stay competitive in this rapidly evolving field.

1. Stay Informed About Global Regulations and Policies

Government policies and international agreements play a key role in shaping the aviation industry’s path toward sustainability. Professionals must stay up-to-date with regulatory developments, such as the EU’s Green Deal, ICAO’s CORSIA, and any region-specific initiatives. Understanding how these policies impact the aviation sector—and your specific role—will allow you to make informed decisions and ensure compliance.

Governments are also focusing on providing incentives and grants to support the transition to sustainable aviation. Familiarizing yourself with such programs can open doors to funding and innovation within your organization.

2. Invest in Specialized Training and Certification

Many governments and international organizations, including the IATA and ICAO, offer specialized training programs aimed at fostering sustainability expertise in aviation professionals. These courses can cover topics ranging from carbon emissions management to the implementation of sustainable aviation technologies.

Certifications such as the IATA Environmental Management for Aviation (EMA) and ICAO’s environmental courses can add significant value to your resume, proving your commitment to sustainability and boosting your career prospects. By enhancing your qualifications, you not only increase your value as a professional but also contribute to advancing the industry as a whole.

3. Foster Collaboration and Innovation

Sustainability in aviation requires the collective efforts of all stakeholders. Governments, airlines, manufacturers, regulators, and academics must work together to achieve the sector’s environmental goals. As an aviation professional, you can contribute by actively engaging with sustainability initiatives and collaborating with others in the field.

Look for opportunities to partner with organizations focused on sustainability or join forums and working groups that drive innovation in green aviation. By sharing knowledge and ideas, you will contribute to the collective effort to build a more sustainable aviation future.

Conclusion

Sustainability in aviation is no longer a choice but a necessity. With the environmental impacts of the aviation industry being scrutinized more than ever, governments and organizations worldwide are pushing for greener practices, and professionals must keep pace with these developments. By focusing on continuous training, staying informed about global policies, and actively fostering collaboration, aviation professionals can help build a sustainable future for the industry. As we celebrate World Environment Day, let’s reflect on the collective responsibility we share in ensuring that aviation continues to take flight toward a greener, more sustainable tomorrow.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sustainable-aviation-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 19:05:08.532118

S Africa's Natref refinery set for July-Oct work

London, 26 June (Argus) — South Africa's 107,000 b/d Natref refinery in Sasolburg will undergo a partial maintenance shutdown from July to October affecting several of its units. The turnaround is understood from South African market sources to affect units producing gasoline, middle distillates and heavy end products, including bitumen. The refinery's bitumen customers received communication on 24 June from UK-based Prax Group, Natref's minority shareholder with a 36.4pc stake, saying the refinery will undergo maintenance work from 14 July to 8 October. An official at Sasol, which holds a 63.3pc controlling stake in Natref, said today it could not comment on the refinery's maintenance plans, while Prax officials have so far been unavailable for comment. The refinery's bitumen customers were informed in April that it would cease bitumen production in September, with final stocks of the product to be sold out a month later. The move will be one of the results of a major upgrade programme at the refinery that will enable it to run on light sweet crudes and comply with the country's Clean Fuels 2 regulations that come into force on 1 July 2027. Bitumen market participants said they have been informed that Sasol will maintain normal bitumen production and supply during the upcoming turnaround, while Prax will have no availability of the product. Bitumen production and truck loadings only resumed in early June , following an unexpected outage in mid-May caused by steam supply issues.

Brazil looks to Cop 30 as progress slow at Bonn

Bonn, 26 June (Argus) — Technical climate talks at Bonn, to prepare for political negotiations at the UN Cop 30 summit in Belem, Brazil in November, look set to end with little progress on mitigation — actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions. As negotiations continue, the incoming Brazilian presidency has signalled it is seeking new avenues as formal processes have become bogged down. New nationally determined contributions (NDCs), countries' climate plans to 2035, due this year, were not formally discussed in Bonn. Few nations have submitted them, so far, and commitments will once again likely be insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The Paris agreement seeks to curb the temperature rise to ""well below"" 2°C, and to pursue a 1.5°C limit. Brazil on Wednesday called the NDCs a ""portrait"" of where states see themselves in 2035, saying that if it does not look good ""we will need to work together to improve it."" Brazil and the EU may be pinning hopes on the leaders' summit at Cop 30 to cut through the logjam. The EU ""sees value in having a political space for high-level discussions"" in response to the NDC synthesis report, it said. This report — due to be released on 24 October — will sum up countries' NDCs as long as they are submitted by September. This could provide a focal point for action ahead of the conference. Another avenue to find progress which Brazil has pushed is the ""action agenda"", a programme of voluntary initiatives by national and sub-national governments as well as civil society and private businesses, which runs alongside the formal negotiations between states. There are hopes that the states seeking to push mitigation the most could create a ""coalition of the willing,"" according to Andreas Sieber of environmental non-governmental organization (NGO) 350.org. This would generate momentum for initiatives which then make the leap to the negotiated process. This was the case for the pledge to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, which originated in the action agenda at Cop 28 in Dubai in 2023 but then made it into the formal outcomes of the summit. By engaging first with willing states, Brazil avoids obstructions, typically from large oil exporters. Baku 2.0 But so far in Bonn, progress on a key element for mitigation — a programme to discuss the meaning of the global stocktake (GST) — has bogged down. The GST, conducted in Dubai in 2023, was a review of the progress on reaching the goals of the Paris accord. It expressed the need to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. But talks on the GST have stalled since, and one delegate expressed a fear that the talks could be entering the same realm as the mitigation work programme (MWP), another workstream which has delivered little progress. Ensuring that discussion of options continues between Bonn and Belem will be key to lay the ground for solid outcomes once decision-makers are in the room, with some sensing a shift to more positive engagement. But frustrations over a new $300bn/yr climate finance target for developing nations could resurface in Brazil. Developing and developed countries were at loggerheads on climate finance and mitigation into the last minutes of the Baku summit. Brazilian climate agency Observatorio do Clima said the focus on finance at Bonn was much more prominent than the incoming Cop presidency expected, with Cop 30 risking ""becoming a Baku 2.0"". Meeting the priorities of many developing countries — more, better and accessible finance — may prove difficult. The Brazilian presidency said today that the Baku to Belem roadmap — a workstream decided on last year to work out ways to increase finance on to $1.3tn/yr — was supported by developing countries. But their priorities differ from those of G20 countries, the Brazil presidency said, implying that agreement may be hard to find. In the absence of the US, which did not send a delegation to Bonn, Brussels and Berlin have emerged as new blockers to talking about increasing finance, according to Victor Menotti of NGO Demand climate justice.

Shell moves to quash BP deal talk

London, 26 June (Argus) — Shell today reiterated it is not considering a bid for its UK peer BP, following up its denial on Wednesday, 25 June, and pointed to a London listing rule that imposes restrictions on making an offer. The denials were prompted by a report in the Wall Street Journal that Shell was in early-stage discussions about a possible acquisition of BP. That in turn followed a Bloomberg article in May that said Shell had been evaluating the feasibility of acquiring its rival. Today Shell explicitly pointed to Rule 2.8 of the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which imposes restrictions on a party that has said it does not intend to make an offer for a company that is subject to the code. Usually once a party has said it does not intend to bid for a company subject to the code, that party cannot then make a takeover approach for a period of six months. Shell did note, however, that it has the right to set the Rule 2.8 restrictions aside under certain circumstances, such as if a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for BP. Shell's management team has repeatedly emphasised that the company sees better value in its own shares, which it believes are rated too low by investors. ""Everything we do has to rank against… the shares and the buying back of the shares,"" chief financial officer Sinead Gorman noted on the company's first-quarter earnings call in May.

Australian gas firm sued over ‘greenwashing’ claim

Adelaide, 26 June (Argus) — Australia's competition regulator is suing gas distributor Australian Gas Networks (AGN) in the federal court, alleging ""greenwashing"" occurred in an advertising campaign in 2022 and 2023. AGN misled customers when it ran ""Love Gas"" TV and digital advertisements claiming that gas in its network would be renewable within a generation without holding reasonable grounds that would be the case, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. ""It is not currently possible to distribute renewable gas at scale and at an economically viable price,"" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said on 26 June. ""We allege even though AGN knew the future of renewable gas was uncertain, it made an unqualified representation to consumers that it would distribute renewable gas to households within a generation."" AGN, a major gas distribution firm owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK, forms part of the firm's Australian Gas Infrastructure (AGIG) business. The distributor services more than 1.3mn customers via about 27,000km of distribution networks and 1,300km of gas pipelines. The firm strives to provide clear and accurate communications about the role and benefits of natural gas today and renewable gas into the future and that the company will defend the claims in court, a spokesman for AGIG said. AGIG, an early developer of small-scale green hydrogen blending in gas networks, plans to start operations of its 10MW Hydrogen Park Murray Valley project in late 2025. A 1.25MW project in South Australia's state capital Adelaide began operations in 2021 . Canberra promised to police claims about emissions more strictly, pledging millions of dollars in 2023 to fund regulatory oversight of fossil fuel producers and distributors . The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's first court action for alleged greenwashing was against Mercer Superannuation and concluded in August 2024. The federal court fined the pension fund A$11.3mn ($7.4mn) for misleading statements about seven ""Sustainable Plus"" investment options. The court found that the options included investments in 15 companies involved in fossil fuel sales, such as BHP, Glencore and Whitehaven Coal.

But unlike the E.U. which has established a long-term SAF strategy with its mandates under ReFuelEU (requiring 70% of all fuel uplifted at EU airports be SAF by 2050)2, U.S. SAF policy remains in a state of limbo especially as the H.R. 1 bill (President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”) headed for a Senate vote seeks to hamper the ability of the country’s leading SAF policy - the 45z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit - to truly encourage sustainable SAF production. This paper provides an overview of the technological options available to the U.S. based on its available resources, finding that despite the early success of the HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway, domestic SAF will have to be carried forward by Alcohol-to-Jet, Gasification, and e-SAF pathways. Policy improvements are then recommended to ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of SAF production, in particular for the Alcohol-to-Jet and e-SAF sectors that have a more complex scaling road ahead of them. The objectives of these recommendations include but are not limited to ensuring a thorough LCA understanding of corn ethanol, strengthening the requirements of the Renewable Fuel Standard, and promoting the competitiveness of American electro-fuels. Their ultimate goal, however, is to reach domestic production levels of truly sustainable SAF in line with the targets of the federal government’s Grand SAF Challenge: meeting the projected domestic demand of 35 billion gallons annually by 2050.",Not Available,https://escholarship.org/images/escholarship-facebook2.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 18:13:14.008837

It comes at an opportune moment when it’s marking its record-setting maiden first-ever first flight on its golden 50th-anniversary celebration, marking a grand resurgence for supersonic passenger aircraft.

A Landmark Decision: The “Concorde Bill”

This revival has been made possible by the executive order signed by former U.S. President Donald J. Trump on June 6th, 2025, widely referred to as the “Concorde Bill.” This significant legislation lifts a decades-long ban that had stifled supersonic innovation due to environmental concerns and the disruptive sonic booms created by previous-generation aircraft flying over populated areas. Originally enacted to mitigate noise pollution and environmental impact, the ban effectively halted all progress in supersonic passenger aviation over continental land.

With this landmark regulatory shift, experts predict unprecedented innovation, reigniting global interest and investment in sustainable supersonic technology. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) anticipates significant economic benefits from this resurgence, along with measurable advancements in aerospace engineering and environmental sustainability.

Sustainable Technology: Greener, Quieter, Faster

While the legendary exterior silhouette of Concorde remains unchanged—preserving its status as an icon of aviation elegance—the technology beneath its sleek skin has been entirely transformed. The new-generation Concorde will be approximately 50% lighter than the original model, achieved through the use of advanced composite materials. This significant weight reduction directly translates to superior fuel efficiency and a reduced environmental footprint.

Powered primarily by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the reborn Concorde will deliver an impressive 80% reduction in emissions compared to its predecessor. This dramatic environmental improvement aligns with global aviation goals outlined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which advocates for increased sustainability within the industry.

Additionally, extensive research and design innovations by Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, a distinguished physicist from Oxford University, have culminated in groundbreaking sonic boom suppression technology. After more than two decades of dedicated research, Churchill secured the world’s first patent for this innovative system in May 2025, perfectly timed to coincide with the Concorde revival. This pioneering technology promises dramatically quieter supersonic flights, enabling the aircraft to fly at speeds surpassing Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound) without disruptive sonic booms at ground level.

Luxury Interiors: Timeless Elegance Meets Japanese Aesthetic

Continuing Concorde’s legacy of luxury travel, the new interiors promise an unparalleled passenger experience. Crafted by internationally renowned architects who specialize in sustainable design, the interior space will embody a refined Japanese aesthetic, balancing simplicity, elegance, and sustainability. Passengers can expect meticulously curated cabins designed with natural, eco-friendly materials, enhancing comfort, serenity, and overall well-being at an altitude of 60,000 feet.

This luxurious yet eco-conscious approach firmly positions Concorde at the forefront of modern aviation, where innovation meets indulgence without compromising environmental integrity.

Digital Innovation: Introducing Concorde Coin (CSSC)

The revival of Concorde extends beyond aviation engineering into the realm of digital innovation. Fly-Concorde Limited, spearheading the development, has introduced Concorde Coin (CSSC)—a blockchain-based stablecoin directly backed by tangible Concorde assets and operational revenues. This innovative digital asset aims to offer passengers and investors an exciting and secure way to engage financially with the iconic Concorde brand.

With increasing global acceptance of blockchain and cryptocurrency as secure investment vehicles, CSSC positions Concorde at the intersection of luxury travel and digital finance, appealing to a new generation of tech-savvy travelers and investors alike.

Leadership and Legacy: Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill

Central to this revival is Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, CEO and Founder of Concorde Co., headquartered in Washington state. Churchill’s deeply personal connection to the Concorde legacy traces back to his lineage—his ancestor, Sir Winston Churchill, originally championed the Concorde as a post-World War II peace initiative.

Dr. Churchill, holding three doctoral degrees in physics and related disciplines from the University of Oxford, has passionately committed over 23 years to overcoming the challenges of sonic boom disruption. His leadership and scientific acumen have been instrumental in bringing the Concorde back into the skies, underscoring the significance of innovation-driven, sustainable aviation solutions.

Global Impact and Economic Potential

According to recent projections by aerospace analysts, the Concorde brand—already synonymous with prestige—is now estimated to be worth approximately $50 billion. The revival is expected not only to boost the global aviation industry but also to generate substantial economic impact in regions connected by these supersonic routes, revitalizing tourism and international business.

Government agencies and regulatory bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are actively collaborating to streamline certification processes for the Concorde’s return to service. Both agencies emphasize safety, sustainability, and community acceptance as cornerstones of this new era in aviation.

Conclusion: The Future is Supersonic

While all over the world, fans are itching for its return, the new Concorde represents much more than nostalgia itself—it represents ultimate sustainable aviation technology, luxurious travel, and cutting-edge digital finance innovation. Ideally blending its timeless heritage with forward-looking innovation, Concorde will redefine travel worldwide once again and show how sustainability and luxury can coexist and thrive at supersonic speeds.

The new AI-powered maintenance scheduler is the brainchild of the IAG.ai Lab team, comprising around 70 AI specialists working in nine departments across labs in Barcelona and London.

The in-house labs serve as hubs for AI-centric innovation and collaboration, focusing on aircraft maintenance, customer service, and overall airline operations.

Better Aircraft Maintenance Workflows

The new engine maintenance scheduling tool uses “algorithms to assess millions of different scenarios, each one tailored to factor in operational, financial or technical assumptions, and identify the optimal maintenance schedule for its fleets,” according to aviationweek.com.

The system is being tested on Aer Lingus’ (EI) A320 CFM56-5B engines, and IAG expects the system to be rolled out to its other airlines by the end of the year.

The goal of the IAG fleet maintenance scheduling overhaul is to prevent maintenance delays, thereby addressing the ever-present engine supply chain issues, as airlines and MROs are struggling to obtain essential engine parts, including materials like titanium and high-pressure turbine blades.

Intergrating AI into the MRO workflow can decrease costs, shorten lead times and compensate for labor shortages. We know that due to scarcity, prices for engine parts have surged, and with procurement of parts is taking longer, lead times for some components can extend to months. Finally, there is a shortage of skilled labor in the aerospace industry, further complicating maintenance and repair processes.

IAGi Accelerator Program

Last March, IAG opened applications for its IAGi Accelerator 2025 program, formerly called Hangar 51. The program’s goal is to identify and test ideas that can solve challenges across the aviation industry.

AeroMorning: Mark, can you tell us about the purpose and characteristics of the WindRunner aircraft?

Mark Lundstrom:

The WindRunner aircraft is a project currently being developed by Radia, an aerospace and clean-energy technology company based in Boulder, Colorado, and founded in 2016.

The primary purpose of the WindRunner is to transport wind turbine blades, specifically enabling onshore wind turbines to use blades as long as offshore ones—up to 105 meters in length. Today, onshore turbine blades are typically limited to around 70 meters, as roads and infrastructure can’t accommodate longer blades. Extending onshore blade lengths significantly boosts green energy production efficiency, lowers energy costs, and reduces the land area needed for wind farms.

The WindRunner will be the largest aircraft in the world under development. It features four engines, a length of 108 meters, a wingspan of 80 meters, and has 12 times the internal volume of a Boeing 747.

In terms of performance, WindRunner can land on semi-prepared airstrips as short as 1,800 meters, carrying a maximum payload of 72 metric tonnes.

Thanks to its unique capabilities, WindRunner is expected to have many applications beyond transporting wind turbine blades. These include moving military hardware (such as F-16s or Chinook helicopters), delivering disaster relief equipment, launching satellites, and transporting other oversized cargo anywhere in the world. Radia envisions a fleet of aircraft to meet global demand.

To mitigate development and cost risks, WindRunner is being designed using proven, certified, and mass-produced technologies. There will be no prototype phase—the project will move directly to a certification aircraft, to be certified under FAA Part 25.

The supply chain is already well-integrated, with most of the key suppliers selected. Most of the structural parts will be sourced from Europe:

Wings and engine pylons – Aernnova (Spain)

Fuselage – Leonardo (Italy)

Empennage – Aciturri (Spain)

Landing gear – Magnaghi (Italy)

Testing and certification will be carried out by Radia with other international partners, with program management handled by Radia in Boulder, Colorado.

Initially, the WindRunner will run on conventional jet fuel, but the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is planned in the second phase, once it becomes widely available and economically viable.

In summary, WindRunner is more than a transportation tool—it’s an enabler for a more sustainable world. By making large-scale onshore wind turbines feasible, it helps reduce the concrete and materials required, cuts energy costs, and increases clean energy output to power high-demand infrastructure like AI data centers or to produce green fuels like SAF in greater volumes and at lower prices.

With WindRunner, Radia is playing a key role in building a cleaner, greener future.

In this way, green energy is not just a climate imperative but an economic opportunity, one that brings capital investment, job creation, and export potential to American soil.","As the global economy accelerates toward a lower-carbon future, few voices carry the pragmatic clarity and cross-border vision that Suneet Singal brings to the table. A business leader and sustainability advocate with a forward-leaning approach to infrastructure and clean energy, Singal is helping to define how the United States can emerge not just as a domestic clean energy leader but as an exporter of American-made green technologies, fuels, and expertise to meet global mandates.

Within this ethos is a strong belief in free-market innovation, profitability, and American energy independence, ideals that resonate deeply with conservative principles while aligning with broader climate goals.

The Southern United States, often associated with traditional energy production, now stands at the intersection of tradition and transformation. With its rich biomass reserves, rail and port infrastructure, and globally leading carbon sequestration hubs, the region is positioned to become a powerhouse in the green energy supply chain. Singal sees immense value in tapping into this potential, not just to serve domestic carriers and industries looking to reduce their emissions, but also to build export pipelines to nations whose emissions mandates have already taken effect.

It's a compelling proposition for Republican lawmakers and conservative-minded investors: create jobs at home, build critical infrastructure in America's heartland, and use US-grown technologies to compete on a global stage. Singal understands this alignment well. His work bridges business with policy in a way that encourages private-sector growth while supporting national interests. Rather than chasing tax incentives, Singal's model focuses on unit economics by delivering clean fuels, such as green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), at competitive prices.

Singal's commitment to export-led growth reflects a broader view of America's role in the global energy transition. While Europe is deepening its decarbonization regulations and Asia is ramping up its demand for clean fuels, the United States, under the right leadership, can be the one to supply them.

""We can build globally competitive facilities in the US, leveraging America's biomass abundance, skilled labor, and advanced logistics to deliver profitable solutions abroad. We now have an opportunity where we don't have to be just consumers of the green transition, we can be the suppliers"". Commented Singal.

This strategy also offers an answer to one of the most asked questions in climate policy: how to align environmental responsibility with fiscal discipline. For conservative stakeholders, Singal's approach offers a path that rewards efficiency, innovation, and entrepreneurial drive.

Projects rooted in the US can be designed to meet both global emission standards and market demands. In this way, green energy is not just a climate imperative but an economic opportunity, one that brings capital investment, job creation, and export potential to American soil.

Carbon capture and sequestration stands out as a key player in Singal's blueprint. The Southern US already boasts some of the most advanced geological formations for long-term CO₂ storage. According to the Global CCS Institute, the US leads the world in operational CCS facilities, with more than 20 active commercial-scale projects. Many of these are concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

These sites are essential not only for capturing emissions from traditional industries but also for enabling low-carbon fuel production. By capturing and storing CO₂ from biofuel facilities, for example, producers can generate net-negative emissions fuels, highly attractive to international buyers facing carbon pricing regimes.

But the global opportunity extends beyond fuel. Singal's vision includes not only shipping green methanol or SAF to global partners, but also building localized versions of US facilities abroad. This decentralized-yet-connected system allows the United States to retain intellectual and economic leadership in clean tech, even as it supports the development of greener supply chains overseas.

""It is not a zero-sum game between economic strength and environmental stewardship. With the right strategies and incentives, the two can reinforce each other. America can build at home and serve abroad. It can meet domestic needs while shaping global standards. We can also do this without abandoning our values, but by elevating them, turning competition, innovation, and independence into the cornerstones of climate leadership."" Concluded Singal.",https://d.techtimes.com/en/full/458063/image-credit-suneet-singal.png,N,,2025-06-26 15:07:42.982145

Yesterday’s Fryer Oil, Tomorrow’s Flight

U.S. kitchens pour out ≈ 3 billion lb of used cooking oil (UCO) every year. Airlines want it: up to 80 % of all new SAF in the next five years will be made through the HEFA pathway that relies on UCO, cutting lifecycle emissions as much as 80 % compared with Jet A. Our own Grease Connections drivers see the demand firsthand: South Florida tankers now head straight from our Miami depot to a nearby HEFA refinery every Friday. The message is simple: when you keep oil clean, you help fuel the next departure board and earn for it.

Five Stops from Kitchen to Cockpit

A typical quick service restaurant produces about 35 lb oil/day. Here’s where Grease Connections steps in:

Cool & pour into a lidded tank: our techs remind crews never to top past 75 % to leave room for expansion.

Smart pickup: our trucks scan the tank tag; a digital manifest hits your inbox before we roll out.

Pre treatment at a regional hub; solids skimmed in under 20 minutes thanks to our heated centrifugal units.

Refinery gate: UCO enters hydroprocessing, stripping oxygen and isomerizing chains to jet spec molecules.

Blend & fly: 865 000 + commercial flights have already used SAF.

What’s Your Oil Worth Today?

USDA spot sheets list yellow grease at $0.33 to $0.45 / lb this week, driving an underground market. One Missouri thief siphoned 258 gal in a single night, nearly $1 000 in diesel equivalent value. Grease Connections curbs that risk with locked lids and GPS sealed pickups; our Orlando district hasn’t lost a gallon since switching to tamper proof hatches last year. Beyond cash, each gallon of UCO based biodiesel can generate LCFS credits; Florida is tightening those rules to push prices higher. Expect the new federal 45Z clean fuel credit to add even more upside when it starts in 2025.

Stay Compliant, Stay Open

EPA’s FOG guide bans any drain disposal and requires documented pickups. NFPA 96 caps unprotected indoor storage at 60 gal for Class IIIB liquids. Grease Connections’ technicians install secondary containment trays that slide out for quick wash downs: health inspectors in Miami tell us it’s the fastest way to ace surprise visits. Our manifests meet cradle to grave traceability rules, a growing focus after reports of fraudulent UCO imports.

How We Beat Grease Bandits

Field lesson: illuminated enclosures plus our steel “shark tooth” lids cut attempted siphoning by 60 % at a Dallas diner row last quarter. Cameras help prosecution, but speed helps more: our average pump out takes five minutes, leaving nothing for thieves. If an overnight spill happens, absorbent socks from our spill kit bag stop oil before it reaches drains; every new customer gets one free at signup.

Choosing the Right Tank: Grease Connections’ Picks

Inside the Refinery: Where Oil Turns to SAF

Hydrotreating removes oxygen; isomerization tailors freeze points. HEFA is still the only fully commercial SAF route, supplying 80 % of today’s volumes. For every 1 000 gal processed, lifecycle CO₂ drops roughly 70 t compared with petroleum jet A. Grease Connections contracts guarantee our loads head to SAF, not lower value diesel, so your waste truly helps aviation decarbonize.

ESG Story Your Customers Will Love

One fast food location recycling with us diverts 12 000 + lb of oil a year (based on our Atlanta route logs). We bundle annual recycling reports you can post on menu boards or RFPs: proof that your fries help power flights, not landfills. With travelers and corporate buyers asking for low carbon dining, this is a story worth telling.

Quick Fire FAQ

Minimum pickup? We start at 50 gal, about two weeks for a busy diner.

Hot water down the drain? Still illegal under FOG rules.

Are imports losing credit eligibility? Yes, as 45Z favors domestic, fully traced oil.

Does SAF really fly now? 865 000 + flights so far.

And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels, and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 litres per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritise climate action over their very tight profit margins.

Up in the air

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the UK wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonise aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/676581/original/file-20250625-56-arar05.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=444%2C1508%2C4721%2C2360&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-26 13:08:12.984414

An ABF spokesperson said:

“We are extremely pleased to be entering the next phase of formal negotiations with Government over the future of Vivergo.

We believe it is a very positive signal that Government recognises the strategic importance of a domestic bioethanol industry, and is serious about working with the sector to find a sustainable long-term future. We look forward to engaging intensively and constructively with ministers over the coming weeks.

ABF cannot continue to absorb losses at the plant. That is why a timely solution is vital. Our clear preference is to find that solution through this process and to get back to running a business that can thrive in the long term.

In parallel, we have entered into a consultation process with our employees - a necessary step given there can be no guarantee that the negotiations with Government will be successful. Our employees are our most important consideration, and we will engage with them properly and transparently about the future. Consultation is not a fixed outcome - and closure is not a certainty. The outcome depends on the progress we are able to make through negotiations with the Government. Our goal is for that outcome to be positive.

We want to keep Vivergo operating. We have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in it. We have fought hard to save it - and the potential ahead is enormous. Just days ago, we signed a £1.25 billion Memorandum of Understanding with Meld Energy to anchor a world-class Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at the site. There is a real opportunity for Hull to be home to one of Britain’s most exciting clean fuel clusters.

ABF has always been and remains a long-term UK investor with a consistent record of supporting UK industry and jobs. We are committed to playing a lasting role in the country’s green industrial future.”

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), an industry group that represents 350 global airlines, has created a new online platform to match airlines with sustainable fuel companies.

The new matchmaker platform is designed to streamline the complicated and expensive process airlines must endure in order to find a sustainable fuel provider that suits their needs. Air carriers can submit their requests on the platform, and fuel providers can then follow up with their supply details. When there’s a match, the companies can take their discussion offline to hammer out details like pricing and payment terms.

IATA says the central database was designed in order to facilitate more voluntary purchases of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The organization has set an ambitious goal for the air travel industry to operate on a carbon neutral basis in less than 30 years.

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist. “The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

Sustainable jet fuel currently only makes up 0.3% of jet fuel use around the globe, according to a recent report by the World Travel and Tourism Council.

The matchmaker platform will include comprehensive details about the fuel options, including volumes of supply, type of feedstock used, location and technology of production, emissions reduction, and compliance with various regulations, such as the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive.

For now, IATA’s platform is only available to airlines and fuel suppliers. However, the organization says that in due time, the database will open up to other non-aviation corporations who wish to participate.

In addition to making sustainable fuel options more accessible, IATA’s plan to achieve net zero emissions includes using other technologies, like those that remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

But the Department for Transport has been accused of undermining domestic bioethanol producers by awarding green energy subsidies to American producers that make the chemical from waste, which is seen as more eco-friendly.

ABF is asking for an end to the green energy certificates being awarded to American producers.","Ministers are racing to save Britain’s largest bioethanol plant after the owner warned it would be forced to close the site without state intervention.

On Thursday, Associated British Foods (ABF) said it had entered into last-ditch talks with the Government about securing support for its Vivergo Fuels business in Hull, which is losing £3m a month.

Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, also confirmed he was engaging “in good faith” with the company and could commit taxpayer money to a rescue package.

If the negotiations fail, ABF’s bosses have threatened to close the factory by Sept 13.

The company has accused ministers of rendering its business unprofitable by awarding subsidies to rival American producers.

Bosses had previously warned they would decide this week whether to close the plant, which makes bioethanol for blending into petrol and employs around 150 people.

But ABF said it had entered “formal negotiations” about whether the site could be kept going. It is understood that the decision follows an intervention by Mr Reynolds.

The Government’s offer to the company remains unclear. But ABF is demanding “short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses” as well as a longer-term deal to put its plant on a profitable footing again.

In a move that piled further pressure on ministers, the company warned: “Given the outcome of the negotiations is uncertain, Vivergo is simultaneously beginning consultation with employees to effect an orderly wind-down.”

The plant, which can produce 420,000m litres of bioethanol per year, had already stopped ordering wheat feedstock, it added.

Losing the facility would leave the UK more reliant on foreign imports and dent ambitions for domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel.

The chemicals sector is described as one of several “foundation industries” in the industrial strategy published by ministers on Monday.

A spokesman for the Government said ABF’s latest ultimatum was “disappointing to see”, while Mr Reynolds described it as “premature”.

Mr Reynolds told journalists: “We have secured a mandate across government to negotiate with them.

“That means we’re willing to engage with them and potentially put government money into a restructure to make sure they’ve got a strong future.

“We have met them many times. We’ve engaged the consultants and we’re well into the process.

“Frankly, I really do regret the Vivergo’s decision to start consultations to let the workforce go and close the plant.”

Only two plants in the UK make bioethanol, which is most commonly blended with petrol to make greener fuels such as E5 and E10.

The vast majority of production uses primary feedstocks such as sugar crops or wheat that are processed to yield fermentable sugars that are then converted into ethanol. Because the fuel is made from plants, it is regarded as renewable.

But the Department for Transport has been accused of undermining domestic bioethanol producers by awarding green energy subsidies to American producers that make the chemical from waste, which is seen as more eco-friendly.

ABF and domestic competitor Ensus say ministers then compounded the problem by striking a trade deal with the US that grants American bioethanol producers tariff-free access to the UK market.

The trade deal has not yet taken effect but ABF says its plant in Hull is already unprofitable and cannot be sustained. It has already written £700m off its value.

Ensus, which runs the country’s only other bioethanol plant, has similarly warned that its facility in Teesside is at risk.

Previous talks between the companies and the Government had not made serious progress.

But it is understood that Mr Reynolds and Heidi Alexander, the Transport Secretary, met company bosses on Tuesday and that the Government has brought in consultants to examine ABF’s proposed rescue package.

It turns out that restaurants, street food stalls and home cooks in Malaysia — which is “among the world’s leading suppliers of both UCO and virgin palm oil” — will pay less for fresh cooking oil than the international market will pay for used cooking oil.
Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact).
Virgin palm oil can be substituted for used cooking oil and voila!
Malaysia exports far more “used” cooking oil than oil that it uses.","The ever-excellent Matt Levine points us to the amusing economic policies that connect the international jet-set to Malaysian street hawkers of fried noodles. The EU and the US have created strong economic incentives to create sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and a good way to do this is to recycle used cooking oil (UCO). What could be better, right? Take a waste product and turn it into jet fuel! The EU and US policies, however, are so strong that all the EU and US used cooking oil cannot meet the demand. Here’s a great sentence, “Europe simply cannot collect enough used cooking oil to fly its planes.”

In the US, credits under the Inflation Reduction Act can account for up to $1.75 to $1.85 per gallon of SAF. Meanwhile cooking oil is subsidized in some parts of the world. The result?

It turns out that restaurants, street food stalls and home cooks in Malaysia — which is “among the world’s leading suppliers of both UCO and virgin palm oil” — will pay less for fresh cooking oil than the international market will pay for used cooking oil. Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact). Also fresh cooking oil is subsidized by the government in Malaysia: “Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.” So if you run a restaurant, you can buy fresh cooking oil for about $0.60 (USD), use it to fry food a few times, and then sell it to a refiner for $1, which is a nice little subsidy for the difficult, risky, low-margin business of running a restaurant.

The noodle hawkers in Kuala Lumpur are getting a nice little bump in profit but who is going stall to stall to check that the oil is in fact used? And what counts as used? One fry or two? Clever entrepreneurs have cut out the middleman. Virgin palm oil can be substituted for used cooking oil and voila! Sustainable aviation fuel is contributing to deforestation in Malaysia. Malaysia exports far more “used” cooking oil than oil that it uses. No surprise.

All of this illustrates a broader point: externalities suggest policy interventions may improve outcomes but markets are complex and politics is blunt. It’s easy to make things worse. If intervention is necessary, a uniform carbon tax beats a patchwork of production-specific subsidies. A price is a signal wrapped up in an incentive. Send everyone the same signal and the same incentive to ensure that the cheapest emissions are cut first and total costs are minimized.

Crucially, a carbon tax rewards any effective solution, even ones a planner would never think of–lighter planes and cleaner fuels sure but also operational tweaks like jet washes. In contrast, subsidies tether policy to specific technologies, like used cooking oil. That invites rent-seeking and inefficiency.

(Reuters) -Associated British Foods said it would close the UK’s largest bioethanol plant by September if the government does not provide support and funding, potentially the first victim of Britain’s tariff deal with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Under last month’s trade deal, the UK’s 19% tariffs on U.S. ethanol will fall to zero, through a 1.4 billion-litre (370 million gallon) quota – a figure equating to the size of the UK’s entire ethanol market.

The possible closure would be an embarrassment for Prime Minister Keir Starmer who hailed the trade deal as a boost to businesses that would protect jobs and attract investment.

It also underscores how Trump’s assault on trade is being felt around the world, with the closure set to affect the production of byproducts including animal feed and carbon dioxide, and British arable farmers which supply the industry.

Bioethanol is produced from crops such as wheat and is used to make petrol greener and to make sustainable aviation fuel. On Monday, Starmer’s government launched its industrial strategy, promising to invest in the green economy.

Britain has two major bioethanol plants in northern England – AB Foods’ Vivergo plant and one operated by Ensus, owned by Germany’s Sudzucker Group – which account for nearly all of the UK’s production capacity.

They have warned that the trade deal, along with existing regulations that give U.S. producers an advantage in the British market, has made the environment impossible. The industry supports thousands of jobs.

Ensus, which has warned its Teesside plant also faces imminent closure, on Thursday welcomed the appointment of external advisers to work with the industry, and said it would work with the government “urgently”.

LEVEL THE REGULATORY PLAYING FIELD

AB Foods said on Thursday it would begin consultations with employees for an orderly wind-down of its plant, while simultaneously continuing talks with the government, which it said is now committed to reaching “a sustainable solution”.

It said it would cease all manufacturing before September 13, its financial year-end, “unless the government is able to provide both short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses and a longer-term solution.”

A spokesperson for the government said it was disappointed with AB Foods’ announcement, having entered into negotiations with the company on financial support on Wednesday.

The government would “present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods,” the spokesperson added.

AB Foods wants the government to increase the amount of ethanol in UK petrol from 10% to 15% and support the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

It also wants the industry to have access to short-term financial aid of up to 150 million pounds ($202 million).

Britain’s concession on ethanol was made in return for the removal of 25% additional tariffs on steel and aluminium, and a quota of 100,000 cars at a duty of 10%.

The long-term goal is for the Swedish aviation industry to be completely fossil-free for domestic flights by 2030 and for international flights by 2045, in line with the aviation industry’s joint roadmap within the framework of Fossil-Free Sweden. Swedavia firmly believes that sustainable aviation fuel, electric aircraft and hydrogen-powered aircraft are vital elements in achieving the green transition in the aviation industry.

Swedavia became fossil-free in its own airport operations at all ten airports as early as 2020, making the Group the first in the world to achieve this. By 2025, all ground operations at Swedavia’s airports that are carried out by other operators will also be made fossil-free through the partnership plan that has been developed, which involves all operators at the airports signing an agreement with Swedavia stipulating a focus on phasing out fossil fuels from their operations.

With Visby Airport, Åre Östersund Airport and Kiruna Airport achieving Level 5 certification within Airport Carbon Accreditation, seven out of ten Swedavia airports are now certified at the highest level. This achievement follows Göteborg Landvetter Airport and Malmö Airport, which were certified at Level 5 in December 2023, and Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Ronneby Airport, which were certified in October 2024. With ACA 5 certification of Visby, Åre Östersund and Kiruna, Swedavia has taken the final steps necessary to phase out fossil fuels at all levels at these three airports.

Within the framework of Airport Carbon Accreditation, Swedavia's ambition is for its remaining three airports - Bromma Stockholm Airport, Luleå Airport and Umeå Airport - to be certified at level 5 by 2026.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The SAF Matchmaker is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.

Concorde Supersonic Jet to Return by 2026

After decades of silence, Concorde is on track to become the world’s leading supersonic passenger aircraft once again.

The recently signed executive order clears regulatory airspace that had long blocked overland supersonic travel due to sonic boom and environmental concerns. The new legislation positions the U.S. as a leader in next-generation aerospace innovation and sustainability.

The new Concorde will remain true to its iconic silhouette but will be 50% lighter and use advanced composite materials and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), cutting emissions by 80%.

It will cruise at 60,000 feet, significantly higher than conventional commercial jets, while operating faster, quieter, and cleaner than the original.

The interior will reflect minimalist Japanese aesthetics, developed by leading sustainable architects. Every feature, from cabin design to propulsion systems, will incorporate cutting-edge aerospace technologies rooted in decades of research and development.

Leadership, Legacy, and Supersonic Breakthroughs

At the helm of this supersonic revival is Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, CEO and Founder of The Concorde Co., based in Washington state.

A triple PhD from Oxford and an expert physicist, Dr. Churchill is credited with solving the long-standing sonic boom challenge. His patented Sonic Boom Suppression technology, granted in May 2025, enables Concorde to fly overland without disturbing ground-level communities.

Dr. Churchill is a direct descendant of Sir Winston Churchill, whose original Concorde initiative was launched as a post-World War II peace project. Now, his legacy continues through the rebirth of this aviation legend, targeted for launch on its 50th anniversary.

Patricia Bader-Johnston, Vice President and Chief Development Officer at Fly-Concorde Limited, emphasizes the aircraft’s broader vision: “Concorde is set to become the global benchmark for sonic boom suppression and sustainability.”

Financial Innovation

Fly-Concorde is also innovating on the financial front. It has introduced Concorde Coin (CSSC), a stablecoin backed by Concorde’s aviation assets and operations.

With blockchain technology gaining global traction, CSSC is designed to attract investors aligned with futuristic, environmentally responsible air travel ventures.

This digital currency initiative aims to fund development while enabling broader engagement in Concorde’s mission. The move reflects growing synergy between aerospace advancement and decentralized finance.

Globally recognized as a pinnacle of aviation excellence, the Concorde brand is now valued at approximately $50 billion. The upcoming relaunch aims to restore its reputation as the epitome of luxury air travel, now aligned with modern values of environmental stewardship, digital innovation, and safety.

History of the Supersonic Era

The Concorde, a joint marvel by British Airways (BA) and Air France (AF), revolutionized high-speed air travel with its supersonic performance. Operating primarily between London Heathrow (LHR), Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), and New York John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK), Concorde represented the peak of technological ambition in commercial aviation.

The aircraft’s inaugural transatlantic flight occurred on September 26, 1973, marking a new era of rapid travel. Despite initial global fascination, the Concorde’s commercial future was constrained by high operational costs, limited routes, and its eventual involvement in a fatal accident in 2000.

Birth of a Supersonic Dream

Concorde’s development began with the 1962 treaty between France and the UK, aiming to share the cost and innovation challenges of producing a supersonic transport (SST).

British Aerospace and Aérospatiale collaborated on the aircraft’s frame, while Rolls-Royce and SNECMA developed its powerful Olympus 593 engines. This cooperation marked a defining moment in European aerospace engineering.

After its maiden flight on March 2, 1969, the Concorde entered commercial service on January 21, 1976. British Airways (BA) initially operated the London (LHR) to Bahrain route, and Air France (AF) flew from Paris (CDG) to Rio de Janeiro (GIG). Shortly after, both airlines launched regular services to Washington Dulles (IAD) and New York JFK (JFK), offering transatlantic flights in under three and a half hours.

Although capable of cruising at Mach 2.04 (2,179 km/h), the Concorde was never economically viable. Only 14 production aircraft entered commercial service, with persistent financial losses leading to route reductions until JFK remained the only regular destination. The aircraft’s sonic boom and high noise levels also restricted route expansion.

Tupolev Tu-144, Copy of Concorde?

The Tupolev Tu-144, the world’s first supersonic transport (SST) aircraft, was a milestone in Soviet aerospace engineering. Designed by legendary aircraft designer Andrey N. Tupolev and his son Alexey, the Tu-144 symbolized the USSR’s ambition to lead in high-speed aviation during the Cold War era.

First flown in December 1968 and surpassing Mach 1 in June 1969, the Tu-144 predated Concorde’s first supersonic flight. It was publicly unveiled in Moscow in May 1970 and stood as a technological marvel with futuristic design elements and record-breaking performance.

Despite its technical achievements, the Tu-144’s career was marred by high-profile incidents. A tragic crash during a demonstration at the 1973 Paris Air Show raised early concerns. Though the aircraft began mail service on the Moscow–Alma-Ata route in 1975 and passenger service in 1978, another fatal crash that same year led to its commercial withdrawal.

Only 55 passenger flights were completed before Aeroflot ceased its SST operations. The aircraft’s high operating costs, limited range, and reliability issues made it commercially unsustainable.

While its commercial role was short-lived, later Tu-144 variants were used in experimental flight programs. Notably, in the 1990s, a modified Tu-144LL flew under a joint Russian-American program to advance next-generation supersonic transport technology.

Final Years and Grounding

On July 25, 2000, Air France Flight 4590 (AF4590), a Concorde departing from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) to New York JFK, crashed shortly after takeoff.

A burst tire punctured a fuel tank, igniting a fire that led to engine failure. The aircraft crashed into a nearby hotel in Gonesse, France, killing all 109 on board and 4 on the ground.

This tragedy, combined with growing maintenance costs and declining passenger numbers, marked the beginning of the end.

Air France retired its Concorde fleet in May 2003, and British Airways followed in October 2003, officially concluding the era of supersonic commercial aviation.

A demonstration project located in Taonan in Northeast China's Jilin province is expected to produce the first barrel of green methanol in July, which will subsequently be transported to Shanghai Port to bunker the commercial logistics vessels under French shipping and logistics group CMA CGM, according to Ni Jianjun, deputy general manager of Shanghai Boiler Works Co Ltd, a unit of Shanghai Electric Group Co Ltd.

""The Taonan site has an annual production capacity of 50,000 metric tons, and we have plans to build more capacity to meet soaring market demand,"" said Ni.

As a type of clean and renewable energy, green methanol is produced mainly from renewable energies featuring high efficiency, clean emission, renewability, easy storage and transportation convenience.

Despite rising demand for green transition across the global shipping industry, production capability of clean energies remains limited.

Throughout 2024, orders for 515 vessels using alternative fuels including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and methanol were placed, up 38 percent year-on-year, with 166 ships to be powered by methanol, reported the Shanghai-based newspaper Jiefang Daily citing data from international certification and classification body DNV.

Among the 180 million tons of methanol produced worldwide in 2023, merely 500,000 are green methanol, including some 300,000 tons produced in China, according to a Shanghai Observer report.

According to Ni, apart from the Taonan project, a much bigger project with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons of methanol is in the pipeline.

What's noteworthy is that all the core technologies and key equipment used in the Taonan project are researched and developed by Shanghai Electric, Ni added.

""CMA CGM's demand for green methanol is much bigger than the 50,000 tons we are going to provide. In fact, there is a supply shortage in terms of green methanol globally,"" Ni said.

Public information shows the demand for green methanol is projected to surpass 10 million tons by 2030, while production is only approaching 500,000 tons annually for the moment.

In addition to the innovative application of green energy in the shipping industry, Shanghai Electric has plans to develop sustainable aviation fuel and will continue to introduce more green fuel solutions for various sectors, Ni said.

On its way to building itself into an international shipping hub, the port of Shanghai is also seizing the emerging opportunities that green transition creates.

A simultaneous ship-to-ship bunkering of green methanol for dual-powered container ship HMM Green under South Korean logistics company was conducted in March at Shanghai's Yangshan Port, becoming the first bunkering of domestically produced green methanol, according to Shanghai International Port (Group) Co Ltd.

The bunkering was conducted by the Hai Gang Zhi Yuan tanker, the nation's first and largest methanol bunkering vessel in operation. In comparison with the bunkering conducted by Hai Gang Zhi Yuan for Danish shipping and logistics services provider A.P.Moller-Maersk's Astrid Maersk in April 2024, the latest bunkering involves a greater amount of green methanol, about 2,900 tons, and the green energy is produced in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.

Indonesia is emerging as a promising destination for energy transition investments. Two of the country’s leading sovereign wealth funds have recently reaffirmed their commitment to scaling up investments in clean energy.

At the same time, the European Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia (EuroCham Indonesia) is advocating for the development of low-carbon fuels such as bioenergy, encouraging local companies to tap into global decarbonization trends to drive export-led industrial growth.

INA, Danantara target nickel processing, clean power, and grid upgrades

At the Energy Transition Forum co-hosted by the Financial Times and Nikkei on June 25, Indonesian Investment Authority (INA) and the newly established sovereign fund Danantara outlined their upcoming investment priorities, naming electric vehicle battery supply chains, solar energy, and grid modernization among key targets.

INA CEO Ridha Wirakusumah noted that renewable energy currently accounts for about 12% of INA’s US$4 billion portfolio and is expected to rise to 15–20% this year. The fund is not only supporting the early retirement of coal plants but also focusing on geothermal, solar, and waste-to-energy projects.

Ridha highlighted a solar power project under discussion that could break the record for the largest installed capacity in the country. In the EV space, INA is prioritizing nickel processing, an essential link in battery manufacturing, leveraging Indonesia’s abundant mineral resources to build a competitive position in the global EV supply chain.

In May, INA, Danantara, and French mining giant Eramet signed an MoU focused on building a domestic nickel ecosystem for EV battery materials. The agreement was witnessed by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.

Foreign stakeholders urge acceleration of low-carbon fuel exports

Danantara Chief Investment Officer Pandu Sjahrir, also speaking at the forum, emphasized the fund’s dual focus on nickel processing and upgrading the national power grid. Indonesia’s outdated electricity infrastructure, originally built to serve fossil fuel plants, is now seen as a major bottleneck to renewable integration.

Danantara, launched in February under the Prabowo administration, is authorized to manage the assets of key state-owned enterprises such as the national oil company Pertamina. The fund oversees assets worth over US$900 billion and is pursuing nine strategic investment areas, including mining for battery minerals, biofuel agriculture, and renewable power.

Foreign investors see Indonesia’s vast natural resources and strategic location as offering immense export potential. Thomas Wagner, head of EuroCham Indonesia’s energy working group, recently stated at a geopolitical forum that Indonesia should move swiftly to develop low-carbon fuels, including bio-based sustainable aviation fuel and bio-methanol, which could generate up to US$8 billion annually in exports.

Wagner urged Indonesian companies to take a proactive stance in capturing surging global demand and benefiting from favorable policies.

Oil and gas licensing In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry.
The checkpoint is used to assess whether proposed oil and gas licenses align with the UK’s climate change goals.
This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans.","The British government weakened key climate policies after fossil fuel giants lobbied ministers and used legal loopholes to avoid public scrutiny, a new report has found.

Climate-focused think tank InfluenceMap has uncovered that industry influence appears to have led to the delay and dilution of UK policies on the roll-out of heat pumps, the development of ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel and the granting of new oil and gas licenses.

In each case, it found that lobbyists representing fossil fuel actors that stood to lose billions from progressive climate regulations were able to influence the Conservative government’s policy without scrutiny.

While InfluenceMap’s report looks at policies relating to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, its findings on the way the UK’s lax laws allow lobbying to be conducted in secret can be applied across sectors. The think tank is calling for reforms to address this and close the “major transparency gap”.

The secrecy around lobbying, which has been at the heart of many government scandals in recent years, is a major driver of the disillusionment in British politics.

Three-quarters of the public believe the government is “rigged to serve the rich and influential”, according to polling conducted by More in Common and University College London’s Policy Lab last year.

InfluenceMap’s findings illustrate “how inadequate and opaque lobbying rules undermine effective policymaking”, said Alastair McCapra, the CEO of the UK lobbying industry body.

He added: “Business engagement should help to build sounder policy with better outcomes for the public, but unaccountable lobbying breeds public mistrust. This important report removes the guesswork needed to piece together what kind of lobbying is taking place.”

Weak lobbying laws

openDemocracy has previously reported extensively on the ways that the UK’s weak lobbying laws allow corporate influence to secretly shape policy.

Our investigations have now been backed up by InfluenceMap, which has found a huge gap exists between the lobbying that takes place and that which is disclosed. This means the British public often has no way of knowing who is swaying policy.

Comparing transparency rules in the UK, the European Parliament, the US, Canada and France, InfluenceMap found that the UK has by far the worst system.

Of the five, only the UK exempts lobbyists who work in-house for a company, rather than for an agency or consultancy, from registering with a statutory lobbying watchdog. Less than 15% of lobbyists working in the UK need to register because of this rule.

The firms on the register must publish a list of clients on whose behalf they have lobbied each quarter. But they do not have to publish any details about the lobbying, including whether it involved written correspondence or a meeting and what legislation or policy was discussed.

Registered lobbyists also only need to declare clients for whom they lobbied government ministers and senior officials. There is no requirement to name clients when they approached other MPs and peers, including those on select committees, or influential government advisers.

The Committee for Standards in Public Life, an independent public body that advises the prime minister on lobbying and other aspects of public office, has consistently recommended the government publish a single, searchable database of all meetings with lobbyists.

Its recommendations would expand the scope of the current register considerably, requiring lobbyists to disclose the specific policies or legislation they discussed at meetings with government ministers and special advisers.

InfluenceMap has also called on the government to take up this recommendation and address the fundamental flaws in the lobbying act by including in-house lobbyists and publishing all responses to government policy consultants as standard.

Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said the report “starkly demonstrates how major transparency gaps in the UK’s lobbying regime are undermining the development of good climate policy.”

“We fully support their recommendations to make lobbying much more transparent and bring the UK in line with international best practice. These reforms would support more participatory and open decision-making to help rebuild public trust and ensure better decision-making, widening the evidence base for policy making and reducing risks of policy capture by vested interests,” she said.

Oil and gas licensing

In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. The checkpoint is used to assess whether proposed oil and gas licenses align with the UK’s climate change goals.

Oil giants BP and Shell and their industry association, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), responded to a consultation on the checkpoint by objecting to the inclusion of two key metrics for measuring the impact of fossil fuels, according to InfluenceMap’s analysis of consultation responses obtained via Freedom of Information requests.

The measures they opposed would have required the government to consider ‘Scope 3 emissions’ and the ‘global production gap’ when issuing new oil and gas licences.

Scope 3 emissions are produced during end-use and contribute the largest share of all emissions from oil and gas production, while the production gap tracks the discrepancy between planned fossil fuel production and what’s needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.

The government dropped both criteria from the final checkpoint, which instead focuses solely on operational emissions, which represent only a fraction of total emissions from oil and gas projects.

This outcome, InfluenceMap’s report notes, strongly aligns with the positions advocated for by BP, Shell, and OEUK, suggesting their lobbying efforts were successful.

The following year, the government approved 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences, which had a potential emissions footprint equivalent to Denmark’s annual output.

InfluenceMap’s report also highlights the issues around government consultations on proposed policies, pointing out that, as in this case, lobbyists typically use these to suggest amendments in favour of their clients, but their responses are not published as standard.

Similarly, unlike in the other four Parliaments InfluenceMap looked at, corporations in the UK are not required to declare their engagement on policies, how much they spend on lobbying, or which legislation or decisions they are targeting.

It highlights that this can lead to a situation in which companies make voluntary corporate disclosures that fail to capture the true extent of this advocacy. In this case, InfluenceMap found BP published a summary of its response to the checkpoint that omitted key lines of its opposition, which were only revealed later through Freedom of Information requests.

Rachel Davies, advocacy director at Transparency International UK, said: “This report highlights, yet again, the glaring gaps in our lobbying transparency regime and the potential risks of favouring a small group of vested interests at the public’s expense.

“The UK needs to catch up to other comparable democracies and act swiftly to introduce a comprehensive lobbying register with meaningful disclosures.”

Domestic hydrogen

It is broadly agreed that, in the UK, hydrogen is not a viable solution for decarbonising domestic heating and is an especially bad alternative to heat pumps. Much of our hydrogen comes from burning gas or coal and it cannot be transported through our existing pipelines without massive and costly infrastructure changes.

This reality has been set out by different independent bodies advising the UK government.

In 2021, the Climate Change Committee warned that hydrogen had “not yet been proven at scale and should not be a cause to delay other options” such as the roll-out of heat pumps or low-carbon heat networks. Two years later, the National Infrastructure Commission said the government “should not support the roll-out of hydrogen heating” because there is “no public policy case” for its use.

As InfluenceMap’s report notes, this has not prevented the gas industry from waging a successful lobbying campaign in a bid to shore up its market position – with a clear impact on government policy.

The think tank found the industry pursued its cause in a number of ways, including setting up Hello Hydrogen, a campaign fronted by TV star Rachel Riley, to make the case for using hydrogen in homes to the public in 2022. While the campaign did not declare its funders, its director was also a director of Cadent Gas, the UK’s largest gas distribution network.

Cadent is one of the funders of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hydrogen, which has publicly called for hydrogen to play a part in domestic heating. The APPG’s other funders include Equinor, Shell and the Energy and Utilities Alliance, a lobbying body run by Mike Foster, the former Labour MP for Worcester (home to Worcester Bosch, a major manufacturer of gas boilers).

Other fossil fuel firms and industry lobbying bodies have also consistently pushed for the use of hydrogen in domestic heating in letters to parliamentary select committees and responses to government consultations.

Ahead of last year’s general election, Centrica (formerly British Gas) wrote to the Public Accounts Committee, which examines the value for money of government projects, to call for further public investment in hydrogen for home heating. The firm had written to the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee in support of the technology less than 12 months earlier.

This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans. A February 2023 report by the House of Lords Committee blamed mixed messages on the effectiveness of hydrogen from the government and industry for the poor uptake of a publicly subsidised scheme for heat pumps, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create many jobs.

The lords’ report concluded: “Hydrogen is not a serious option for home heating for the short to medium-term and misleading messages, including from the government, are negatively affecting take-up of established low-carbon home heating technologies like heat pumps.”

The UK’s heat pump roll-outs have lagged behind those of its neighbours. Just 55,000 heat pumps were installed in the UK in 2019, compared to 600,000 in France, according to a study cited in the InfluenceMap report.

In the UK, this reportedly created around 2,000 jobs and reduced emissions of CO₂ by 0.08 million tonnes (MT); in France 30,000 jobs were created and 0.84 MT of CO₂ emissions avoided.

‘Sustainable’ aviation fuel

InfluenceMap also uncovered how industry significantly influenced the government’s so-called ‘Jet Zero’ strategy for cutting emissions in the UK’s aviation industry, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Biofuels, largely made up of used cooking oils, are often suggested as an option for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), although they are generally accepted to be worse in terms of scalability than other, more advanced fuels, and much worse than just reducing the number of flights.

The government initially proposed limiting the use of used cooking oil for SAF to alleviate competition on the resource – which is increasingly in demand for other uses, such as producing biodiesel for cars – and to encourage investment in new technologies for the aviation industry.

The proposals included two options; either banning the use of used cooking oil for SAF altogether, or rapidly phasing down its use so that it would make up just 8.5% of total sustainable aviation fuel by 2040.

But the government’s final SAF policy was more closely aligned with industry preferences than scientific warnings, InfluenceMap found. It allows used cooking oil to make up 100% of SAF uptake in 2025 and 2026, 71% in 2030, and 35% in 2040.

InfluenceMap’s analysis reveals the weakened SAF mandate came after pressure from Shell, BP, the International Airlines Group (which owns several airlines), Airlines UK (the trade body for UK-registered airlines) and Virgin Atlantic airline.

It also found that business interests were overrepresented in parliamentary meetings on SAF while the policy was being shaped.

This can be seen in the make-up of Parliament’s Jet Zero Council, “a partnership between industry academia and government”, which was run by Heathrow’s chief operating officer, while the International Airlines Group chaired the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Delivery Group.

The council comprised 24 members from industry, three from academia and one from civil society. Ministers were also directly involved with the council, with then-prime minister Boris Johnson attending the group’s first meeting along with four ministers.

Transparency failures again played a key role. Not a single ministerial meeting on SAF referenced the weakening of the cooking oil cap in official records, and industry responses to consultations were only obtained through Freedom of Information.",https://cdn2.opendemocracy.net/media/images/GettyImages-1246268061_1.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 08:01:30.513298

Global aviation desperately needs Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Boeing’s recovery depends on successful sales of its aircraft. Below are two articles that show how these two imperatives have flowed together nicely for the

Seattle/Chicago/Arlington? company.

Boeing is seeking to sell its aircraft to Canada and India

The two countries pose prime opportunities to develop SAF

An apt term for Boeing’s substantial investment in each country’s Green Technologies while hoping to sell both members of the Commonwealth of Nations (a/k/a British Commonwealth) might be

The investment is well justified from both a financial and a environmental basis. Here are some of the explanations of the need and the challenge:

2050 ZERO NET EMMISIONS; EU’s Clean Aviation and the US- HOW are they doing?

More SAF feedstocks = cheaper green fuel?

The SAF investments are absolutely critical to attaining the 2050 Global Goal of Net Zero Carbon Emissions. Contributing to target markets is a wise way to match environmental goals with sales.

Boeing Sees India as Crucial Player in Sustainable Aviation Future

India has the potential of producing 8-10 million tonnes annually, said President of Boeing India and South Asia, Salil Gupte

India can emerge as a net exporter of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and play a significant role in global green and clean aviation. Speaking at the CII Annual Business Summit 2025 in New Delhi, President of Boeing India and South Asia, Salil Gupte, highlighted that the availability of abundant feedstock like agricultural residue in India can be used for SAF production and help in the reduction of carbon emissions from the aviation sector, the Business Standard reported.

“This means that India can actually provide over 5% of the world’s SAF requirements...India can be an exporter of SAF. This creates an opportunity. This means India can help decarbonise the civil aviation industry,” said President of Boeing India and South Asia, Salil Gupte, according to BS.

SAF annual production must reach 185 million tonnes to meet the global net-zero aviation target by 2050. India, with its various kinds of feedstock, including used cooking oil and farm waste, has the potential of producing 8-10 million tonnes annually, he added.

This comes months after Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury mentioned that the aviation industry is likely to miss its carbon emissions target by 2050. Although the aircraft is working on building aircraft that is hydrogen-powered but presently it’s commercially impossible to produce them at scale. This makes SAF a more viable option for a net-zero target.

“I don’t think we are wrong to pursue net zero by 2050…Maybe it’s going to take a bit more time, but let’s not be shy in the ambition,” Airbus CEO had said, according to Bloomberg. To mitigate the emissions, he suggested the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) as an interim solution.

OTTAWA, Ontario, May 28, 2025 — Boeing will invest $17.48 million CAD to strengthen the energy security of Canada and bolster the country’s economic growth. The investments will promote the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and are part of Boeing’s Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) commitment to Canada for its selection of Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon to fulfill its long-range, multi-mission aircraft role.

The investments will support two projects:

$10 million CAD for Project Avanceopens in a new tab

A joint venture between Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables in Port Cartier, Quebec, to convert wood residuals from existing sawmills into a low-carbon intermediate “biocrude” that can be converted into SAF. Project Avance is forecasted to enable future projects in Quebec to produce 10 million gallons (approximately 37,854,000 liters) of unblended SAF annually.

$7.48 million CAD for Dimensional Energyopens in a new tab

The power-to-liquid technology provider will scope scaled development of its pioneering carbon utilization project to convert industrial CO2 emissions into synthetic aviation fuel production. This study will support future projects in North America to convert 500,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions to produce more than 40 million gallons (approximately 151,416,000 liters) of SAF annually.

“This significant investment in SAF production demonstrates our commitment to scaling sustainable aviation fuel and to our work in Canada, where we have driven innovation for over a century,” said Al Meinzinger, president, Boeing Canada. “With 2,000 employees across Canada, Boeing is committed to supporting Canada’s aerospace industry and domestic productivity and advancing exciting new energy innovations.”

“Our proprietary Alder Renewable Crude (ARC) product has enormous potential to fast-track the production of SAF in Canada,” said Darren Fuller, Chief Commercial Officer of Alder Renewables. “The support of Boeing and local government leaders in Quebec is supercharging our commitment to securing a low carbon future for the aviation sector. Close collaboration with our industry partners — Boeing and Bioenergie AECN — coupled with government support is essential to get to the next phase. We’re ready to play our part.”

“Making high performance hydrocarbons is an innovative use for carbon dioxide that turns unwanted waste into valuable fuels and products,” said Jason Salfi, CEO of Dimensional Energy. “This investment from Boeing provides essential predevelopment capital to catalyze projects and scale our proven power-to-liquid technology to market now.”

“Boeing’s investments in Quebec and British Columbia highlight Canada’s position as a strategic partner of choice in sustainable aviation and will generate high-value jobs and economic growth,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. “The Government of Canada is committed to reducing aviation emissions and reinforcing Canada’s position as a global leader in aerospace innovation.”

The two SAF projects are part of Boeing’s over $280 million CAD investment in Canadian Clean Technology projects through the P-8 ITB program. Boeing investments will advance technologies that have the potential to unlock vast renewable resources and accelerate industries producing low-carbon fuels to meet the rising global demand. SAF has the potential today to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s lifecycle and offers the fastest route to decarbonization in the aviation sector.

The Government of Canada announced its decision to acquire the P-8A Poseidon aircraft in November 2023 as part of the Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project. These Boeing CMMA ITB investments build on more than $2 billion in P-8 contracts with Canadian companies to date, contributing to economic growth across the country. The purchase will generate benefits of nearly $358 CAD million annually in economic output to Canada, according to an independent study by Ottawa-based Doyletech Corporation.

Customized options for more sustainable flying with SAF

The Lufthansa Group offers several special fares for corporate customers: With the “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare”, business customers can offset up to 30% of the CO₂ emissions calculated for their individual flight through the use of SAF in flight operations. The Lufthansa Group also offers companies the opportunity to invest in larger quantities of SAF through SAF bulk deals.

Background: The use of SAF in the Lufthansa Group

There is no refueling of individual flights with pure SAF. As a so-called ""drop-in"" fuel, SAF is compatible with fossil kerosene and can be blended with it without any problems. Before being transported to the airport, SAF is blended with fossil jet fuel or produced in a process known as co-processing (joint processing of biogenic residues with fossil oil) and then fed into the airport infrastructure. The Lufthansa Group ensures that the amount of SAF required to offset individual CO2 emissions is fed into the Lufthansa Group's flight operations within six months of purchase. Over its entire life cycle, the SAF from biogenic residues used by the Lufthansa Group has a CO2 footprint that is around 80 percent lower than that of conventional kerosene made from fossil crude oil.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Lufthansa_June25_1bba5e7acd.jpg,N,,2025-06-26 00:59:14.232797

In the fall of 2014, she began her Ph.D. in industrial management at Cambridge’s Institute for Manufacturing.
“In my Ph.D., I studied start-ups encouraging healthier, more sustainable food consumption,” she said.","We need carbon for everything. It’s critical for fuel, but it also has applications in construction, manufacturing, even textiles.

Literally billions of tons of carbon sit in our atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), contributing to rising global temperatures and just waiting to be converted into something useful.

What if CO2 could be taken out of the atmosphere, and converted into fuel? Kirsten Van Fossen, S.B. ‘12, is trying to answer that question. She’s a postdoctoral research fellow at the Magda Barecka Lab at Northeastern University, where they’re using electrochemistry to convert CO2 into ethanol, an intermediary in the synthesis of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“There’s a lot of discussion around decarbonization, but more accurately this technology should be considered ‘defossilization,’” said van Fossen. “This is really a technology that can move us away from the reliance on fossil fuels as a source of carbon.”

Van Fossen’s research is the culmination of the last 15-plus years of her life, going all the way back to her time as an environmental science and engineering concentrator at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). It taps into the lessons she learned about sustainability, entrepreneurship and tech commercialization as a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and then as a department head at the foodservice data start-up Galley. And it draws on her government work with the U.S. Department of Transportation, where she was part of the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center and worked on SAF and alternative aviation fuel projects over a decade ago.

“I just feel like it’s all coming together in this opportunity working with the Barecka Lab,” she said. “I’m very drawn to the world of start-ups, building things from scratch.”

FROM BOATING TO BRAZIL

A national-caliber rower as a high school student in New Jersey, Van Fossen chose Harvard in part because of the appeal of rowing on the Charles River every day. While always planning to study engineering, she didn’t know which discipline before she got here.

“I understood that at Harvard, I could explore multiple disciplines,” she said. “Engineering was a good fit for me. It combined my passion for math and science, my love for working in a team, and gave me plenty of hands-on experience. At Harvard I became aware of the issues of climate change, the urgency, and I saw environmental engineering as the discipline that would set me up for having the most impact.”

A SEAS class on environmental chemistry and an MIT class in which she built a light sensor for a device that concentrates solar energy were some of the early experiences that convinced van Fossen that environmental engineering was the right choice. But it was her senior thesis that would prove life-changing. She designed an electrochemical filter for drinking water, and while in the lab was introduced to a visiting professor from the Universidade de São Paulo. After graduating, that professor invited her to continue her research and work on a water reuse and recycling project with him in Brazil.

“In my work in Brazil, I visited a lot of industrial sites,” she said. “That’s also what I was around as a child. My father worked at a small business called Van-Air & Hydraulics, and I remember visiting the workshop there. It was in Brazil where I started thinking about applying to graduate school.”

START-UPS AND SUSTAINABILITY

Seeing how Brazilian companies managed water and other resources inspired Van Fossen to dive deeper into the world of sustainable industry and entrepreneurship. In the fall of 2014, she began her Ph.D. in industrial management at Cambridge’s Institute for Manufacturing.

“In my Ph.D., I studied start-ups encouraging healthier, more sustainable food consumption,” she said. “I was exposed to lots of different start-ups, pitched some start-up ideas myself while I was working on my Ph.D., and I kind of caught the start-up bug.”

Within a month of finishing her Ph.D. in late 2018, Van Fossen joined Galley as Head of Customer Success. Working there for over four years, she eventually transitioned to Head of Sustainability and Education at the company, whose platform offered a range of foodservice data solutions, including inventory management, menu planning, nutritional analysisand aspirations to decrease food waste and increase sustainable food practices. When the company decided to withdraw focus on those aspirations, Kirsten moved on.

“I joined Galley as the seventh employee. In my tenure there, we grew to over a hundred people working at the organization,” she said. “I saw what it looks like for a start-up to grow rapidly, and what it takes to build up a company.”

NEW USES FOR CO2

Van Fossen has been at the Barecka Lab since November 2024. Her research draws on not only the hard science of her undergraduate days, but also the industry and entrepreneurial experiences she’s had since then. One of her major focus areas is the eventual commercialization of this technology, as well the market for other potential products that could be synthesized with the Barecka Lab’s patented technology. The lab is partially funded from a grant from the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, with a goal of bringing the air-to-ethanol technology to market.

“I love that I can draw on that hard science background that I got from Harvard. The math, chemistry, physics that I got to study in engineering, it’s all so beautiful and practical,” she said. “With the core curriculum, I got the base that I needed to navigate lots of different work contexts. I’ve had federal government experience, academic experience, start-up experience, and I really think that base came from the work I did at Harvard.”",https://seas.harvard.edu/themes/custom/seas/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-25 20:01:49.909363

With sustainability taking a seat at the table in all our board rooms, companies need quick wins with measurable impact. Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is rapidly gaining attention with businesses whose M.O. involves regular air travel. The Film and TV industry particularly. But how impactful is SAF, and is it the environmental panacea we’ve all been hoping for?

What Exactly Is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. It’s incredible to think that these raw, organic materials - namely the waste from gardening, catering, sewage processing, paper making and bin collecting - can produce fuel to power aircraft. These natural by-products are processed to create a fuel with significantly reduced environmental impact over its lifecycle, compared to its fossil-based predecessors.

The Truth About CO2

When burned, SAF creates similar levels of carbon dioxide to conventional aviation fuels. The difference is that the CO2 produced is already part of the carbon cycle - not extracted from the ground specifically for creating aviation fuel. Fossil fuels increase the overall level of CO2 by releasing carbon that had been previously locked away underground. In contrast, SAF recycles the CO2 which is absorbed by the vegetation from which it is made.

According to the International Air Transport Association, IATA, the CO2 absorbed by during the growth of the original plant materials is roughly in balance with the amount produced by using the fuel. This would make SAF carbon neutral, but it must be acknowledged that some emissions are released during the production process, due to transportation and refining methods.

The Good News

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is already accelerating progress towards a net zero future. Not only can it use existing fuel infrastructure in getting to airports, it’s safe to use in current aircraft. SAF can be blended easily with traditional jet fuel and used without modifying the existing engines. Most importantly, simply by using SAF, lifecycle emissions can be reduced by up to 80%.

The IATA estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions the aviation sector needs to reach its 2050 net zero goals. When you factor in the role aviation plays in film and television productions - not just to transport people to shoot locations but equipment, replacement props and parts, never mind the promotional tours, factoring SAF into your plans will result in significant impact.

Making It Work For You

The inconvenient truth here is that, currently, there isn’t enough SAF to fuel the world’s commercial airlines for even a single day. So, in the spirit of partnership, Air Partner has teamed up with Delta Airlines who has already invested significantly in SAF for their own fleet, and who actively lobby for access to more sustainable, affordable fuels for all. When your travel team books a flight with Air Partner, they’ll be offered the option of purchasing SAF environmental attributes – a super-easy way to claim carbon reductions against the emissions footprint of your own flight. The exact quantity needed is calculated, and the cost added seamlessly onto your flight booking.

This means that your company gives back by being “allocated” the SAF environmental attributes associated with the actual SAF that is loaded into Delta Air Lines infrastructure and used within their network. You have essentially bought the right to “claim” the emissions reduction associated with this physical SAF’s use.

Measuring Your Impact

Evolving legislation means that we all have to prove our impact with verified data. And rightly so to avoid greenwashing. That’s why a SAF Certificate will be issued to you, detailing the specifics of the physical SAF associated with your environmental attributes. It confirms your ownership of these attributes and the emission reductions they represent and can support any related claims you make in that all-important impact reporting.

What About Carbon Offsetting?

(June 25, 2025) — Today, the Michigan Senate passed bipartisan legislation to help launch the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Michigan. Sponsored by Senate Majority Floor Leader Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Sen. Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe), Senate Bills 235–36 would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of SAF — a move that would support Michigan’s farmers and economy while reducing the state’s carbon footprint.

“It has been an exciting process to partner with my colleagues across the aisle and across the chamber on this legislation, which not only aims to support Michigan farmers but — in continuing what was outlined in the Clean Energy Future plan — would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,” said Sen. Singh. “This legislation will open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the connection between our agricultural sector and the state’s energy goals.”

SAF is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced using bio-renewable products like ethanol or diesel, which are manufactured from crops like soybeans or corn. By providing a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce, or blend sustainable aviation fuel, this legislation would directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning, ethanol-derived aviation fuels. Additional incentives are available if greater emissions reductions are reached. There is a maximum incentive cap of $4.5 million annually in the first year, and $9 million each year after.

“Access to sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” said Sen. Bellino. “I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.

The coalition includes Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR); NATSO, representing travel centers and truck stops; American Trucking Associations (ATA); Illinois Soybean Growers; National Energy & Fuels Institute (NEFI); SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel Marketers; and the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).

Equalizing the value of the credit between over-the-road biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was an important policy improvement. Creating SAF parity would be an important step to leveling the playing field and mitigating the ongoing problem of SAF displacing gallons of over-the-road biomass-based diesel rather than gallons of petroleum.

Another important policy improvement from the House version was the extension of transferability of the credit to all seven years of the program. Without transferability, most biomass-based diesel producers would not have access to the credit at all.

Finally, biomass-based diesel producers are glad to see that the removal of Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) stayed in the Senate version. After 20 years of predictions of ILUC from biofuels, the modeled ILUC results were never observed and certainly not scientifically agreed upon.

We applaud these policy improvements and call for them to remain in the final version that Congress passes. We especially want to thank Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and biomass-based diesel champion Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), and other members of the Finance Committee for their hard work.

While these improvements make '45Z' a much more workable policy from the original law passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the amendments do not take effect until 2026. The expiration of the blenders' tax credit in January and the lack of implementing regulations for '45Z' have put the biomass-based diesel industry in great peril. The industry is all but shut down for all of 2025 and will continue to be for at least the rest of the year unless there is some transitional short-term policy measure to turn the plants back on and provide a bridge to '45Z' in 2026. We have called for a streamlined version of the blenders' tax credit for the rest of 2025 to be that bridge. Without such a bridge, most biomass-based diesel producers will not survive to 2026. At a time of dangerous conflict in the Persian Gulf, America needs all of the domestic energy it can get.

As global aviation accelerates its shift to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Africa is struggling to keep pace due to prohibitive costs and limited infrastructure. The continent has only five SAF projects and a projected production capacity of just 0.6 million tonnes by 2030.

This leaves Africa sidelined in the industry’s green transition, as SAF currently costs two to three times more than conventional jet fuel—a burden that most African airlines cannot bear without substantial financial support. Jet fuel in Africa averages 17% more expensive than elsewhere, with taxes, fees, and financing costs also significantly higher. Despite these challenges, African air traffic is projected to double to 345 million passengers by 2043; yet, intra-African connectivity remains underdeveloped and dominated by non-African carriers.

Africa World Airlines Announces Fare Reductions and New Route

Africa World Airlines (AWA) will reduce airfares by the end of June 2025, aiming to make air travel more accessible. The airline, known for its strong safety record, also announced the launch of direct flights from Accra to Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, starting July 1, 2025. This new route is expected to enhance trade and partnerships between Ghana and Burkina Faso, offering passengers significant time savings and competitive fares starting at $290.

South African Airways Expands Domestic and Regional Network

South African Airways continues rebuilding its network post-restructuring, with plans to launch and revive several domestic and cross-border routes. The airline will resume flights to George and East London and relaunch the Durban–Cape Town route. Internationally, SAA will commence service between Johannesburg and Gaborone (Botswana) in October and introduce a seasonal route between Cape Town and Mauritius in November 2025. The pace of expansion is contingent upon aircraft availability, as SAA continues to rebuild its fleet following the resumption of operations in 2021.

The aviation industry is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and as air travel continues to grow, so does its environmental impact. In response, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has implemented the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to mitigate these emissions. A crucial component of CORSIA is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which has the potential to significantly reduce the industry's carbon footprint. This article provides a comprehensive guide to CORSIA and SAF standards, covering regulations, compliance, and industry impact.

Overview of CORSIA and its Objectives

CORSIA is a global market-based measure aimed at offsetting CO2 emissions from international aviation. Its primary objective is to stabilize emissions at 2020 levels by promoting the use of SAF and offsetting emissions through carbon credits. CORSIA applies to international flights, and its implementation is divided into three phases: pilot (2021-2023), first (2024-2026), and second (2027-2035).

Importance of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels, made from renewable resources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste. SAF can reduce lifecycle CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The use of SAF is critical to achieving CORSIA's emissions reduction goals and is considered a key strategy for the aviation industry to reduce its environmental impact.

Brief History and Development of CORSIA and SAF Standards

The development of CORSIA and SAF standards has been a collaborative effort between ICAO, governments, and industry stakeholders. CORSIA was adopted by the ICAO Assembly in 2016, and its standards and recommended practices (SARPs) were developed over the subsequent years. The first batch of CORSIA-eligible SAF pathways was approved in 2020, marking a significant milestone in the development of SAF standards.

CORSIA Regulations and Compliance

Detailed Explanation of CORSIA Regulations

CORSIA regulations require airlines to monitor, report, and verify (MRV) their CO2 emissions from international flights. The regulations also establish a framework for offsetting emissions through the purchase of carbon credits. The CORSIA MRV system is based on three main components:

Emissions monitoring: Airlines must monitor their CO2 emissions using approved methodologies.

Emissions reporting: Airlines must report their emissions to their respective states and to ICAO.

Emissions verification: Emissions reports must be verified by an independent third-party auditor.

The following flowchart illustrates the CORSIA MRV process:

Emissions Monitoring

Offsetting Emissions

Compliance Requirements for Airlines and Aviation Operators

Airlines and aviation operators must comply with CORSIA regulations by:

Monitoring and reporting their CO2 emissions

Verifying their emissions reports

Offsetting their emissions through the purchase of carbon credits

Maintaining accurate records and submitting reports to their respective states and to ICAO

The compliance requirements for CORSIA are outlined in the following table:

Compliance Requirement Description Emissions Monitoring Monitor CO2 emissions using approved methodologies Emissions Reporting Report emissions to respective states and to ICAO Emissions Verification Verify emissions reports through independent third-party audit Offsetting Emissions Offset emissions through purchase of carbon credits

Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) Processes

The MRV process is critical to ensuring the integrity of CORSIA. The process involves:

Emissions monitoring: Airlines use approved methodologies to monitor their CO2 emissions.

Emissions reporting: Airlines report their emissions to their respective states and to ICAO.

Emissions verification: Emissions reports are verified by an independent third-party auditor.

Production and Supply Chain Considerations for SAF

The production and supply chain for SAF are critical to its adoption. SAF can be produced from a variety of feedstocks, including waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste. The supply chain for SAF must be carefully managed to ensure that it is sustainable and environmentally beneficial.

The following table outlines the key considerations for SAF production and supply chain:

Consideration Description Feedstock Sourcing Ensure feedstocks are sustainably sourced Production Process Optimize production process for efficiency and emissions reduction Supply Chain Management Manage supply chain to ensure sustainability and environmental benefits

Current Challenges and Future Prospects for SAF Adoption

Despite its potential, SAF adoption faces several challenges, including high production costs and limited supply. However, as demand for SAF increases and production technologies improve, costs are expected to decrease, making SAF more competitive with conventional jet fuel.

The future prospects for SAF adoption are promising, with many airlines and aviation operators committing to using SAF. Governments and industry stakeholders are also working together to promote the development and use of SAF.

Industry Impact and Future Directions

Economic and Environmental Impacts of CORSIA and SAF on the Aviation Industry

CORSIA and SAF are expected to have significant economic and environmental impacts on the aviation industry. The use of SAF is expected to reduce the industry's carbon footprint, while CORSIA is expected to promote the development and use of SAF.

The economic impacts of CORSIA and SAF will depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of SAF and the price of carbon credits. However, the adoption of SAF is expected to create new economic opportunities in the aviation industry, including the development of new supply chains and production facilities.

Opportunities for Innovation and Growth in Sustainable Aviation

CORSIA and SAF present opportunities for innovation and growth in sustainable aviation. The development and use of SAF are expected to drive innovation in production technologies and supply chain management.

The following diagram illustrates the opportunities for innovation and growth in sustainable aviation:

Future Directions for CORSIA and SAF Standards

The future directions for CORSIA and SAF standards will be shaped by a variety of factors, including technological advancements, economic considerations, and environmental goals. ICAO will continue to play a critical role in promoting the development and use of SAF and in ensuring the integrity of CORSIA.

As the aviation industry continues to evolve, CORSIA and SAF will remain critical components of its efforts to reduce its environmental impact.

Conclusion

In conclusion, CORSIA and SAF are critical components of the aviation industry's efforts to reduce its environmental impact. The use of SAF is expected to play a key role in achieving CORSIA's emissions reduction goals, and the development and use of SAF are expected to drive innovation and growth in sustainable aviation.

“A lot of global consumption is going to be underpinned by the mandates in Europe and the United Kingdom,” said Fabricio Cardoso, principal at Argus Consulting.

Both of those regions introduced two per cent SAF mandates in 2025 and will be driving global demand going forward, he said during a recent webinar hosted by the company.

Field scouting advised for physiological leaf spot

Scouting for physiological leaf spot in the coming weeks is critical now that that the crop disease has been confirmed in winter wheat fields in southern Alberta.

Alfonso Berrocal, business development manager for oil products with Argus, estimates that the European Union and U.K. mandates will generate 1.5 to 1.7 million tonnes of demand in 2025.

The EU mandate remains at two per cent for the first five years and then moves to six per cent.

The U.K. mandate is more ambitious in the short-term, growing to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040.

However, the EU mandate is bigger in the long-term, climbing to 20 per cent by 2035 and 70 per cent by 2050.

Lindsey Liu, senior Argus analyst covering the Chinese biofuel market, said the Asia Pacific region is a bit behind the EU and U.K., but mandates are coming.

Japan is targeting a 10 per cent SAF mandate by 2030.

Singapore will go to one per cent by 2026, rising to three to five per cent by 2030.

Thailand’s is one per cent by 2026, climbing to three per cent by 2030.

India will have a one per cent SAF mandate on international flights by 2027, rising to five per cent by 2030.

China has no national mandate. Instead, it has set a 50,000 tonne SAF target for 2025 that will be met through airport level blend targets for select airlines at key airports in Beijing, Chengdu, Zhengshou and Ningbo.

Indonesia has a 2.5 per cent target for 2030, while Malaysia and South Korea have one per cent targets.

Australia has no planned mandate, but one is likely coming with the re-election of the Labor government in May.

Liu said there are SAF proposals in most of the major markets in the Asia Pacific region, but there is still considerable policy uncertainty, which is leaving producers wary.

“A lack of firm policy support in most countries in the region is slowing development of the sector and causing timelines of many planned projects to be postponed,” she said.

There are close to 50 announced projects in the region, but many are a long way from producing.

Matthew Cope, American biofuel reporter for Argus, said the SAF supply and demand situation is much further behind in North America.

“This market is far less developed than what we’re seeing in Europe and Asia,” he said.

It is a market that will be driven by tax credits rather than mandates.

Producers are still awaiting clarity on the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, which will pay up to US$1.75 per gallon for SAF.

Cardoso said when it’s all added up, there will be about 15 billion litres of annual global demand by 2030 and 30 billion litres by 2035.

However, there is a big caveat.

“Obviously, any mandate coming from China could have a massive impact on overall demand,” he said.

As it sits, there will be more global capacity than demand until 2035 when demand finally surpasses capacity.

And that is only using projects that are under construction or have achieved a final investment decision.

If you factor in “very provisional” proposed plants that have not secured financing, the capacity far outstrips demand well beyond 2035.

The burning question for many in the agriculture sector is — what feedstock will be used to make the jet fuel?

“We would expect SAF to be coming primarily from UCO (used cooking oil),” said Cardosa.

However, there won’t be enough UCO to supply the sector by the time the EU achieves its 20 per cent mandate by 2035.

A wide assortment of feedstocks will be needed by that time.",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/25105151/147902_web1_2019-10-20T000000Z_1719650286_MT1NURPHO000INDKSZ_RTRMADP_3_ENGLAND-AIRPORT.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 15:10:26.749165

Brazil's E30, B15 blends to start 1 Aug

Sao Paulo, 25 June (Argus) — Brazilian regulators have approved an increase in ethanol and biodiesel blending into fossil fuels effective 1 August. In a meeting of the mines and energy ministry and national energy policy council CNPE the government decided to move forward with an increase in ethanol blending rates into gasoline to 30pc to make E30, and blend 15pc biodiesel into diesel to create B15. CNPE is evaluating the feasibility of raising ethanol blends to a 22-35pc range and biodiesel blends to a 13-25pc range, mines and energy ministry's biofuels department director Marlon Arraes said during Argus ' Biofuels & Feedstocks Latin America Conference, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The fuel of the future program, introduced to the Congress on September 2023, spurred more than R53bn ($9.6bn) of investments in biodiesel to achieve a 25pc mix by 2026, as well as R24bn invested in ethanol to reach a 35pc blend that same year, Arraes said. Investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) through advanced geological techniques reached R140bn, while investments in biomethane and products such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel reached bring that total up to R260bn. Cost competitiveness, feedstock supply risks and regulatory instability remain hurdles to a wider biofuel framework in Brazil, he said. The fuel of the future program avoided 705mn metric tonnes (t) of CO2 equivalent, Arraes said, mostly from CCUS and biodiesel investments. ""We need to engage in our way to produce biofuels and sustainable energy to deliver to society the cheapest decarbonization that we can"", he added.

European middle distillates fall to pre-conflict levels

London, 25 June (Argus) — Gains in European jet fuel and diesel prices caused by the Israel-Iran conflict have entirely reversed following this week's ceasefire agreement. Front-month Ice gasoil futures — the underlying value in Argus ' European middle distillate assessments — sank to $688.25/t at close on Tuesday, 24 June, the day of the ceasefire. This was the contract's lowest settlement since 12 June, the last close before the conflict began. The contract fell by $75/t on the day on Tuesday, the largest single-day decline in 31 months. Benchmark crude basket North Sea Dated dropped by around 11pc to $68.06/bl on Tuesday, its lowest closing value since 11 June. Ice gasoil values rose to $798.50/t on 19 June, as the conflict raised fears of weaker supply from the Mideast Gulf, particularly for middle distillates. The region accounted for just under 25pc of Europe's jet fuel and diesel imports last year, according to Kpler and Vortexa. Tensions rose just as seasonal demand for jet fuel and diesel neared an annual peak in Europe, with the region relying on imports to meet demand. Market participants said the price rises were excessive, considering there had been no disruption to supply. European refining margins have also fallen, reflecting middle distillate prices' heavier falls than those for crude. Delivered cargoes of jet fuel and diesel to northwest Europe held premiums of $21.08/bl and $22.90/bl respectively to Dated, having peaked at $26.82/bl and $28.98/bl on 19 June. Cracks have averaged below $20/bl in recent months. Jet fuel margins could remain elevated in line with seasonal demand, but European diesel supply had tightened before the conflict because of weaker imports and extra demand for marine gasoil (MGO) in the Mediterranean after the start of the emissions control area. This shortness of supply has not yet fully resolved and could further support refining margins in the coming weeks.

Cheaper power key to reach UK’s climate targets

Edinburgh, 24 June (Argus) — The UK's climate plan credibility has improved slightly but no progress has been made to make electricity cheaper, which is key to hit the country's emissions targets, independent advisory body Climate Change Committee (CCC) said in its progress report. The report assesses the UK's progress towards its net zero goals under the current government, which took power in July 2024. The CCC found the UK's 2050 target remains reachable but climate action needs to accelerate, even though policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions have improved. Only half of the 16 key indicators assessed by the CCC, with a relevant benchmark or target, are on track — including offshore and onshore wind operational capacity, sustainable aviation fuel, electric vehicle (EV) charging points and distances travelled by car. EV car sales, heat pump installations, woodland creation and peatland restoration are ""slightly off track"", while the ratio of electricity to gas prices for households and industries is ""significantly off track"", the CCC said. The committee noted no progress has been made on actions to lower the cost of power. The government is planning to consult on this ""in due course"", but CCC urged for actions and timelines. The CCC has identified ""ten priority actions"" for the year ahead, with cutting the cost of electricity for households and businesses again at the top. Cheaper power will support industrial electrification and ""speed up the uptake of clean electric technologies, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles,"" the CCC said. The transition to renewables will eventually reduce the country's reliance on volatile wholesale gas prices, which are the main driver of electricity prices, it said. ""But the government can take immediate action to accelerate this by moving policy costs associated with past schemes, and those that are not directly related to the cost of electricity generation, off electricity bills,"" the CCC said. Removing electricity policy costs — levied on the unit price of electricity at 20 times the rate of gas — would reduce annual electricity bills by £190 ($258) for a typical household with a gas boiler and by £490 for a typical household with a heat pump, CCC found. ""This would bring UK prices into the range of other countries who are ahead on heat pump roll-out,"" it said. The CCC report assessed policy development from July 2024 to 23 May 2025, so does not take into account policies announced in the recent spending review nor the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme intended to reduce electricity costs by up to £40/MWh for more than 7,000 electricity-intensive businesses. UK emissions reached 413.7mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in 2024, including its share of international aviation and shipping, down by 50pc from 1990 and by 2.5pc from 2023, according to the CCC. The year-on-year reductions come mainly from the electricity supply — declining gas generation — and the industry sector. The government will increasingly need to focus on transport, building, agriculture and aviation to reach its emission reduction targets, the CCC said. The report points to encouraging trends in EVs and in heat pump installations, which grew by 56pc on the year, and in woodland creations, but it reiterated action on these fronts must accelerate. Although much of the progress stems from policies set by previous government, the CCC said ""bold policies"" introduced this year are promising, such as removing planning barriers on renewable deployment and the reinstatement of the 2030 phase-out date for gasoline and diesel vehicles. The market share of new EVs increased on the year in 2024, by nearly 20pc. But CCC noted aviation sector emissions are increasing. The share of sustainable aviation fuel increased to 2.1pc last year from 0.7pc in 2023, but a lot more is required to reach the 10pc SAF mandate by 2030.

Brooke Rogachuk

Rogachuk, who was also selected as an Astronaut Scholar in 2024, became only the second OU student to be selected in back-to-back years. She was also recently named a 2025 Goldwater Scholar. Her undergraduate research has focused on sustainable aviation, and she currently works on sustainable aviation fuel implementation for Boom Supersonic.

“Being an Astronaut Scholar has given me connections that will help me throughout my career. Not only did I get a mentor that helped me land my job at Boom Supersonic, but I’ve made friends with so many people that I can reach out to when I need them,” she said.

She credits the opportunity to conduct her own undergraduate research through the Gallogly College of Engineering as a major reason why she was selected two years in a row.

“A lot of my fellow scholars can’t say that they’ve developed their own methodology or developed their own research study. It’s been really amazing to work in Dr. Dai’s lab and study materials science. It’s something that I don’t think I would have been able to do if I had gone anywhere else but OU,” she said.

Huynh, a National Merit Scholar with career ambitions to become a physician-scientist, is currently interning at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Like Rogachuk, she too sees the importance of mentorship.

“A lot of the opportunities that I’ve had are because someone else has shown me what’s possible. That’s why the Astronaut Scholarship stuck out to me. It also reaches students who want to make a difference in their field and make the world a better place,” she said.

Since her freshman year, Huynh has worked on cancer studies in Zhibo Yang’s lab and the OU Health Science Center.

“It’s been really exciting to work on such demanding research, especially since we get to work with real patient samples. That gets me closer to the clinic side and actively helping those in need,” she said. “A lot of my research has been guided by patient outcomes. Ensuring my research decisions are guided towards patient outcomes has been a really rewarding experience.

by Michael McAdams (Advanced Biofuels Association/Real Clear Energy) Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has moved from the margins of energy policy to the forefront of America’s energy future. Once viewed as a long-shot innovation, SAF is now a commercially viable, rapidly scaling solution to power our aviation sector while revitalizing rural economies and advancing our national goals for energy dominance. As SAF production accelerates, Congress and the Trump administration have an opportunity to cement America’s leadership in aviation fuel innovations by extending long-term tax credits that support domestic SAF production.

This sector’s momentum is undeniable. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently reported that SAF production in the U.S. surged from 2,000 barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 25,000 barrels per day by February 2025. As of May, production capacity stands at roughly 30,000 barrels daily, and industry projections suggest we could approach 500,000 barrels per year by the end of 2025.

SAF’s explosive growth is a direct response to policy certainty and strategic investment—but we are only getting started. I recently spoke with Alison Graab, Executive Director of the SAF Coalition, about this issue. She rightly noted, “The biggest barrier we hear from our coalition members is the need for a longer-term market signal for SAF investment.” Without it, this American success story and the promise it offers to our country’s economy risks being outsourced.

That’s because SAF, at its heart, is an innovation and jobs engine. The entire SAF value chain—from feedstock cultivation to production and refining—offers new economic lifelines to American farmers and rural communities. These fuels are derived from a wide variety of sources, including agricultural residues, waste oils, and even woody biomass. SAF development creates stable demand for these materials, opening new revenue streams for growers and foresters. During our conversation, Graab concurred about the significant potential offered by SAF, “There are so many additional benefits that really offer a lot of opportunities to this administration and Congress.” Put simply, SAF can transform America’s heartland into an energy innovation engine.

Global demand for SAF is projected to soar as countries implement mandates and incentives to power their aviation sectors. As I spoke with Graab, she highlighted how the United States is well-positioned to lead, with more production facilities online than any other nation. “We can see the U.S. continue to grow that by helping to export and fulfill what other countries need in addition to the U.S.,” Graab emphasized. This growth offers America an important energy diplomacy tool and a new source of revenue through SAF exports. At a time when many nations are competing to develop cutting edge energy technologies, America’s ability to scale SAF production is a geopolitical advantage we cannot afford to squander.

Fortunately, Congress is awake to this challenge and has already taken an encouraging step in the right direction. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by the U.S. House of Representatives includes an extension of the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit through December 2031. This is exactly the kind of long-term policy signal investors need to deploy capital into SAF projects. Extending this credit is a critical win, but more must follow. We must ensure the SAF-specific tax credit structure remains robust, technology- and feedstock-neutral, and predictable over the next decade.

To deliver on SAF’s promise, policymakers must act boldly. Long-term certainty around 45Z and related credits is the clearest path forward. Equally important is for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to modernize its regulatory treatment of feedstocks like woody biomass to unlock hundreds of millions of gallons of potential fuels. The American SAF industry knows how to scale. We have the infrastructure, we have the feedstocks, and we have the know-how. Now we need Washington to follow through to unleash this potential to advance our American energy dominance agenda.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 15:10:31.040011

The Elixir, equipped with a Turbotech turbine, completed its maiden flight in La Rochelle just ahead of the Paris Air Show. This inaugural flight marks a key step toward a 100% SAF-powered flight scheduled for the end of 2025.

To support this initiative, Elixir Aircraft signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)—a formal agreement outlining the intent to collaborate—with TotalEnergies on June 17, 2025. Under this MoU, TotalEnergies will supply part of the sustainable aviation fuel used during flight testing.

First Flight of the Elixir Turbine in La Rochelle

This milestone is part of the BeautHyFuel project, supported by CORAC (the French Civil Aviation Research Council) and the DGAC. It is led by Elixir Aircraft and Turbotech, in partnership with Safran Aircraft Engines, Daher, and Air Liquide.

Following the first engine start on the aircraft in February 2025, the Elixir “Turbine” completed its maiden flight on June 6, 2025, in La Rochelle. The flight lasted 55 minutes. Since then, the aircraft has entered its flight testing campaign, having already accumulated over five hours and seven test flights.

A 100% SAF-powered flight is scheduled before the end of 2025.

The Elixir Turbine is on display at the Paris Air Show as part of a DGAC exhibit showcasing recent innovations from French aerospace manufacturers aimed at decarbonizing light aviation—many of which are already in active operation.

MoU Signed with TotalEnergies

To support its flight testing program using Jet A-1 SAF, Elixir Aircraft signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TotalEnergies on Tuesday, June 17, 2025, during the Paris Air Show. TotalEnergies will supply part of the sustainable fuel needed for the test flights.

The first phase of testing, beginning this summer, will use a 35% blend of SAF biofuel produced in France by TotalEnergies. A second phase will use 100% SAF by the end of 2025.

“TotalEnergies shares our ambition to develop solutions that help decarbonize the aviation industry. We are thrilled to conduct the Elixir Turbine tests with the support of this leading innovator in aviation fueling,” said Arthur Léopold-Léger, Co-founder and President of Elixir Aircraft.

“We are delighted to support Elixir Aircraft with the supply of sustainable aviation fuel for its flight tests. SAF plays an essential role in decarbonising the aviation sector and this agreement demonstrates our ability to support our customers in reducing their CO₂ emissions,” said Louise Tricoire, SVP Aviation & Marine Fuel at TotalEnergies.

The Elixir: A 4th Generation Aircraft, Made in France

The Elixir is a 4th-generation aircraft featuring a streamlined all-composite Carbon OneShot airframe, composed of only nine parts—no rivets, no glue. This innovative technology offers exceptional structural integrity, enhanced safety, simplified maintenance, and a lighter weight—resulting in lower fuel consumption compared to traditional 2nd-generation metal or 3rd-generation semi-composite aircraft. Thanks to its advanced structure and low fuel usage of just 12 litres per hour, the Elixir is the most environmentally efficient aircraft in its category.

With an order book of 300 units—mostly for export—the Elixir has been adopted by private flight schools such as Airbus Flight Academy and Leading Edge Aviation, and was recently selected by ENAC (École Nationale de l’Aviation Civile).

A Future-Proof, Fuel-Agnostic Aircraft

While Elixir Aircraft chose the reliable Rotax engine to meet today’s flight school requirements, the company remains focused on advancing sustainable aviation technologies:

Its current production of ultra-efficient piston-engine aircraft, running on unleaded fuel, already reduces CO₂ emissions by 70%.

The development of the Turbotech TP-R90 turbine prototype, designed to run on sustainable aviation fuel, will achieve an 85% reduction in CO₂ emissions.

With stronger measures, the UK can not only achieve its legally binding climate targets but also boost energy security for homes and businesses nationwide.
Without tougher policy and real investment in sustainable fuels, airport expansions and weak carbon pricing will put climate targets and industry leadership at real risk.
The government should take urgent action to tackle non-CO2 emissions as highlighted in the report and start properly charging for international aviation emissions.
The report highlights that in shipping recent IMO decisions on fuel standards and emissions pricing have improved shipping’s outlook for meeting climate targets.","The Climate Change Committee (CCC) has today published its first assessment of the new Labour Government’s progress on reducing emissions. The independent statutory body reports that, while government policies have improved over the past year, further urgent action is still required. With stronger measures, the UK can not only achieve its legally binding climate targets but also boost energy security for homes and businesses nationwide.

Anna Krajinska, UK Director T&E said, ‘The UK’s transport sector is at a crossroads. To keep net-zero targets within reach, we need immediate action: maintain the ZEV mandate, set a clear path to phase out diesel HGVs, and accelerate investment in sustainable aviation fuels. This must be coupled with comprehensive pricing for fossil fuel use in shipping and aviation to drive forward the switch to clean alternatives.Now is the time for bold policy, not more flexibilities or delays’

For cars, with flexibilities on the rise, CCC reports that the ZEV mandate risks shifting from ‘slightly off track’ to ‘significantly off track’—if carmakers exploit flexibilities. T&E’s analysis shows that the recent changes risk a cliff edge in 2030 with carmakers potentially having to sell an impossible over 100% ZEV to make up for excessive borrowing. To reduce this risk the government must ensure regulatory certainty and a robust industrial strategy to support domestic manufacturing and stay competitive.

T&E UK is also calling for urgent government action to complement new infrastructure investment. While the confirmation of 54 new zero-emission HGV charging hubs by Innovate UK is a positive step, the UK Government has still not established a clear regulatory mandate to drive the uptake of zero-emission heavy goods vehicles, and ensure the phase-out of diesel HGVs by 2040. Without a robust policy mechanism—such as a ZEV-HGV mandate—the UK risks falling short of its net-zero transport targets, leaving industry and investors without the certainty needed to accelerate the transition to cleaner freight

In aviation, according to the CCC, emissions now outpace the UK’s entire electricity sector. Without tougher policy and real investment in sustainable fuels, airport expansions and weak carbon pricing will put climate targets and industry leadership at real risk. The government should take urgent action to tackle non-CO2 emissions as highlighted in the report and start properly charging for international aviation emissions.

The report highlights that in shipping recent IMO decisions on fuel standards and emissions pricing have improved shipping’s outlook for meeting climate targets. However, T&E’s analysis shows that the IMO regulation only covers 20% of UK emissions and further action by the UK government is needed to meet climate targets. This should include the expansion of the UK Emission Trading Scheme to include international shipping.",https://www.transportenvironment.org/uploads/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/pexels-alexeydemidov-10658552.jpg?mtime=1750840764,N,,2025-06-25 16:08:04.678515

,,2025-06-25 12:34:42+00:00,www.agri-pulse.com,Senate changes to 45Z tax credit could hinder SAF growth - Agri-Pulse,Rebekah Alvey,,,,,https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/23108-senate-changes-to-45z-could-hider-growth-in-saf,"However, the 45Z credit has significant support from Republicans representing the agriculture sector.
SAF value lowered in Senate proposal While the House bill does not explicitly mention SAF, the Senate proposal suggests lowering the maximum value of the credit for SAF from $1.75 per gallon to $1.
The 45Z credit was intended to build off those developments and support options that would reduce carbon intensity.
“Today what matters is carbon intensity and innovation,” Fitzgerald said of the 45Z credit value model.
Under the Senate proposal, ethanol producers can claim the 45Z credit for themselves rather than selling their fuel to an alcohol-to-jet SAF producer, which could undermine growth, Cooper explained.","Treatment of sustainable aviation fuel under the 45Z tax credit for clean fuel producers in the Senate GOP budget reconciliation could be detrimental for the domestic market, sources say.

Both the House-passed reconciliation bill, and the proposal by the Senate Finance Committee would preserve 45Z and extend it through 2031, a win for many across the biofuel spectrum. But key differences between the two proposals could have a major impact on the SAF space.

Senators hope to vote on the final reconciliation bill and return it to the House later this week. Until then, senators are debating key provisions of reconciliation, including 45Z and SAF.

The clean fuel production credit is one of the few Inflation Reduction Act credits preserved in this reconciliation. Credits like those to support electric vehicles, clean electricity and clean hydrogen production were cut or will be phased out.

Upon returning from meetings at the White House Monday night, some senators reported that President Donald Trump wanted the entirety of the IRA cut. However, the 45Z credit has significant support from Republicans representing the agriculture sector.

Leaving a GOP conference Monday night, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said the Senate Finance Committee's 45Z provision was still under discussion. Leaders indicated in the meeting that they plan to continue the path of the draft released last week. But Moran noted there’s no final text.

Ahead of the final text, SAF and farm groups are pushing the Senate to adjust pieces of the 45Z provision.

In a letter obtained by Agri-Pulse, 37 farm groups urged Senate Finance members to move toward the House proposal for disincentivizing foreign feedstocks instead of the Senate proposed model.

Under the House reconciliation bill, the credit could only apply to fuels made with feedstocks from the U.S., Canada or Mexico. The Senate version would cut the value of the credit by 20% if the fuel uses feedstocks grown outside the U.S., which farm groups worry is less effective in making domestic feedstocks competitive.

SAF value lowered in Senate proposal

While the House bill does not explicitly mention SAF, the Senate proposal suggests lowering the maximum value of the credit for SAF from $1.75 per gallon to $1. This puts it on the same level as other road fuels like ethanol and renewable diesel.

This cut would be a challenge for the SAF industry given it’s an opt-in fuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard and Low Carbon Fuel Standard programs, Tom Miller, who leads biofuels regulatory affairs for energy giant BP, said on a webinar. This means SAF is starting at a disadvantage in comparison to road fuels. The increased credit value under 45Z was an important incentive for SAF project development.

Renewable diesel production and SAF production have similar economics. However, Bruce Fleming, CEO of Montana Renewables, said that without a premium, producers are less compelled to produce SAF.

“People won't bear the working capital cost. People won't bear the transportation costs and the headaches absent a premium,” Fleming said. “That can come from policy support, that can come from the market, that can come from early adopters, that can come from countries with mandates.”

Unlike road fuels, SAF producers have to build new infrastructure in the U.S., said Lindsay Fitzgerald, chief advocacy and communications officer at Gevo.

Fitzgerald said the biodiesel blenders tax credit was effective at getting many road fuels on a level playing field by supporting the development of blending infrastructure. The 45Z credit was intended to build off those developments and support options that would reduce carbon intensity.

“Today what matters is carbon intensity and innovation,” Fitzgerald said of the 45Z credit value model. “That’s what this program is rewarding.”

If the Senate proposal isn't changed, Fitzgerald said some refineries could convert to renewable diesel. But without the added incentive, the SAF market is likely to stall. This lowered credit could specifically hinder ethanol to jet facilities, Fitzgerald said.

Lower credit could slow industry growth

SAF is one space in which the ethanol and corn industry see some promise, particularly given consumer demand and the push for sustainability across the globe. But it’s going to take time for the industry, particularly the ethanol-to-jet sector, to scale up, said Matt Ziegler, biofuel policy lead for the National Corn Growers Association.

“Knocking down the value of that credit by 75 cents is certainly detrimental in our eyes,"" he said.

Shortly after the Senate text was released, Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, said he could see the credit reduction becoming an impediment to making the fuel competitive or potentially slowing further investment.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, echoed concerns about the reduction in the value for SAF under the Senate proposal. He said the original structuring of 45Z presented challenges for alcohol-to-jet production, but cutting the credit will make that even harder.

Under the Senate proposal, ethanol producers can claim the 45Z credit for themselves rather than selling their fuel to an alcohol-to-jet SAF producer, which could undermine growth, Cooper explained.

“If Congress envisioned 45Z helping to drive growth in sustainable aviation fuel and really open the door for alcohol-to-jet made from corn ethanol, we’re not sure that limiting 45Z to $1 for SAF is going to accomplish that goal,” Cooper said.

The SAF industry backs some features, including extension through 2031. The sector has long called for a longer runway for the credit to provide market certainty and encourage investment. This extension is likely to provide that, particularly for independent developers, Miller said.

The Senate version does not phase out transferability for the credit. The House version does. Preserving transferability does add cost but is a win for both renewable road fuels and SAF.

“We have to have it,” said Fleming of Montana Renewables of transferability. “Nobody’s going to operate without it.”

Before the IRA, it was not possible to sell and buy credits. Instead, a producer could allocate credits to an investor through partnership allocation rules. But this was a complex and burdensome process, said Sue Moon, an associate at King and Spalding. Even though the transferability rules are still complex, it was quickly adopted by many producers.",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/California-Bureau/sustainable-aviation-fuel-836x627.jpg?height=635&t=1749433164&width=1200,N,,2025-06-25 09:02:51.539372

Wizz Air has once again proven its commitment to environmental sustainability, clinching the title of “Most Sustainable Low-Cost Airline” at the prestigious 2025 World Finance Sustainability Awards. This remarkable achievement marks the airline’s fifth consecutive win in this category, further solidifying its leadership role in driving sustainability within the aviation sector. As the aviation industry intensifies its focus on environmental responsibility, Wizz Air’s consistent recognition highlights its pivotal role in shaping the future of eco-friendly air travel.

The World Finance Sustainability Awards, known for recognizing businesses that make significant strides toward environmental and social sustainability, awarded Wizz Air this prestigious title based on its outstanding performance in several key areas. The award decision was determined by a panel of judges, who used advanced AI-powered research tools to assess airlines worldwide for their efforts in promoting sustainability, carbon reduction, and innovation. In this highly competitive landscape, Wizz Air stood out for its exceptional contributions to reducing the environmental impact of air travel.

One of the cornerstones of Wizz Air’s ongoing sustainability initiatives is its active involvement in the Alliance for Zero Emission Aviation (AZEA).
