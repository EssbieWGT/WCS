Kennedy International Airport (JFK). To make this happen, the airline has entered partnership with multiple stakeholders to ensure a constant fuel supply.

Regular supply of SAF

JetBlue has announced the first-ever regular supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the New York region at JFK Airport. The airline says that this has been made possible through various corporate business partners that help cover the premium over regular jet fuel. Ursula Hurley, chief financial officer, JetBlue, commented,

“JFK has been JetBlue’s home for 25 years, and our operations here should set the standard we envision for our entire network. Thank you to the many teams and partners who have helped make this possible. Incorporating SAF into our flights is an important lever in decarbonizing the aviation industry and expanding its availability to our Northeast airports is a big step.”

JetBlue has taken initiatives in recent times to further its commitment to a sustainable aviation sector. In December 2024, the airline announced that its TrueBlue and Mosaic passengers who purchase $100 of SAF contributions online will earn one tile.

The carrier said that nearly 90% of the contributions were allocated toward its purchase of SAF and/or blended SAF products. With a limit of $1,000, TrueBlue passengers could receive 10 tiles. The offer was available until December 31.

Making it possible

The current consistent supply of SAF in New York is being done by a careful strategy of fuel production and delivery. According to JetBlue’s official statement, Diamond Green Diesel LLC—a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and Darling Ingredients Inc. affiliate — produces the fuel and Valero then blends it with conventional jet fuel to create blended SAF.

This is then delivered by World Fuel via existing jet fuel distribution infrastructure where it is claimed by JetBlue for use in their fleet at JFK Airport. Brad Hurwitz, senior vice president, supply and trading, World Fuel Services, commented,

“Working with JetBlue and Valero to bring blended SAF to one of our largest airport locations supports our ambition at World Fuel to grow a consistent supply network for SAF on the U.S. East Coast. This collaboration enhances our ability to provide regular sustainable aviation fuel and improves access to lower carbon fuels for our aviation customers.”

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National Renewable Energy Lab first explored the possibility of delivering sustainable aviation fuel to the New York region in a 2021 study.

The latest development has also made Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole quite happy. He said that they are proud to collaborate with JetBlue on the use of SAF at John F. Kennedy International Airport and that it is leading by example through its work on safe SAF delivery to regional airports and promoting sustainable air travel.

Long way to go

Airlines are gradually increasing their SAF usage and signing purchase deals to achieve their goals. For example, Air New Zealand announced its largest purchase of sustainable aviation fuel in December, securing the supply of 30 million liters (7.9 million US gallons).

The same month, United Airlines, too, signed an agreement with energy company Phillips 66 for the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

However, the production rate for SAF is still significantly low to make any meaningful impact. In 2024, SAF accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel.

Director of IATA, General Willie Walsh says that “SAF volumes are increasing, but disappointingly slowly. Governments are sending mixed signals to oil companies which continue to receive subsidies for their exploration and production of fossil oil and gas. And investors in new-generation fuel producers seem to be waiting for guarantees of easy money before going full throttle.”

Like each of the past meetings, this year’s symposium will feature two days of presentations, including sessions on fuel cell aircraft technology, demonstrations and hydrogen hubs for airports. In addition, interested attendees are invited to SAE International’s AE-5CH Hydrogen Airport Taskgroup meeting the day before, on Tuesday, 1 April.

The meeting of the SAE AE-5CH Hydrogen Airport Taskgroup, led by Jesse Schneider, CEO of ZEV Station, is open to SAE and VFS members, and interested conference participants.

There are challenges in decarbonizing the aerospace industry, especially due to lightweighting and powertrain needs. Larger, heavier eVTOL aircraft that require more power for sustained flight need fuel cells with hydrogen, combined with batteries to achieve zero-emission, all-electric, long-range flights.

Despite the advantages of utilizing hydrogen, it still hasn’t been widely embraced as an accepted propulsion approach in North America. Though sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a good transition fuel that helps to reduce CO2, it does not answer all the questions for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and consumes more resources such as energy and water. Hydrogen, on the other hand, holds tremendous potential in this area as a mid- and long-term replacement of kerosene.

After the passage of the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the US government has committed $8 billion to support the development of hydrogen hubs across America. In addition, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act offered significant incentives for the large-scale use of hydrogen. Thus, there is great opportunity to utilize these resources towards outfitting hydrogen at airports.

Though hydrogen is standardized for ground vehicles, it is not yet at scale for use for aircraft. Other impediments include the lack of infrastructure, transporting hydrogen and high costs due to the scale of the industry today. The H2-Aero initiative is seeking to think outside the box, as it’s certainly possible to bring hydrogen at scale, especially in conjunction with other forms of transportation such as airport ground equipment.

The H2-Aero Team has published a whitepaper, “Multimodal H2-Airport Hub,” to cover the scenario for a Hydrogen Hub starting with ground vehicles and later scaling to support an airport with hydrogen aircraft through different scenarios of storage, distribution and production.

Although multiple hydrogen consortia and government bodies have published roadmaps, and the UK and European Union have made progress in this area, there has been little traction for hydrogen aviation in the US. The H2-Aero Team is engaging with government, industry and academic organizations to bring hydrogen for the range of aircraft—from eVTOL, eRotor, eSTOL, LTA and eCTOL—to the forefront, because aviation is one of the most challenging transportation industries to decarbonize and stands to benefit the most from hydrogen.",,N,,2025-03-15 04:50:25.544158

This initiative is part of SK Energy's ambitious strategy to solidify its position within the Asia-Pacific SAF market.

Following the success of its European SAF exports that began in January 2025, the company is keen to expand further in this sector.

Lee Young-chul, Head of SK Energy’s Marketing Division, says: “We will closely monitor changes in SAF policies and market dynamics both domestically and abroad.

“By collaborating with Cathay Pacific and other partners, we aim to build a stable global SAF supply chain.”

The company's deal with Cathay Pacific shows the significance of Hong Kong International Airport, which not only catered to more than 53 million passengers in 2024 but also serves as a key logistical hub in the region.

With more than 1,100 daily flights operated by more than 120 airlines, the integration of SAF at this scale could significantly contribute to the reduction of aviation-related carbon emissions in Asia.

The move to increase SAF supply to Hong Kong is seen by SK Energy as a strategic step towards capturing a larger share of the Asia-Pacific market, amidst growing global concerns over carbon footprints of airline operators.

Worldwide SAF demand

Global demand for SAF is on the rise, driven by international commitments to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation industry:

The European Union has mandated that all flights departing from Europe must use a minimum of 2% SAF in their fuel mix, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050

The United States aims to replace all conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050

Singapore plans to implement a SAF levy with a 1% usage target in 2026

South Korea will introduce a 1% SAF blending mandate in 2027.

Despite this, IATA reported “disappointingly slow” growth in SAF production in 2024.

“With airlines, the core of the value chain, earning just a 3.6% net margin, profitability expectations for SAF investors need to be slow and steady, not fast and furious,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

“But make no mistake that airlines are eager to buy SAF and there is money to be made by investors and companies who see the long-term future of decarbonisation.”

Market research firm Global Market Insight predicts that the global SAF market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 46.2% – from approximately US$1.7bn in 2024 to US$74.6bn by 2034.

Jiaao Enprotech’s bio kerosene has received approval from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, confirming that the fuel meets airworthiness certification requirements, the Jiaxing-based company said yesterday. No details were given about a sales strategy or potential customers.

The jet fuel will be produced at Jiaao’s CNY7.1 billion (USD1 billion) factory in Lianyungang, eastern Jiangsu province, it said. The plant, which came online in November last year, is designed to produce 750,000 tons of sustainable aviation kerosene a year. This would make Jiaao the biggest producer in the country when the factory is fully up and running.

Convinced of its potential, BP Global Investments, part of London-based BP, bought a 15 percent stake in the Liangyungang factory in August last year.

The Lianyungang plant, which is run by subsidiary Lianyungang Jiaao New Energy, uses waste resources, including food scraps and cooking oil, to produce jet fuel. Biokerosene is a key solution for the global aviation industry to transition to greener energy. Compared to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuel, green aviation fuel can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the company said.

Jiaao’s biodiesel products have already been certified by the EU and, in 2021, the company entered into a long-term supply deal with Shell Oil. In 2023, Jiaao’s biodiesel business generated revenue of CNY1.7 billion (USD234.8 million), which accounted for about 67 percent of its total earnings for the year, according to the firm's 2023 annual report.

Jiaao’s share price [SHA:603822] closed down 6.2 percent at CNY60 (USD8) today. However, the company’s stock has gained around 40 percent in value in the past month, hitting a new high since September 2022 just yesterday. Since BP bought in, Jiaao’s stock has surged 172 percent.

SAF is now projected to account for just 6% of the UK’s aviation fuel mix by 2030, falling short of the government’s 10% goal. By 2040, this figure is expected to reach 17%, yet the CCC warns that feedstock limitations and intensifying global competition could hinder progress.

The report, which came out in late February but is still being picked over, highlights that access to sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oils and agricultural waste, remains a key challenge. The UK faces stiff competition from the US, EU, and China, which have implemented more aggressive SAF policies and incentives. Without sufficient domestic production, the UK could become a net importer of SAF, making it more expensive and less competitive.

Even if supply challenges are addressed, costs remain a major obstacle. The CCC report states, “Synthetic fuels will remain around seven times more expensive than conventional kerosene by 2050, while biomass-derived SAF is projected to be twice as expensive.” These high costs make SAF commercially unviable without policy support or technological advances. Direct air capture and storage could be a cheaper alternative to fuel switching, it is reckoned.

Murray Douglas, Head of Hydrogen Research at global energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, recently framed similar concerns about the cost challenges facing SAF and other synthetic fuels. He told gasworld, “Hydrogen needs to be below $1.50 per kg for e-fuels to work, and we’re nowhere near that. Even in places with ultra-cheap renewables, we’re looking at costs that just don’t make sense.” The economics are particularly difficult for aviation fuels, which require competitive pricing to remain commercially viable, since profit margins for airlines are always thin.

Douglas further noted that e-SAF, once considered a near-term solution, is unlikely to be viable at scale before the 2040s.

If the UK fails to scale up SAF production, the CCC warns that aviation may have to implement demand management measures, such as higher ticket prices or restrictions on flight growth. The report states, “SAF remains a key part of the decarbonisation strategy, but its scalability is uncertain.”

The UK’s SAF mandate, which came into force on 1 January 2025, requires at least 2% of all jet fuel to be SAF this year, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. This timeline is expected to deliver 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2030, reducing carbon emissions by 6.3 megatonnes per year a decade later.

But achieving these targets is now uncertain due to capacity, technology, scaling, and investment challenges.

Four UK airports – Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, and Stansted – currently have SAF handling capabilities.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/03/shutterstock_1879664092.jpg",N,,2025-03-15 04:51:47.588066

Syntholene partners with a geothermal energy provider to power the world’s first geothermally-driven synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) facility.

U.S. based Syntholene Energy Corp reports having signed a binding energy agreement securing 20 MW of geothermal power, a major milestone in deploying the world’s first geothermally-powered synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) plant module.

This agreement will power a commercial demonstration facility, integrating geothermal heat and electricity for high-temperature steam electrolysis, improving the efficiency of power-to-fuel technology. The facility will produce synthetic kerosene, addressing the growing demand for carbon-neutral aviation fuel.

A first-of-its-kind hybrid energy approach

Unlike traditional geothermal power plants that focus solely on electricity generation, this facility will utilize both heat and electricity, demonstrating a new model for industrial-scale geothermal applications.

There are key benefits to geothermal-powered eSAF production, such as base-load clean energy for fuel synthesis, Carbon-neutral industrial heat utilization, and scalability from demonstration to commercial output.

Strategic partnership & expansion potential

Under the binding Letter of Intent (LOI), Syntholene will design, engineer, and operate the facility at a partner-controlled geothermal site, retaining exclusive rights to technology and project expansion.

The agreement also includes a commercial expansion option, allowing up to 20 MW of geothermal capacity for future large-scale production.

“This energy agreement represents the seeds of a transformative moment for synthetic fuel cost and scalability,” said Dan Sutton, CEO of Syntholene.

Geothermal: a game-changer for industrial heat applications

Geothermal energy has long been underutilized in heat-intensive industrial processes. By leveraging geothermal heat for fuel synthesis, Syntholene is setting a precedent for more efficient, carbon-neutral industrial applications.

If successful, this model could pave the way for other industrial sectors to utilize geothermal resources for low-emission manufacturing processes.

Looking ahead: the future of geothermal-powered fuels

This project positions geothermal energy at the forefront of clean fuel innovation, bridging the gap between renewable energy and sustainable aviation. As Syntholene advances to full-scale commercial production, it will be a key player in decarbonizing aviation and heavy transportation.

Penalties for non-compliance with SAF quotas If airlines and refueling providers fail to meet the established SAF quotas, they face severe penalties.
Another BDL demand concerns the financing of SAF quotas.
EU Regulation 2023/2405 presents the aviation industry with new requirements that bring both opportunities and challenges.","A key element of the EU regulation concerns the carrying of kerosene on return flights from countries outside the European Union. Starting this year, airlines departing from the EU will be allowed to carry a maximum of 10 percent of the kerosene from their home country for the return flight. This regulation is intended to prevent so-called “fuel tankering” – a practice in which airlines fill up aircraft in non-EU countries to benefit from lower fuel prices and thus save costs. According to the regulation, the annual quantity of fuel delivered to an airport within the EU must cover at least 90 percent of the respective airline’s annual requirements.

The regulation aims to optimize fuel consumption and reduce unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions. According to the EU, so-called tankering leads to higher fuel consumption, as aircraft typically fly with more fuel than they need for the respective route. This not only leads to higher emissions but also to more inefficient flights, which runs counter to the Union’s environmental protection efforts.

Another reason for this measure is to promote fairer competition between airlines. Airlines based in countries with lower fuel prices could otherwise gain an unfair competitive advantage by meeting their fuel needs at a lower price and carrying unnecessarily more fuel on longer routes. This would exacerbate the competitive disadvantage for airlines operating in countries with higher fuel costs.

Reporting and proof obligations for airlines

The regulation requires airlines and their fueling providers to provide detailed documentation by March 31, 2023, at the latest. This documentation includes not only the quantity and origin of the kerosene used, but also detailed documentation of the fuel purchase. Airlines must provide, among other information, the name of the fuel provider, the quantity purchased in tonnes, the conversion process, and the lifecycle emissions of the SAF used. These reports must be verified by independent auditors to ensure proper compliance with the regulations.

In addition to providing evidence of kerosene transport, airlines must also document the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Since the beginning of the year, a minimum quota of two percent SAF has been in effect for all departures from airports in the EU. This quota will continue to increase until 2030, and synthetic fuels, so-called e-fuels, will also be mandatory in the future. The exact quantity and origin of the SAF used must also be documented in detail.

Penalties for non-compliance with SAF quotas

If airlines and refueling providers fail to meet the established SAF quotas, they face severe penalties. The regulation stipulates that in such cases, the refueling providers will be held primarily accountable, which in some cases could also affect the airlines themselves. The German Aviation Association (BDL) has already pointed out this development and criticized the additional financial burden that the new regulations could impose on the aviation industry. According to the BDL, compliance with the quotas could lead to a significant competitive disadvantage for smaller airlines that do not have the same financial resources as large corporations.

Another BDL demand concerns the financing of SAF quotas. The industry association proposes that passengers should be required to finance the more expensive sustainable kerosene alternatives through a levy across Europe. This should offset the higher costs incurred by airlines due to the mandatory use of SAF. This levy could help cover the higher production costs of SAF while ensuring fair competition.

Challenges for airlines

The new regulations pose several challenges for airlines. On the one hand, they must adapt to the amended regulations and provide the necessary documentation, which entails additional bureaucratic effort. On the other hand, the restriction on the carriage of kerosene also leads to a change in operational processes, especially on routes where “tankering” of cheap kerosene was previously a common business model. The SAF quotas that must be implemented could also pose a financial risk for smaller airlines if prices for sustainable fuels remain higher than for conventional kerosene.

Nevertheless, the new regulations also offer opportunities for innovation in fuel technology and aviation logistics. Some airlines may increasingly focus on developing their own SAF producers or partnering with major fuel suppliers to reduce the costs of sustainable fuels. The development of synthetic fuels, which may be more cost-effective and readily available in the future, could also represent a long-term solution for the aviation industry.

EU Regulation 2023/2405 presents the aviation industry with new requirements that bring both opportunities and challenges. While the limitation of fuel tankering and the introduction of SAF quotas are intended to encourage the aviation industry to become more sustainable, the financial and administrative burdens could put smaller airlines at a competitive disadvantage.

The coming years will show how well the industry is able to adapt to the new requirements while operating economically. What is clear, however, is that the aviation industry is facing a crucial phase in which it must reorient itself both ecologically and economically.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-15 03:51:29.987983

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.","The signing of a binding agreement for up to 20 megawatts of electrical energy (or thermal equivalent) marks a key step toward the company’s goal of delivering clean synthetic fuels at lower cost than fossil fuels, for the first time. Syntholene combines geothermal heat and electricity to enable breakthrough energy efficiency for high temperature steam electrolysis, with the mission of overhauling the economics of power-to-fuels technology.

With the processes already demonstrated at lab-scale, the energy delivered as a result of the binding agreement will be used to power a commercial-demonstration-scale geothermal-powered synthetic fuel production facility. The first target fuel output is synthetic kerosene, earmarked to fill the growing demand for eSAF clean aviation fuel.

This hybrid energy installation represents a global first, demonstrating the potential of geothermal resources to power scalable and sustainable synthetic hydrocarbon fuel infrastructure with a base-load supply of both heat and electricity. Notably, the agreement enables the operation to scale from demonstration to industrial output.

“This energy agreement represents the seeds of a transformative moment for synthetic fuel cost and scalability.” said Dan Sutton, CEO of Syntholene. “By integrating proven processes with a dedicated geothermal resource, we aim to deliver high-performance, low-cost, and carbon-neutral eSAF that can bankably scale to meet the global demand for clean aviation fuel.”

Binding Agreement

Syntholene Energy Corp (“Syntholene”) has entered into a binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) for the strategic development of the demonstration facility. Under the terms of the LOI, Syntholene will design, engineer, construct, commission, and staff the facility at a partner-controlled geothermal site. Syntholene retains exclusive ownership rights to the test facility equipment, intellectual property derived from the project, and the right to scale operations commercially, contingent upon the successful completion of the demonstration.

The LOI includes a commercial expansion option, allowing Syntholene access to approximately 20 megawatts of geothermal electrical or equivalent heat capacity for future commercial-scale operations, subject to technical, financial, and regulatory viability.

Completion of the transactions contemplated by the LOI are subject to a number of conditions, including entry into a more fulsome definitive agreement.

Geothermal for Carbon Neutral Industrial Heat

Geothermal energy presents several prospective advantages for powering heat-intensive industrial processes such as fuel synthesis. Appropriately selected geothermal resources provide carbon-neutral and low-cost thermal power with consistent uptime. With the right heat and pressure characteristics, these resources can meet the rigorous demands of industrial power requirements.

Most geothermal power plants operating today have been developed to generate electricity, with substantial waste heat. By combining energy inputs for endothermic industrial processes, Syntholene envisions a more efficient use of the heat energy inherent in geothermal resources. This enables a more industrially-tailored energy profile for synthetic fuel production facilities co-located to high-quality geothermal resources.

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation. It takes about 1.5 gallons of ethanol to make one gallon of sustainable aviation fuel.

All conventional aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of SAF and jet fuel. However, by 2030, it is expected that a large portion of airplanes will be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF.

At this week’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference in Rosemont, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state is positioned to be a major player in the aviation fuel producing market.

“The ecosystem that we’ve built for sustainable fuel development is really second to none,” said Pritzker. “From agricultural commodities to refiners to consumers, Illinois is a leader at every step of the sustainable fuel supply chain.”

Last year, United Airlines announced plans to purchase one million gallons of sustainable jet fuel at O’Hare International Airport. O’Hare is the fifth airport in the world where United has purchased SAF for operational use. JetBlue is currently using SAF at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.

The Department of Energy set a goal to achieve 3 billion gallons of SAF production by 2030, and 35 billion gallons by 2050. To qualify for United States federal tax credits, SAF must meet a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Dave Loos, director of Biofuels and Research with the Illinois Corn Growers Association, says the state is well positioned to take advantage of the SAF market.

JetBlue’s SAF supply is made possible through corporate business partners who help cover the cost premium over traditional jet fuel. An additional 4 million gallons of neat SAF is possible under the terms of the deal with the support of corporate partners.

“JFK has been JetBlue’s home for 25 years, and our operations here should set the standard we envision for our entire network.” said Ursula Hurley, chief financial officer, JetBlue. “Thank you to the many teams and partners who have helped make this possible. Incorporating SAF into our flights is an important lever in decarbonizing the aviation industry and expanding its availability to our Northeast airports is a big step.”

To ensure a consistent supply of SAF, Diamond Green Diesel LLC—a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and Darling Ingredients Inc. affiliate — produces the fuel and Valero then blends it with conventional jet fuel to create blended SAF. The blended SAF is then delivered by World Fuel via existing jet fuel distribution infrastructure where it is claimed by JetBlue for use in their fleet at JFK Airport. Blended SAF is a drop-in product for existing aircraft and infrastructure and can lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to approximately 80%, when compared to current conventional jet fuel.

“Working with JetBlue and Valero to bring blended SAF to one of our largest airport locations supports our ambition at World Fuel to grow a consistent supply network for SAF on the U.S. East Coast,” said Brad Hurwitz, senior vice president, supply and trading, World Fuel Services. “This collaboration enhances our ability to provide regular sustainable aviation fuel and improves access to lower carbon fuels for our aviation customers.”

The delivery of SAF to the New York region was first explored in a 2021 study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National Renewable Energy Lab, evaluating the ways in which SAF could be transported to Port Authority airports using existing fueling infrastructure. The study found that SAF could be successfully delivered to Port Authority airports, paving the way for airline partners to fuel an aircraft with SAF at LaGuardia Airport successfully in June 2022 and for John F. Kennedy International Airport to welcome the world’s first transatlantic flight fueled by SAF in November 2023.

“We are proud to collaborate with JetBlue on the use of SAF at John F. Kennedy International Airport,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “As the international gateway to the US, JFK is leading by example through our work on safe SAF delivery to our regional airports and promoting sustainable air travel. We look forward to facilitating more SAF operations across our airport system.”

“The Port Authority looks forward to continue working with our partners as we all strive toward more environmentally friendly air travel,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “Our work testing the safe delivery of SAF to our airports was a key first step demonstrating the possibility of more sustainable airport operations. As our agency works to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we hope more business partners like JetBlue will want to work together to advance our mutual sustainability goals while delivering a world-class air travel experience.”

Expanding SAF Use

Growing the SAF market and expanding adoption nationwide requires public and private collaboration. Proposed federal and state incentives for renewable fuels would support the industry’s transition to SAF, while corporate partnerships offset costs. Businesses can reduce their travel emissions by purchasing JetBlue-issued SAF certificates, and JetBlue continues to seek additional partners to expand its SAF use.

The company is partnering with Houston-based Baker Hughes Co. (Nasdaq: BKR) to accelerate the deployment of Baker Hughes’ direct air capture technology, which could be used at the Matagorda County facility.
In Texas, especially in Matagorda County, we were welcomed to do a new infrastructure project,” Gentle said.
Prior to making its $114 million investment, Idemitsu signed a letter of intent to purchase e-methanol from the Matagorda County facility.
A second site has been identified in Matagorda County where HIF Global intends to build another methanol and SAF facility after it reaches FID on the first site.","HIF Global LLC, a international producer of alternative fuels, has become the first in the United States to receive an approval for an e-fuels pathway in California, supporting the facility it’s developing in Matagorda County.

The certification for the company's sustainable aviation fuel production will allow it to be eligible for California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Meg Gentle, executive director of HIF Global's board, told the Houston Business Journal at CERAWeek by S&P Global in Houston.

“That’s just one more step along the path for creating this market for e-fuels and shows how (places like Europe, California and Japan) are saying, ‘We are going to make a place for e-fuels in the market.” Gentle said.

HIF Global, which has its U.S. headquarters in Houston, is developing a $6 billion to $7 billion e-methanol plant in Matagorda County, which initially will have the capacity to produce 1.4 million tonnes per annum of methanol synthesized from hydrogen, coming from water electrolysis, and carbon dioxide.

It will be the first e-fuels production facility in the U.S. and the largest in the world, HIF Global said.

The first part of the project, which will make the methanol, is being designed by Bechtel Energy, Siemens Energy and Topsoe. The next part of the project will add the production of sustainable aviation fuel and is being designed by London-based Johnson Matthey PLC and North Carolina-based Honeywell International Inc. (Nasdaq: HON).

Gentle said HIF's goal is for construction to begin by 2026, or maybe as soon as late 2025, depending on when the company secures its offtake agreements and reaches a final investment decision. The project was originally projected to start construction in 2024.

“We are working to finish our offtake agreements, which really need certainty in the underlying regulation,” Gentle said. “Uncertainty is the enemy of investment.”

How hydrogen tax credit uncertainty affects HIF's project

In the United States, in order for HIF to move forward with its investments, Gentle said the 45V hydrogen tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act must be fully implemented. The Department of Treasury published its final rule on the hydrogen tax credits at the beginning of January, but it is unclear whether those credits will be among the aspects of the IRA that members of Congress attempt to repeal.

“The discussions in Washington about repealing the tax credit have then created a new uncertainty. So on the one hand, finally, after two years of working on it, we had final guidelines from the U.S. Treasury,” Gentle said.

“We do not view these as a handout. These are an investment that we are making in creating a new industry that then stands on its own, is profitable and grows. And in order to do that, we are competing against other countries bringing these fuels to market, and our most fierce competition is coming from China. And so these are helping us compete against China.”

A spokesperson for HIF Global added: ""Our customers are looking for regulatory certainty in the U.S. to finalize the long-term contracts, including final determination of the tax credits to confirm we are competitive with their alternative supplies from China.""

Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, previously told the Houston Business Journal that the 45V tax credits were something the trade group urged policymakers to retain.

Meanwhile, Gentle is confident that the methanol part of the project will move forward, even if separate market dynamics don’t come together to justify producing sustainable aviation fuel.

“We can always move forward with the methanol, and we have full flexibility then to adjust to what the market wants,” Gentle said.

Other companies are taking a similar approach when it comes to sustainable fuels. Houston-based Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX), for example, recently converted its San Francisco Refinery to a renewable fuels refinery, starting with renewable diesel. However, the company planned to produce more sustainable aviation fuel from the facility into this year as market dynamics were expected to improve.

HIF's investment in Texas

HIF Global chose its site in Matagorda County for several reasons: the state’s business-friendly environment, robust transmission in the area, and access to carbon dioxide, including through direct air capture. The company is partnering with Houston-based Baker Hughes Co. (Nasdaq: BKR) to accelerate the deployment of Baker Hughes’ direct air capture technology, which could be used at the Matagorda County facility.

“We do projects in communities that want us there. In Texas, especially in Matagorda County, we were welcomed to do a new infrastructure project,” Gentle said.

HIF Global has received key investments from investment firm EIG Partners, Porsche, Baker Hughes, Idemitsu Kosan, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., and the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security. The latter three companies, based in Japan, brought in their investments last year, together reaching nearly $500 million in investments.

Prior to making its $114 million investment, Idemitsu signed a letter of intent to purchase e-methanol from the Matagorda County facility.

HIF Global had previously applied for tax credits for a second facility that would have been located near Fort Worth, but the HIF Global spokesperson said the company is no longer pursuing that location as it determined that site does not work for an e-fuels facility.

The company's mission is to deliver the world's first truly high-performance, low-cost, and carbon-neutral synthetic fuel through a scalable modular production system.
Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.","CHICAGO, March 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - SYNTHOLENE ENERGY CORP (""Syntholene"" or the ""Company""), a leader in clean fuel synthesis, has secured a dedicated geothermal energy resource sufficient to deploy the world's first geothermally-powered synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) plant module.

The signing of a binding agreement for up to 20 megawatts of electrical energy (or thermal equivalent) marks a key step toward the company's goal of delivering clean synthetic fuels at lower cost than fossil fuels, for the first time. Syntholene combines geothermal heat and electricity to enable breakthrough energy efficiency for high temperature steam electrolysis, with the mission of overhauling the economics of power-to-fuels technology.

With the processes already demonstrated at lab-scale, the energy delivered as a result of the binding agreement will be used to power a commercial-demonstration-scale geothermal-powered synthetic fuel production facility. The first target fuel output is synthetic kerosene, earmarked to fill the growing demand for eSAF clean aviation fuel.

This hybrid energy installation represents a global first, demonstrating the potential of geothermal resources to power scalable and sustainable synthetic hydrocarbon fuel infrastructure with a base-load supply of both heat and electricity. Notably, the agreement enables the operation to scale from demonstration to industrial output.

""This energy agreement represents the seeds of a transformative moment for synthetic fuel cost and scalability."" said Dan Sutton, CEO of Syntholene. ""By integrating proven processes with a dedicated geothermal resource, we aim to deliver high-performance, low-cost, and carbon-neutral eSAF that can bankably scale to meet the global demand for clean aviation fuel.""

Binding Agreement

Syntholene Energy Corp (""Syntholene"") has entered into a binding Letter of Intent (""LOI"") for the strategic development of the demonstration facility. Under the terms of the LOI, Syntholene will design, engineer, construct, commission, and staff the facility at a partner-controlled geothermal site. Syntholene retains exclusive ownership rights to the test facility equipment, intellectual property derived from the project, and the right to scale operations commercially, contingent upon the successful completion of the demonstration.

The LOI includes a commercial expansion option, allowing Syntholene access to approximately 20 megawatts of geothermal electrical or equivalent heat capacity for future commercial-scale operations, subject to technical, financial, and regulatory viability.

Completion of the transactions contemplated by the LOI are subject to a number of conditions, including entry into a more fulsome definitive agreement.

Geothermal for Carbon Neutral Industrial Heat

Geothermal energy presents several prospective advantages for powering heat-intensive industrial processes such as fuel synthesis. Appropriately selected geothermal resources provide carbon-neutral and low-cost thermal power with consistent uptime. With the right heat and pressure characteristics, these resources can meet the rigorous demands of industrial power requirements.

Most geothermal power plants operating today have been developed to generate electricity, with substantial waste heat. By combining energy inputs for endothermic industrial processes, Syntholene envisions a more efficient use of the heat energy inherent in geothermal resources. This enables a more industrially-tailored energy profile for synthetic fuel production facilities co-located to high-quality geothermal resources.

Rhoden announced last week that he had signed House Bill 1052 but also emphasized that the measure does not kill a project proposed by Summit Carbon Solutions.

https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2424/files/2025/03/n-0313-13-pipeline.mp3

American Carbon CEO Tom Buis called the bill a lost opportunity for South Dakota to capitalize on growing markets for low-carbon biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel. Buis said, “Other states are moving forward, and it’s unfortunate to see South Dakota take a step back.”

HB 1052 was a direct response from pipeline opponents frustrated by the actions of the Iowa-based company. They said Summit employees have conducted land surveys without permission and have used misleading information to get landowners to sign leases allowing Summit’s proposed pipeline to be built across their property.

Buis said the “legislation comes at a time when South Dakota farmers and ethanol producers desperately need new markets to restore profitability. Instead of supporting economic growth, this decision creates unnecessary roadblocks and sends the wrong message to agriculture and rural communities.”

Rhoden said Summit needs to earn back the trust of South Dakotans and admitted it won’t be easy for the company to do. He outlined his reasons for signing the bill in a letter to the legislature and the people of South Dakota.

Summit’s proposed pipeline project would connect ethanol companies in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota to an underground storage site in southwestern North Dakota.

This facility will be based on Honeywell UOP’s first ETJ license and basic engineering design in the Asia Pacific region with a production target of 200 million liters per year.

Expected to begin operation in 2029, the facility becomes the fifth of its kind in the world and will provide a vital supply of SAF to both domestic and international markets, contributing significantly to the growing demand for SAF driven by the aviation industry’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

“For more than 40 years, Honeywell has provided Taiyo Oil with key major refining process units for its Shikoku operations, and we are honored to continue this trusted relationship to help the company advance its decarbonization initiatives,” said Barry Glickman, vice president and general manager of Honeywell Sustainable Technology Solutions. “As demand for SAF continues to increase, the aviation industry faces challenges posed by the limited availability of conventional SAF feedstocks like vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste oils. Honeywell’s ETJ SAF technology broadens the available feedstock options to help overcome these challenges.”

This follows its successful SAF export to Europe in January 2025, and the company hopes it will secure a leading position in the Asia-Pacific SAF market.

Lee Young-chul, Head of SK Energy’s Marketing Division, says: “We will closely monitor changes in SAF policies and market dynamics both domestically and abroad.

Expanding SAF’s reach

SK Energy has made impressive progress in SAF production and distribution:

In September 2024, the company established a facility capable of producing 100,000 tonnes of SAF annually using co-processing technology

The company successfully exported SAF to Europe in January 2025, becoming the first Korean oil refiner to do so

SK Energy began supplying ISCC-certified SAF to Cathay at Incheon International Airport in November 2024.

The co-processing method it uses integrates bio-feedstocks into existing refinery infrastructure, enabling large-scale production of lower-carbon fuels such as SAF and bio-naphtha.

Aviation in Asia-Pacific

The Asia-Pacific region is important to SK Energy, accounting for more than 80% of the company's export volume.

Hong Kong International Airport saw more than 53 million passengers in 2024 and is a key transit hub in the region.

With more than 1,100 flights per day by more than 120 airlines, SAF could make a big difference.

SK Energy hopes this export to Hong Kong will accelerate its efforts to capture a larger share of the SAF market in Asia-Pacific.

Worldwide demand for SAF

Global demand for SAF is on the rise, driven by international commitments to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation industry:

The European Union has mandated that all flights departing from Europe must use a minimum of 2% SAF in their fuel mix, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050

The United States aims to replace all conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050

Singapore plans to implement a SAF levy with a 1% usage target in 2026

South Korea will introduce a 1% SAF blending mandate in 2027.

Despite this, IATA reported “disappointingly slow” growth in SAF production in 2024.

“With airlines, the core of the value chain, earning just a 3.6% net margin, profitability expectations for SAF investors need to be slow and steady, not fast and furious,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

“But make no mistake that airlines are eager to buy SAF and there is money to be made by investors and companies who see the long-term future of decarbonisation.”

Market research firm Global Market Insight predicts that the global SAF market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 46.2% – from approximately US$1.7bn in 2024 to US$74.6bn by 2034.

""Together with our supplier OMV Petrom, we have managed to start the process by which aircraft operating flights at Cluj International Airport will be fuelled with sustainable aircraft fuels. It is another important objective that we have achieved in fulfilling our commitments to reduce carbon emissions and support less polluting air transport,"" added David Ciceo, General Manager, Cluj International Airport.

With almost 3.3 million passengers in 2024, Avram Iancu Airport in Cluj is the largest regional airport in Romania and the second largest airport in the country, after Otopeni. As part of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, in addition to supplying sustainable aviation fuels, the airport has also purchased two electric aircraft de-icing/anti-icing trucks and an electric bus to transport passengers from the terminal to the planes.

How sustainable fuels are produced

SAFs are fuels produced by processing renewable raw materials, such as waste oils and animal fats. Using advanced refining processes these materials are transformed to have characteristics similar to kerosene. SAF can be used directly in existing infrastructure and aircraft. It has the potential to provide a life-cycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces. SAF will play a very important role in achieving the aviation industry’s carbon reduction goals.

Vale, the world’s second-largest iron ore miner and a leader in high-grade iron ore production, is solidifying its position through the development of Mega Hubs in Oman, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
The green iron market is expanding rapidly, yet Australia – the world’s largest iron ore producer – is failing to capitalise on this transition.
Accelerating investments in viable, globally adopted solutions will be essential to securing a role in the future green iron market.
To keep pace with the evolving green iron market, Australia must strengthen its competitive positioning and employ its resources effectively.","Green iron could generate $295 billion per year for Australia, three times the current value of iron ore exports, while also creating thousands of jobs. The government has announced a $1 billion Green Iron Investment Fund to support this transition. However, achieving this will not be easy, as Australia must compete with other players in this growing market. So far, Australia has been slow to act compared with other regions.

In 2024, new joint venture Tosyali-SULB announced plans for the world’s largest direct reduced iron (DRI) plant. Last month, the company awarded an order to Midrex and SMS Group for the development of the DRI complex. Initially aiming for an annual production capacity of 8.1 million tonnes (Mt) of DRI for export, Tosyali-SULB plans to start with a first-phase capacity of 2.5Mt.

This is just one among many plans to expand DRI-based iron and steelmaking across the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) region.

The new DRI complex will feature Midrex Flex technology, enabling the production of green iron by gradually replacing fossil gas with hydrogen. This transition is critical for decarbonising the green steel industry in MENA, a global hub for gas-based DRI production.

While some EU steelmakers remain hesitant about importing green iron from regions with more favourable production conditions, Tosyali-SULB is taking a bold step on the supply side of this emerging market. Strengthening collaboration between end users and producers will be essential for building a robust green iron and steel value chain.

First movers are significantly expanding operations in key regions like MENA. Vale, the world’s second-largest iron ore miner and a leader in high-grade iron ore production, is solidifying its position through the development of Mega Hubs in Oman, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These hubs are designed to boost production of iron ore concentrate and agglomerates co-located with DRI plants, positioning Vale as a dominant supplier in the region.

In January, Vale took a major step forward by signing a land reservation agreement to establish a Mega Hub in Ras Al Khair Industrial City in Saudi Arabia. This facility is expected to produce 12Mt of cold briquetted iron ore (CBI). Vale previously secured an offtake agreement to supply 4Mt of agglomerates for the future ESSAR Group facility in Saudi Arabia, further cementing its strategic presence. The company has revealed that it expects to make two final investment decisions relating to its Mega Hubs plans in 2025.

In Oman, Vale already operates a pelletising facility with an annual capacity of 9Mt and is progressing with plans to produce 12.6Mt of iron ore concentrate in collaboration with Jinnan Steel & Iron Group as part of the broader Mega Hub strategy. These initiatives underscore Vale’s rapid progress in efforts to reduce Scope 3 emissions, especially compared to its Australian counterparts, who have been slower to respond.

The green iron market is expanding rapidly, yet Australia – the world’s largest iron ore producer – is failing to capitalise on this transition. Adapting some of MENA’s key strategies could accelerate Australia’s progress. Despite having world-class renewable energy potential, iron ore reserves suitable for DRI production, and access to gas, Australia doesn’t produce DRI at commercial scale and remains focused on small-scale pilot projects.

One major challenge is access to sufficient gas supplies, given Australia’s LNG export sector uses over 80% of total gas production. This has fuelled high domestic gas prices and supply shortages on the east coast, undermining the competitiveness of gas-based manufacturers and forcing some industrial facilities to close. Market conditions are also tightening on the west coast, pushing prices to levels that may cause demand destruction among existing industries and inhibit new gas-intensive industrial investment. There is an urgent need for a more balanced energy policy to support domestic industries.

Iran, one of the world’s largest gas producers, produced 252 billion cubic metres (bcm) of fossil gas in 2023. It also played a significant role in global DRI production, contributing 33.4Mt in 2023 – equivalent to 36% of all gas-based DRI output. Unlike Australia, which produced 152bcm of gas, Iran retains nearly all of its production for domestic use, while Australia exports a substantial share as LNG.

In this tight market, the most advanced commercial-scale DRI projects announced in Australia, such as POSCO’s Port Hedland HBI plant, may face major gas supply challenges before transitioning to green hydrogen. Securing adequate feedstock and energy remains a key risk, underscoring the broader uncertainties in scaling up low-carbon iron production in Australia.

A recent study indicates that Australia faces significant challenges producing gas-based DRI or hot briquetted iron (HBI) competitively due to its higher gas prices compared to regions like MENA, Canada and the US, where lower-cost gas allows for more cost-effective production.

MENA established itself as a DRI hub decades ago, leveraging gas-based technology and abundant, low-cost energy to remain competitive in steel production. Today, the region is laying the foundation for a hydrogen economy, gradually transitioning towards hydrogen-based processes even in its steel sector.

With industrial decarbonisation progressing rapidly, the long-term role of gas-based ironmaking in Australia is becoming increasingly uncertain. Relying on fossil fuel technologies increases investment risks, as steel sector end-users are shifting away from feedstocks with high embedded carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

A study by Wood on POSCO’s planned Port Hedland HBI plant reveals that, in its base case scenario, total Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions would reach 0.70 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per tonne of HBI (tHBI), with 0.55tCO2e/tHBI from fossil gas consumption alone. This far exceeds what could be considered low-emission production. For the first phase of the project, the plan is to use gas-flexible Midrex Flex technology, and the study highlights that switching from fossil gas to hydrogen could reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 57%.

Australian iron ore miners have often claimed that the quality of their in-situ ores is not suitable for DRI production, and they are exploring solutions to enable the use of low-to-mid-grade ores. Studies show that the emerging technological pathways – such as using a smelter after iron ore reduction to remove impurities – will be crucial in decarbonising iron and steelmaking.

However, Australia cannot afford to overlook proven technologies already operating worldwide. Delaying billion-dollar projects until new pathways progress beyond pilot and small-scale trials risks falling behind in the global transition.

Projects like Fortescue’s Christmas Creek green iron initiative and NeoSmelt are making progress, but to secure a foothold in the market, Australia needs more large-scale commercial projects backed by magnetite mines and available technologies. Opening up new iron ore mines can be a decade-long process. Accelerating investments in viable, globally adopted solutions will be essential to securing a role in the future green iron market.

The prospect of combining South Australia’s magnetite ores with green hydrogen in DRI plants to produce truly green iron remains uncertain, particularly given the challenges at the Whyalla steel plant. Despite state government intervention to sustain the business, South Australia may face either a prolonged delay or, at worst, a permanent setback in its ambitions to produce green hydrogen at scale, leaving it exposed to gas supply and cost risks for longer.

Recent progress in MENA projects demonstrates that the technology is readily available and that, with strategic planning, natural resources can be leveraged to accelerate the transition. To keep pace with the evolving green iron market, Australia must strengthen its competitive positioning and employ its resources effectively.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/shutterstock_1421683301.jpg,N,,2025-03-13 08:50:45.148520

Think you knew SAF? The Trump administration is shaking up the internationally recognized term for sustainable aviation fuel. Call it synthetic aviation fuel now, according to the Energy Department and reported by AgriPulse. It could shape up to be something of a “Gulf of America”-esque fight. “We still have the Sustainable Aviation [Fuel] Caucus,” quipped caucus Co-Chair Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), who said she’s not changing the group’s name.

Others were less diplomatic. Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said “DOE can call it whatever they want” but using biofuels to cut aviation emissions “should continue to be an objective worthy of DOE’s support and leadership. “We’re not quite sure what DOE is trying to accomplish with the name change,” Cooper said in an email. “Every other country in the world uses the ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ terminology, and ‘synthetic’ clearly has a different meaning that seems to entirely set aside environmental performance considerations.”",https://governorsbiofuelscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/favicon-biofuels.jpg,N,,2025-03-13 06:50:07.475132

— Philippe Haffner, co-founder and CEO

VITRY-LE-FRANçOIS, FRANCE, March 12, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- - First positive impact to date of the start of production of mobility-grade green hydrogen at the Marolles site (Marne County, Grand Est Region).

- First decisive step towards the development of a 720-kg/day production plant for hydrogen, electricity and biochar from biomass at the Glovelier site (Jura County, Switzerland), which is expected to be commissioned in July 2026.

Following the successful start of production of green hydrogen at its Marolles site (Marne County, Grand Est), Haffner Energy (ISIN: FR0014007ND6 – Ticker: ALHAF) announces the signing by H2 bois SA of a first contract, essential step towards developing H2 bois SA’s project at its Glovelier site (Jura County, Switzerland).

A first contract, essential step towards developing H2 bois SA’s project

The signing of this first contract brings discussions with H2 bois SA to a new concrete phase. The company was created by the Swiss Corbat Group, and its partners Planair and Romande Energie, co-shareholders of H2 bois SA, to develop and operate projects for the production of hydrogen, electricity and biochar from biomass.

In particular, this first contract is critical for H2 bois SA’s project of a biomass-based hydrogen, electricity and biochar production plant, intended to meet the energy needs of local industrial consumers of fossil hydrogen and decarbonize mobility. Biomass is to be procured from the local wood industry,

The plant, which is expected to be commissioned in July 2026, could represent a total order value for Haffner Energy that may reach up to €8.3 million, including options. With all its equipment and auxiliaries, it is designed to produce 30 kg/h of hydrogen.

The hydrogen produced at the plant will be distributed on site or removed for industrial and mobility applications. The electricity produced will be fed into the electricity grid. Biochar, a by-product of the production of syngas (syngas) from which hydrogen is derived and a real carbon sink, will be used for compost enrichment and soil amendment.

A land footprint already secured and pipeline to the H2 distribution site in construction

It was already made public that the distribution site is planned near the A16 motorway, thus facilitating access for vehicles. It is located in an industrial area packed with established consumers of fossil hydrogen. The hydrogen will be transported there by a pipeline, its 1-km route crossing the new business park (ZAM 2) which is expected to welcome new companies consuming green hydrogen.

On the date of the signing of this first contract, the building permit has been secured and the work related to the construction of the pipeline has begun.

The start of production of green hydrogen in Marolles: a trigger for the signing of this first contract

As announced at the time of the half-year financial results, this technological milestone allows Haffner Energy to accelerate commercial discussions with various partners interested in its disruptive biomass thermolysis and gasification technologies. It was thus the trigger for finalising the signing of this first contract, which increases the company's prospects in a promising hydrogen market despite its slow start.

""We are delighted to have reached this essential milestone with the Swiss companies Corbat, Planair and Romande Energie. As we anticipated, the production of mobility-grade hydrogen is proving to be a key catalyst. This shows that our Hynoca® technological process is delivering on its promises, which should be a game-changer for a hydrogen ecosystem that has yet to truly take off. We have been waiting for this for a long time, and the availability of the Marolles site finally allows us to produce super green hydrogen from solid biomass"", says Philippe Haffner, Co-founder and CEO of Haffner Energy.

""The expiration of the Biodiesel Tax Credit at the end of 2024 has decimated biofuels supply chains.
Restoring the Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit is a concrete step that Congress can take to help mitigate inflationary threats that persist throughout the economy, including tariffs.
Since its introduction in 2004, the Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit has successfully motivated retailers to invest in infrastructure needed to support low-carbon fuel options, while also making renewable fuel blends more affordable for consumers.
The Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit has been instrumental in developing a strong renewable diesel industry in the United States, driving significant growth in production.","NATSO, representing America's truck stops and travel centers, SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel Marketers, American Trucking Associations (ATA), the Clean Freight Coalition (CFC), Energy Marketers of America (EMA), the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), the National Energy & Fuels Institute (NEFI) and the Truckload Carriers Association (TCA) urged Congress to extend the 'Section 40A' Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit. Extending the longstanding, bipartisan $1 per gallon tax credit will ensure that the current uncertainty in the advanced biofuel industry does not result in higher fuel prices at the pump.

Fuel retailers, distributors and blenders, trucking fleets and consumers of renewable fuels support tax policies that result in lower fuel prices. Renewable diesel and biodiesel provide affordable, cleaner-burning fuel that reduces American dependence on foreign energy sources, stabilizes domestic fuel markets, and enables consumers to purchase more competitively priced diesel fuel. Biodiesel and renewable diesel have historically been the most widely used biofuels in commercial trucking and remain the most viable option for reducing carbon emissions from the nation's trucking, home heating oil, and rail industries.

""The expiration of the Biodiesel Tax Credit at the end of 2024 has decimated biofuels supply chains. Many biofuel production facilities, particularly biodiesel plants, have scaled back or are shutting down entirely,"" the organizations said in a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee. ""Consumers should not have to incur unnecessary cost increases for everyday goods like food, medicine, and other essential commodities if stability is not restored to biofuels markets through an extension of the Biodiesel Tax Credit.""

Economists predict inflation could rise 2.5% in 2025, elevating it to a top economic issue in the United States. Restoring the Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit is a concrete step that Congress can take to help mitigate inflationary threats that persist throughout the economy, including tariffs.

The Biodiesel Tax Credit directly lowers the cost of diesel fuel for truck drivers, which in turn reduces shipping costs and helps lower the prices consumers pay for goods transported by truck.

Since its introduction in 2004, the Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit has successfully motivated retailers to invest in infrastructure needed to support low-carbon fuel options, while also making renewable fuel blends more affordable for consumers.

The Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit has been instrumental in developing a strong renewable diesel industry in the United States, driving significant growth in production.

Emissions from the airport, along with city operations, makes up about 2% of the city's overall greenhouse gas emissions, O'Keeffe said.","Cleveland Hopkins International Airport has announced a sustainability plan as part of larger, city-wide efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The plan outlines six focus areas to improve energy efficiency, including incorporating EV charging infrastructure and expanding solar and renewable energy options.

""It's a matter of reducing our emissions across all scopes by 2050 and wherever needed, utilizing things like carbon offsets to kind of get the rest of the way,"" Airport Sustainability Coordinator Elizabeth Lehman said ""That will kind of manifest in a lot of different ways from the visitor's experience.""

The plan lays out projects that will reduce emissions, increase sustainability and help ensure climate resilience, according to a news release.

These strategies target emissions the airport controls, Lehman said, but the airport is preparing to work with its airlines to address emissions from their planes.

""A lot of that has to do with how can we, you know, potentially support infrastructure to bring sustainable aviation fuel to Cleveland and to Ohio.""

The airport aims to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The plan will bring the airport into alignment with goals established in the city’s climate action plan, said Cleveland Director of Sustainability and Climate Justice Sarah O’Keeffe.

The latest draft of Cleveland's climate action plan proposes a citywide 63% emission reduction by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. Achieving net zero emissions means contributing no new emissions to the atmosphere, rather than allowing emissions to increase over time. The final plan will be published in April.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the city will help reduce the effects of climate change felt by residents and business owners in the region, O'Keeffe said, including more frequent and severe storms, flooding and damage from fallen trees.

""Nature-based solutions, stormwater management, trees, these things help us become resilient and recover,"" she said. ""Adopting modern technology helps us avoid making the problem worse.""

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

I’m going to need a bump in XP utilizing this for this period. I’m new to buying this and wondering about a few things:

-is this available at the cost shown right up to at least check in time if not at the check in desk? Does it change ever? I looked at XPs and cost going back a few months till now no change.

-strangely the initial journey shows the cost but not XP earned, a long haul and then intra Europe segment both don’t show XP earned. In talking to Air France by phone I was quoted XPs for the displayed pricing but they couldn’t explain why it didn’t show XPs earned. It’s a North America to Prague flight, is it the route that is the reason? I hesitate to do this given the lack of transparency but other options prove more costly. Why doesn’t the app/site show the XPs to be earned?

This analogy of the three-legged stool is commonly used by the oil and gas sector to secure their importance to Alaska. The guiding rule is that Alaska’s overall economy, represented by the stool, collapses if any one of these three legs falters.

According to newspaper accounts, the Trump administration has frozen $750 million in resource development projects. Also, up to 1,400 Alaskan jobs are now threatened or terminated by Elon Musk’s indiscriminate layoffs. And now slashing Medicaid is being proposed.

This combined economic affront to Alaska was recently highlighted by Senator President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, in a letter to Alaska’s congressional delegation. According to these legislative leaders, Alaska could experience a loss of $2 billion in federal funds if Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program are threatened as proposed in the budget resolution just passed by the House of Representatives under President Trump’s direction. Stevens and Edgmon write, “absorbing a $2 billion plus reduction in the return of federal funds to our state is not an option. It is a direct threat to Alaska’s future, plain and simple.” After touching upon Alaska’s fiscal situation and how federal resources play a critical role in Alaska, leaders Stevens and Edgmon closed their letter with this statement – “It is our duty to inform you that the legislature cannot fix the financial havoc that is being wreaked on Alaskans by the federal government.”

These are words that all Alaskans need to take to heart. If all these layoffs, cuts and freezes are left unchecked, Donald Trump and Elon Musk will essentially be taking a chainsaw to the federal leg of our stool; risking a collapse of our economy. And let’s not forget this leg of the stool was once made exceptionally strong by former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens.

To the majority of Alaskans who voted for Donald Trump, I say don’t let the distant lure of Arctic National Wildlife Refuge oil or the liquefied natural gas pipeline project blindside you from seeing how Alaska’s economy is being seriously threatened by the Trump administration. These projects are at least a decade away and highly speculative. For instance, Japan has only agreed to look into the Alaska LNG project, not invest it in. And let’s not forget no major oil company stepped up to bid on ANWR under the first Trump administration. These types of megaprojects in the distant future will not offset the economic harm now being unleashed, nor does reinstating old-growth logging in the Tongass or permitting the Ambler Road. None of the provisions under Trump’s Alaska executive order will offset the potential harm of collapsing our federal leg.

This is an economic reality that I hope Trump voters will come to realize.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC08584-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 22:50:08.988202

The South Korean government is in the process of designating SAF as a ‘national strategic technology’. Currently, the government is offering tax credits of 15% for large and mid-sized companies and 25% for small businesses that invest in national strategic technology facilities. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport launched the SAF Blending Mandate Design Task Force and are developing a roadmap by the first half of the year.

In February 2025, the government announced that a SAF experiment center will be established by 2031 in Seosan, a city on the country’s western coast, with an investment of KRW311 billion (bn) (approximately US$2bn). In the same month, SK Innovation, GS Caltex, S-Oil, and HD Hyundai Oilbank disclosed that they are jointly building a SAF plant at a cost of KRW1 trillion (approximately US$0.6bn) to process 250,000 metric tonnes (mt) annually.

South Korea’s ambitious moves come amid fast-growing opportunities in the SAF market. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated that 449bn liters of SAF will be required by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5% compared to the 2025 level. The SAF market value is projected to surge from US$0.6bn in 2022 to around US$45bn in 2030, a nearly 75-fold increase.

Challenges in SAF production

SAF is an innovative solution for decarbonizing the aviation sector by replacing petroleum in fuel production with alternative feedstocks such as waste fats, oils, and grease (FOG), municipal solid waste (MSW), food waste, algae, and photosynthetic organisms. Compared to traditional jet fuel, SAF can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 80%. It offers a drop-in decarbonization solution, requiring minimal aircraft or infrastructure modifications, with current operation standards allowing up to 50% SAF and fossil jet fuel blend. The aviation industry aims for complete SAF compatibility (100% blend) by 2030.

Despite its environmental benefits, SAF production faces challenges, including limited feedstock availability, high manufacturing costs (two to five times higher than fossil jet fuel), and technological limitations, as highlighted in a previous report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). The dominant SAF production process, hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), relies on feedstocks like used cooking oil and animal fats, which are in short supply.

This feedstock scarcity and unaffordability risks a shift towards first-generation feedstocks (such as soybean and palm oil), which are cheaper and more readily available but are associated with sustainability concerns. Associated problems include deforestation, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, competition with food uses, and land-use emissions that may exceed fossil fuel impacts.

Additionally, not all SAFs achieve the same degree of carbon reduction. Some production methods have higher carbon footprints than others.

Seizing opportunities by availing domestic advantages

Against this backdrop, shifting from first to second-generation SAF feedstocks, including waste-based components, is gaining momentum among many governments.

South Korea has one of the world's best waste recycling systems (86% waste recycling rate) and is ranked second in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for municipal waste recycling (56.5%). The country could leverage this strength to become a leading SAF producer since reliable and consistent resource capture from recycling is key to creating second-generation fuels.

South Korea could utilize its recycling program for different SAF production pathways. Domestically aggregated used cooking oil could be collected for HEFA and co-processing production, while MSW could be used for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) processes. Domestic feedstock procurement could reduce reliance on imported raw materials, potentially moderating SAF production costs and hedging feedstock availability.

The timely development of a domestic SAF supply chain is crucial for South Korea to take advantage of market opportunities. For instance, the collection of used cooking oil, a vital feedstock for HEFA and coprocessing-based SAF production, could pave the way for new businesses in the country. Establishing a robust used cooking oil collection network would enhance energy security and improve the competitiveness of local SAF producers and the airline industry.

The International Renewable Energy Agency’s (IRENA) 1.5°C Scenario projects that bioenergy, including SAF, will account for over 18% of the total final energy consumption by 2050. SAF is a key solution for hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.

However, widespread SAF adoption requires strong governance to balance sustainable feedstock use, environmental impact, and economic equity. Leveraging its strategic initiatives, waste recycling expertise, and leadership in the jet fuel market, South Korea is well-positioned to develop a domestic SAF industry and accelerate the transition toward a greener aviation future.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/Korean%20Air%20airline%20at%20Incheon%20Airport%20with%20control%20tower%20view%20in%20Seoul%20South%20Korea.jpg,N,,2025-03-13 00:50:29.923781

Cosmo Energy Holdings is set to make history by launching Japan’s first domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in April 2025, accelerating the nation’s push for cleaner skies. This initiative aligns with Japan’s ambitious goal of replacing ten percent of jet fuel with eco-friendly alternatives by 2030.

As the country’s third-largest refiner, Cosmo will produce SAF from used cooking oil at its Sakai refinery in western Japan.

Under Japan’s sustainability mandate, domestic refiners must ensure ten percent of their aviation fuel sales come from SAF by 2030. To meet this target, Cosmo has outlined an aggressive expansion plan:

Thirty Thousand Kilolitres Annually at Sakai: Utilizing used cooking oil.

One Lakh Fifty Thousand Kilolitres at Sakaide: Sourced from bioethanol.

One Lakh Twenty Thousand Kilolitres from Imports: Partnering with Thailand’s Bangchak and other Asian suppliers.

Cosmo’s Sakai project is set to produce Twenty-Four Thousand Kilolitres in fiscal 2025 after accounting for maintenance, with major airlines like Japan Airlines (JAL), ANA, and DHL already securing supply contracts.

Looking ahead, Cosmo aims to kickstart SAF production at Sakaide by 2029, with a final investment decision expected in fiscal 2026. Government subsidies covering nearly half of the capital expenditure have helped drive these projects forward.

By moving ahead of competitors, Cosmo Energy is positioning itself as a leader in Japan’s sustainable aviation transition, despite hurdles such as cost reduction, raw material sourcing, and buyer commitments. With this initiative, Japan’s aviation sector takes a bold step toward a greener future.

2million tonnes of e-SAF production capacity has now been announced for Europe, but there have so far been no Final Investment Decisions reached.
Through Project SkyPower, representatives all over the industry have thoroughly modelled the conditions required to overcome the barriers to scale this innovative fuel,’ said Marjan Rintel, CEO at KLM and co-chair of Project SkyPower for Air France-KLM.
‘As aviation industry leaders, we collectively agree that an enabling policy and funding framework is urgently required to kick-start production at scale.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel could cut 90% of emissions compared to traditional alternatives, but take-off is being delayed by policymakers.

Project SkyPower is the European Union’s leading pro-SAF organisation, and members have now backed an open letter calling for urgent policy updates to drive expansion of the sector.

Air travel is one of the biggest transport contributors to global emissions, and environmental groups have warned the current rate of expansion is far outpacing the speed at which new technologies are bringing down emissions.

Hopes have long been pinned on developing sustainable jet fuel, which economists also argue would help boost industry. However, critics contest that this solution is hamstrung by high costs and lack of production capacity, and the priorities should be encouraging other travel modes that are less harmful to the environment.

All 15 Project SkyPower members – some of the most influential aviation CEOs on the continent – have now published an open letter demanding EU leadership offer greater support to the SAF sector. This has been backed by 70 individual companies with interests in development. Steps that should be taken to increase production include:

Strategic priority in the Clean Industrial Deal and the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP): The European Commission should include e-SAF as a strategic priority in the Clean Industrial Deal and as a critical part of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, helping drive the scale-up from innovation to commercialisation.

Recycle ETS revenues from aviation to capitalise a market intermediary that enters auctioned, 10- 15-year contracts with e-SAF producers and 3-5 year contracts with off-takers: Recycling ETS revenues via SAF Allowances is critical for the continued competitiveness of airlines, but doesn’t benefit e-SAF projects which require long-term offtake contracts to make first-of-a-kind e-SAF plants bankable. ETS revenues from aviation could be used to capitalise a market intermediary to provide the minimum level of public support required for revenue certainty.

Establish a bridging mechanism in 2025 until a capitalised market intermediary comes online, to give first movers priority access to the new funding instrument: Only the first pioneering large-scale e-SAF projects will reach FID by 2025-27 – a requirement to be operational by 2030/31 and have a realistic chance of contributing to the EU’s initial e-SAF sub-mandates. To avoid delaying action while a capitalised market intermediary is being operationalised (1-2 years), the European Commission should guarantee priority access to this market intermediary for these pioneering projects.

Provide long-term certainty over mandates, production criteria and penalties: The EU should use proactive communications to remove uncertainty around continued enforcement of e-SAF mandates post-ReFuelEU Aviation review in 2027, as well as continued enforcement of current e-SAF production criteria. Member States should also publish harmonised penalty guidance as soon as possible.

Mitigate project-on-project risk via government-backed backstop mechanism: To mitigate the challenges e-SAF project developers face in financing dedicated production facilities for renewable electricity and CO2, the European Commission should establish a financial backstop ensuring debt service payments can be made until such facilities become operational.

2million tonnes of e-SAF production capacity has now been announced for Europe, but there have so far been no Final Investment Decisions reached. At the time of writing, under 300,00 tonnes of actual capacity will be online by 2030. This is less than half of the requirement stipulated in ReFuelEU’s sub-mandate.

‘e-SAF is important in the transition away from fossil fuels in aviation. Through Project SkyPower, representatives all over the industry have thoroughly modelled the conditions required to overcome the barriers to scale this innovative fuel,’ said Marjan Rintel, CEO at KLM and co-chair of Project SkyPower for Air France-KLM. ‘As aviation industry leaders, we collectively agree that an enabling policy and funding framework is urgently required to kick-start production at scale. We call on EU policymakers to adopt these recommendations to support the aviation sector to reach its climate ambitions.’

This milestone follows SK Energy's successful export of SAF to Europe earlier this year, reinforcing its strategic push to lead the Asia-Pacific (APAC) SAF market.

On March 10, SK Energy announced a contract with Cathay, Hong Kong's flagship airline, to supply 20,000 tons of ISCC-certified SAF through 2027. Since November 2024, SK Energy has been providing SAF to Cathay at Incheon International Airport. Both companies intend to expand SAF utilization across additional routes in the near future.

This agreement marks a pivotal achievement for SK Energy, occurring just two months after the company became the first Korean refinery to export SAF to Europe. The APAC region is critical for SK Energy, accounting for over 80% of its export volume. With Hong Kong International Airport ranking as the fifth busiest airport globally in passenger traffic, this partnership allows SK Energy to further solidify its presence in the region. Leveraging this strategic foothold, the company is actively working to strengthen its position in the APAC SAF market.

Industry experts highlight SK Energy’s success as a result of its innovative SAF production system. In September 2023, SK Energy established a production capacity of 100,000 tons per year using a co-processing method. This technique integrates bio-feedstock supply systems into existing petroleum processing lines, enabling the efficient production of low-carbon fuels such as SAF and bio-naphtha.

Global SAF demand is rising following the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) 2021 resolution to reduce aviation industry carbon emissions by 50% by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. The European Union now mandates that all departing flights must include at least 2% SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. The United States has also committed to replacing conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050. In APAC, Singapore plans to introduce a 1% SAF usage requirement by 2026, and South Korea will require airlines to blend 1% SAF in 2027. In preparation, South Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport will set SAF usage targets by mid-2025.

Lee Young-chul, SK Energy's Marketing Division Head, affirmed the company’s commitment to monitoring global SAF policies and collaborating with Cathay and other partners to build a robust SAF supply chain.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-12 15:50:35.954091

Specifically, he cited low carbon fuel standards in California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico that push for ultra-low carbon ethanol.","Plans for a five-state carbon pipeline were thrown into question last week when South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a law prohibiting the use of eminent domain for such projects.

Carbon sequestration is a way for ethanol producers to significantly lower carbon intensity scores. But carbon dioxide has to go through a pipeline to get to a sequestration site.

Permitting issues at the state level have been a barrier to some pipeline projects. With a new administration and Congress focused on rolling back “Green New Deal ” measures, it’s unclear how they will proceed.

The South Dakota law could spell trouble for the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline that was planned to traverse parts of the state.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said the group’s view is that the South Dakota law effectively bans CO2 pipelines in the state. If this holds, he said it will disadvantage many farmers and ethanol plants there.

Limiting carbon pipelines undercuts President Donald Trump’s energy goals that include the ability to sequester carbon as a key part of American energy dominance.

The proposed project would include 2,500 miles of pipeline through Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and the Dakotas. Already, 57 ethanol plants along the route have partnered with Summit.

Rocky journey for pipeline development

After years of back and forth, the company has received sequestration permits in North Dakota and pipeline permits in Minnesota, North Dakota and Iowa.

However, the Iowa Utilities Board's approval provided that Summit could not begin construction until it had approval from North Dakota and South Dakota for the route.

Some South Dakota landowners strongly opposed the project.

The state Supreme Court sided with landowners in August, ruling that Summit had not proved it is a common carrier, limiting its ability to do surveys without landowner permission. Voters in November rejected a law allowing carbon pipeline developers to sidestep local restrictions.

Initially, state utility regulators rejected the company’s permit application in 2023. Summit reapplied in November 2024 with a route change. Regulators are still considering the route.

In a letter explaining his decision to sign the eminent domain bill, Rhoden said the project is not dead yet. Instead, he hopes Summit uses the opportunity to reset and improve relations with landowners. He also noted that voluntary easements will not be prohibited by the law.

Under a voluntary easement, a landowner agrees to take a payment in exchange for allowing a company to access their land. That way the company doesn't need eminent domain authority.

As of October 2024, Summit said it had secured 75% of the base route in Iowa, 75% of the previous route in South Dakota, 82% in North Dakota and 89% in Minnesota.

In a statement after the law was signed, Summit said the move presents obstacles but the project will move forward in states that “support investment and innovation.” The company promised more news ""soon.""

“It’s very unfortunate that, despite our approvals in Iowa, North Dakota and Minnesota, South Dakota changed the rules in the middle of the game,” Summit wrote. “This kind of regulatory uncertainty creates real challenges — not just for our project, but for the ethanol plants in South Dakota that now face a competitive disadvantage compared to their counterparts in neighboring states.”

Other carbon pipeline projects have been scrapped recently. Navigator CO Ventures announced in 2023 that it had canceled its Heartland Greenway pipeline project due to “the unpredictable nature of the regulatory and government processes.”

Carbon pipelines key part of ethanol production

IRFA's Shaw said a pipeline in South Dakota would be a “big red easy button,” for Iowa ethanol producers and farmers seeking lower carbon intensity scores. However, he said the law does not signal the end of the road.

“There are many places to sequester carbon,” Shaw said. “There are many ways to get there that do not involve a pipeline in South Dakota.”

Shaw said there’s high demand for “ultra” low carbon ethanol around the world and in the United States. Ethanol producers are looking for ways to access markets and one hiccup in South Dakota is not going to stop it, he said.

Specifically, he cited low carbon fuel standards in California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico that push for ultra-low carbon ethanol. Other states are exploring fuel standards that could model these. Some of the largest ethanol export markets, like the United Kingdom, European Union and Canada, also have low carbon fuel standards.

In the private market, airlines are also itching for low-carbon fuel, Shaw said.

“It doesn't matter whether you think the issue of reducing carbon is silly or smart or stupid,” Shaw said. “It doesn't matter. These are what our customers want.”

Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is the biggest and easiest way for ethanol producers to reduce carbon intensity. Ethanol plants could invest millions of dollars in on-site technologies that lower carbon, but it’s more costly and less beneficial than sequestration, Shaw said.

There are other ways to transport carbon, including rail, but carrying carbon through pipelines is cheaper. Shaw noted that Illinois could be a destination for a pipeline that avoids South Dakota.

Shaw said there are plenty of ways Summit can keep the project alive and said he'd be shocked if the company simply abandoned the project rather than exploring alternatives.

While Shaw took an optimistic approach to broader political support for carbon sequestration, Doug Durante, executive director of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, was more skeptical.

“We're going kind of backwards in our emphasis on carbon,” Durante said. “So I think if you had a pipeline … what’s the value?”

Durante pointed to efforts by the Trump administration to eliminate climate initiatives, language and programs. USDA scrubbed certain websites related to climate change. Recently, the Department of Energy also rebranded “sustainable aviation fuel” as “synthetic aviation fuel.”

Trump and some Republican lawmakers have also sought to scale back the Inflation Reduction Act. Signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, the law updated the 45Q tax credit to offer $85 per ton of carbon sequestered to incentivize the use of carbon capture and storage.

Pipeline projects like Summit seek to claim this credit.

Lowering carbon intensity scores through sequestration can also change the credit amount fuel producers receive through the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. This was also included in the IRA and replaced expiring biofuel credits.

Some Republicans have made it clear that they want some IRA provisions, including 45Z and 45Q, to be preserved in upcoming tax reform and budget reconciliation bills. But it’s unclear exactly how Congress and the administration will handle these efforts.

Without credits or incentives, Durante said it could alter the calculation and value of ethanol.

“I think it unfortunately kicks one of the legs of the stool out from under ethanol,” Durante said. “Again, if there’s no governmental or societal value for reducing carbon.”",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Associated%20Press%20photos/Dec%202023/AP_Dec_23_carbon_pipeline_protest.jpg?height=635&t=1741297988&width=1200,N,,2025-03-12 14:51:01.787215

It not only supports businesses in achieving their environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets but also enhances supply chain resilience and provides a competitive advantage. As companies seek more sustainable sourcing solutions, SAF is emerging as a critical driver of low-carbon logistics.

In a significant step towards reducing carbon emissions, Mercedes-Benz has secured a record-breaking order of SAF for its export air freight shipments from Frankfurt to Beijing and Shanghai. The procurement of around 13,000 tonnes of SAF marks the largest single-volume order of its kind by a DB Schenker customer. This initiative will cut Mercedes-Benz’s CO2e emissions by 40,000 tonnes, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable logistics.

Thorsten Meincke, Global Board Member for Air & Ocean Freight at DB Schenker, highlights the long-term impact of the agreement: “Achieving carbon neutrality is a long-haul journey. Our new biofuel agreement with our trusted partner Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark for sustainability commitments.

""By working together, we are actively and immediately reducing emissions in intercontinental supply chains. This contract represents one of the largest-ever SAF deals in the entire automotive and logistics industries globally. I look forward to seeing more customers join us.”

Strengthening Sustainable Supply Chains Through Procurement

Mercedes-Benz and DB Schenker have maintained a strong procurement and logistics partnership for decades, covering land, air and ocean transport, as well as warehouse management. In 2021, Mercedes-Benz became one of the first companies to utilise DB Schenker’s SAF-powered cargo flights. This latest order represents another milestone in their joint efforts to decarbonise supply chains.

With sustainability now at the core of corporate procurement strategies, Mercedes-Benz is setting a new industry benchmark by prioritising low-emission transport solutions.

Elke Pusskeiler, Head of Supply Chain Management at Mercedes-Benz, underlines this commitment: “As part of our Ambition 2039 for Mercedes-Benz Cars, we aim to reduce CO2 emissions in logistics by 60% compared to 2021. Our sustainability strategy focuses on CO2 avoidance and on the reduction of emissions for all modes of transport in inbound and outbound. Utilising sustainable aviation fuel for air freight allows us to cut emissions. Together with DB Schenker, we made another significant achievement in our efforts for sustainable logistics.”

This agreement not only demonstrates leadership in green logistics but also encourages other companies to integrate SAF into their procurement strategies. By leveraging sustainable sourcing, businesses can build more resilient supply chains while contributing to global decarbonisation efforts.

SAF’s Role in Green Logistics and Procurement Strategy

SAF is a renewable fuel derived from waste products such as agricultural and forestry residues, algae, used cooking oil and municipal solid waste. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle, making it a key enabler of sustainable logistics.

A major advantage of SAF is its compatibility with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure, allowing for immediate adoption without the need for costly modifications. This makes it an attractive solution for procurement teams aiming to transition towards lower-carbon transport options while maintaining operational efficiency.

For companies focused on ESG compliance and supply chain sustainability, integrating SAF into their procurement strategies offers multiple benefits. By reducing reliance on fossil fuels and supporting the circular economy, SAF contributes to long-term carbon reduction goals while ensuring business continuity in an increasingly regulated environment.

The Impact of SAF Procurement on the Automotive Industry

The partnership between Mercedes-Benz and DB Schenker signals a broader shift in automotive procurement, where sustainable sourcing and logistics solutions are becoming non-negotiable. By investing in SAF, Mercedes-Benz is not only reducing its own carbon footprint but also setting a precedent for the industry.

Mercedes-Benz’s sustainability roadmap, ‘Ambition 2039,’ outlines its goal of achieving net carbon neutrality across its entire vehicle lifecycle and supply chain. To reach this target, the company is investing in recycled materials, fleet electrification and renewable energy. By 2030, more than 70% of its energy requirements are set to be met through solar and wind power.

By securing large-scale SAF procurement, Mercedes-Benz is demonstrating that sustainable sourcing is not just an ambition but a practical reality. This approach encourages other automotive manufacturers and logistics providers to follow suit, driving the industry towards a greener future.

As businesses face increasing pressure to decarbonise their supply chains, the Mercedes-Benz and DB Schenker agreement highlights the power of procurement in shaping a more sustainable logistics landscape.

It will become a biorefinery dedicated to producing fuels exclusively from renewable materials,” concludes Petrobras’ CEO, Magda Chambriard.","Petrobras (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Riograndense Refinery (RPR) successfully completed an industrial scale co-processing test using 5% pyrolysis bio-oil (a non-food biomass raw material) combined with fossil feedstock. The refinery, located in Rio Grande, southern Brazil, has Petrobras, Ultra and Braskem as shareholder companies.

Petrobras provided the technology for the co-processing test conducted at RPR’s catalytic cracking unit, which lasted seven days and was concluded on February 17th. A highly specialized technical team from Petrobras and Riograndense offered support throughout the commissioning, startup, operation, and shutdown stages of the bio-oil supply to the process. When co-processed at RPR’s FCC unit, the bio-oil was converted into various fractions such as fuel gas, LPG, and components for gasoline formulation and marine fuel with renewable content.

For the test, the FCC unit was adapted to enable the simultaneous bio-oil and fossil feedstock co-processing. The reactor catalyst belongs to the ReNewFCC line, produced in partnership with Fábrica Carioca de Catalisadores (FCC S.A.), a joint venture between Petrobras and Ketjen.

The renewable fraction was supplied by Vallourec – Florestal unit. The bio-oil production is ISCC PLUS certified and involves the condensation of vapors generated during eucalyptus charcoal production, which helps in preventing GHG emissions.

In late 2023, RPR became the first in the world to process 100% vegetable oil in an FCC unit, producing fuels and feedstocks for the chemical industry, such as propylene and bio-aromatics (BTX – benzene, toluene, and xylenes), also with Petrobras´ Research, Development, and Innovation Center (CENPES) technology.

“The recent test represents a significant breakthrough for global biorefining, as it could enable wood and other agroforestry residues transformation, which are widely available, into derivatives typically produced in oil refineries,” says Petrobras’ Director of Engineering, Technology, and Innovation, Renata Baruzzi.

Petrobras’ Director of Industrial Processes and Products, William França, emphasizes that “the innovative aspect of this new CENPES development is the bio-oil introduction into an existing refining asset, reducing the need for additional investments and opening a broader perspective in the energy transition and value generation for the industry”.

According to Petrobras’ Director of Energy Transition and Sustainability, Mauricio Tolmasquim, “with COP30 approaching, this innovation reinforces Petrobras’ and Brazil’s leadership on the international scenario, consolidating the company’s role in driving technological solutions for the energy transition in our country,”.

The initiatives are part of Petrobras’ BioRefining Program, which foresees US$ 1.5 billion investments within its 2025-29 Business Plan. The co-processing test at RPR complies with the RD&I clauses of the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP).

The cellulosic content test is part of the ongoing efforts to transform RPR into a biorefinery in the coming years. “In line with our commitment to leading a just energy transition in Brazil, the Riograndense Refinery has the potential to become the world’s first refinery to produce continuously 100% renewable products.

Biodiesel and HVO prices increased on higher feedstock costs, market participants said.
A closed arbitrage with China, Europe's biggest importer of UCO, is putting further pressure on supply in the region, market participants said.
The tickets are under pressure from stronger supply as some are being offered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blenders, market participants said.
But market participants anticipate prices rising from the end of March, which could reverse this trend.","The price of renewable fuel tickets in the UK and the Netherlands has firmed in recent trading sessions, but tickets remain a more competitive option to comply with domestic renewable fuel mandates than physical biofuels blending.

Tickets are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet mandates for the use of renewable energy in transport.

In the Netherlands, ""other"" and advanced renewable fuel units (HBE-Os and HBE-Gs) hit a more than three-week high of €11.10/GJ on 6 March, while in the UK, non-crop renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) reached 26.25 pence/RTFC on 5 March, the highest level since 29 January.

Despite the increase, RTFCs are at a discount to the like-for-like blend value of used cooking oil methyl esther (Ucome) biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) Class II (see graph). And in the Netherlands, HBE-Gs remain well below the like-for-like blend value of palm oil mill effluent (Pome) oil-based HVO (Class IV). This typically discourages obligated parties to physically blend biofuels.

Biodiesel and HVO prices increased on higher feedstock costs, market participants said. The premiums of HVO Class II and IV against the HVO-escalated 7-28 day Ice gasoil price reached $800/m³ and $785/m³, respectively, on 7 March, the highest since 12 February.

Meanwhile, the Argus Ucome biodiesel fob ARA price rose to $1,453.24/t on 4 March, its highest since 3 December. And last week, the Argus UCO fob ARA assessment hit its highest level since October 2022, driven by low supply in the ARA region and a stronger euro against the US dollar. A closed arbitrage with China, Europe's biggest importer of UCO, is putting further pressure on supply in the region, market participants said.

UCO trade flows shifted away from Europe last year as significant amounts of Chinese product moved to the US at the expense of flows elsewhere. But there may be some relief for European buyers in 2025 as US buyers wait for clarity on the Inflation Reduction Act's carbon intensity-based 45Z credit.

President Donald Trump's doubling of pre-existing tariffs on Chinese imports to the US to 20pc is yet to have an impact on the European market, although participants said it could put a ceiling on further price gains.

SAF blending pressures HBE-IXBs

HBE-IXB tickets — generated by blending biofuels made from feedstocks listed in Annex IX part B of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive — have been moving in the opposite direction. The Argus Netherlands HBE-IXB price softened to its lowest since October last year on 13 February, at €9.50/GJ (see graph). It has since risen slightly, reaching €9.75/GJ on 11 March.

The tickets are under pressure from stronger supply as some are being offered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blenders, market participants said. Biofuels in aviation benefit from a 1.2x multiplier, in addition to the double counting rule for waste feedstocks.

An EU-wide SAF mandate — ReFuelEU — came into effect on 1 January, replacing national obligations. Under the mandate, fuel suppliers will need to include 2pc SAF in their jet fuel deliveries in 2025, rising to 6pc in 2030.

UCO-based hydrotreated esters and fatty acids synthesised paraffinic kerosine (HEFA-SPK) is the most common type of SAF available today. In the Netherlands, blending HEFA-SPK SAF into jet fuel can generate HBE-IXBs.

But the Dutch ministry of infrastructure is consulting on its second draft to transpose the recast RED III. If the current draft is implemented, the Netherlands will introduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction mandates from 2026 for land, inland shipping and maritime shipping. The first draft also included an aviation subcategory, but it was removed in February.

GHG-quota by blending less lucrative in Germany

The increase in biodiesel and HVO prices in the ARA region has not had an impact on German GHG certificates. Buying GHG certificates remains more cost effective than physical blending for fuel suppliers. But market participants anticipate prices rising from the end of March, which could reverse this trend.

Starting January 2025­, planes can refuel with sustainable aviation fuel at Cluj International Airport

​OMV Petrom, the largest integrated energy producer in Southeast Europe, in supplying Cluj International Airport Avram Iancu with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in 2025, an important step towards reducing carbon emissions in air transportation. Through this partnership, Cluj International Airport and OMV Petrom reaffirm their commitment of supporting the energy transition and adopting sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.

Starting January 2025, aircrafts taking off from Cluj airport, the second largest airport in Romania, are fueled with aviation fuel mixed with 2% SAF, thus reducing the environmental impact. Nearly 1,800 flights were operated in January and February using this fuel, covering all departures from the airport.

""We are proud to contribute to the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel at Cluj International Airport. SAF is produced from renewable raw materials such as vegetable oils and animal fats, transformed into fuels with properties similar to conventional kerosene using innovative technologies. At OMV Petrom, we have started construction works on a €750-MM investment so that, starting 2028, we can produce such fuels in Romania at the Petrobrazi refinery. We believe in Romania's potential to become a regional hub for such fuels,"" said Radu Căprău, member of the OMV Petrom Executive Board responsible for Refining and Marketing.

“Together with our supplier OMV Petrom, we have managed to initiate the process by which the aircrafts operating flights at Cluj International Airport will be fueled with sustainable aviation fuels. This is another important goal we have achieved to fulfill our commitments to reduce carbon emissions and support less polluting air transport,"" said David Ciceo, General Manager of Cluj International Airport.

With nearly 3.3 MM passengers in 2024, Avram Iancu Airport in Cluj is the largest regional airport in Romania and the second largest airport in the country, after Otopeni. As part of efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, in addition to supplying SAF, the airport has also acquired two electric aircraft de-icing/anti-icing vehicles and an electric bus to ensure passengers’ transport from the terminal to the planes.

How sustainable fuels are produced. SAF is produced by processing renewable raw materials, such as used oils and animal fats. Using advanced refining processes and green hydrogen, these materials are transformed to have characteristics similar to conventional kerosene. SAF can be dropped straight into existing infrastructure and aircraft. It has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces. SAF will play a vital role in meeting the aviation industry’s carbon reduction targets. The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates the use of SAF on European Union airports in a minimum proportion of 2% starting January 1, 2025, with a gradual increase in the use of SAF up to 6% by 2030.

Could you tell us a little bit about your role at British Airways and how you first got into sustainability?
The biggest part in aviation is fuel – can you talk about fuel efficiency and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)?
So, working with companies like Airbus and Boeing to improve fuel efficiency is really key.
If we’re using fuel, are we using lower carbon fuel?","Aviation is a fascinating sector, especially when it comes to sustainability.

It is known as a ‘hard-to-abate sector’ because, unlike other industries, its road to net zero is not so straightforward.

Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions from up and down a company’s supply chain) form the majority of total emissions for most organisations around the world.

In aviation, almost all emissions come from Scope 1 (the direct emissions from operations). The reason? Jet fuel.

Planes rely on jet fuel to fulfil their primary function, but sustainable alternatives are not yet readily available enough for the sector to totally switch out fossil fuels for cleaner, greener ones.

Instead, aviation companies like British Airways have to decarbonise in other ways.

After his fascinating fireside at Sustainability LIVE: Net Zero, Tom Byrne, British Airways' Head of Net Zero & Environment, told us all about the innovative approaches that the industry is taking to decarbonisation right now.

Could you tell us a little bit about your role at British Airways and how you first got into sustainability?

My job is Head of Net Zero & Environment and it's a privilege to have that for a brand like British Airways.

I've always loved flying and being able to contribute towards flying getting more sustainable in time is a dream for me.

My team focuses on accelerating our net zero programme, which is about using less fuel, lower carbon fuels and increasingly looking at carbon removals, but also looking after our wider environmental footprint.

So that's food waste, single-use plastic and environmental compliance. It's a really busy area and a really brilliant job.

I've been in the industry for over a decade now and I’ve primarily worked for big corporates in the built environment, online fashion and now aviation.

My work is about really trying to help businesses achieve their long-term carbon goals and climate goals. And yeah, it's been a good ride!

There are many different parts to net zero at a company like BA. The biggest part in aviation is fuel – can you talk about fuel efficiency and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)?

You’re right – the majority of our emissions are in our Scope 1 and the majority of those is burning jet fuel. So that's the primary source of our emissions and it’s what we look at every single day to drive down.

There's three main ways of tackling that.

1. Using less fuel and having more operational efficiency. So our new aircraft, the Airbus A350 uses 35% less fuel than the Boeing 747 that it’s replacing.

The Airbus A320 Neos use about 20% less fuel than the ones they're replacing. So, working with companies like Airbus and Boeing to improve fuel efficiency is really key.

2. Working with our pilots to improve efficiency. So we operate every single day with more efficient processes and more efficient technology. So that's a really key part of our net zero pathway. We think that will cover about a third of our emission reductions.

3. SAF. If we’re using fuel, are we using lower carbon fuel? That's where SAF really comes into it.

There have been a few stories about contrails in the news recently. Does BA do much work around contrails?

Carbon is part of the equation when it comes to climate, but there's this other element of our climate impact, which is called non-CO₂, and contrails form a large part of that.

Non-CO₂ is something that we are thinking about a lot and have been for the last couple of years.

We're trying to work with the science community, with the academia community just to improve the science and knowledge, because with carbon we really know one tonne of jet fuel that we burn equals three tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere.

We know what that does to climate change and global warming.

With non-CO₂ – including contrails, the level of uncertainty is much wider. We're working with the likes of Imperial College London, Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy and the UK government to actually improve the science.

We're actually doing a research study ourselves around how we could use SAF to reduce contrails as well.

We're trying to collaborate as best we can with industry partners to improve their knowledge, improve the science, and then hopefully mitigate in the future like we're doing with CO₂ emissions.

Aviation is often called a ‘hard-to-abate’ sector, so if there's people actually ready to team up and join forces on how to decarbonise, then that's a great thing.

Exactly right. There's three elements of collaboration that I think about a lot. Firstly, collaborating with your peers.

So what are you doing to share information, best practise data with your peers? And as an industry, we all need to move towards that net zero position.

It's no good to us if only BA does it, right? So we have to collaborate with our sister airlines and our peers.

Then, it's collaboration with the supply chain. That’s really important because we don't produce planes, we don't produce fuel, we don't capture carbon emissions ourselves. We have to work with supply chain partners to do that.

And then thirdly – customer collaboration. So that might just be communicating to customers, but we can give them more information about the issues around aviation and what we're trying to do to solve those issues.

We're also collaborating with corporate customers. We know we are a lot of our corporate customers’ Scope 3 footprint.

Tackling Scope 3 is really important for them and we can work with them on those solutions.

Whether that is just giving them information, data, helping them to make smarter choices, co-sponsoring things like SAF to drive down their emissions as well, that's really vital.

Collaboration exists in lots of different ways and without it we won't get very far.

The record agreement reduces the global automotive company’s CO2e emissions by 40,000 tons through the procurement of around 13,000 tons of SAF. The biofuel is being accredited towards export air freight shipments from Frankfurt to Beijing and Shanghai.

Thorsten Meincke, Global Board Member for Air & Ocean Freight, DB Schenker: “Achieving carbon neutrality is a long-haul journey. Our new biofuel agreement with our trusted partner Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark for sustainability commitments. By working together, we are actively and immediately reducing emissions in intercontinental supply chains. This contract represents one of the largest-ever SAF deals in the entire automotive and logistics industries globally. I look forward to seeing more customers join us.”

Elke Pusskeiler, Head of Supply Chain Management, Mercedes-Benz AG: “As part of our ‘Ambition 2039’ for Mercedes-Benz Cars, we aim to reduce CO2 emissions in logistics by 60% compared to 2021. Our sustainability strategy focuses on CO2 avoidance and on the reduction of emissions for all modes of transport in inbound and outbound. Utilizing Sustainable Aviation Fuel for air freight allows us to cut emissions. Together with DB Schenker, we made another significant achievement in our efforts for sustainable logistics.”

DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz have had a strong partnership for many decades. The joint business stretches across several modes of transport, including land, air, and ocean transport as well as warehouse management. When DB Schenker launched the world’s first regular cargo flight covered by SAF in 2021, Mercedes-Benz was among the initial customers.

While the usage of SAF alone cannot fully eliminate emissions from air transport, it is an available alternative and tangible step in reducing the environmental impact of aviation. It is a well-tested alternative to conventional jet fuel. Produced from waste materials such as used frying oil, it reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 80% compared to fossil fuel.",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Mercedes-Benz-shipments_1_Credit-DB-Schenker_Torsten-Zimmermann.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 12:52:16.559348

The next deadline is often the next race, so change can happen in a matter of weeks.

In the race to net zero, Formula 1 is leading the field, aiming to reach this target by 2030.

Its 2024 Impact Update says that Formula 1 is on track to deliver on this goal.

Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, says: “Innovation and community drove Formula 1's work in 2024. We are thrilled to outline our progress and continued work in this space.

“Formula 1 as a sport is uniquely positioned to take action through our global reach and technological leadership.”

Fuelling F1 cars sustainably

F1’s cars run on E10 fuel, a blend of 10% green ethanol and 90% fuel – but this is planned to change in 2026.

Cars will soon run on 100% sustainable fuel, where the carbon used to produce the fuel is of the same quantity as that emitted when it is used.

F1 has been working in partnership with Aramco and the FIA to develop this fuel and have tested more than 39 blends in the process.

In 2024, F2 and F3 cars ran on 55% Aramco advanced sustainable fuel and the FIA medical and safety cars operated on 40%.

This will move to 100% in F2 and F3 cars for 2025 ahead of F1 cars adopting the fuel.

Throughout the 2024 season, all cars also operated using FSC-approved Pirelli tyres, ensuring compliance with strict forest sustainability standards.

Sustainable fuels off-track

The cars on track represent just 1% of F1’s carbon footprint and already use the most efficient hybrid engines in the world.

Most of the sport’s emissions are off-track, where cars, equipment and teams need to be transported to each of the race locations.

The report says that in 2024, F1’s investment in alternative fuels drove carbon reductions in its air and road logistics alongside circuit operations and on track.

It also made significant investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as part of this ultra-efficient logistics strategy with DHL and Qatar Airways.

This combined investment reduced total related emissions by more than 8,000 tCO₂e, or roughly 19%, compared to traditional aviation fuel.

Low-carbon energy generation systems began testing and were used in 2024 at the Red Bull Ring, the Hungarian Grand Prix and the Italian Grand Prix in Monza.

For 2025, the programme will be rolled out to reduce more than 90% of carbon emissions at all European Grand Prix using technologies such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), biofuel, solar panels and batteries.

Reducing logistics emissions

Transporting the equipment for 24 races around the world is no small feat.

As part of Formula 1’s efforts to reduce travel and logistics emissions, it has made improvements to the geographical flow of races around the world.

The race in Japan will move from September to April, fitting with the Asia Pacific segment of the schedule and Azerbaijan has been moved to align with Singapore.

The Qatar Grand Prix will move to the penultimate race of the season, putting it next to Abu Dhabi.

From 2026, the Canadian Grand Prix will be hosted earlier in the year and the Monaco Grand Prix will take place on the first full weekend in June, consolidating the European leg of the season to remove an additional transatlantic crossing.

Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said: “The change will make the future flow of our calendar not only more sustainable, but logistically more sensible for our teams and personnel.

“Our net zero by 2030 commitment continues to be a priority for us as a sport and it is thanks to changes like this that we are on track to hitting our goal.”

Formula 1’s social initiatives

In 2021, the Hamilton Commission proposed 10 recommendations including the implementation of a Diversity and Inclusion charter.

Formula 1, the FIA and all 10 F1 teams have now signed the charter, aiming to improve diversity and inclusion across motorsport with initiatives like scholarships, apprenticeships and access for those from underrepresented communities.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh delivered a candid message at an industry event in Phoenix, signaling a need to reassess the sector's sustainability roadmap.

At the 77th IATA Annual General Meeting in Boston, U.S., on October 4, 2021, IATA member airlines passed a resolution committing them to achieving net-zero carbon emissions from their operations by 2050. Bold promises marked that historic moment when the global aviation industry began recovering from the COVID-19 crisis. Today, however, that enthusiasm appears to be waning.

Before a diverse audience of financiers, lessors, banks, and industry stakeholders, Walsh acknowledged for the first time that the sector is unlikely to meet its long-standing target.

This admission not only marks a turning point for IATA but also raises fundamental questions about the feasibility of the industry’s current sustainability plans. Let's dive in.

The Roadblock: Sustainable Aviation Fuels

The development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) have been central to the industry's strategy for reducing emissions. Despite some progress—increasing production numbers that, while doubling in recent years, still represent only a tiny fraction of overall jet fuel demand—the slow pace of SAF adoption has become a critical concern.

Walsh’s remarks pointed directly to these challenges, noting that the anticipated growth in SAF production has not materialized quickly enough to sustain the aggressive 2050 timeline.

Industry analysts and executives, including Aviation Week’s Jens Flottau and senior editors Joe Anselmo and Christine Boynton, have long warned that the path to net zero was built on overly ambitious assumptions—have a listen to the podcast episode where the editors discuss Walsh's acknowledgement of this.

The signs were already present in 2023. According to an assessment by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), it would be difficult to accomplish the previous White House administration's target of meeting 100% of U.S. jet fuel demand with biofuels by 2050 due to sustainability and supply issues.

The CBD is a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 1.7 million members and online activists dedicated to protecting endangered species and wild places.

According to the report, the majority of the feedstocks being evaluated for the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) would negatively impact the environment or the climate. The report adds that the development of renewable fuels alone cannot achieve the ambitious SAF production target.

“Once you examine the data, the aviation biofuels boon looks more like a boondoggle,” said John Fleming, Ph.D., a scientist at the Center’s Climate Law Institute and the lead author of the report.

“Aviation is inarguably one of the toughest sectors to decarbonize, but that’s exactly why we need a diversified, comprehensive approach. For Biden to put all our eggs in the biofuels basket is a reckless disregard of climate reality.”

To further complicate the matter, setting a 2050 target can seem disingenuous given that airplanes last, on average, a little over 20 years and that technologies won't likely be widely available for fleet adoption until the 2040s.

Walsh's acknowledgment, therefore, while surprising in its timing, confirms what many in the industry have feared: without a substantial breakthrough in sustainable fuel technology, the 2050 target will remain an elusive goal.

Political, Regulatory Shifts

The evolution of this narrative is set against a backdrop of shifting political and regulatory climates. In 2021, environmental mandates and policies—especially those pushed by the Biden administration and European governments—compelled airlines to pursue aggressive emissions reduction strategies.

However, those external pressures have eased in many regions, particularly in the United States, as political priorities shift away from stringent sustainability mandates.

Despite these changes, European and Asian regulatory frameworks continue to impose strict emissions and SAF quotas. Walsh’s comments have already sparked concerns about potential conflicts with governments that insist on maintaining rigorous environmental standards.

Furthermore, Bain & Co. partner Jim Harris pointed out in his July 2022 op-ed for Aviation Week that, according to a study on future aviation propulsion technologies, SAF production costs and supply availability would fall short of meeting aviation needs, even with government mandates and incentives encouraging early adoption and investment.

And let's not forget the time when seasoned Captain Ben K told the Marshall Skill Academy that while it was part of the push toward sustainability, “SAF is not completely carbon neutral; there are emissions when it’s refined and then transported to the airports.”

“You also still need to grow plants to make it – which takes up things like water, farm space, labour costs, and so on. This is why ‘lifecycle emissions’ is a phrase that pops up a lot in SAF press releases.”

This disconnect between industry projections, alternative fuel production, and regulatory demands will inform further debate in upcoming meetings, including the IATA General Assembly slated for June in Delhi.

Airlines, Manufacturers' Response

Even as Walsh’s comments cast doubt on the feasibility of the 2050 goal, major airlines have reiterated their commitment to sustainability.

U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DL), Southwest Airlines (WN), American Airlines (AA), and United Airlines (UA) have all confirmed that they will adhere to their net-zero targets, underscoring the importance of sustained investments in technology and innovation.

Efforts to drive progress are already underway. United Airlines, for instance, has launched a Sustainable Flight Fund to support startups working on SAF development and new aviation technologies.

Meanwhile, innovative projects such as JetZero—a blended wing body prototype poised to offer significant efficiency gains—offer a glimpse into the potential future of cleaner air travel.

Aircraft manufacturers and regulatory bodies like the ICAO have also intensified their efforts. Recent meetings have produced recommendations to tighten emissions standards and accelerate the certification of new sustainable fuel pathways.

In 2024, Boeing announced a collaboration with NASA and UA to conduct in-flight tests to measure the impact of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on contrails and non-carbon emissions.

The second ecoDemonstrator Explorer by Boeing, a Boeing 737-10 plane designated for UA, underwent testing using 100% SAF and traditional jet fuel stored in separate tanks. NASA's DC-8 Airborne Science Lab followed the commercial aircraft to evaluate the emissions and contrail ice particles generated by each fuel type.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, Airbus and a consortium of industry leaders co-invested in a SAF financing fund to accelerate the production of green fuel. Airbus Canada, Pratt & Whitney Canada, and SAF+ Consortium also announced a joint project called CADAQ-100 to develop next-generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in collaboration with the Government of Quebec.

The combined companies agreed to invest over C$17m (US$12.5m) in the project. To be sure, lowering CO2 emissions is a battle on many fronts, and the aviation industry is leading the way.

A Wake Up Call

Four billion passengers are moved by air annually, and the industry supports more than 60 million jobs worldwide. Despite an annual increase in flights, the aviation industry has invested heavily in new technology and operational methods, significantly reducing its carbon emissions, which is 2-3% of global carbon emissions (motor vehicles account for 83% of global emissions).

However, Walsh’s remarks serve as a wake-up call for the aviation industry. He risks reducing the external pressure that has driven critical innovations over the past few years by admitting that the current timeline is likely unachievable.

The industry now faces the dual challenge of reconciling realistic technological advancements with stringent environmental regulations. While the short-term outlook appears grim, continued collaboration between airlines, manufacturers, and governments could still pave the way for meaningful progress toward sustainable aviation.

As aviation enthusiasts, we have to acknowledge that, compared to the early passenger jet models that entered service in the 1950s, today's aircraft are over 80% more fuel-efficient. I say leave it to the engineers.

As for SAF, it is not a panacea to curtail aviation's CO2 emissions, and yet, the aviation industry relies heavily on SAF to achieve net zero by 2050. Therefore, I agree with Harris' assumption that, unless we are ready to cap aviation traffic, the industry will eventually need to accelerate the adoption of other technologies into its fleet, which will take more than expected or proposed.

A poll conducted last year at the 'IBA Webinar: Net Zero for Aviation - An Impossible Target?' showed that 47% of attendees saw 2080 as a more realistic date. SAF plants are growing in capacity, and 53 airports worldwide are distributing SAFs.

Whether from biofuels, advanced biofuels converted from waste products, or synthetic liquid fuels, the SAF promise is just that. Experts say there will not be enough supply for many years. In 2021, 125m liters of SAF were produced—449m liters are needed by 2050. Unless there's a breakthrough, it's not going to happen.

The companion Center for Biological Diversity 2020 report, Flight Path, outlines feasible solutions, including improving aircraft fuel efficiency, making operational and regulatory improvements, and achieving ""ambitious advancements"" toward a fully electrified aviation sector.

What is SAF?

Sustainable aviation fuel is a waste-derived or renewable fuel that helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

It is made from feedstocks like agricultural and forestry waste, algae, used cooking oil and municipal solid waste to help decarbonise the aviation industry.

SAF is helping the logistics industry to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and promote a circular economy by significantly reducing lifestyle CO2 emissions.

It is also compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure (drop-in fuel), meaning it represents a viable alternative in the transition to a greener future.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/58b171eef770ba2cd097cca249ca6ccf:e3e6f846b18f9d396f4f6d294f288ed9/mercedes-benz-shipments-1-credit-db-schenker-torsten-zimmermann.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 12:52:48.411882

This is another important goal we have achieved to fulfil our commitments to reduce carbon emissions and support less polluting air transport,” said David Ciceo, General Manager of Cluj International Airport.

With nearly 3.3 million passengers in 2024, Avram Iancu Airport in Cluj is the largest regional airport in Romania. As part of efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, in addition to supplying sustainable aviation fuel, the airport has also acquired two electric aircraft de-icing/anti-icing vehicles and an electric bus to ensure passengers’ transport from the terminal to the planes.

How sustainable fuels are produced

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are fuels produced by processing renewable raw materials, such as used oils and animal fats. Using advanced refining processes and green hydrogen, these materials are transformed to have characteristics similar to conventional kerosene. SAF can be dropped straight into existing infrastructure and aircraft. It has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces. SAF will play a really important role in meeting the aviation industry’s carbon reduction targets.

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates the use of sustainable aviation fuels on European Union airports in a minimum proportion of 2% starting January 1, 2025, with a gradual increase in the use of SAF up to 6% by 2030.",https://energyindustryreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OMV-Petrom-Provides-SAF-for-Planes-at-Cluj-International-Airport.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 12:52:58.303676

This significant purchase is expected to cut CO2e emissions by 40,000 tons for Mercedes-Benz and will power air shipments from Frankfurt to China, reinforcing the companies’ commitment to sustainable logistics and the drive toward carbon neutrality.

(PRESS RELEASE) ESSEN/STUTTGART, 12-Mar-2025 — /EuropaWire/ — In a landmark move for green logistics, DB Schenker has supplied Mercedes-Benz with its largest ever order of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marking a new chapter in low-emission air freight. This record-setting agreement involves the procurement of approximately 13,000 tons of SAF, which is projected to reduce Mercedes-Benz’s CO2e emissions by 40,000 tons. The biofuel will power air shipments from Frankfurt to key destinations in China, including Beijing and Shanghai.

This collaboration builds on a long-established partnership between DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz, spanning decades across various transport modes such as land, air, ocean, and warehouse management. Thorsten Meincke, Global Board Member for Air & Ocean Freight at DB Schenker, emphasized the significance of this agreement:

“Achieving carbon neutrality is a long-haul journey. Our new biofuel agreement with our trusted partner Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark for sustainability commitments. By working together, we are actively and immediately reducing emissions in intercontinental supply chains. This contract represents one of the largest-ever SAF deals in the entire automotive and logistics industries globally. I look forward to seeing more customers join us.”

Elke Pusskeiler, Head of Supply Chain Management at Mercedes-Benz AG, underscored the importance of this initiative as part of the company’s broader “Ambition 2039” strategy. She noted that the focus on CO2 avoidance and reduced emissions across all transport modes is vital for reaching their sustainability targets:

“Utilizing Sustainable Aviation Fuel for air freight allows us to cut emissions. Together with DB Schenker, we made another significant achievement in our efforts for sustainable logistics.”

The SAF used in this partnership is derived from waste materials such as used frying oil and is produced without certified palm oil, ensuring an average 80% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Although SAF is more costly—currently three to five times the price of fossil-based fuel—it offers a tangible solution to diminish the environmental impact of air transport. The established process of virtual allocation ensures that each ton of SAF used translates directly into an equivalent reduction of conventional kerosene consumption.

This breakthrough agreement not only highlights the potential of SAF in reducing aviation emissions but also reinforces the commitment of both DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz to driving sustainable change in the global supply chain.

Further information for editors

CO2e avoidance: The amount of CO2e released during combustion in the jet engine is equal to the amount of CO2e removed from the atmosphere during the photosynthesis phase of the plants employed to produce the oil the SAF is refined from. While the actual physical insertion of SAF might occur on different flights and airports, the respective amount of conventional kerosene is avoided. This established process is called virtual allocation.

Calculation: The method for calculating life cycle emissions and their reductions complies with the EU Renewable Energy Directive II (2018/2001/EU). These are accounted for under Scope 3.

Financial commitment: DB Schenker only uses biofuel which is certified palm oil free. Currently, the market price for SAF is 3-5 times more expensive than regular fossil-based fuel.

Airline partners: The SAF utilized for Mercedes-Benz’ supply chain is being utilized on several globally operating carriers.

Huawei has unveiled a comprehensive suite of intelligent transformation solutions as part of its broader strategy to accelerate industrial intelligence across multiple industries. The announcements came during the Mobile World Congress (MWC) Barcelona 2025, where the company showcased 83 global transformation showcases spanning 71 key scenarios.

The company launched 10 major solutions jointly developed with partners, including the Smart Railway Yard & Station Solution and Intelligent Multi-level Port Operation Management Solution.

Much of the focus of the event was on the digital transformation of industry, with Leo Chen, Huawei’s Corporate Senior Vice President and President of Enterprise Sales, outlining four key pathways the company believes are essential to accelerating what it calls ‘intelligent transformation’. “Firstly, we must deeply integrate technologies into industry scenarios and build a target ICT architecture for industrial intelligent transformation based on industry requirements, pain points and development stages,” Chen stated.

The other pathways include building advanced AI-oriented infrastructure to support exponential growth in AI workloads, developing high performance AI products that seamlessly integrate with open-source models and training ICT talent in a more targeted manner.

These solutions could significantly impact transport operations by addressing persistent challenges in real-time operations management, passenger flow optimisation and infrastructure monitoring.

AI infrastructure for transport environments

Huawei’s new AI inference appliances, which support over 50 mainstream large models, are designed to make advanced AI capabilities more accessible to transport sector customers. By simplifying deployment, the company aims to lower the adoption barrier for intelligent applications in complex operational environments.

The Huawei Enterprise Business exhibition area at MWC featured three themes: Accelerating Industrial Intelligence, Innovative ICT Infrastructure, and Partner Collaboration for Mutual Success. The showcase highlighted integration of digital and intelligent technologies, including those specifically developed for transport applications.

Talent development key to success

A significant component of Huawei’s strategy involves addressing the talent shortage that often hampers digital transformation efforts in sectors like transportation. The company announced two new talent development initiatives: the Industry Elites in the ICT Classroom Programme for enterprise customers and the Leading ICT Talent Cultivation Programme for universities.

These programmes aim to cultivate professionals who can bridge the gap between industry-specific challenges and technological solutions – a critical need as airports increasingly rely on integrated digital systems.

Industry challenge data

Data presented at the summit highlighted that 83% of digital transformation projects stumble due to failures in data products, while 52% of enterprise systems cannot access or integrate with intelligent platforms.

According to Huawei, its approach attempts to address these challenges by focusing on eliminating operational silos and establishing clear security frameworks – particularly important for airport environments where security protocols must seamlessly integrate with operational efficiency.

Intelligent transformation in the real world

Several customers from adjacent industries provided testimonials about their experiences with Huawei’s intelligent transformation solutions. Gil Brasileiro Fernandes, ICT Services Manager at Petrobras, noted: “Digital innovation is not just a choice, but the path to a more efficient, safer and sustainable future.”

The principles outlined by Petrobras – investing in robust infrastructure, prioritising solutions that enhance efficiency and safety, and transforming connectivity into a competitive advantage – align closely with the priorities of transport customers.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0752-1.jpeg,N,,2025-03-12 12:53:13.053502

ReFuelEU is part of the Fit for 55 package, which is the EU’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to a 1990 baseline and to reach net-zero by 2050.

The ReFuelEU aviation rules require EU airports and fuel suppliers to ensure that at least 2% of aviation fuels are “green” by 2025, increasing to 6% in 2030, 20% in 2035, 34% in 2040, 42% in 2045, and 70% in 2050.

The rules also require a proportion of the fuel mix to be comprised of synthetic fuels, such as e-kerosene. The requirement for synthetic fuels is set at 1.2% in 2030, 2% in 2032, 5% in 2035 and progressively reaches 35% in 2050.

The ReFuelEU regulations have been criticised by many in the biofuels industry for excluding crop-based aviation fuels, according to the report.

In May 2024, the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), Growth Energy, the US Grains Council (USGC) and SAF technology company LanzaJet sought to intervene in the challenge in support of ePURE and Pannonia Bio, Ethanol Producer wrote.

In its ruling, the General Court of the EU said that ePURE and Pannonia Bio did not have a legal right to bring the challenge, the report said.

As the underlying challenge was dismissed, the objections to the EU regulations raised by the RFA, Growth Energy, USGC and LanzaJet were not considered by the court.

“We are disappointed by the court’s decision and strongly disagree with its finding that biofuel producers in the EU and United States – who manufacture the renewable fuels that become SAF – are somehow not harmed or affected by the EU’s unfair and unscientific SAF requirements,” the US groups were quoted as saying.

“We will continue exploring options with our partners in Europe to address the biased nature and punitive effects of the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation.”

RFA had also petitioned the EGC to intervene in a separate challenge brought by EU producers against the FuelEU Maritime regulation, which also excludes crop-based biofuels from inclusion in the EU’s regulatory programme to decarbonise maritime fuels, the report said.

The underlying challenge to the FuelEU Maritime regulation – and RFA’s petition to intervene – were also dismissed by the Court.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/EU-jpeg-sized.jpg?mtime=1685521489,N,,2025-03-12 06:50:15.132479
