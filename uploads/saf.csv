A fuel dump over Los Angeles, intended to reduce risk during an emergency landing, left a trail of controversy. The airline's $78.75 million settlement to resolve claims of property damage and health impacts has since become a case study in how regulatory and reputational risks are reshaping airline valuations and ESG-aligned investment strategies.

The Incident and Its Aftermath

On January 14, 2020, Delta Flight 89 jettisoned 15,000 pounds of jet fuel over densely populated areas after an engine failure. While the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cleared the pilots of wrongdoing, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) cited Delta for environmental violations, accusing the airline of exposing communities to harmful pollutants. The settlement, now pending judicial approval, allocates $50.6 million to affected residents and property owners. Beyond the financial toll, the incident raised questions about Delta's adherence to sustainable practices, particularly as the airline markets itself as a leader in decarbonization.

ESG Investing Under Scrutiny

The fuel dump settlement intersects with another high-profile legal challenge: a class-action lawsuit alleging Delta's “carbon-neutral” claims are misleading. Critics argue the airline's reliance on carbon offsets—criticized for inaccuracy and impermanence—fails to address its true emissions. This case, alongside similar lawsuits against United and American Airlines, underscores a growing skepticism toward corporate ESG claims. Investors are increasingly demanding verifiable, science-based targets rather than voluntary offsets.

Regulatory and Reputational Risks

Regulatory shifts are amplifying these risks. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signaled a narrower view of ESG disclosures, while state-level lawsuits, such as those targeting asset managers for ESG-driven divestment from coal, hint at broader political resistance. For airlines, the Spence v. American Airlines case—where a court ruled ESG investing in employee retirement plans breached fiduciary duties—sets a precedent that could deter companies from prioritizing non-pecuniary ESG goals.

Reputational damage, meanwhile, is harder to quantify but equally impactful. A 2024 academic study found that ESG misalignment can erode firm value by undermining trust. Delta's dual legal battles—over environmental claims and seat transparency—risk tarnishing its brand, particularly as consumers and investors grow more discerning.

Implications for Airline Valuations

The aviation sector's ESG transition is fraught with contradictions. While Delta invests in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fuel-efficient aircraft, incidents like the fuel dump highlight the gap between ambition and execution. For investors, the key question is whether airlines can align their ESG strategies with financial performance.

Data shows a divergence: airlines with robust ESG frameworks, such as Southwest and Alaska, have seen valuation premiums, while those facing greenwashing allegations lag. Delta's recent 25% dividend hike—a signal of financial resilience—may offset some reputational damage, but long-term credibility hinges on transparency.

Investment Advice: Navigating the ESG Maze

For ESG-aligned investors, the Delta case offers three lessons:

1. Demand Accountability: Scrutinize companies' use of carbon offsets and ensure they prioritize direct emissions reductions (Scope 1 and 2).

2. Monitor Regulatory Trends: The SEC's evolving stance on ESG disclosures could reshape airline valuations.

3. Balance ESG and Financial Metrics: While ESG criteria enhance risk management, they must align with profitability. Airlines like Delta that blend innovation (e.g., blended-wing-body aircraft) with tangible sustainability goals may outperform peers.

Conclusion

Delta's fuel dump settlement and carbon neutrality litigation exemplify the challenges of integrating ESG into traditional industries. As regulatory scrutiny intensifies and consumer expectations evolve, airlines must prove their ESG commitments are more than marketing tools. For investors, the path forward lies in rigorous due diligence—favoring companies that marry sustainability with verifiable financial returns. In an era where reputational risks can eclipse operational ones, the aviation sector's ESG journey is far from over.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 22:56:08.490168

“We have demonstrated that by only re-routing a very small subset of those flights we could have a very significant impact.
This body of activity within the industry, despite the various uncertainties that remain, is enough to ­encourage those seeking action on aviation’s non-CO2 impact that momentum is increasing.","There is a cruel irony that one of the most visible parts of aviation’s impact on the ­environment has been one of the hardest to pin down in terms of its exact nature and the action required to mitigate its climate effect.

Contrails form the biggest part of the bucket of non-carbon dioxide (CO2) environmental impacts resulting from ­aviation, alongside nitrogen oxide, sulphur oxide, and soot particles.

But while contrails can often be seen with the naked eye, the science behind their formation and environmental impact is far less clear.

“The formation, persistence, and spread of contrails into cirrus clouds are subject to significant uncertainties,” writes KPMG, in a wide-ranging report on aviation’s non-CO2 impacts commissioned by the UK Department for Transport and co-produced with Cranfield University and SATAVIA (now part of GE Aerospace unit Aerospace Carbon Solutions).

“Factors such as the exact composition of aircraft exhaust, atmospheric humidity, and ambient temperature play critical roles in contrail development,” it adds.

Contrails are formed when an aircraft passes through Ice ­Super Saturated Regions (ISSRs), where water ­droplets emitted from the engine freeze. Around one in 20 flights is estimated to generate persistent ­contrails, which can last for several hours.

Persistent contrails can develop into cirrus clouds, which have a warming or cooling effect on the planet – either trapping hot air in, or reflecting sunlight away. While there is broadly consensus that there is a net warming effect from contrails, particularly at night when there is no sun to reflect heat away, agreement is harder to find on the exact impact and timeframe over which that should be considered.

SCIENTIFIC PICTURE

Speaking during a panel debate on the issue of ­contrails during the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) Sustainability Conference in June, Mark Stettler, professor of transport and environment at Imperial College London, said that despite the ­uncertainties there is a clear scientific picture.

“It is true that there are remaining and persisting uncertainties in the overall magnitude of the ­effect from contrails,” he says. “But it’s also true the ­uncertainty bar – even if you take the lowest point on that – is still a significant part of aviation’s ­climate impact.

“The opportunity is very significant,” he adds. “If we were to be able to avoid forming contrails then we would get rid of [not only] a very significant proportion of aviation’s climate impact, but also a very significant proportion of the earth anthropogenic impact on the climate.”

While CO2 effects have an accumulated impact, the short lifespan of contrails means the warming effect would be wiped out if they could be avoided.

Targets are in place to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, along with European mandates on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use, but so far there is limited regulation in place for non-CO2 emissions.

However, since the start of this year, a requirement for airlines to report their non-CO2 emissions was added to the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS). Initially mandated on all flights within the European Economic Area (EEA) – as well as Switzerland and the UK – airlines must provide the data under the Monitor, Report & Verify programme.

That will be expanded to flights from the EEA to third countries from 2027, although airlines can ­p­rovide that data on a voluntary basis before then.

That regulators in Europe are looking at non-CO2 emissions is unsurprising, given the EU’s track record of pushing environmental legislation and since Europe has relatively high levels of contrail formation.

Airline bodies though flag the risk of regulating without further understanding of the issues.

In a position paper, IATA says including non-CO2 provisions in the EU ETS or other such schemes is “premature”. It argues that in the absence of “accurate measurements and commercially available solutions”, to do so risks creating market distortions, adding operational complexity, reducing connectivity and producing negative climate-related trade-offs.

DEEPER UNDERSTANDING

IATA, which has been calling for “urgent action” to deepen understanding into contrails and their impact, is partnering with various stakeholders to research how to monitor and report non-CO2 emissions.

One moving part in the analysis is understanding what improvements in aircraft and engine technology, and a move to different fuel types like SAF, mean for non-CO2 emissions.

Industry partners have come together on several projects that have included research to better understand the impact of SAF on contrail formation. These include Boeing’s second Explorer Ecodemonstrator, a 737 Max 10 for United Airlines, in late 2023, and the ECLIF3 and VOLCAN flight test projects on Airbus narrowbody and A350 aircraft respectively.

Airbus says indications are there is an up to 25% reduction in ice-crystal formation from using SAF, but more research is needed. It has now teamed with engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, German aerospace research centre DLR, SAF specialist Neste, and several universities on the EU-funded PACIFIC project. This will further study the impact of fuels and the engine cycle on non-CO2 emissions.

The airframer, which remains an advocate for hydrogen power in the long term, has used a hydrogen-powered modified glider to study contrails produced by these propulsion systems. It hopes to report data from the Airbus UpNext Blue Condor project this year.

Other recent contrail research initiatives include by GE Aerospace, which was a partner on both the Boeing Ecodemonstrator and the ECLIF and VOLCAN Airbus projects, last November teaming with NASA and the DLR on the contrail optical depth experiment (CODEX) project. These flights involved NASA’s Gulfstream III research aircraft trailing GE’s 747 flying testbed and scanning its wake with LiDAR sensors.

“Teams were able to collect 3D imaging on ­contrails from all four CF6 engines using LiDAR at a ­variety of distances, as well as data on the surrounding ­atmospheric conditions to assist in calibrating ­predictive models,” says GE.

“More detailed LiDAR imaging helps improve ­understanding of how contrails form and behave over time. Also, the optical depth can be used to estimate their net warming effect,” it says. “When combined with the detailed atmospheric data gathered by onboard sensors and radio drops, the accuracy of contrail predictive models is improved.”

GE adds that learnings from CODEX are being applied to new combustion and engine technologies in its RISE programme to reduce non-CO2 emissions.

There also has been ongoing research and trials around contrail avoidance, particularly through ­altering flight altitudes.

Eurocontrol’s Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC), which manages the upper airspace over ­Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and ­northwest Germany, was the first to carry out a ­large-scale operational contrail mitigation trial in 2021, conducted during the night across all MUAC airspace in collaboration with the DLR.

The effort concluded that contrails could be prevented by taking practical measures such as adjusting the flight level of an aircraft, and highlighted that further research was necessary in areas including enhanced weather predictions and more automated ­decision-making processes.

MUAC has since conducted the first large-scale, ­real-time contrail prevention simulation comparing two operational concepts: mitigation by airlines through flight planning around contrail areas; and tactical vertical clearances by air traffic controllers.

“While both options are possible, the preferred option is pre-planned contrail avoidance. If contrail avoidance is to be carried out during periods of high traffic, additional capacity will be required,” MUAC says.

It has also developed a ground camera system to monitor the effectiveness of weather forecasts in ­relation to contrail development and is partnering with Google to utilise this satellite imagery and ­artificial intelligence to predict regions where ­contrails may develop.

“This information is being used as part of an ­operational flight trial, allowing us to provide tactical clearances for contrail mitigation at night during summer and autumn 2025,” MUAC says.

Some of MUAC’s work has been done as part of the CICONIA programme, a three-year SESAR Joint Undertaking project looking into mitigating the impact of aviation’s non-CO2 emissions. The wide-ranging programme has 15 participants, including Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Swiss International Air Lines and UK air traffic management body NATS.

“We’ve got a number of validation exercises [that] are ongoing. We are starting to see some really good results from that,” Sian Andrews, SESAR environmental lead at NATS, said during the RAeS Sustainability Conference.

MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES

Much of the initial opportunity for contrail mitigation is on quieter periods, as there is more scope to make alterations. There is a particular focus on night flights, given that this is a quieter time for flight activity, and that it fits with the bigger environmental opportunity of mitigating contrails given there is no cooling effect from reflection at night.

“What we are looking at, as we have developed the concept of operations within CICONIA, is a kind of step one, where are saying when it is a bit easier, when the traffic density is a bit lower, what can we do? And we think we can do quite a bit, we can get some significant results, and we are maturing that,” says Andrews.

Work is also continuing on what can be done when traffic levels are busier, while Andrews points to the wider importance of addressing contrails over the North Atlantic in particular.

“The North Atlantic is a very strong case for contrail mitigation, partly because it is very ­susceptible to ISSRs and the amount of traffic that is passing over the North Atlantic, especially at night, is quite high,” she says.

French carrier Amelia has been working on contrail avoidance with Thales and Breakthrough Energy Contrails for the last year and has already delivered notable environmental savings.

“Just focusing on some Amelia flights for a few months, we have saved several hundred tonnes of equivalent CO2 through the contrails we have avoided generating,” explains Julien Lopez, head of green operations within Thales’s avionics division.

Amelia has been working with Thales since 2022 on first evaluating its wider environmental impact, and since last summer on contrail avoidance. After initially demonstrating that contrail mitigation could work on Amelia’s scheduled service between Paris and Valladolid in northern Spain, Thales subsequently automated the process and Amelia has since February been deploying it progressively across its flights.

“Now it is fully automatic other than there is still a manual dispatcher of every flight-plan optimisation we propose,” explains Lopez.

As of mid-May, contrail avoidance had been implemented on around 50 out of roughly 1,700 Amelia flights assessed. That is in line with wider data on the number of flights causing persistent contrails.

“Contrails are generated by a very small portion of flights, so you can modify only a small ­portion of flights and have a very significant impact on ­contrails and on the whole climate impact of ­aviation,” notes Lopez.

CLEAR BENEFIT

One of the challenges of changing flight plans is the additional fuel, and therefore CO2 emissions, ­incurred in the new routing. “Usually, based on all the mitigation we have made, extra fuel was in the range of less than 1%,” he says. “So, for the about 700t of CO2 equivalent saved, we have generated only 0.3t of extra CO2.”

Validation work is carried out after a flight, as the model is re-run using actual weather data rather than the forecast. “On average we lose about 10% of the benefits because of the lack of precision of the forecast data,” Lopez explains. “But when you consider the gain we can make, that is still very consistent.

“Clearly the next step is to move from a flight-­per-flight basis with a single airline to an airspace ­approach in a co-ordinated way with air traffic ­management and airlines,” he says.

This is where Thales’s work on another SESAR Joint Undertaking project, CONCERTO, has a role to play. The initiative, which covers nine countries in northern Europe and involves 23 partners, aims to develop solutions to reduce CO2 emissions and introduce the management of non-CO2 impacts into daily operations.

Lopez says that CONCERTO has, based on a ­large-scale simulation, validated an ­operational concept to make contrail avoidance feasible at an airspace level. “We have demonstrated that by only re-routing a very small subset of those flights we could have a very significant impact. It is very promising,” Lopez says, noting the results will be published shortly.

This body of activity within the industry, despite the various uncertainties that remain, is enough to ­encourage those seeking action on aviation’s non-CO2 impact that momentum is increasing.

“We have been talking about it for a long time,” noted Tim Johnson, director of UK NGO Aviation Environment Federation during a panel debate at the Airbus Summit in late March.

“It feels different this time. It feels like the ­momentum is not just within Europe, it seems to be global. The interest has spread to ICAO. I don’t think this time we’re going to go back, having spiked the ­public’s interest and having these operational ­responses and trials.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/1/8/3/112183_contrailscgeoffreyswaine_shutterstock_8253_crop.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 22:56:14.745299

Qantas and Jetstar deliver best on time performance since 2019; Qantas most on time major domestic airline for FY25

Results Overview – Comments from Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson

“For everyone across the Qantas Group, this year has been all about delivery. While we are pleased with the progress we are making, we remain focused on further improving our performance and continuing to deliver for our customers, people and shareholders.

“Continuing strong demand across all market segments, combined with our dual brand strategy, helped the Group grow earnings. Qantas and Jetstar carried four million more customers during the year, while our Loyalty business grew as frequent flyers engaged with the program more than ever before.

“Our strong financial performance is enabling significant investment in new aircraft and customer initiatives, helping deliver better operational performance and customer satisfaction across both airlines.

“Jetstar had a standout year, with its fleet renewal providing a significant boost to earnings. In a high cost of living environment, Jetstar continued to provide value for customers, with around one in three travelling for under $100.

“Despite the strong performance across the Group, we saw some costs rise above the rate of inflation, which reduced the benefits of lower fuel. Transformation remains a priority given ongoing increases in airport and government charges, engineering and supply chain costs and the impact of Same Job Same Pay legislation.

“I want to thank our people who serve our customers with passion every day. They are the real stars of our performance and we are introducing a new employee share plan so they can share in our success.

“As well as rewarding our employees, we have also resumed paying dividends. We have announced we will pay a base final dividend of $250 million and a special dividend of $150 million, taking dividends for the full year to $800 million.

“Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about. This year will see an acceleration of Qantas’ domestic fleet renewal and in the coming years we’ll take delivery of additional A321XLR aircraft fitted with lie-flat Business seats. We will also be using more Sustainable Aviation Fuel from overseas airports while we continue efforts with Government and industry to establish a SAF industry in Australia.

“Direct flights from the east coast of Australia to London and New York are also a step closer to reality, with the first Project Sunrise A350-1000ULR aircraft to enter the final assembly line in the coming months, and the first aircraft delivery expected in October next year.”

Group Domestic

The Group’s dual brand strategy continues to provide value for both the premium and low fares segments of the market, with Group Domestic delivering $1.52 billion in Underlying EBIT, up 12 per cent from the prior year, at a margin of 14 per cent.

Qantas Domestic unit revenue increased 5 per cent, comprising a 3.5 percentage point improvement from higher seat factors and increased business-purpose travel, plus 1.5 percentage points from yield improvements. Qantas’ charter revenue increased 9 per cent, helped by the arrival of five additional Airbus A319 aircraft during the year to service the resources market in Western Australia.

QantasLink also received five new A220s during the year, which are on track to deliver up to $9 million additional annual EBITDA benefit per aircraft over the 717 aircraft they have replaced, once the fleet reaches scale. The regional carrier’s transition to an all-Q400 turboprop fleet continued during the year, with all Q200 and Q300 aircraft now retired.

Qantas’ first two A321XLRs are expected to enter service on its domestic network in mid-September, making it the first airline in the Asia Pacific to operate the new aircraft type.

Engineering, wages, airport and government charges were the major contributors to higher costs. New aircraft transition and entry into service costs were also higher, but these are expected to decrease as new fleet types reach scale.

Jetstar carried a record 16 million passengers domestically, helping it deliver a 55 per cent increase in Underlying EBIT. This was enabled by new aircraft, strong demand which helped increase seat factor by 2 percentage points and lower fuel prices. New aircraft also provided customer benefits including inflight streaming and more onboard baggage space.

Following the closure of Jetstar Asia last month, its 13 A320 aircraft will be progressively redeployed across Jetstar Australia, Jetstar New Zealand and QantasLink to support fleet renewal, replace leased aircraft and support growth. The first of these aircraft will enter service next month.

Group International and Freight

The sustained growth in demand for international travel and the addition of new routes helped Group International achieve a 20 per cent improvement in Underlying EBIT to $903 million.

Qantas International capacity increased by 6 per cent, with the return of another A380, while unit revenue turned positive in the fourth quarter[4]. Strong demand for premium cabins across its international network continued into the second half, with a 2 percentage point increase in seat factors across First, Business and Premium Economy cabins.

The strong financial performance and customer satisfaction on existing ultra long haul routes, including to Europe and the United States, continues to provide confidence ahead of Project Sunrise. Work on Qantas’ first A350-1000ULR is progressing, with the aircraft entering the final assembly line in Toulouse, France in October 2025. The first aircraft is due to be delivered in October 2026[5]. The aircraft will fly the first non-stop ultra long haul commercial flight in the first half of calendar year 2027.

Elevated engineering and supply chain costs, higher wages due to the Same Job Same Pay legislation and preparation for the return of Qantas’ final A380s were the major contributors to higher costs.

Jetstar carried around 25 per cent more customers internationally to and from Australia than the prior year, enabled by similar growth across its international network, with particularly positive performance into Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The airline launched 11 new international routes during the year, supported by the delivery of seven new A321LR and four A320neo aircraft, opening up more options for low fares holidays for Australians.

Jetstar’s refurbished Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet will commence flying towards the end of the current financial year. Its A321XLRs will begin to arrive from calendar year 2027 and will be fitted with a two-class cabin for medium haul international travel.

Net freight revenue grew 7 per cent year on year, despite global trade uncertainty, enabled by simplifying Qantas Freight’s fleet and transformation initiatives. Preparations are underway for the first freighter flight at Western Sydney Airport’s 24-hour cargo precinct in mid-calendar year 2026. The new freight facility will help meet growing e-commerce demand and will complement existing operations at Kingsford Smith Airport.

Qantas Loyalty

Growth in active members and strengthening engagement helped Qantas Loyalty achieve 9 per cent Underlying EBIT growth for the full year to $556 million.

Qantas Frequent Flyers earned 10 per cent more Qantas Points and redeemed 8 per cent more compared to the prior year, as program enhancements increased member interaction on the ground and in the air.

Members booked a record number of Flight Reward Seats during the year, with more seats made available on Qantas, Jetstar and partner airlines.

The launch of Classic Plus on domestic flights in December helped accelerate Classic Plus bookings to above one million seats for the year. Around one in three of those bookings were for travel during peak school holiday periods and one in four members who made a Classic Plus booking were redeeming their points on flights for the first time in five years.

There has also been an increase in Jetstar Classic Reward Seats booked following the introduction of the lowest one-way Economy reward seat in Australia, requiring just 5,700 points. This was one of a number of changes announced in January, which also included the first points increase to Classic Reward seats since 2019 and an increase in the number of points frequent flyers can earn when flying Qantas domestically.

Australian businesses continue to see value in partnering with Qantas Loyalty, with more coalition partners joining the program and cash inflows from partners up 10 per cent. David Jones is the latest major Australian brand to join the program and will provide another opportunity for members to earn and redeem points on the ground, while long-term partner Woolworths Group has extended its partnership with the program beyond 2030.

Hotels, Holidays and Tour bookings achieved double digit growth in total transaction value to $1.5 billion, which includes an increase of more than 50 per cent in TripADeal bookings.

Investment in Customer and Operations

The Group invested significantly in customer-focused initiatives during the year, including the arrival of 17 new aircraft, delivering a more reliable, on time and seamless customer experience.

Investments in operational improvements also helped Qantas achieve its best domestic on time performance since 2019, with 82 per cent of flights in the second half departing on time. Jetstar’s on time performance improved by 3 percentage points during the year, with 76 per cent of flights in the second half departing on time. Jetstar’s cancellation rate of less than 2 per cent is its best annual performance in seven years.

Customer satisfaction improved for Qantas and Jetstar, with Qantas’ Net Promoter Score improving by 10 percentage points and Jetstar improving by 6 percentage points. Qantas was awarded Best Airline in Australia/Pacific at the 2025 Skytrax World Airline Awards.

Qantas opened new lounges in Adelaide and Broome and commenced significant upgrades to its Sydney International and Los Angeles Business lounges, and its Auckland lounge. Qantas also activated fast and free international Wi-Fi on South East Asia and trans-Tasman routes, with more markets to be connected during the coming year. Jetstar enhanced its in-app self-service capability, launched tap and go for easy onboard payments and improved its ancillary product offering.

Our People

During the year, the Group invested significantly in training and development initiatives, as well as the ongoing rollout of frontline and corporate technology solutions that allow its people to work more efficiently.

Group employee engagement improved by 7 percentage points in the latest engagement survey[6], putting the organisation 4 points above the global industry average[7].

The Group also continues to reward its people, including a one-off $1,000 Thank You payment to around 25,000 non-executive employees which was made in December 2024 and a new employee share plan announced today, which will see eligible non-executive employees receive $1,000 in Qantas shares on an annual basis, subject to the Group’s financial performance.

Sustainability and Community

Sustainability remains a key priority for the Group as it takes action towards its 2030 sustainability targets. Through its $400 million Climate Fund, the Group has now committed more than $100 million to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other decarbonisation projects. In April, the Group announced a $15 million investment in ClimateTech Partners, an Australian-based venture capital fund investing in climate improvement businesses and projects.

The Group recently expanded its SAF uptake from Los Angeles with an agreement to use more than 100 million litres of SAF over the next three years.

In Australia, a partnership with Sydney Airport and a coalition of large corporate customers enabled the largest ever importation of SAF into the country. This importation was a positive test of Sydney’s fuel infrastructure and further confirmed the industry’s commitment and desire to see investment and policy support for Australian-based SAF supply.

The Group also made improvements to its customer-facing Voluntary Carbon Program during the year, with 70 per cent of the carbon portfolio now made up of nature-based projects, and 50 per cent of the portfolio linked to an Australian-based project.

The Group also continues to expand its support for Australian communities, including entering a new four-year partnership with Surf Life Saving Australia and three-year partnership with the Australian Red Cross during the year. The Group will provide funding for the training of 750 new Red Cross volunteers as part of the partnership, with more than 150 volunteers already trained.

More than $60 million in flight discounts were provided to regional and remote customers via the Resident Fares Program and more than $2 million in grants were given to regional community groups.

Financial Framework and Shareholder Returns

The Group ended the year with $12.2 billion of liquidity, including $2.2 billion in cash, $1.4 billion in committed undrawn facilities and $8.6 billion in unencumbered fleet and other assets.

Net debt increased to $5.0 billion, remaining below the middle of the Group’s target range of $4.6 billion to $5.7 billion, while net capital expenditure totalled $3.9 billion as the Group’s fleet renewal program accelerated.

The Board has approved a final dividend, comprising a fully franked base dividend of $250 million (16.5 cents per share), and a special dividend, also fully franked, of $150 million (9.9 cents per share). The dividends will be paid on 15 October 2025. This is in addition to the $400 million interim dividend announced in February.

Ground handling decision and cyber incident

Earlier this month, the Federal Court finalised the legal case relating to the outsourcing of Qantas’ ground handling in 2020. Qantas has reiterated its apology to affected former employees for the impact that losing their jobs and the subsequent five-year legal process has had on them and their families. In December, Qantas reached an out-of-court settlement with the Union for $120 million in compensation for former employees and has paid the full penalty that was handed down last week.

In June, 5.7 million Qantas customers were impacted by a cyber incident which saw some of their personal data compromised. Additional protections were put in place and the airline continues to support impacted customers, with a support line and specialist identity protection advice available.

LTD. and Velocys Inc. have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishing a strategic partnership to advance production technology for electro-sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF), a CO2-derived synthetic fuel. This partnership combines SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s CO2→CO chemical looping technology with Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch (FT) microchannel reactor technology to enable the manufacture of synthetic fuels using CO2 as a feedstock, thus contributing to decarbonization.

Background

CO2 emissions must be reduced across all industries to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The aviation industry accounts for approximately 2.6% of global CO2 emissions, and a key emission reduction measure that is gaining attention is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other organizations, 65% of CO2 reduction targets for the aviation industry can be achieved through the adoption of SAF. At present, conventional SAF is manufactured from waste oil and biomass-derived raw materials. However, considering the anticipated increase in SAF demand going forward, the early commencement and widespread adoption of e-SAF—which is manufactured from CO2 and hydrogen derived from renewable energy—is considered essential.

In this context, CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) technology, which converts CO2 into fuel and chemical products for practical use, is attracting attention. CCU technology enables the reuse of CO2 as a valuable resource and replaces fossil resources, thereby reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

Strengths of both companies

SEKISUI CHEMICAL is working to reduce global CO2 emissions through the social implementation of CCU technology. To date, it has developed a unique chemical looping technology that converts CO2 into CO with a high reaction yield (90% or higher).

Velocys has been developing FT reaction technology for the manufacture of synthetic fuels from synthetic gas (a mixture of CO and H2) converted from municipal waste, industrial waste, biomass, and CO2 for over 20 years. Its proprietary catalyst and microchannel reactor design have established productivity six to ten times higher than conventional FT reaction technology.

Collaboration overview

This project aims to establish a new e-SAF manufacturing technology by combining SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s proprietary CO2→CO chemical looping reaction technology, which achieves high reaction yields (90% or higher), with Velocys’ FT reaction technology (synthetic gas → synthetic fuel), which achieves high CO conversion rates (90–95%).

In the future, the two companies will work to establish a highly efficient e-SAF manufacturing technology using CO2 as a raw material, thereby contributing to the decarbonization of the aviation industry and the realization of a sustainable society.

Previous initiatives of both companies

■ SEKISUI CHEMICAL

SEKISUI CHEMICAL has achieved a CO reaction yield of 90% or higher using its proprietary CO2→CO chemical looping reaction technology*. It has successfully operated for a cumulative total of six months in a small-scale demonstration using exhaust gas from a steel mill (1 kg- CO2/day) and is currently conducting a survey project (NEDO “International Demonstration Project on Japan’s Technologies for Decarbonization and Energy Transition (Pre-Demonstration Survey)”) aimed at a 10 t- CO2/day scale demonstration.

*This achievement is a result of NEDO’s international joint research and development project (JPNP20005) for innovative technology in the field of clean energy.

■ Velocys

Ara hired George Yong and Teresa O’Flynn as co-heads of infrastructure in 2022 and started fundraising for the infrastructure fund in September of the same year.
The fundraise helped the firm place 11th in the 2025 edition of NPM‘s Impact 50 ranking of the largest private markets impact managers.
To date, Ara has made three investments through the infrastructure fund.","Ara Partners is poised to take advantage of a “buyer’s market” in the decarbonisation industry, following the close of its first infrastructure fund this year, senior managing director Tuan Tran tells New Private Markets.

“What we’re seeing right now is pretty much record dealflow,” Tran says, adding that Ara has a couple of possible transactions in the pipeline and could make an announcement before the end of the year.

The Houston-based private equity firm announced in May that it had raised $800 million for Ara Infrastructure Fund I and associated co-investment vehicles, surpassing a target of $500 million.

“Ultimately, our investors saw that this strategy provided them with a distinctly different exposure to industrial decarbonisation – beyond traditional energy transition investments like wind and solar – while targeting the mid-market segment, which is increasingly overlooked as larger funds shift their focus up-market,” Tran says.

Ara hired George Yong and Teresa O’Flynn as co-heads of infrastructure in 2022 and started fundraising for the infrastructure fund in September of the same year. It reached first close with $100 million in September 2023, before coming to $185 million in September 2024 and $507 million in January this year. It got to final close with $800 million in May.

The fundraise helped the firm place 11th in the 2025 edition of NPM‘s Impact 50 ranking of the largest private markets impact managers. It also reinforced Ara’s view that decarbonisation and financial performance “go hand in hand”, according to Tran.

“We believe we are still in the early innings of this powerful secular trend as critical infrastructure is being built or repurposed to store and transport low-carbon molecules and green electrons,” he says.

To date, Ara has made three investments through the infrastructure fund. It bought a majority stake in renewable fuels logistics company Lincoln Terminals in November 2022, followed by deals for USD Clean Fuels in December 2023 and Irish organic waste recycler Natural Wood Products in February this year.

In other sectors, Tran mentions biofuels, particularly sustainable aviation fuel, and points to possible onshoring deals in the US market as the administration of President Donald Trump moves to enact policies to bolster the domestic supply chain, particularly for rare earths and other critical minerals.

“Ensuring a secure, domestic supply chain and reducing reliance on China is a top priority for them,” Tran says in reference to the Trump administration. “There is significant momentum behind onshoring critical industries, creating American jobs and strengthening national security in these areas.”

Ara, however, is “categorically” not a venture capital firm, instead choosing to focus its investments on the “missing middle”, according to Tran.

“We see superior risk-adjusted returns in the mid-market space, where smaller deals face less competition and lend themselves to bilateral discussions,” he says.

In 2022, for example, Ara acquired Genera Energy, a manufacturer of moulded fibre products, and committed up to $200 million to expand the company’s sustainable pulp and packaging business. In July this year, Genera completed the expansion of its plant in Tennessee at a cost of $340 million.

“We are largely focused on building out these new plants,” Trans says of Ara’s plans after acquisition, adding that budget overruns and construction delays can be “catastrophic” for an investment.

With that in mind, Ara employs experienced operator-builders alongside investment professionals, which give the firm “a decisive edge” when it comes to delivering projects on time and on budget, according to Tran.

“This unique combination is a major differentiator,” he says.",https://media.newprivatemarkets.com/uploads/2025/08/ara.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 18:56:11.384103

Losers: Refiners face RIN bill uncertainty and waiver whiplash Oil refiners without sizable blending or renewable diesel hedges face a higher compliance tab.
The administration’s posture—elevate ethanol and renewable diesel while questioning EV subsidies and mandates—aims to thread a needle between energy transition optics and pump-price politics.
For fuel buyers, more renewable diesel could soften diesel basis in some West Coast and Gulf Coast markets, offset by feedstock-driven cost inflation.
Corporate positioning: who’s hedged, who isn’t Integrated refiners with renewable diesel capacity and trading desks have a structural advantage.","The White House moved to turbocharge biofuels, proposing record 2026 blending quotas that sent soybean oil up 11% to the highest since October 2023 and lit a fire under renewable diesel sentiment. The EPA plan lifts total renewable fuel volumes 8% to 24.02 billion gallons and raises biomass-based diesel targets, while clearing a backlog of small-refinery exemptions that could swing compliance costs. It is a clear political and market play: a win for farm country and biofuel producers, a headache for petroleum refiners, and a fresh catalyst across RIN credits and ag commodities.

Record RFS targets jolt commodities and stocks

The EPA’s proposal sets the 2026 Renewable Fuel Standard at 24.02 billion gallons, up from last year’s mandate and the highest on record. The agency also proposed 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026, roughly 5.61 billion gallons of physical blending, reinforcing a rapid buildout in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel capacity. Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the policy as a domestic economic play: “We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers while mitigating the impact on gas prices and ensuring the continued existence of liquid fuels.” Markets got the message. Soybean oil spiked as traders recalibrated feedstock demand. RINs firmed across the board, signaling a tighter compliance outlook even as small-refinery waivers muddy the supply picture. The geopolitical backdrop adds fuel. Escalating tensions between Israel and Iran have investors hedging fuel security and cost risk, amplifying the bid for alternatives as crude volatility spills into refined products.

Winners: Farm Belt, biofuel producers and feedstock owners

The clear beneficiaries are corn and soy value chains and companies leveraged to blending growth. Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Bunge (BG) gain from stronger crush economics and merchandising volumes. Green Plains (GPRE) and other ethanol producers stand to benefit from higher implied offtake and firmer RIN support for blending. On the diesel side, Darling Ingredients (DAR) remains a pure-play winner through feedstocks and renewable diesel partnerships, while Chevron (CVX), Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Phillips 66 (PSX) gain from vertically integrated renewable diesel platforms that can arbitrage RINs, tax credits and Low Carbon Fuel Standard markets. Farmers get pricing power. A sustained soybean oil rally, if confirmed by the final rule, tightens margins for downstream food producers but transfers value back to the Farm Belt. The administration is betting that a liquid-fuels-first approach—more ethanol and diesel substitutes, fewer EV carrots—keeps pump prices in check and shores up rural support without ceding the energy transition narrative entirely. The risk for producers is operational: if feedstock inflation outpaces RIN and credit support, renewable diesel margins compress, and capacity additions slow. For now, traders are leaning into the volume story.

Losers: Refiners face RIN bill uncertainty and waiver whiplash

Oil refiners without sizable blending or renewable diesel hedges face a higher compliance tab. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers warned the package “plays politics with our fuel system,” flagging higher consumer costs and pressure on domestic manufacturing. The EPA complicated the calculus by moving on the long-stalled small-refinery exemptions: 63 granted, 28 denied and 77 partially approved, cleaning up petitions dating back to 2016. That decision temporarily enlarges the pool of exempted gallons, loosening RIN demand in the near term while prolonging uncertainty about reallocation and future enforcement. For names like Valero (VLO), PBF Energy (PBF) and Delek (DK), the distribution of exemptions, the trajectory of D6 and D4 RIN prices and the timing of the final 2026 rule will determine whether this becomes a pass-through cost at the rack or a hit to margins. Refiners argue the RIN market is opaque and volatile; the administration counters that the mandate lifts domestic supply and can coexist with stable retail prices. The spread between wholesale and retail will be the tell.

Policy risk: reallocation, lawsuits and the election calendar

The EPA signaled a supplemental rule to decide whether larger refiners should backfill exempted volumes through reallocation, a critical detail that would ratchet compliance costs if implemented. Litigation is likely no matter how the agency lands. Refiners will challenge aggressive targets and any reallocation, while producers will fight broad exemptions. Court timelines could stretch into the next compliance year, leaving traders to price legal risk into RIN curves. The political overlay is unmistakable. Biofuels are a lever in battleground states with deep ag footprints. The administration’s posture—elevate ethanol and renewable diesel while questioning EV subsidies and mandates—aims to thread a needle between energy transition optics and pump-price politics. If crude volatility persists amid Middle East shocks, the White House will sell biofuels as insurance against foreign supply risks, even as the oil industry calls the scheme a hidden tax.

Market implications: soy complex, corn, RINs and retail fuel

The immediate trade is soy oil strength and a firmer soy crush, with ripple effects for meal prices and livestock inputs. Corn demand expectations tick higher with an 8% increase in implied blending volumes, especially if driving demand holds through 2026. Ethanol crush margins improve on volume certainty and RIN support, though rail logistics and export channels remain swing factors. D4 RINs could tighten into year-end if traders anticipate reallocation and faster renewable diesel ramp rates, while D6 RINs will track gasoline demand and exemption headlines. For fuel buyers, more renewable diesel could soften diesel basis in some West Coast and Gulf Coast markets, offset by feedstock-driven cost inflation. Watch for retail spreads: if refiners succeed in passing through higher RIN costs, price transparency will become a political football.

Corporate positioning: who’s hedged, who isn’t

Integrated refiners with renewable diesel capacity and trading desks have a structural advantage. Chevron’s Renewable Energy Group acquisition and Marathon’s Martinez JV with Darling provide compliance credits and margin optionality. Phillips 66’s Rodeo project continues to scale. Pure-play refiners with thinner hedges rely on RIN strategies and term agreements, leaving them more exposed if RINs firm and reallocation hits. On the ag side, ADM and Bunge are positioned to capture crush and merchandising upside, but their guidance will hinge on how quickly feedstock costs transmit downstream. Green Plains’ technology-driven yield improvements become more valuable in a higher-volume world. For investors, the screen is simple: overweight feedstock owners and integrated blenders; underweight RIN-short refiners until the reallocation rule is clearer.

Key numbers and timelines to watch

The headline 24.02 billion-gallon target and the 7.12 billion D4 RIN quota will anchor models, but the swing variable is exemption policy. The 63 granted and 77 partial waivers clear backlog noise, yet they also set up a binary outcome on reallocation that could yo-yo RIN prices. Comment periods and a final 2026 rule later this year will be catalysts, followed by any supplemental reallocation decision. USDA crop reports and crush capacity updates will feed the soy oil trade. Quarterly calls from ADM, BG, DAR, VLO, MPC and PBF will surface how much of the mandate is already priced into contracts and how management teams are hedging.

What it means for energy transition math

The administration is doubling down on a transition path that keeps liquid fuels front and center. That stance puts biofuels in the political winner’s circle even as EVs and wind face tougher rhetoric and permitting friction. Investors should expect a policy tug-of-war to continue, with biofuels getting budget and headline support and opposition from refiners intensifying. In the near term, the market signal is clean: more mandated volumes, firmer feedstocks, higher compliance complexity. That combination makes the biofuels trade noisy but investable, with asymmetric upside for the Farm Belt and integrated renewable diesel players if the EPA follows through on reallocation.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ChatGPT-Image-Aug-12-2025-04_04_33-PM.png,N,,2025-08-27 22:56:40.173815

About SWISS Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) is Switzerland’s leading air carrier.","Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has entered a long-term strategic partnership with tech pioneer neustark, the first company in the world to store carbon dioxide generated by biogas facilities in demolished concrete to remove it permanently from the atmosphere.

The Swiss-based start-up has already demonstrated the viable benefits of its new technology. And its new partnership with SWISS should permit this Swiss innovation to be more rapidly further refined and internationally expanded as a key element in achieving the world’s carbon reduction goals.

The air transport sector is facing a major challenge. Flying brings people and cultures together; but it generates emissions, too. So firm action is needed today if future generations are also to enjoy all the benefits that mobility brings.

This is why SWISS is consistently pursuing its own objective of making its business and operations carbon-neutral by 2050 via various measures ranging from deploying more efficient aircraft and using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to promoting pioneering new solutions that permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

SWISS’s new partnership with Swiss-based start-up neustark is a further key element in these sustainability endeavors. SWISS is the first airline in the world to support the mineralization technology that this ETH Zurich spinoff has developed.

The technique takes carbon dioxide generated in biogas facilities and stores it in recycled concrete (sourced from demolished buildings and the like) to permanently remove it from the atmosphere. SWISS has concluded a partnership agreement with neustark which will remain in effect until 2030, with options for enlarging the volumes covered and/or extending the agreement’s duration.

SWISS’s early involvement in its venture will enable neustark to accelerate the development of its technologies and drive its international expansion. In forging such partnerships, SWISS and the Lufthansa Group are underlining their commitment to pursuing and promoting scalable science-based solutions for decarbonizing the air transport sector.

A strategic partnership for scalable CO₂ removal

“Our journey to net zero demands actions as well as words,” stressed SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “Switzerland is a land of innovation. And we’re proud to help carry this strength out into the world.

“In teaming up with neustark, we’re supporting a Swiss idea that can have a global impact. Permanent CO₂ removal is key to the future of the aviation sector; and we are intentionally getting involved in this technology as early as possible, to help scale it up and drive its further development. And as the first airline in the world to do so, we’re saying: At SWISS, we don’t wait; we lead the way.”

“We are delighted to have secured SWISS as our first airline partner,” added Valentin Gutknecht, Co-CEO and co-founder of neustark. “Our new collaboration shows how even difficult-to-decarbonize sectors like air transport can help to scale up core climate technologies.

“Pioneers like SWISS are playing a vital role in further developing our carbon removal technology and in enabling us to achieve our ambitious growth plans to permanently remove exponentially more tonnes of hard-to-avoid CO2 emissions from the atmosphere every day.”

Partnerships key to achieving ambitious objectives

SWISS’s new partnership with neustark further expands the already extensive involvements of the company and the Lufthansa Group in the fields of sustainable aviation fuel and CO₂ removal. SWISS was the first airline in the world to use the solar fuel developed and produced by Swiss-based start-up Synhelion. And SWISS is also the first airline to team up with the Climeworks company to help scale up its ‘direct air capture’ carbon removal technology.

Sustainability: a shared task and commitment

SWISS and the Lufthansa Group are adopting a range of actions to achieve net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. These include reducing their carbon emissions at the source through operating advanced aircraft, raising the efficiency of flight operations, and using sustainable fuels.

This is complemented by investments in climate projects and promoting the development of promising new technologies such as neustark’s that enable permanent CO₂ removal. Air transport can only become more sustainable if all its various parties and partners work together: airlines, their customers, tech pioneers and the political world.

neustark in brief

Swiss-based start-up neustark has developed an innovative technology that takes concrete from demolition sites – the world’s biggest waste stream of more than a billion tonnes a year – and other mineral waste and turns it into a carbon sink. To do so, CO₂ generated by biogas facilities is captured, liquefied and transported to nearby demolition waste recycling centers, where it is injected into the now- granular recycled concrete and permanently bound therein through an accelerated mineralization process that transforms the CO2 into rock. The CO₂-enriched recycled concrete granules can be re-used in construction – in road building, for instance, or to produce fresh recycled concrete. With more than 30 active CO2 separation and storage sites in Europe and more being planned, neustark is pursuing its vision of permanently storing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of CO2 in mineral waste in the next few years.

Neustark is a spinoff of ETH Zurich. Founded in 2019 and domiciled in Bern, the company is one of the leading developers of CO₂ mineralization and is rapidly expanding in Europe with active projects in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Austria and elsewhere.

Washington, DC, Aug. 27, 2025 – The most important developments shaping business aviation’s path to net-zero carbon emissions will be in the spotlight when industry leaders gather for the 2025 National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE), taking place Oct. 14-16 in Las Vegas.

The show will once again include a Business Aviation Sustainability Summit, taking place Oct. 14 and 15, with education sessions dedicated to taking a deeper look at the most pressing issues facing the industry.

For example, Congress has remained active on policy proposals for incentivizing the production, availability and uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can reduce business aircraft emissions by up to 80% over legacy fuels.

One recently passed congressional budget bill includes an additional two-year extension of the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit incentivizing production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to 2031; another bill under consideration would expand alternative fuels research.

On the regulatory front, the certification of low- or zero-emissions advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft is drawing closer to reality, since the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) release at last year’s convention of a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) to establish requirements for the safe, efficient integration of the next-generation aircraft into the nation’s aviation system.

“As the industry continues innovating toward its sustainability aims, NBAA-BACE offers a vital opportunity for the business aviation community to come together, highlight recent breakthroughs, and chart the path forward for an even more sustainable future,” said NBAA Senior Director, Environmental and Technical Operations Stewart D’Leon.

The two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding on August 19, 2025, and set a near-term target to finalize SAF adoption within six months, by February 2026. The move matters because air transport makes up more than half of Shein’s transport emissions, and the retailer’s air-heavy model has pushed its pollution far above peers.

In its latest figures for 2024, Shein reported 8.52 million tonnes CO₂e from transport, out of 16.7 million tonnes CO₂e overall. Transport emissions rose 13.7% year over year, and they are now more than three times those of Inditex, Zara’s parent company. The new agreement aims to shift part of Shein’s air cargo to SAF and to add operational changes that can slow that growth without slowing deliveries.

Under the plan, Lufthansa Cargo will track SAF use on Shein routes and issue externally verified “Proof of Sustainability” certificates that show the related, traceable emission reductions. The companies will share emissions data, improve reporting, and expand SAF volumes where supply, cost, and operations allow. They will also study other low-carbon steps, from fleet efficiency to logistics improvements, to cut fuel burn and waste along the route.

Shein’s Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment, said the company will pilot SAF on select lanes and expand use where it works, while looking for more ways to lower the footprint of deliveries. Lufthansa Cargo CEO Ashwin Bhat called the tie-up a model for “concrete measures and reliable implementation” in international freight and said the airline wants to support more sustainable supply chains at scale.

Policy and timeline

The MoU’s scope goes beyond fuel. It covers joint work on low-carbon and renewable energy options, better demand planning to reduce last-minute air lifts, and process changes that can move more goods by sea or truck when time allows.

The parties set a firm initial adoption window ending February 2026; progress will be reviewed and expanded after that, with SAF use tracked and certified on agreed routes. The agreement also includes:

Knowledge sharing

Stronger traceability of shipments

Improved environmental and operational reporting across the network

For Lufthansa Cargo, this partnership fits a larger pathway to cut net carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 (vs. 2019) and to reach net-zero by 2050. The carrier points to a mix of SAF, operational tweaks, and technical upgrades—such as aerodynamic films that reduce drag—to squeeze more distance from each tonne of fuel. Details of the group’s climate program are posted on its site: Lufthansa Cargo Sustainability.

For Shein, the numbers tell a hard story. The fast fashion model relies on speed, frequent restocks, and wide global reach, all of which have favored air freight. The company has shifted some volume to sea freight and trucking, but the need for speed-to-market keeps air as a key lever. That is why SAF, though still limited in global supply, is central to this pilot.

Sustainability specialists see SAF as a helpful step but stress that the biggest wins come from cutting the need for air in the first place. That means:

Better inventory planning

More local production

Fewer emergency flights triggered by stock-outs

The MoU nods to these ideas by calling for logistics improvements and stronger forecasting to reduce rush shipments.

Industry context and human impact

Aviation fuel choices can feel abstract, but they influence real jobs and delivery timelines. A shift to SAF on Shein lanes can lower the climate impact of the same work done by pilots, ramp crews, dispatchers, and customs brokers.

If demand planning also improves, warehouse teams may face fewer overnight rushes and more predictable schedules. At the same time, the industry will watch prices: SAF remains costlier than conventional jet fuel, which can flow through to freight rates if used at scale.

Market forces and rules will shape how fast this deal grows. The companies flagged that changes in trade policy—such as the UK’s de minimis rules for low‑value imports—and Shein’s public market plans could affect logistics choices. Strong, transparent reporting tied to externally verified certificates can help regulators and investors judge whether claimed reductions are real.

Key potential impacts:

– For Shein: cut logistics emissions, respond to regulator and consumer pressure, and demonstrate that fast delivery can be compatible with lower-carbon air freight.

– For Lufthansa Cargo: expand SAF supply deals, refine booking and fueling processes, and attract large retail customers seeking certified emissions cuts.

– For the broader sector: increased pressure on fast fashion and freight providers to publish comparable data, test SAF, and shift more volume to sea when schedules allow.

SAF accounting and transparency

In practice, SAF adoption for a global retailer usually follows a “book-and-claim” model:

Fuel is supplied and used within an airline’s network.

A certificate assigns the climate benefit to the buyer.

External verification prevents double counting.

The MoU confirms this path by highlighting Lufthansa Cargo’s Proof of Sustainability documents, which rely on external checks to maintain credible accounting. That approach lets Shein contract for a larger SAF share than may be physically available on any single flight while keeping emissions claims traceable.

Transparency is built into the agreement. The parties will share emissions data and improve reporting of operational and environmental metrics. That matters for independent review and for comparisons across companies, especially since Shein’s transport footprint already exceeds that of major rivals by a wide margin.

Katy Austin & Simon Browning

Transport correspondent & producer

The bonus for Ryanair workers who intercept passengers with oversized cabin bags will rise from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag, the airline's boss said.

Michael O'Leary told the BBC the change would come in this November, and that he made no apology for it.

Mr O'Leary said the bonus was meant to put off the small minority who brought cabin bags which were bigger than the size limit, insisting the airline was ""not trying to catch people out"".

He added that if people ""don't comply with the rules and try to get on with an outsize bag, we will catch you and I would look forward to rewarding and bonusing our staff that pick out those oversize bags"".

Ryanair passengers are allowed a free bag to take on board, but can be charged up to £75 they try to bring a larger bag than allowed onto a flight, depending on the route and travel date.

The airline currently allows a small carry-on bag – with a size capped at 40cm x 20cm x 25cm and weight of 10kg – with every ticket.

However, this is set to increase to 40cm x 30cm x 20cm from September after a change in EU rules.

Mr O'Leary said about 200,000 passengers per year have to pay extra to put carry-on luggage in the hold, and that he did not feel sorry for ""chancers"" trying bring ""rucksacks"" aboard.

""We're the airline with the lowest air fares in Europe,"" he said. ""Those are our rules. Please comply with the rules, as 99.9% of our 200 million passengers do, and you won't have any problem.""

He said if people ""comply with the bag rules then everyone will board faster"" and there will be ""fewer flight delays"".

In addition to increasing the bonus per bag, Ryanair is scrapping an €80 cap on how much staff can earn each month for catching people with bags that are too large.

The Ryanair chief executive also said he wanted ""ground handlers to catch people who are scamming the system"".

Sustainable fuel 'nonsense'

Mr O'Leary, who has previously voiced scepticism about sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), said there was ""not a hope in hell"" of the UK's SAF mandate of 10% being met by 2030.

He said Ryanair would not be increasing how much SAF it used because supply ""is not there"", and described SAF as ""nonsense"".

The mandate starts in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, increasing to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.

Mr O'Leary said sustainability targets for aviation are ""dying a death"", with the sector set to miss both 2030 targets for sustainable aviation fuel and a 2050 net zero mandate.

The private jet industry has undergone a significant market shift that many operators have not recognized, according to new research analyzing five years of search data.

A comprehensive study of private jet search trends from 2020-2025 reveals that traditional ownership models are declining rapidly. On-demand charter services now represent 52% of all revenue, while fractional ownership has grown 67% year-over-year. The market is projected to reach $24.28 billion by 2025, representing 14.3% growth from 2024.

North America maintains 63.5% of the global market share, aligning with NBAA’s latest industry reports. Belgium has demonstrated 10.6% growth, five times the EU average. The Philippines led Asia-Pacific with 38% growth, while Kenya showed 63% growth despite Africa’s overall 11.5% decline, matching patterns in EBAA’s regional analysis.

These growth markets have succeeded by addressing customer demand for flexibility without ownership. Entry-level jet cards start at £39,708, and event-specific access drives significant volume – the Cannes Film Festival alone generates 3,000 private jet movements, double the normal volume.

Three key factors are reshaping private jet market trends. Technology advancements have reduced operational costs, with AI route optimization delivering 10-15% fuel savings and composite materials reducing aircraft weight by 20-25%. Sustainability requirements are accelerating change, as Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces CO2 emissions by up to 80% despite costing 2-4 times more than conventional fuel. The EU mandates 2% SAF usage by 2025, rising to 70% by 2050. Business models have evolved to include fractional ownership, jet-sharing, subscription cards, and online booking platforms, replacing traditional brokerage models.

A significant disconnect exists in the industry’s digital presence. While 90% of wealthy travelers begin their search online, 87% of private jet companies lack proper tracking and optimization for these search patterns. Companies that effectively track search data can identify which aircraft types receive the most searches, when demand spikes occur around major events, which routes show highest purchase intent, and how customers research across 7-12 touchpoints.

The pandemic significantly impacted the industry, with deliveries dropping to 644 in 2020 before recovering to 764 in 2024. Forecasts indicate 820 deliveries for 2025, consistent with Aviation Week’s market projections. The fundamental change involves buyer preferences shifting from ownership to access. Fractional providers experienced 59% more flight hours in Q2 2024 versus Q2 2019, matching WingX flight data trends. Charter bookings increased by 23%.

Based on current growth rates, traditional ownership is projected to represent less than 25% of the market by 2027.

Three categories of operators are positioned to capture market share in this evolving landscape: companies offering fractional and on-demand models, operators in high-growth regions such as Belgium, Philippines, and Kenya, and early adopters of SAF and AI optimization technologies. Companies continuing to focus primarily on full ownership models risk losing market relevance as customer preferences shift toward flexibility over asset ownership.

Air France’s 46th A220-300, named VAISON-LA-ROMAINE, reduced lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by over 25 tonnes compared to fossil fuels during this milestone journey.

According to Air France-KLM, combining fleet renewal with SAF is essential for aviation’s decarbonization strategy.

The airline group, among the world’s largest SAF buyers, emphasized that receiving SAF at delivery increases transparency and accelerates industry adoption.

Expanding SAF Integration

Since introducing SAF deliveries to its Mirabel site, Airbus has been progressively integrating SAF into A220 production, acceptance, and test flights.

In 2025, the site aims to cut CO2 emissions by around 400 metric tonnes by consuming 170,000 litres of pure SAF.

This aligns with Airbus’ global initiative, with 78% of its aircraft delivered in the first half of the year using SAF blends.

Airbus targets 100% SAF compatibility across all aircraft by 2030. Current A220 models already operate with up to 50% SAF, reflecting both technical readiness and regulatory compliance.

Lifecycle Emissions

The SAF used in this delivery flight was certified to achieve up to an 85% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to fossil fuel.

This substantial decrease is managed through the mass balance system, where certified SAF volumes are tracked alongside conventional Jet A-1 fuel using an auditable chain of custody approach.

By adopting this system, Airbus ensures both operational feasibility and transparency in SAF usage, reinforcing its role as a driver of sustainable aviation.

Air France’s A220 Fleet

Air France’s first A220 entered service in 2021, part of a 60-aircraft order. The A220 family offers up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, further supporting the airline’s medium-haul efficiency goals.

The A220 programme continues to serve as a cornerstone in both Airbus’ and Air France’s sustainability roadmaps, combining cutting-edge aircraft efficiency with sustainable fuel adoption.

The future of African aviation may well depend on what comes next after Aviation Africa 2025.","The Aviation Africa Summit 2025 is set to bring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to the centre of discussions on the continent’s aviation future. The event will focus on practical solutions for producing SAF, ensuring supply chains, and creating policy frameworks to accelerate adoption. Experts including AfriSAF’s CEO and co-founder Kwame Bekoe and Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority Director General Silas Udahemuka will share their insights. Moderated by aviation industry veteran Vijay Poonoosamy, the panel promises a no-nonsense debate on moving from endless studies to real-world action. For Africa, the time for SAF is now.

Why Africa must embrace SAF urgently

Africa’s aviation sector faces the dual challenge of rapid growth and climate responsibility. With rising demand for flights across the continent, airlines and regulators are under pressure to cut emissions. SAF is seen as the most practical pathway to cleaner skies. Kwame Bekoe of AfriSAF notes that success depends on mobilising feedstock, choosing the right technologies, and reducing investment risks. Aligning policies with market incentives will also be crucial. If executed well, Africa can leapfrog into a leadership role, ensuring its aviation growth is both sustainable and competitive.

AfriSAF leads with innovation in feedstock management

At the heart of Africa’s SAF progress is AfriSAF, which is pioneering feedstock management solutions. By connecting farmers, waste producers, and energy developers, the company ensures that raw materials for SAF are available at scale. Bekoe explains that this is the first step to building cost-competitive projects. The aim is to lower barriers to entry and encourage private investment. AfriSAF’s model demonstrates how technology can simplify a complex value chain. Its role at Aviation Africa 2025 will be central to showcasing how innovation can bring SAF from concept to commercial reality.

Potential benefits beyond clean skies

The advantages of SAF for Africa stretch far beyond aviation. Bekoe highlights how production can create green jobs, reduce dependence on imported fuel, and improve waste management. Cleaner air in growing cities will also mean better public health. These ripple effects make SAF more than just a climate solution—it is an engine for sustainable development. From energy security to rural livelihoods, the benefits spread across multiple sectors. This explains why SAF is gaining traction not only among airlines but also among policymakers, investors, and community leaders.

Policy alignment remains the missing piece

Despite strong interest, Africa still faces policy gaps that slow down SAF adoption. Governments have often been reluctant to create financial incentives, fearing high costs. However, experts argue that without subsidies, tax breaks, or blending mandates, SAF will struggle to compete with conventional jet fuel. The Aviation Africa Summit 2025 will provide a forum to discuss how policy can catch up with ambition. Industry leaders are expected to call for a united approach, where governments, regulators, and businesses work hand in hand to ensure that progress moves beyond reports and pilot projects.

Rwanda showcases regulatory leadership

Rwanda’s Civil Aviation Authority, led by Director General Silas Udahemuka, has emerged as one of the leaders in advocating for SAF. Rwanda has already introduced policies encouraging green innovation and has invested in renewable energy. Udahemuka is expected to highlight how regulatory frameworks can set the tone for private sector investment. By embedding sustainability into national aviation strategies, Rwanda provides a model that other countries can adapt. Africa’s diversity means one-size-fits-all solutions will not work, but Rwanda’s proactive stance is a reminder that leadership at the state level matters.

Insight Theatre to present practical pathways

Beyond panel debates, Aviation Africa 2025 will feature the Insight Theatre where AfriSAF’s CEO will present concrete solutions for enabling SAF production in Africa. The presentation will outline how the company uses its feedstock management tool to drive efficiency and collaboration. It will also explore potential partnerships across the continent and highlight cost-competitive approaches. These discussions aim to move beyond vision statements and into actionable strategies. Delegates attending the session will leave with a clearer understanding of how SAF can be scaled up quickly in African contexts.

Risks and challenges must be addressed

While the promise of SAF is strong, risks remain. High upfront investment costs, uncertain demand, and technological complexities can deter stakeholders. Africa also faces challenges in logistics, with limited infrastructure in many regions. Experts warn that unless these issues are addressed, progress will stall. However, this is precisely why the Aviation Africa Summit 2025 is critical. By bringing together stakeholders from across the value chain—airlines, governments, fuel producers, and financiers—the event can create shared solutions. The message is clear: challenges are real, but so are the opportunities.

SAF as a driver of African competitiveness

Africa has the chance to position itself as a global leader in sustainable aviation. With abundant feedstock from agriculture and waste, the continent is uniquely placed to scale SAF. If successful, this could reduce reliance on expensive fuel imports and make African airlines more competitive globally. It could also improve Africa’s image as a region committed to sustainability, attracting investment and partnerships. Aviation Africa 2025 will be a litmus test for how committed stakeholders are to turning this opportunity into a reality. The stakes could not be higher.

Conclusion: A turning point for African aviation

Aviation Africa Summit 2025 arrives at a critical time for the continent’s aviation industry. With passenger demand growing, Africa cannot afford to delay action on sustainability. SAF offers a practical and powerful pathway to cleaner skies and broader economic benefits. Experts agree that feedstock mobilisation, risk reduction, and policy alignment are the keys. With AfriSAF leading innovation, Rwanda showing regulatory leadership, and stakeholders uniting, the summit could mark a turning point.

It has been confirmed that Lufthansa Cargo will, in the first instance, provide Shein with certificates proving that it is increasing the quantity of alternative airline fuels it uses.

The certificates will be aligned with third-party verification standards and evidence that the new fuels produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions over their lifecycle than conventional jet fuel.

While the alternative fuels may not be directly used on flights carrying Shein shipments, the certificates will enable Shein to account for the emissions reductions in its own corporate accounting.

Shein’s statement announcing the MoU stipulates that it will use emissions offsetting solutions linked to the Lufthansa Cargo certificates within six months. Both companies intend to pursue longer-term collaboration, the statement adds.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network,” said Shein’s general manager of global fulfilment, Ethan Shen.

“While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonisation strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency, and exploring other low-carbon solutions.”

Shein and Lufthansa will additionally explore closer cooperation on reporting environmental data, including emissions data, in a more traceable and credible way.

SAF FAQ

SAF is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning that it can be blended with conventional jet fuel to reduce the carbon intensity of an aircraft’s fuel batch. It is therefore more commercially viable at present than using hydrogen or electric propulsion for large planes.

The typical limit for blending SAF with conventional jet fuel is around 50%. Most flights operating using some SAF use a far smaller proportion, partly due to a lack of supply and high costs. SAF costs remain up to seven times higher than kerosene.

The International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) defines SAF as “a renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria”. However, the exact “sustainability criteria” depend on where and under which jurisdiction or regulation the fuel is ultimately intended to be used.

SAF is not without controversy. Critics, including academics and policymakers, are calling for stronger regulation on the lifecycle emissions of SAF, including upstream emissions in, for example, agricultural production.

They are also urging national governments not to bullishly pursue airport expansion, as the use of 100% SAF, electric or hydrogen planes is some years away.

Shein’s new net-zero target

Shein’s parent company, Roadgadget Business, recently had its 2050 net-zero target verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) – a decision which caused much backlash in the corporate sustainability space, given Shein’s significant emissions growth in recent years.

Shein posted a 175% increase in its absolute emissions across all scopes between 2021 and 2023.

In a new decarbonisation roadmap, Shein estimates that 96% of its total emissions in 2024 resulted from purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution. Its SBTi target requires an ambition of a 90% absolute reduction in Scope 3 (indirect) emissions by 2050, against a 2023 baseline.

Shein’s decarbonisation roadmap details plans to optimise air and trucking routes to reduce transportation distances; support road transport partners to adopt fuel-efficient trucks; and shift from air freight to sea and road freight where possible.

However, it does not include figures for the projected emissions reductions of these activities.

Sustainability consultancy Anthesis Group assisted Shein in producing the roadmap.

SWISS joins ‘neustark’ in carbon removal partnership

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Swiss start-up neustark, a pioneering company that has developed a novel method of permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The partnership is set to accelerate both the refinement of neustark’s technology and its international rollout, furthering SWISS’s broader efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

The aviation industry faces the challenge of balancing the benefits of global connectivity with the environmental impact of emissions. SWISS has set itself the target of reaching net-zero by mid-century, pursuing a combination of measures such as operating more fuel-efficient aircraft, adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and investing in solutions that permanently eliminate carbon dioxide. The partnership with neustark represents a key step in the airline’s strategy to mitigate its carbon footprint.

Neustark, a spin-off from ETH Zurich, is the first company worldwide to apply a process that stores carbon dioxide from biogas facilities into demolished and recycled concrete. The gas is mineralised within the building material, ensuring its permanent removal from the atmosphere while also contributing to the circular economy by repurposing construction waste. SWISS is the first airline to actively support this mineralisation technology, highlighting its intention to back innovative and scalable approaches to decarbonisation.

The agreement between SWISS and neustark runs until 2030, with provisions to extend its scope either by increasing the volumes of carbon dioxide processed or by prolonging the partnership’s duration. By committing early, SWISS is enabling neustark to advance its technology at pace and pursue expansion into new markets.

Together with the Lufthansa Group, SWISS is demonstrating leadership in tackling aviation’s environmental impact by fostering partnerships that can deliver meaningful and lasting carbon reductions. This initiative signals a commitment not only to cleaner air transport but also to broader sustainability goals, ensuring that mobility can remain accessible to future generations without compromising the planet’s climate.

SAFs are a ‘drop-in’ fuel and can be blended into fossil-based aviation fuels and used in existing aircraft without modification.

SAFs are considered sustainable because they have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional fossil-based jet fuels.

The roadmap sets out a number of actions which aim to encourage and support SAF production in Ireland.

Emissions

The aviation sector faces a particular challenge to decarbonise due to a lack of renewable alternatives. Internationally, air travel accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions related to the combustion of fossil fuels.

According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the full-flight CO2 emissions of all flights departing from EU27 European free trade association airports were estimated to be 133 million tonnes in 2023.

Current production

From a production, capacity and demand point of view, SAF is still at an early stage of development.

It is estimated that EU SAF supply was less than 0.05% of total jet fuel demand in 2020.

In its 2022 environmental report, the EASA estimated potential SAF production capacity at around 0.24 million tonnes. This still amounts to less than 10% of the amount required to reach the EU mandate of 6% by 2030.

Irish production

Ireland has no commercial SAF production. The roadmap outlines that, in the near term, Ireland will rely on imports.

Blending SAF with conventional aviation fuel is expected to take place abroad or at Irish fuel terminals, which may require port upgrades.

However, the roadmap identifies limited short-term potential through the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway, using local feedstocks such as tallow and used cooking oils. Volumes are likely to be low.

Medium-term opportunities lie in advanced biofuels from waste and residues, though supply and technology challenges also remain.

Long-term potential is centred on synthetic eSAF, supported by Ireland’s offshore renewable electricity ambitions of 37 gigawatts by 2050, which could provide the inputs needed for large-scale production.

This depends on successful wind deployment and policies such as the national hydrogen strategy.",https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ifj/WEBFILES/000/882/196/2422811-882196.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:01:20.027119

The UK Government says that they “underpin almost all economic activity and innovation, including the development of AI [artificial intelligence] and other technology, public service delivery, and how we interact with one another”.

In September 2024, the UK Government designated data centres as part of the country’s critical national infrastructure.

The UK data centre sector

Data centres can be categorised by their use and ownership:

Enterprise data centres: owned and operated by a single organisation for internal purposes.

Co-location data centres: the facility is operated by a third party that rents space to customers.

Hyperscale data centres: massive facilities built by major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

AI data centres: facilities specialised for the high-performance computing needs of AI development.

A data centre’s capacity is usually expressed as the maximum power it can draw, which determines how much IT equipment it can support. The UK had approximately 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of data centre capacity in 2024.

Most UK data centres are concentrated in Greater London, which is Europe’s largest data centre market. However, new hubs are emerging in places such as Manchester and South Wales.

Economic impact

As data centres do not have an industrial classification in the UK, it is difficult to identify their economic impact. techUK estimates that UK data centres have an annual gross value added (GVA) of £4.7 billion. This is based on an average from a range of international studies.

Data centres also support other sectors that benefit from data processing and storage services, including AI, cloud computing, and financial services.

Data centres are highly automated facilities and the number of jobs they create is relatively modes, particularly given their size and cost. A £10 billion campus in Blyth, Northumberland, which could house up to 10 data centres, is expected to directly create 400 full time jobs.

Why have data centres in the UK?

Preliminary analysis for the government found that UK data centre capacity could rise to between 3.3 GW and 6.3 GW by 2030, depending on policy interventions, but that this may not be enough to meet demand.

Although data can in principle be stored and accessed from anywhere in the world, there are several reasons for expanding data centre capacity within the UK, including:

to make it easier for UK organisations to access high-quality data processing power, enabling them to conduct research and develop new products and services.

to support the deployment of AI technologies: data needs to be processed close to the user for AI applications that require real-time decision-making, such as autonomous vehicles or remote healthcare. The government sees data centres as a key part of its proposed AI Growth Zones (AIGZs), through which it aims to establish AI innovation hubs across the UK.

to allow the UK Government to regulate data centres, such as by requiring them to meet cybersecurity standards and reduce their environmental impact.

Policy issues for data centres

Planning policy

Following December 2024 reforms to the government’s National Planning Policy Framework, which applies in England only, local authorities are required to consider the need for data centres when setting local policies and deciding planning applications. This change was welcomed by industry stakeholders, who had previously faced challenges getting approval for new developments. Additionally, AIGZs will have fast-track planning and infrastructure support for AI data centres.

Data centres will also be able to opt into the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) regime. NSIP applications are determined by the Secretary of State, rather than local planning authorities.

Planning policy in Scotland is supportive of data centres that utilise renewable energy produced in Scotland. Data centres are not mentioned in planning policy in Wales or Northern Ireland.

Energy consumption

Data centres currently consume around 2.5% of the UK’s electricity. The sector’s electricity consumption s expected to rise four-fold by 2030.

This has led to concerns about the sustainability of data centres. Major data centre operators have committed to achieving voluntary sustainability targets by 2030. They support renewables projects through power purchase agreements (PPAs), although some studies have questioned whether PPAs contribute to decarbonisation. Data centre operators are also exploring nuclear power, including small modular reactors, as a source of clean, reliable power.

Industry stakeholders and commentators have pointed to high energy price and grid capacity constraints as factors limiting the growth of the UK data centre sector. The Social Market Foundation, a think tank, has found that powering a data centre in the UK is more expensive than in other European markets, and four times more expensive than in the United States. This has led to calls for data centres to be included in energy-intensive industry support schemes and for reforms to electricity pricing.

Limited grid capacity means it can take years to get permission to connect to the national grid. The government has tried to improve the situation by reforming the connections process and prioritising strategically significant projects.

Water consumption

Cooling is essential to data centre operations, as they generate heat, and many facilities use water for cooling. Depending on the size and the cooling method used, data centres can consume large quantities of water.

The Environment Agency has criticised the lack data on how much water UK data centres consume. However, industry groups argue that water consumption is much lower in the UK than in the US, because UK data centres tend not to use water-intensive cooling methods. The government is working with the industry to improve transparency and efficiency.

Resilience

As data centres become more critical, their resilience to cyberattacks, power outages and climate risks is increasingly important. techUK argues that data centres designed in accordance with international standards are highly resilient.",https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/AdobeStock_631485302.jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 13:01:24.319814

The economic case for SAF is clear, the industry is a catalyst for American jobs and economic growth.","Introduction

As the United States eyes its 2030 target of producing three billion gallons of SAF per year, the national conversation around SAF has shifted towards an economic lens. In fact, the U.S. SAF industry aligns with current federal priorities focused on job creation, domestic manufacturing, and economic growth across multiple sectors of the U.S. economy.

Today, the U.S. SAF industry remains in its early commercial phase, with current domestic production capacity estimated between 20-30 million gallons per year, or roughly 2,000 barrels per day. This remains a fraction of U.S. jet fuel demand, which exceeds 16 billion gallons annually. This article examines the economic impacts of current and future SAF production as the industry is poised for growth.

Scaling Production, Investment, and Employment

U.S. SAF production is still in its early phases, with total U.S. output at less than 0.1% of national jet fuel consumption. Of the numerous pathways that exist for SAF production, the few commercial plants currently in operation are HEFA and alcohol to jet (ATJ) pathways. To scale the industry, more than $44 billion in private and public capital has already been committed to SAF projects, with the Department of Energy (DOE) projecting that this will be sufficient to scale production to three billion gallons per year by 2030, achieving a 10% penetration rate.

This level of capital deployment entails significant employment opportunity within the sector. A single commercial-scale SAF facility, designed to produce around 100 million gallons per year, creates an estimated 1,100 jobs annually during construction. To keep the facility running and operational, between 75-150 full-time operations and management (O&M) jobs are required. This scale puts SAF facilities in line with other renewable fuel producers like renewable diesel and ethanol producers. Positions are skilled, and highly local for construction, chemical processing, engineering, operations, and technical services.

Scaling this to the industry wide goal of three billion gallons, will require building up to 30 new facilities or expanding existing production facilities across the U.S. This rollout would generate an estimated 33,000 construction-phase jobs over the next five years and sustain up to 4,500 permanent direct O&M jobs across the industry once fully operational.

Beyond production facility based jobs, the SAF value chain contributes substantial employment through equipment manufacturing, fabrication, and supporting industries. DOE estimates that each $1 billion invested in SAF projects supports approximately 1,590 direct supply chain jobs. Applying this figure to the full $44 billion in committed investment yields an additional 70,000 supply chain jobs, distributed across industrial hubs nationwide, further amplifying the impactthat the growth of the SAF industry has on U.S. jobs, manufacturing, and overall economic output.

Feedstock, Agriculture, and Rural Job Creation

Beyond production facilities, SAF’s economic footprint extends into American agriculture and logistics. Feedstock sourcing represents a significant share of SAF’s employment impact, particularly for ATJ and Fischer-Tropsch pathways that rely on large volumes of biomass inputs. These pathways drive substantial upstream employment across the agriculture and agribusiness value chains.

A strong proxy for estimating these impacts is drawn from the ethanol industry, which shares similar agricultural and logistical characteristics to ATJ-based SAF. According to that industry, the U.S. ethanol sector supported approximately 264,000 agriculture-related jobs tied to the supply of 5.3 billion bushels of corn, resulting in the production of 15.6 billion gallons of ethanol. This translates to roughly 17,000 agriculture and logistics jobs per 1 billion gallons of fuel produced.

Applying a similar ratio to SAF, suggests that SAF feedstock sourcing could generate between 50,000 and 60,000 direct U.S. jobs by 2030 when production reaches 3 billion gallons per year. This projection is consistent with employment modeling conducted by DOE, which anticipates tens of thousands of new jobs emerging in feedstock production, transport, and pre-processing as SAF scales.

The employment profile differs by pathway. ATJ and FT SAF production will draw heavily from agricultural residues and forest biomass, supporting farming communities, rural transport hubs, and rail logistics networks. In contrast, HEFA production, which relies on fats, oils, and greases, creates fewer upstream jobs but still generates significant employment during facility construction and in specialized collection networks for used cooking oils and animal fats. Because SAF production integrates both agricultural and industrial supply chains, its rural employment impact is widespread, a key metric for cultivating policymaker support.

Growing SAF’s Economic Impact

In addition to driving employment, SAF production contributes substantial economic output and public revenue. Based on the current pipeline of announced projects, $44 billion in capital investment is expected to flow into U.S. SAF facilities, feedstock infrastructure, and equipment manufacturing by 2030. Drawing from comparable industry data, this level of spending should yield approximately $80-$100 billion in cumulative U.S. economic output. Tax revenues generated from this economic activity are equally significant. Using comparable industry benchmarks, the SAF buildout would yield an estimated $12-$18 billion in public revenues by 2030. Importantly, a high proportion of this output will remain domestic, ensuring that SAF investment translates into American jobs and manufacturing growth.

For policymakers, the SAF industry represents a smart, long-term investment in American productivity. The economic case for SAF is clear, the industry is a catalyst for American jobs and economic growth. The build out of SAF infrastructure supports skilled manufacturing, generates billions in tax revenue across a wide geography, and exemplifies American energy dominance.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/68a5d8b5441fd442d8bec1db/1756292391265/9.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-08-27 13:01:34.829573

Compared to traditional jet fuels, the use of SAF in this journey reduced GHG emissions by over 25 tonnes, further demonstrating the immense potential that SAF has in transforming the aviation industry.

The Importance of SAF in Decarbonization

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is central to the aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is made from renewable resources, such as plant oils, agricultural waste, and even carbon captured from the air. This makes SAF a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels and a key component of the aviation industry’s efforts to address climate change.

The use of SAF on this milestone flight underscores Air France’s commitment to integrating sustainable fuels into its operations. The airline’s parent company, Air France-KLM, has become one of the world’s largest buyers of SAF, emphasizing the importance of SAF adoption in the airline’s broader sustainability strategy. By using SAF at delivery, Air France not only meets its sustainability goals but also sets an example for the industry by increasing transparency and accelerating the widespread adoption of SAF.

Airbus’s Commitment to SAF and Sustainable Aviation

As a key partner in Air France’s sustainability journey, Airbus is also making significant strides in SAF integration. The aircraft manufacturer has been progressively incorporating SAF into its production process and test flights. The company is working towards a future where SAF is standard across all its aircraft deliveries, with a goal of ensuring 100% SAF compatibility across all of its aircraft by 2030.

Since introducing SAF deliveries to its Mirabel site in Canada, Airbus has already been integrating SAF into the production, acceptance, and test flights of its A220 series. This initiative aligns with Airbus’s commitment to reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. In 2025, Airbus aims to cut CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes, equivalent to consuming 170,000 litres of pure SAF. This progressive shift in fuel usage highlights Airbus’s dedication to sustainable aviation and the ongoing advancement of SAF technology.

The Role of SAF in Lifecycle Emission Reductions

The SAF used on Air France’s Airbus A220-300 flight was certified to achieve a reduction of up to 85% in lifecycle emissions compared to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuel. This remarkable reduction is achieved through the mass balance system, which tracks SAF volumes alongside conventional Jet A-1 fuel. The system uses an auditable chain of custody approach, ensuring both the operational feasibility and transparency of SAF usage. By adopting this system, Airbus is reinforcing its role as a leader in sustainable aviation, delivering on the promise of significantly lower carbon emissions without sacrificing performance or safety.

This commitment to reducing lifecycle emissions is crucial for the aviation sector, as it moves towards meeting the global sustainability goals set by international organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). As more airlines adopt SAF, the collective impact on global emissions can be profound, helping the aviation industry make significant progress toward its carbon-neutral future.

Air France’s Role in the A220 Program

Air France has made the Airbus A220 family a cornerstone of its fleet renewal program, with the airline planning to operate a total of 60 A220 aircraft in the coming years. The A220 family, known for its cutting-edge technology, offers impressive fuel efficiency, with up to 25% lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft. This fuel efficiency, combined with the use of SAF, makes the A220-300 a crucial part of Air France’s strategy to achieve its sustainability goals.

Since the introduction of its first A220 in 2021, Air France has seen firsthand the benefits of this aircraft model, which is well-suited for medium-haul routes. The aircraft’s advanced aerodynamics, lightweight design, and efficient engines allow it to minimize its environmental impact while maintaining high levels of passenger comfort and operational efficiency.

The introduction of SAF into the A220 program further enhances the airline’s commitment to sustainability. By combining the advanced efficiency of the A220 with the adoption of SAF, Air France is setting a powerful example for other airlines to follow.

But the LPG sector’s infrastructure investments are shaping a renewable-ready sector for off-grid homes and businesses, explains Megan Healy

A mixed-technology future for off-grid heating

While the majority of net-zero headlines and the clean energy debate centres around electrification, for the UK’s 1.5 to 2 million homes off the gas grid the transition is more complex. For many of these homes, often older, rural, and hard-to-treat, the adoption of heat pumps presents multiple barriers.

According to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), 20% of rural homes are technically unsuitable for heat pumps.1 Independent research commissioned by trade association Liquid Gas UK suggests that up to 36% may face additional technical and financial barriers,2 such as a potential £32,000 retrofit cost for heat pumps in some off-grid properties.3

Other issues include capacity limitations with the electricity grid, particularly in rural locations. An aging infrastructure, much of the grid dates from the 1960s or earlier and has long lead times for grid expansion – planning approval and construction for grid reinforcements can take 7-14 years, creating a backlog of projects. With the demand for electrification expected to double by 2050,4 there is a strain on distribution and transmission, particularly during peak usage periods.

The UK’s LPG sector is one industry stepping up to provide a solution for these off-grid properties, having committed to a renewable future.

Across the sector, there’s growing momentum in the demand for renewable liquid gases, particularly those readily compatible with existing supply chains like bioLPG.

Produced from sustainable carbon rich feedstocks including used cooking oil, agricultural residues and municipal waste, bioLPG offers an immediate and low-disruption route to decarbonisation.

Achieving up to 90% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional LPG and heating oil , these ‘drop-in’ gases are chemically identical to traditional LPG, making them a straightforward heating alternative for off-grid properties and applications that are unsuited to electrification.

Advancing the renewable readiness of the liquid gas sector relies not just on the fuels themselves, but on the infrastructure that enables their storage, movement, and availability.

Major LPG suppliers such as Flogas Britain are laying the groundwork for a renewable-ready transition by upgrading key distribution hubs, expanding storage capacity, and making strategic investments that will shape the energy mix for decades to come.

Ivan Trevor, Managing Director at Flogas Britain, says: “Achieving net zero requires a balanced approach.

“Electrification is a key piece of the net zero journey but is not a viable solution for hard-to-abate properties and high-heat industrial applications. Renewable liquid gases provide a flexible and scalable lower carbon solution that works with existing boilers, tanks and appliances, and alongside other technologies.”

To facilitate this transition, pivotal investments are being made at two major storage and import facilities: Avonmouth in the Southwest and Teesside in the Northeast, demonstrating the industry’s commitment to a net zero future.

Storage at Avonmouth

At Avonmouth, Flogas has successfully repurposed a former liquid natural gas (LNG) peak-shaving facility – where excess natural gas is stored to meet peak energy demands – transforming it into the UK’s largest above-ground LPG storage site.

Capable of handling 34,564 tonnes of LPG, the redevelopment has already seen the conversion and commissioning of a 17,000-tonne tank, with plans underway to recommission a second tank for further storage. Additionally, a new jetty will be built at Bristol Port, and a 6km pipeline will be laid to facilitate seamless upstream transfers of imports and storage to the site.

Due to the chemical similarities of bioLPG with traditional LPG, the facility is readily-capable of storing and distributing renewable fuels with minimal technical changes.

“The facility is ready to take bioLPG today, and future-proofed in terms of handling other low-carbon fuels, such as rDME and potentially ammonia, with minimal technical modifications,” Mr Trevor explains.

Importing energy security

With limited domestic production of bioLPG, currently around just 3,000 tonnes annually, imports will play a critical role in scaling up the UK’s renewable supply, says Mr Trevor.

“Avonmouth’s future import capacity of up to 500,000 tonnes per year opens the door to global markets, particularly the United States, which has a more developed bioLPG industry and abundant feedstocks.

“With a different pace towards their own energy transition, producers in the US have a growing interest in co-production and a stronger financial incentive to focus on exports,” he explains.

Mr Trevor highlights that while bioLPG imports from the US will be key, the UK is looking to diversify its sources.

“There are other places in the world where bioLPG can be produced—anywhere LPG or oil refining occurs could potentially produce bio,” he says.

“We’re focused on expanding our options and enhancing access to global bioLPG markets to meet growing demand.”

Supply at Teesside

A tripartite deal between Flogas, Exolum and North Sea Midstream Partners (NSMP) has enabled the Teesside facility to redirect previously exported North Sea propane inland to unlock LPG and bioLPG blends for customers across the UK.

By recommissioning storage, and transporting excess supply to the Avonmouth facility, Flogas is using the Teesside site to provide up to 90,000 tonnes of LPG each year to rural off-grid customers in both domestic and industry settings.

Renewable blends are also expected to become integrated into the Teesside supply in the future.

“Avonmouth is a game changer in terms of winter resilience due to its strategic location and storage capacity. Teesside, meanwhile, is bringing product that was once unavailable back inland to the UK market, improving energy resilience with groundwork being laid for blending bio into that stream,” explains Mr Trevor.

“Together, Avonmouth and Teesside form a complementary model, combining long-term storage and import capabilities at one end of the country with newly accessible domestic supply at the other.

“With these two sites working in tandem, a significant portion of the UK can be reliably supplied with LPG and bioLPG, bolstering our energy security and strengthening the resilience of our off-grid energy sector,” he says.

Building momentum on the way to decarbonisation

Flogas Britain, who are members of Liquid Gas UK, the trade association for the LPG and renewable liquid gases industry, is one major name at the forefront of driving the shift towards renewable liquid gases, however the momentum is a cross-industry partnership.

Member organisations are clear that collaboration is a key component of success, with parent companies SHV Energy (Calor) and DCC (Flogas) signing a memorandum of understanding to promote the renewable fuel development.

This partnership, alongside the Teesside tripartite deal, shows the industry is using joined-up thinking across the supply chain.

George Webb, CEO of Liquid Gas UK, says: “To achieve net zero, a balanced approach is needed, one that includes renewable liquid gases, which provide a flexible, cost-effective solution that works with existing systems and meets the needs of industry and consumers alike.

“Our members are committed to helping the UK transition to renewable energy, supporting hard-to-decarbonise sectors with significant investment and future-proofed infrastructure.”

With 80% of the national gas grid expected to be decommissioned by 2050, natural gas energy prices could rocket, impacting urban homeowners too, meaning transitionary fuels have a role to play beyond the off-grid sector, according to Mr Webb.

“Some homes and entire British high-heat industries risk becoming stranded without affordable heating alternatives in the future.

“This puts the investments from the LPG industry firmly in the spotlight, as there is potential for 50% of renewable liquid gas demand to come from on-grid homes transitioning away from the national gas grid due to the combination of increased fossil fuel costs, and high installation costs of heat pumps,” he says.

Future proofing through policy

However, the transition to renewable liquid gases isn’t just about switching fuels; building the infrastructure must go hand in hand with a supportive policy framework to enable large-scale adoption.

Mr Trevor explains: “You’ve got customers who want to decarbonise, and we are creating the ability to transition them from fossil to renewable liquid gas by importing and storing both gases through the same facility.

“This means we are not only improving national energy resilience, we’re delivering the potential for a more seamless energy transition for those customers at the same time.”

In addition to supporting and safeguarding the energy supply for rural homes and businesses, the future of the LPG industry includes economic growth with the potential to support a total of 12,500 jobs as the industry matures.

To this end, industry leaders are calling for clear recognition of renewable liquid fuels within the UK’s future energy mix, similar to how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been backed to decarbonise aviation.

“If the government provides certainty that renewable gases will be part of the fuel mix, it gives confidence for future investment in production and infrastructure,” says Mr Trevor.

“The sector is ready to step up – the infrastructure is being built, the supply chains are forming, but to maximise the full benefits of energy security, affordability and emissions reduction, the government must ensure a level playing field for all technologies.

“This will create a more just energy transition, stimulating greater demand for bio, which has a lot to offer the economy,” he says. Mr Webb adds: “Net zero won’t be achieved with a one-size-fits-all mentality, and government must support rural communities, who often face the steepest barriers.

“The UK’s renewable readiness is no longer a future goal – thanks to sites like Avonmouth and Teesside it’s already underway – what’s needed now is alignment between industry progress and supportive policy to drive it home.”",https://envirotecmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/FLOGAS-1200px.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 05:56:43.057164

The document relies on a task force bringing together government, airports, airlines, and academia. Its purpose is to identify barriers to imports and future production, and to prioritize initial actions that can evolve over time.

European framework and blending mandates

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation sets minimum shares of SAF in fuel delivered to European Union airports: 2% in 2025, 6% in 2030, and 20% in 2035, with sub-targets for synthetic fuels starting in 2030. These objectives are monitored by European agencies and integrated into the broader climate policy framework.

According to the roadmap, projected Irish demand would reach 88,000 t in 2030 and 318,000 t in 2035. The document also highlights that a European pipeline of eSAF (Power-to-Liquid, PtL, synthetic aviation fuel) of about 1.1 Mt by 2030 had not yet reached final investment decisions, underscoring the gap between global supply and the volumes required by ReFuelEU.

Costs, support mechanisms and price signals

The roadmap emphasizes the price gap between fossil kerosene and SAF, partly offset by European instruments. The European Union’s emissions trading system allocates 20 million free allowances to aviation from 2024 to 2030 to help bridge the price difference at incorporation. In parallel, the EU announced in 2025 a subsidy scheme covering up to €6/l for e-fuels and €0.5/l for biofuels, financed by the sale of part of the allowances.

Public estimates converge on a significant cost premium for SAF: two to seven times higher than fossil fuel under most scenarios, and even more for synthetic fuels. These figures explain the need for long-term offtake contracts and targeted incentives during the scale-up phase.

Industrial pathways and energy resources

The document identifies three horizons of production: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) through co-processing in the short term, advanced biofuels from agricultural and forestry residues in the medium term, and eSAF/PtL based on hydrogen and CO₂ in the long term. Competitiveness will depend on feedstock availability, electricity costs, and technological maturity.

Ireland explicitly links the eSAF option to its offshore wind ambitions: at least 37 GW of installed capacity by 2050, supported by grid reinforcement. The 2025 budget allocates around €750 million to accelerate grid investments, a prerequisite for large-scale eSAF production.

Airline demand and deployment trajectory

Irish-based carriers have set targets consistent with ReFuelEU: Aer Lingus aims for 10% SAF in 2030, and Ryanair 12.5% by the same year. These trajectories depend on supply agreements and the regional availability of volumes compliant with European standards. Several airlines and industry associations have warned of the risk of missing 2030 targets without lower costs and faster investment.

The ministry notes that the roadmap is an evolving document, designed to be updated as barriers to imports and production become clearer and as European and international instruments are refined. Monitoring will rely on the Task Force, regular consultations, and European reporting, guiding industrial priorities and support mechanisms.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/en_1140250842540-2-1.webp,N,,2025-08-27 05:57:03.177373

,,2025-08-27 03:25:48+00:00,DTN Progressive Farmer,Deputy Secretary: USDA Eyes 'Bridge' Policy for Farmers as Crop Prices Remain Low,Chris Clayton,,,,,https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/columns/washington-insider/article/2025/08/26/deputy-secretary-usda-eyes-bridge,"DECATUR, Ill. (DTN) -- Deputy Agriculture Secretary Stephen Vaden suggested Tuesday that USDA officials are looking at a ""bridge"" policy that would help crop farmers facing low commodity prices until stronger price supports take effect next year.
The National Association of Farmer Elected Committees (NAFEC) wrote to other farm groups last month, raising concerns about local staffing levels.
The NAFEC leadership said, ""the staffing levels in our counties have never been lower.""
Vaden said USDA would not be asking for temporary or permanent FSA staffing levels.
""We did it with our current staffing levels.","DECATUR, Ill. (DTN) -- Deputy Agriculture Secretary Stephen Vaden suggested Tuesday that USDA officials are looking at a ""bridge"" policy that would help crop farmers facing low commodity prices until stronger price supports take effect next year.

Vaden represented the Trump administration on Tuesday at the Farm Progress Show. He spoke about issues such as expanding markets and trying to hold trading partners accountable. He also said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins could not attend because of a Cabinet meeting where she would brief President Donald Trump about the state of the agricultural economy ""as we head into harvest and what we need to do to bridge this year to next year.""

Vaden pointed out the higher commodity safety net in the One Big Beautiful Bill, but higher Agricultural Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage (ARC and PLC) programs won't pay out until October 2026 for the 2025-26 crop. Improvements to crop insurance premium subsidies and higher coverage levels for most crops won't start until crops are planted next year as well.

""We have got to get to '26, and that's what we're talking about now,"" Vaden said.

Asked by DTN about what a ""bridge"" looks like, Vaden said, ""We're seeing the same thing that farmers are seeing with regard to commodity prices, and we know that many of the most important pieces of the One Big Beautiful Bill don't come into effect until 2026,"" he said.

The Commodity Credit Corp. (CCC) will be replenished for the next fiscal year, likely around November, Vaden noted.

""That's after harvest is completed for our corn and soybean farmers, so we've got to get them from this growing season to the next growing season.""

The Trump administration in 2018-19 tapped the CCC for more than $23 billion for commodity producers primarily to support declines in crop prices due to the trade war with China. It's possible a similar scenario could come into play, though Vaden didn't specifically spell that out in his comments.

Vaden pointed out USDA has paid more than $8 billion in Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP) aid payments for 2024 crop losses and another $4 billion in the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program for at least some of the crop and livestock losses in 2023 and 2024. Vaden noted there should be some future announcements in September for farmers to file other disaster claims for 2023 and 2024 crop losses that were not covered by crop insurance.

In regard to current market conditions, Vaden added, ""We are seeking to develop policy solutions to help bridge that, and that's what the secretary and I are working on, and what she's constantly talking to not only the president but other members of her cabinet about. You can rest assured that when we have those announcements to make, we'll do it.""

THERE ARE ENOUGH FSA STAFFERS TO MEET WORKLOAD

Vaden also rejected the notion that there are not enough Farm Service Agency (FSA) staff at county offices to handle the load of new programs or disaster aid.

The National Association of Farmer Elected Committees (NAFEC) wrote to other farm groups last month, raising concerns about local staffing levels. Like other agencies, FSA has seen a wave of people take early retirements and buyouts. The NAFEC leadership said, ""the staffing levels in our counties have never been lower."" While ""already at a breaking point,"" FSA staff were implementing aid programs while now have to develop 30 million more base acres that were added to farm programs in the budget reconciliation bill. NAFEC called on farm groups to press Congress to help FSA with staffing levels.

""Without staffing increases, critical services will be impacted,"" NAFEC wrote.

Vaden said USDA would not be asking for temporary or permanent FSA staffing levels. He said FSA staff had released ECAP and disaster program payments in record times through FSA.

""We did it with our current staffing levels. We did it so where our producers received their money in three business days after they submitted the form, and the forms were already preprinted, and all they had to do was sign, in most cases,"" Vaden said. ""That is the fastest roll out of any commodity assistance program in USDA's entire history. So, if we were having staffing level issues, how would that be possible? The answer is, it wouldn't, and we're not.""

PRESSING FOR MARKETS WITH TRADE

Vaden repeatedly said the only way for commodity prices to increase is with higher demand. He touched on announcements such as England committing to buy U.S. ethanol and Japan agreeing to buy sustainable aviation fuel from the U.S., though that production has yet to develop.

""You can bet that on every conversation that we're going to have with administration officials from whatever department, opening up new markets, focusing on the commodity price and focusing on the possible record yields we are seeing this fall, is first and foremost in every conversation that we are having.""

Recognizing Brazil is a major competitor for the U.S. when selling to China, Vaden said he believed the Trump administration's investigation into Brazilian trade practices such as import tariffs on ethanol or Brazil's deforestation would help show that Brazil is unfairly competing against U.S. corn and soybean farmers. Vaden suggested the results of that investigation would somehow help U.S. commodities increase sales.

""When we're producing the yields that we're producing on a sustainable basis, that we're producing without any environmental harm, and we're committing and we are competing rather against people who are literally burning down a forest to expand their agricultural productivity, that's something that's difficult to compete with,"" Vaden said. ""That's not an even playing field. We're not going to tolerate that, and that's why we've got this investigation going, because our farmers should not be competing with people who are not playing on a level playing field.""

(SOCAR) A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) covering cooperation in the field of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) was signed between SOCAR Turkey and Turkish Airlines at a ceremony held at Turkish Airlines Headquarters on August 13, 2025. Senior executives from both institutions attended the ceremony, and the signed memorandum was considered a strategic step toward a sustainability-focused transformation in the energy and aviation sectors.

Speaking at the ceremony, SOCAR Turkey CEO Elchin Ibadov emphasized that sustainability is one of SOCAR Turkey's key priorities, saying: “As SOCAR Turkey, we have a strong infrastructure for sustainable aviation fuel production thanks to the high production capacity of our group company, STAR Refinery, our advanced refinery technologies, our modern operations focused on digitalization, and our R&D efforts. Our technical know-how and integrated business model in the energy sector enable us to produce not only the fuels of today but also the fuels of the future.”

Aware of our responsibility to the future, we view sustainability as an integral part of our business practices and act with a transformation approach that considers environmental and social impacts. In line with this understanding, this strategic step taken together with Turkish Airlines is an initiative that will contribute to the vision of a more sustainable world not only for our sectors, but also for future generations. Considering Türkiye's strategic position in the aviation sector, we are pleased to be collaborating on this process with a strong global brand like Turkish Airlines.

I wholeheartedly believe that these efforts, which deepen our existing partnership in the jet fuel sector around sustainability, are just the beginning of our journey, and that together we can create much greater impact. I thank everyone who contributed to the realization of this shared vision, especially Turkish Airlines management. I hope this collaboration will be beneficial for our institutions, our country, and our region.

In his speech, Turkish Airlines CEO Bilal Ekşi emphasized the importance of this collaboration for sectoral transformation, stating: “As Turkish Airlines, we are taking steps in line with international targets for emission reduction in our operations. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is one of the most concrete and applicable tools on this journey. This agreement we signed with SOCAR Turkey elevates our strong fuel supply partnership to a new dimension that can deliver environmental benefits.”

This step will not only create an alternative fuel supply but will also pave the way for efforts to integrate SAF into our operations and increase production capacity in this area. As Turkish Airlines, we aim to contribute to the sustainability goals of the global aviation sector while also increasing our country's potential in this area. The future of global aviation will be shaped not by unilateral efforts, but by strong and committed partnerships. Therefore, we believe that this process we have initiated with SOCAR Turkey will create long-term value for both our institutions and our country's aviation sector. I hope our collaboration will be beneficial to all our stakeholders.

With the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding, the existing jet fuel cooperation will also be extended to the SAF field, while this partnership will also form the basis for the implementation of broader projects aimed at regional sustainability goals.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 19:56:09.890388

- Robert Flores, Amcor, VP, Sustainability Operations & Advocacy – Americas

Plastics production currently accounts for over 4% of GHG emissions, a share that continues to rise faster than other oil and gas products due to increasing demand in major end-use sectors such as packaging, textiles, and construction materials. The embodied emissions of an otherwise identical plastic product can vary significantly depending on the fossil feedstock type, extraction practices, monomer plant operations, methane management performance, and the electricity sources in downstream processes like molding and extrusion. Reducing climate risk requires both cutting unnecessary plastic use and lowering emissions from essential products. Yet climate pollution from production remains underrecognized in plastics, often overshadowed by concerns around waste and recycling. Despite existing emissions accounting standards and guidance, companies often lack the tools to assess plastic products' climate impact. Gaps remain particularly in the conversion step, which accounts for up to 38% of a plastic product’s embodied emissions. This is especially true when it comes to capturing methane intensity and evaluating recycling methods that align with the sector’s decarbonization pathways. These gaps hinder informed, low-emissions purchasing and design decisions. To address these challenges, RMI and Amcor pilot-tested RMI’s Plastic Conversion PCF Guidance with emissions collected from suppliers to explore practical emissions reporting and how it can drive industry decarbonization.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/headshot_placeholder.png,N,,2025-08-26 22:56:16.044165

By embracing higher blends, John Deere is assuring customers they can rely on a clean, homegrown fuel that reduces carbon emissions and strengthens rural economies.""","Today, John Deere announced the approval of B30 biodiesel use across its entire portfolio of Tier 4 John Deere engines. This increases the previous approval of blends up to B20. The announcement will also be highlighted this week at the 2025 Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois, where all John Deere equipment operated in the company's Ride and Drive area will run on B30 biodiesel.

""At John Deere, we're committed to supporting and growing the use of renewable fuels in our equipment,"" said Pierre Guyot, senior vice president of John Deere Power Systems. ""We believe strongly in the role that renewable fuels play in supporting the agriculture economy and are excited to offer our customers – including those who grow the very crops used to make renewable fuels – the opportunity to leverage higher blends of fuels like biodiesel in their own equipment.""

John Deere has a long history of supporting renewable fuel use in its equipment. Prior to today's announcement, all Tier 4 John Deere engines were approved for B20 biodiesel and RD100 renewable diesel, with all Tier 3/Stage III A and lower tier engines approved for biodiesel blends up to B100. In addition, all John Deere spark ignition turf and utility equipment is approved for E10 ethanol blend. John Deere is also exploring the use of higher ethanol blends in future engine solutions, including the development of a concept 9.0L ethanol engine that runs on E98. Customers interested in incorporating higher renewable fuel blends including B30 into their operations are encouraged to consult their fuel supplier.

What they're saying

""This is a win-win situation for U.S. soybean farmers and rural communities,"" said Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association and Kentucky soybean farmer. ""Higher blends of biodiesel mean greater demand for the soybeans we grow and cleaner-burning fuel for equipment in the field. John Deere's leadership in approving the utilization of B30 in their machinery helps move renewable fuels forward while directly supporting the farmers who help produce them.""

""John Deere's approval of B30 demonstrates true leadership in supporting America's farmers and advancing sustainable fuels,"" said Scott Fenwick, technical director for Clean Fuels Alliance America. ""Biodiesel is engineered to deliver the performance fleets and equipment owners expect, while exceeding ASTM quality specifications. By embracing higher blends, John Deere is assuring customers they can rely on a clean, homegrown fuel that reduces carbon emissions and strengthens rural economies.""

John Deere is committed to expanding the production and use of renewable fuels across all modes of transportation to support farmers, consumers, and the rural economy while also helping reduce emissions.

This event represents a further step toward sustainable aviation, as Airbus in Canada issued official sustainability credentials for SAF directly to a customer for the first time.

The flight showcases Airbus’ commitment to supporting the aviation industry’s decarbonization goals.

Delivery of Air France A220 on SAF

The landmark delivery flight of Air France’s 46th A220-300, named “Vaison-la-Romaine,” used a 50% SAF blend. This reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by over 25 tonnes compared to traditional fossil fuels.

This reduction was verified through Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) credits, issued under the CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme approved by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

These credentials confirm that the SAF used in Mirabel achieves an 85% reduction in GHG emissions over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel.

Blaise Brigaud, Senior Vice President of Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM, emphasized the importance of this milestone. “Fleet renewal and sustainable aviation fuel are the two key pillars of aviation decarbonization.”

“Combining them is a logical step. Air France-KLM is proud to contribute to this Airbus achievement with our A220 delivery flight. As one of the world’s largest buyers of SAF, we see direct SAF delivery as a game-changer, enhancing transparency and advancing industry progress,” Brigaud said.

SAF Integration into Mirabel Flight Ops

Airbus has been integrating SAF into its operations at Mirabel since announcing its use for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights.

This delivery flight solidifies Airbus’ commitment to using SAF for customer ferry flights and internal operations across its global commercial aircraft assembly sites.

Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada gave further comment. “In 2025, we expect to reduce CO2 emissions by about 400 metric tonnes at Mirabel. We are incorporating 170,000 litres of pure SAF into our operations.”

“This ferry flight, with PoS credits for a 50% SAF blend, is a key milestone. This is especially so as we approach Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year.”

The A220, like all Airbus aircraft, is certified to operate with up to 50% SAF. Airbus is aiming for 100% SAF compatibility across its fleet by 2030.

In the first half of 2025, 78% of Airbus aircraft deliveries worldwide included a SAF blend. This highlights the growing emphasis customers place on sustainable practices.

SAF management at Mirabel follows the mass balance model. This is a widely accepted method where certified SAF volumes are tracked from input to output. It is blended with conventional Jet A-1 fuel per industry standards.

This ensures accurate accounting and compliance with sustainability certifications.

Conclusion

Air France’s A220-300s, part of a 60-aircraft order, have been operating on its medium-haul network since October 2021.

The A220 offers up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to older aircraft, making it a cornerstone of Air France’s sustainability strategy.

This delivery flight underscores the aviation industry’s collective push toward a decarbonized future by 2050, with SAF and modern aircraft playing pivotal roles.",https://aviationsourcenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airbus_and_air_france_complete_inaugural_saf_a220_ferry_flight-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 19:56:36.383936

The aircraft used a fuel blend containing 50% SAF to fly from Airbus’ site in Mirabel, Quebec, across the Atlantic to France. It was the first time an A220 has used that blend during its delivery.

SAF reduces carbon emissions by at least 65% over a commercial aircraft’s lifetime.

All Airbus aircraft currently in production can operate with up to 50% SAF. The manufacturer is aiming for compatibility at up to 100% SAF by 2030.

Airbus Canada CEO Benoît Schultz said the company’s Mirabel site is projected to cut carbon emissions by around 440 tons this year through the use of almost 45,000 gallons of SAF integrated into operations.

Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. The airline said its newest A220, nicknamed “Vaison-La-Romaine,” will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 tons during its lifetime compared to an aircraft using fossil fuels.

Airbus and Air France-KLM said the ferry flight is part of a broader partnership between the two companies aimed at financing the purchase of SAF, which can cost between two and seven times as much as conventional jet fuel. Air France gives Airbus employees traveling for work the option of donating money toward the purchase of SAF, which the carrier said offsets some of the environmental impact of their trip.

Airbus estimates that, since the beginning of the partnership in November 2023, it has cut its emissions by more than 2,000 tons of carbon through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF.

SAF can be produced from sources such as plants, algae, tallows, solid biomass, waste oils, and some natural vegetable oils.

Still, the omission of air navigation infrastructure undermines the N712 billion investment in the project. An airport without ANS is a warehouse – a monument to incomplete strategy, writes WOLE SHADARE

The rebuilding of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMA) Terminal One in Lagos initially came with its controversy, given what some described as ‘outrageous’.

The plan to spend N712 billion on a total overhaul of the terminal that has outlived its usefulness to many is a step in the right direction, considering how dilapidated the terminal has become and the shame it has conferred on Nigeria and Nigerians.

A visit to the MMA terminal reveals the seriousness the government has attached to giving the country a world-class airport facility.

No Nigerian airport is among the ten best airports in Africa despite the country’s huge aviation market and a burgeoning domestic aviation industry.

Missing from the global ranking

The 2025 best airports in Africa, ranked by Skytrax, are the Cape Town Airport, South Africa, and King Shaka International Airport, Durban, OR. Tambo International Airport, Johannesburg; three airports in South Africa that came first, second and third, respectively. Others are Cabablanca, Mauritius, Marrakech, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Nairobi.

Nigerian airports often receive low rankings due to a combination of factors, including poor infrastructure, inadequate facilities, and inefficient service delivery.

Many Nigerian airports suffer from outdated infrastructure, including dilapidated runways, inadequate terminal space, and poorly maintained equipment and navigational facilities.

Common problems include poor maintenance, non-functioning equipment like air conditioning, crowded and disorganised environments with touts, and issues with luggage handling, all of which fall short of both local and international standards

While some improvements have been made, issues like inadequate air conditioning, dysfunctional equipment, and overcrowding persist, impacting the overall passenger experience.

It would be recalled that in 2014, three Nigerian airports were rated among the worst in Africa. While the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, was rated 10th worst in Africa, the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja and Port Harcourt International Airport, Port Harcourt, were ranked the seventh and sixth worst airports on the continent. Going by that ranking, Nigeria’s principal gateway airport in Lagos is the worst in Africa.

Automation

The key to getting Nigerian airports out of their present mess lies in investments in automation of most of the processes that deal with passengers and luggage, as well as in the general cleanliness of airports in the country.

Nigeria stands at an inflection point. The allocation of ₦712 billion to transform Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) into a world-class hub is visionary.

Exclusion

Yet, this investment carries a critical vulnerability: the exclusion of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA). This omission threatens to undermine every naira invested.

The decision by the management of NAMA to overhaul the country’s airspace infrastructure gives a fillip to the seriousness the Federal Government attaches to aviation infrastructure and the capacity to close the country’s aviation infrastructure gaps by commencing a comprehensive audit of the entire Kano Flight Information Region (FIR), also known as the Nigerian airspace.

The exercise which commenced last week Tuesday is a systematic self-assessment audit by the agency targeted at examining the overall safety performance, operational efficiency and regulatory compliance of the Nigerian airspace as well as strengthening NAMA’s readiness for the impending Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) Certification by Nigerian Civil Aviation Agency (NCAA) and the forthcoming ICAO Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (USOAP) Coordinated Validation Mission (ICVM) and Regional Office Safety Team (ROST) Mission.

ICAO divides the world’s airspace into Flight Information Regions (FIRs) to provide Air Traffic Services (ATS). Each FIR is officially recognised and published in ICAO documents and aeronautical charts.

FIRs are typically named after the city or location of the Area Control Centre (ACC) responsible for managing that airspace. The ACC is the central unit providing en-route air traffic control and coordination within the FIR.

Designating Nigeria’s airspace

Nigeria’s airspace is internationally designated by ICAO as the Kano Flight Information Region (FIR) because Kano was the country’s first international aviation hub and home to the pioneer Area Control Centre responsible for managing over-flight and en-route traffic. For continuity and global recognition, ICAO retained the name Kano FIR, and it today covers the entire Nigerian airspace as well as portions of the Gulf of Guinea delegated to Nigeria.

According to him, “This audit is a landmark initiative, the first of its kind in NAMA’s 25-year history, and it marks a bold and proactive step by the agency to reinforce its mandate of delivering safe, efficient, and seamless air navigation services in full alignment with international best practices.

An airport without advanced Air Navigation Services (ANS) is infrastructure without intelligence.

MMIA’s runways, terminals, and aprons are the body. The agency’s CNS/ATM (Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management) is the central nervous system. Without the latter, the former cannot function in the agency’s journey towards excellence in airspace management.

Strategic error, consequences

Allocating ₦712 billion exclusively to physical infrastructure while ignoring ANS violates ICAO’s fundamental principle of integrated aviation systems (ICAO Doc 9750), ignores global best practices (Dubai, Singapore, South Africa) where ANS receives 20–30% of major airport funding.

Over time, the country’s radars, especially the Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria (TRACON), are obsolete and unreliable communications increasing mid-air collision risks. Lagos TMA handles 60% of Nigeria’s air traffic with 1980s-era systems.

Without Category III Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), MMIA’s new runways will fail during harmattan – costing airlines ₦28 million/hour in delays (AON Data, 2023). Surface Movement Radar (SMR) gaps make runway incursions 47% more likely (NCAA Safety Audit, 2023).

Consequently, airlines lose $50M/year in fuel and delays due to ANS inefficiencies. Investor confidence erodes or collapses when airports lack ANS resilience could be likened to building Eko Atlantic City without sea walls, while building an airport without ANS is a catastrophe.

Experts’ views

An expert who spoke to Aviation Metric under strict conditions called on the Federal Government to reallocate 20% (N142 billion) of the entire Lagos airport terminal cost to NAMA to tackle decaying airspace infrastructure at many of the country’s airports.

The reallocation of funds to NAMA would help to replace or repair are Lagos ACC automation upgrade to prevent ATC bottlenecks at 40+flights/hours, CAT 3 ILS for MMIA runways to enable 24/7 all-weather operations.

Others are Surface Movement Radar (SMR) to eliminate runway incursions, ATCO recruitment and training to fill 42% staffing deficit and cyber security to prevent system-wide collapses.

He, however, called for a public dashboard tracking all ₦712bn expenditures (including NAMA’s portion) with the engagement of Independent auditors (PwC/Deloitte) validating milestones.

His words, “This is your chance to cement a legacy of integrated, safety-focused aviation transformation. The world is watching. For the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, delivering MMIA as a true hub requires ANS. Excluding NAMA sets your vision up for public failure. Airlines’ profitability hinges on efficient airspace.”

“The ₦712 billion MMIA project is a down payment on Nigeria’s future. But an airport without ANS is a warehouse – a monument to incomplete strategy. Amend the allocation immediately to include allocation for NAMA to tackle airspace navigation infrastructure.”

Chief Executive Officer of Belujane Konsult, Mr. Chris Azu Aligbe, said NAMA has the right to call for an upgrade on facilities, stressing that this is necessary and should be taken.

Air Navigation Service (ANS)

“The government needs to invest in aviation infrastructure beyond terminals. Not only terminals that make up aviation. They should bring these things to the public forum. They should let us know what type of airports they are building, the capacity of the airport after it has been completed. How many years are they projecting that this airport will last before we rebuild it again”?

Last line

MMIA’s runways, terminals, and aprons are the body. NAMA’s CNS/ATM (Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management) is the central nervous system. Without the latter, the former cannot function.

Overcoming Obstacles to Green Hydrogen Adoption Despite the growing momentum and considerable public support, the decarbonised hydrogen industry faces significant financial, technological, and technical challenges.
Decarbonised Hydrogen: Realistic Prospects for a Sustainable Future The decarbonised hydrogen industry is an emerging sector that follows a typical technological maturation curve.","Decarbonised Hydrogen: A Key Lever for Decarbonisation

Hydrogen is used as a raw material in several industries with high CO2 emissions, such as oil refining, steel production, and the manufacture of fertilisers and chemicals. With appropriate adaptations, it can also substitute natural gas in industrial furnaces, thereby contributing to emission reductions in sectors such as cement and steel.

It also plays a growing role in decarbonising the transport sector. On the road, it's found in fuel cell electric vehicles or in hydrogen combustion engines. In maritime and air transport, hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) serve as low-carbon alternatives to replace petroleum-based fuels.

This significant potential has led to a wave of announcements for green and blue hydrogen production projects globally since 2020.

The Global Surge in Hydrogen Projects

To track this rapidly evolving sector, Enerdata has developed a tool that lists all large-scale decarbonised hydrogen projects. Currently, over 830 projects are listed worldwide, each with an electrolyser capacity of at least 100 MW. These have the potential to produce approximately 200 million tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen, as well as 470 million tonnes of clean derivatives (ammonia, methanol, methane, and jet fuel).

As electricity consumption accounts for approximately 70% of hydrogen production costs, regions rich in low-cost renewable resources have a significant advantage (Egypt, Australia, Chile, and Morocco, followed by the United States, China, India, and Europe).

Current Progress and Challenges of Decarbonised Hydrogen

Following a surge in project announcements between 2020 and 2023, 2024 has brought a dose of reality: Many projects are struggling to get past the initial phase or feasibility study and haven't reached a final investment decision. Some projects deemed unrealistic (such as 'Spirit of Scotia' in Canada – 43 million tonnes per year, or 'Western Green Energy Hub' in Australia – 3 million tonnes per year), have even been cancelled. Many other projects can't even secure off takers for the hydrogen they would produce.

Enerdata estimates that only 7% to 9% of announced projects are in an advanced phase, representing a maximum of 75 projects out of the 830 listed. This proportion remains broadly consistent across regions, including Europe and France, with slight variations.

France has announced over 28 large, decarbonised hydrogen projects, with a potential production capacity of over 1.4 million tonnes over the next 10 to 20 years. This contrasts with current hydrogen consumption of approximately 0.6 million tonnes (mostly grey). However, only 3 projects, totalling a combined production capacity of 0.1 million tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen, are in an advanced phase. The French government, also recently updated its national hydrogen strategy, revising the target to 0.5 million tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen, by 2030.

Despite these challenges, some projects are progressing thanks to off-take agreements and final investment decisions. For example, TotalEnergies has partnered with Air Liquide and RWE to supply decarbonised hydrogen to its European refineries. Verso Energy, a French developer, is advancing several green hydrogen projects to produce decarbonised jet fuel (SAF) in France and Finland. The 'Scatec Green Ammonia' project in Egypt is the first hydrogen import project into Europe to secure an off-take agreement and European subsidies.

These successful projects share common characteristics. To bridge the price gap between grey and green hydrogen, developers and buyers rely on a combination of demand- and supply-side subsidies, including local and regional support schemes—essential measures for ensuring economic viability. Public policy also plays a critical role in stimulating demand, using both incentives and regulatory pressures. For example, European regulations set emissions thresholds for refineries and mandate the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the aviation sector. Carbon pricing further supports the shift toward decarbonised hydrogen.

In some cases, green hydrogen buyers pass on some of the additional costs to end-consumers. For instance, the marginal cost of green steel in electric vehicle production is often accepted by consumers, who are willing to pay a premium for a less carbon-intensive product.

Policies and Geopolitics: Catalysts for Hydrogen

The energy transition and geopolitical upheavals — notably the war in Ukraine — have heightened concerns about energy security and supply risks. In response, major policy changes, preferential legislation, and support mechanisms have been introduced to promote cleaner, more local, and diversified energy sources.

Legal frameworks such as the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), as well as the European RED III directive and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), directly support the development and deployment of clean hydrogen. The European Hydrogen Strategy and the RePowerEU initiative have set ambitious targets: to produce 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen locally and import an additional 10 million tonnes by 2030.

Green hydrogen, classified as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) by the European Union, is eligible for various financial incentives (European Innovation Fund, European Hydrogen Bank). Furthermore, industries using these fuels can meet their emission reduction targets while avoiding carbon tax penalties, as is the case for refineries.

Overcoming Obstacles to Green Hydrogen Adoption

Despite the growing momentum and considerable public support, the decarbonised hydrogen industry faces significant financial, technological, and technical challenges. The primary obstacle remains its high production cost (approximately €6/kg in Europe) compared to traditional grey hydrogen (approximately €2/kg).

Beyond cost, the complexity of these projects is heightened by the need to develop additional solar and wind farms, secure water supplies, ensure proximity between production and consumption to limit transport, and adhere to strict environmental, social, and safety standards.

In Europe, to qualify as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) and retain its 'green' label, a project must comply with three strict principles: additionality, geographical correlation, and temporal correlation between renewable electricity production and green hydrogen production. The need for Rigorous synchronisation and thorough documentation throughout the process further increase costs and complexity.

For projects aiming for international export, hydrogen transport is a major challenge. Its low volumetric density requires it to be compressed to very high pressure, liquefied, or converted into more easily transportable liquid vectors (ammonia or methanol). These processes are energy-intensive and increase technical complexity as well as the necessary investments.

Decarbonised Hydrogen: Realistic Prospects for a Sustainable Future

The decarbonised hydrogen industry is an emerging sector that follows a typical technological maturation curve. This development will involve a learning process, the selection of the most resilient projects, a mix of setbacks and successes, and valuable lessons. These challenges are inherent to any new technology and should not deter investment in this promising energy vector. Hydrogen is, and will continue to be, a viable solution for decarbonising many industries.

However, this potential must be evaluated by considering economic opportunities, technical limitations, and available alternatives. Hydrogen should not be seen as the sole solution to carbon emissions, but rather as one option among others, to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The relationship between emission reduction and associated cost must guide public investments and subsidies.

While road transport can largely be decarbonised through battery electric vehicles, hydrogen is better suited for heavy transport applications. Continued investment and innovation are essential in marine engines using ammonia and methanol derived from green hydrogen. The maritime transport sector, a significant contributor to CO₂ emissions, currently lacks viable alternatives to fossil fuels.

Priority should also be given to developing industrial clusters with sufficient hydrogen demand, supported by associated infrastructure (such as gas pipelines repurposed for hydrogen transport) to enhance efficiency. Simplifying authorisation procedures for renewable energy projects and reducing investment risks will help lower development costs and accelerate the deployment of decarbonised hydrogen.

The French industrial value chain plays an important role in the hydrogen ecosystem, both in Europe and globally. It is among the most developed in the world and includes equipment manufacturers, project developers, and other value-creating players, thereby contributing to French industrial leadership in various regions worldwide – a positive trend that deserves recognition and support.

Lufthansa Cargo CEO Ashwin Bhat said: “Signing this memorandum with Shein represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence.
It demonstrates the importance of concrete measures and reliable implementation in the international air freight business.","A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed by both the companies on 19 August.

Under the MoU, Shein and Lufthansa Cargo will collaborate on the implementation of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offsetting solutions for Shein’s deliveries.

The goal is to finalise this adoption within six months.

Additionally, the partnership will explore other initiatives aimed at promoting renewable and lower-carbon energy sources in air transport operations.

This collaboration falls in line with Shein’s ongoing efforts to mitigate its transportation-related carbon emissions.

Shein global fulfilment general manager Ethan Shen said: “Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide Shein with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of SAF where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network. While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonization strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency, and exploring other low-carbon solutions.”

To ensure transparency and credibility, Lufthansa Cargo will issue “Proof of Sustainability” certificates for the SAF quantities used by Shein.

These certificates will adhere to externally verified standards and provide a traceable account of emission reductions compared to traditional jet fuel.

The two entities are also considering additional collaborative efforts such as knowledge sharing and enhancing traceability and reporting of operational and environmental data.

Lufthansa Cargo CEO Ashwin Bhat said: “Signing this memorandum with Shein represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence. It demonstrates the importance of concrete measures and reliable implementation in the international air freight business. Together with all stakeholders within the supply chain, we are driving the development of more sustainable global supply chains in line with our purpose: Enabling Global Business.”

The carrier, part of Lufthansa Group, announced Tuesday it has signed a multi-year agreement with Swiss climate tech start-up neustark to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—making SWISS the first airline to join forces with the CDR firm.

Under the deal, SWISS will finance a portion of neustark’s expansion across Europe, where the start-up already operates 38 capture and storage sites in seven countries.

Neustark specializes in “mineralization,” a process that locks CO2 into recycled concrete and other mineral waste, permanently preventing it from reentering the atmosphere. The company expects to scale to hundreds of thousands of tons of CO2 removal in the coming years.

SWISS and neustark – another airline and carbon removal partnership

The move underscores SWISS’s broader climate strategy, which blends sustainable aviation fuel with investment in carbon capture and removal. Earlier this year, the airline also deepened ties with Swiss innovators Climeworks and Synhelion, which focus on direct air capture and solar fuels.

Jens Fehlinger, SWISS’s chief executive, said the partnership represents an “early step toward scaling” carbon removal technologies. “Permanent CO2 removal is a key building block on the path to net zero in aviation,” he said.

For neustark, the deal is both a milestone and a signal of confidence from a notoriously hard-to-decarbonize sector. “Pioneers like SWISS play a crucial role in further deploying our technology to permanently remove exponentially more tonnes of CO2 every single day,” said co-founder Valentin Gutknecht.

By linking two carbon-intensive industries—aviation and construction—the companies aim to accelerate the commercialization of durable carbon removal, which could prove essential for reaching net zero emissions.

In the U.S. direct air capture company 1PointFive has also been inking agreements with airlines like Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA) and easyJet with several more prospects exploring options.

neustark solidifying its position

Though details of the agreement haven’t been revealed, neustark appears to be on an upwards trajectory.

After raising $69 million in a funding round led by BlackRock and Temasek in June 2024, the company increased its efforts to achieve its goal of removing 1 million tons of CO2 by 2030.

A postdoctoral scholar at Oregon State University (OSU), Ibrahim designs and tests nanocatalyst strategies that upgrade crude bio-oils produced from residues like rice straw and forest slash into energy-dense, stable fuel fractions suitable for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathways.

“We’re learning how to get more usable fuel out of waste biomass while lowering carbon intensity,” he says. “My long-term goal is to help transfer these methods to contexts like Ghana, where agricultural by-products are abundant.”

From residues to renewable fuels

Thermochemical processes such as fast/catalytic pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction break down biomass into a heavy, oxygen-rich oil. Ibrahim’s work focuses on bimetallic magnetic nanocatalysts specialized materials that strip oxygen, stabilize the oil, and boost yields during upgrading. In plain terms: less waste, better product, and a cleaner drop-in feed for SAF refining.

Why aviation and why now

Aviation is a hard-to-abate sector; SAF is one of the few near-term tools to reduce its footprint. By improving conversion efficiency and fuel quality from low-value residues, Ibrahim’s research tackles a known bottleneck on the path to lower-carbon jet fuel.

The work has been recognized through peer-reviewed publications and invitations to evaluate others’ research as a journal reviewer and conference poster judge.

Policy relevance and real-world deployment

At OSU, Ibrahim plays a leading role in a state-funded Clean Fuel Initiative modeling Oregon-specific carbon-intensity (CI) outcomes for fuels derived from woody biomass.

He co-authored a Legislature-directed report describing GREET-based CI modeling, process design, and bench/pilot-linked yields evidence that his laboratory advances are feeding into policy and program planning.

What this could mean for Ghana

Ghana generates significant volumes of agricultural by-products (e.g., cocoa husks, corn stalks, sawdust). Ibrahim sees an opportunity to convert a disposal challenge into a fuel resource, provided there is sustained R&D, pilot facilities, and public-private partnerships.

“I don’t yet have formal collaborations in Ghana,” he notes.

“But the science is mature enough to begin feasibility studies mapping feedstock logistics, testing catalysts on local residues, and validating the carbon-intensity benefits under Ghana’s grid conditions.”

The road ahead

Challenges remain capital costs, supply-chain logistics, and consistent policy frameworks but Ibrahim is pragmatic. “The key is to start small and measure everything,” he says. “If Ghana invests in targeted pilots and workforce training, we can build toward a regional hub for sustainable fuels that creates jobs and reduces import dependence.”

Editor’s note: As of August 2025, Dr. Ibrahim’s publications have accrued 77 citations (h-index 3); he has served as a journal peer reviewer and conference poster judge, and he recently co-authored a state-commissioned clean-fuel report at OSU. He welcomes inquiries from Ghanaian universities, agencies, and industry on pilot collaborations.

“The evolution of data recorders is mostly around video recording and providing additional information whenever there is an incident,” said Yahav.","Developments in cloud-based flight data recorder (FDR) technologies, data management and analytics offer opportunities for business aircraft operators to add value to their existing systems while bolstering overall flight safety.

“There is a missed opportunity with integrated data collection and analysis,” said Dror Yahav, CEO of Universal Avionics. “While many OEMs, install it to check a requirement, flight data recorders are a powerful tool that links to everything that your aircraft is connected to.”

Although their FDRs and cockpit voice recorders collect massive amounts of data, many operators often fail to do anything with it. Capturing the right data can be the first step toward improving pilot performance. It can help provide effective analysis to determine what factors may have contributed to an incident or accident. It has the potential to help prevent future accidents and enable more efficient operations.

Within the past two decades, innovations in this technology for the business aviation sector have been significant. ForeFlight Mobile, for example, is designed to efficiently and effectively help pilots and professional flight crews gather information on weather and on their destinations.

Cloud solutions, such as ForeFlight’s CloudAhoy, aim to improve post-flight debriefings to advance flight training. ForeFlight Cloud integrates with FDR systems, stores data and enables data sharing as well as data analysis. This allows FDRs to go beyond tracking and recording features. The focus is flight safety, data security – including of cloud-stored pilot flight logs, regulatory compliance and enhanced operational efficiency.

“One current development is the ongoing integration of flight data management and analysis into cloud platforms, bringing airline-style flight data monitoring and Flight Operations Quality Assurance programs to business aviation,” said Hannes Griebel, director consulting services, aerospace and assured space systems at CGI.

CGI has developed its VirtualFlightRecorder, a cloud-based flight recorder data storage and protection system. “It complements the functions traditionally performed by the conventional crash-resistant FDRs by storing flight recorder data transmitted by an aircraft in flight,” Griebel said.

Griebel acknowledged that modern avionics or retrofit units, which are often quick-access recorders or data gateways, can upload recorded flight data to cloud services after each flight, where it is processed for trends and safety insights. The initiative adds a layer of data security by using blockchain technology to authenticate, log and secure incoming flight data records to ensure confidence in the data collated for analysis.

CVR + FDR = CVFDR

FDRs and CVRs are usually two separate boxes. Universal Avionics decided to change this. The company has developed a new generation of these systems called KAPTURE. Installed in business jets and other aircraft, the new systems were designed to comply with European regulations and the latest FAA Technical Standard Orders.

“We wanted to ensure that customers are compliant with the latest mandate, which required new airplanes to equip a 25-hour CVR by May 16, 2025, and all airplanes will need to retrofit to this regulation by 2030,” Griebel said. The legislation was part of the 2024 FAA reauthorization.

“After the base regulation requirements were met, we still wanted to provide customers with more value for their daily workflows,” said Yahav. There is much stored value available in FDRs, which most users do not use to improve their operations. Universal Avionics aims to support customers with their data analysis as well as with their compliance obligations.

This involves the development of products and services, including the integration of FDR and CVR functions into one black box to create a single CVFDR unit. It records voice audio, flight data or both. For security reasons, in the business aviation sector, the data is encrypted. This has to be decrypted when there is an accident.

“Users of our flight management system have constant access to their data, enabling them to optimize their operations and to undertake proactive and predictive maintenance,” said Yahav. AI tools can be used when there are large amounts of data to analyze, for predictive maintenance, or to improve fuel efficiency. “You do not want to waste time performing maintenance too early or risk unscheduled downtime when it’s too late,” Yahav said.

Adding Video Data to FDRs

Technology also enables the integration of video into flight data recorders, connecting a cockpit camera to make a visual record of pilot activities or intruders entering the flight deck. “The evolution of data recorders is mostly around video recording and providing additional information whenever there is an incident,” said Yahav.

“Virtual recorder (VR) technologies have the potential to revolutionize CVR and FDR analysis by providing immersive and interactive experiences for investigators,” said Borka Vlacic, director of product management, Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. With this kind of technology, it is possible to recreate a cockpit environment and overlay any relevant data.

Connectivity Is Key

These innovations can often work with any kind of connectivity, but not always. “Only satellite communications provide practical connectivity solutions for operations over water or remote areas, where the safety benefits are greatest,” said Griebel.

Satellite is the only practical method to reach cloud-based storage solutions to back up data for an aircraft that operates in remote areas. “In practice, this means flight data is no longer confined to a physical device on board – it is also sent to remote storage in real time or near-real-time,” Griebel said. With modern satellite communications systems, connected recorders can transmit continuously, at intervals, or be triggered by an emergency, depending on operator preference.",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Pilot-ipad-flightdeck.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 15:56:29.536496

This partnership combines Sekisui’s CO2→CO chemical looping technology with Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch (FT) microchannel reactor technology to enable the manufacture of synthetic fuels using CO2 as a feedstock, thus contributing to decarbonization.

The aviation industry accounts for approximately 2.6% of global CO2 emissions, and a key emission reduction measure that is gaining attention is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA; Paris, France; www.iea.org) and other organizations, 65% of CO2 reduction targets for the aviation industry can be achieved through the adoption of SAF. At present, conventional SAF is manufactured from waste oil and biomass-derived raw materials. However, considering the anticipated increase in SAF demand going forward, the early commencement and widespread adoption of e-SAF—which is manufactured from CO2 and hydrogen derived from renewable energy—is considered essential.

In this context, CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) technology, which converts CO2 into fuel and chemical products for practical use, is attracting attention. CCU technology enables the reuse of CO2 as a valuable resource and replaces fossil resources, thereby reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

Sekisui Chemical is working to reduce global CO2 emissions through the social implementation of CCU technology. To date, it has developed a unique chemical looping technology that converts CO2 into CO with a high reaction yield (90% or higher).

Velocys has been developing FT reaction technology for the manufacture of synthetic fuels from synthetic gas (a mixture of CO and H2) converted from municipal waste, industrial waste, biomass, and CO2 for over 20 years. Its proprietary catalyst and microchannel reactor design have established productivity six to ten times higher than conventional FT reaction technology.

If the operator exceeds a carbon emissions threshold, it must be offset through buying carbon credits, which are verified by a third party before submission to a national accreditation body.
Founded in 2024 by aviation industry veteran Houseman, Zenith Net-Zero emerged out of ZenithJet, a firm that provides aircraft owners with technical support.
One client is Jetcraft, a London-based aircraft broker, which asked Zenith Net-Zero to measure its carbon emissions and advise on purchasing carbon credits.
As its contribution to the SAF industry, Zenith Net-Zero is working on a project for SAF development in Africa.","Zenith Net-Zero, an environmental advisory focused on aviation, is now one of the few Canadian companies accredited by a national standards organization to provide assurance services for an international carbon offsets program.

Last week, the Dorval, Que.-based company announced the Standards Council of Canada affirmed its ability to deliver greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions validation and verification for aircraft operators that submit reports to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a major program run by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

CORSIA requires members to buy credits on carbon markets as a means of offsetting emissions generated on international routes between participating countries. Operators take steps such as paying to develop carbon sinks or produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Zenith Net-Zero can independently verify emission reports and offset claims submitted by aircraft operators such as Air Canada and WestJet to CORSIA.

A handful of domestic firms are accredited for such a service and many Canadian aircraft operators rely on foreign companies for such a task, Nick Houseman, founder and president of Zenith Net-Zero, said in an interview with Sustainable Biz Canada.

“It’s a big deal for us in the sense of, for Canada there (isn’t) really anybody accredited to do this in Canada,” he said.

Zenith Net-Zero's validation and verification

Armed with its accreditation from the council, Zenith Net-Zero can verify and validate if an aircraft operator is in line with CORSIA’s standards, and calculate its pollution based on factors such as fuel use and flights.

If the operator exceeds a carbon emissions threshold, it must be offset through buying carbon credits, which are verified by a third party before submission to a national accreditation body.

He is pleased to offer the validation and verification for CORISA after years of contemplating the possibility, Houseman said.

“I think it will be valuable to operators in Canada that have somebody in Canada who understands the landscape here and help them meet their obligations under CORSIA.”

The company can also provide its assurance for operators in other countries, especially with heightened pressure for CORSIA compliance he anticipates will only grow.

Founded in 2024 by aviation industry veteran Houseman, Zenith Net-Zero emerged out of ZenithJet, a firm that provides aircraft owners with technical support. ZenithJet offered environmental consulting services in 2022, helping aviation businesses understand their climate-warming pollution and steps to reduce it, Houseman said.

“We saw the opportunity there in the sense of, it’s not easy to comply with these schemes,” he explained. “So there’s a lot of work that goes into it, understanding all of the flights and for operators it’s not their core business.”

To guide those operators, its services include assisting clients in developing carbon offset projects, accounting for and reporting greenhouse gas emissions, and assessments of the environmental impacts of products and services.

The aviation industry is a notable polluter, responsible for 2.5 per cent of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions.

The future of sustainable aviation, according to Houseman

Zenith Net-Zero’s clients are mostly in business aviation, an industry in which Houseman has developed deep ties. They include operators of small business jets to Boeing 747s and small consulting firms. One client is Jetcraft, a London-based aircraft broker, which asked Zenith Net-Zero to measure its carbon emissions and advise on purchasing carbon credits.

Such offsets remain a primary tool for decarbonizing aviation because low-carbon jet fuel remains highly expensive and limited in supply, Houseman said. Yet SAF will likely be pivotal for aviation to reach net-zero, according to the International Air Transport Association in a 2025 document.

The Canadian government published a plan with the goal of 10 per cent SAF use by 2030. But such an ambition remains largely aspirational, while development on SAF production projects take place in Canada.

Electric-battery planes are at least 20 years away from mass adoption and limited to short flights, Houseman predicts, eliminating one pathway for quickly reducing aviation’s emissions.

For now, he sees the best options for aircraft operators to cut their emissions as adopting electric ground support equipment and using renewable energy.

As its contribution to the SAF industry, Zenith Net-Zero is working on a project for SAF development in Africa. The company is seeking to raise funds for a feasibility study for the effort.

“The conditions are right in certain areas of Africa,” Houseman said, on account of the abundant agricultural waste that can be turned into SAF feedstock plus the high cost of importing conventional aviation fuel for the continent.

Another innovation the company is exploring is reducing methane emissions from dairy cows by supplementing their feed with mycelium, the thin, root-like parts of fungi. It could even be added to manure to make fertilizer or SAF feedstock, Houseman said. He hopes to get the project off the ground later this year.",https://squall.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/posts/2025082503-nick-houseman-800x600.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:56:56.506903

This marked a significant step forward: Airbus in Canada directly issued official sustainability credentials for SAF to a customer for the first time.

This landmark flight not only confirms Airbus’ capability to provide Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) directly to customers and operators but also supports the industry’s commitment to decarbonisation.

With PoS credits for a 50 percent SAF blend applied through the mass balance process, this ferry flight conducted by Air France’s 46th A220-300 named “VAISON-LA- ROMAINE,” represented more than 25 tonnes reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels.

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game- changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability, Air France-KLM.

Since the announcement of the first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) delivery at Airbus site in Canada, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights, this achievement solidifies Airbus’ commitment to using SAF for internal operations as well as customer ferry flights across all its commercial aircraft assembly sites and delivery centers worldwide.

“In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,” said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada.

“And we’re pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50 percent SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year.

On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.”

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100 percent SAF by 2030. According to the PoS under CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme

approved by ICAO, the SAF received at Airbus in Mirabel is certified for 85 percent reduction in GHG emissions on its lifecycle compared to fossil fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the aerospace industry’s progress towards decarbonization by 2050.

SAF management in Mirabel is done using mass balance, a chain of custody model in which a company accounts for volumes of certified products by looking at the volumes entering the operation and the equivalent volume of products leaving the operations as a measurement, minus any processing losses.

As such, the SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel (Jet A-1) as per established industry standards and auditable bookkeeping.

Air France’s first A220-300s, part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft, have been flying on its medium-haul network since October 2021. The A220 delivers up to 25 percent lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plays a central role in reducing the carbon footprint of air transport, allowing at least a 65% reduction in CO₂ emissions over the full life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel.

Air France-KLM is among the world's top three SAF users and applies a strict sourcing policy: only fuel that does not compete with human food supply, does not contribute to deforestation, and is not produced from palm oil is selected.

Another joint initiative between the Group and the manufacturer: Air France-KLM and Airbus have signed an agreement enabling Airbus employees to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel by supporting the production of sustainable aviation fuel. This voluntary commitment is part of Air France-KLM's ""SAF Corporate"" program, which facilitates the financing and purchase of SAF. Since joining the program in November 2023, Airbus has cut its emissions by more than 2,000 tons of CO₂ through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF.

An increasingly modern and efficient fleet

Fleet renewal is a cornerstone of the Group's transformation strategy. With fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions reduced by 20% per seat-kilometer compared with previous-generation aircraft, the Airbus A220 embodies this ambition.

Air France-KLM has nearly 200 new-generation aircraft (A220, A320neo, A321neo, A350, and Boeing 787) on firm order, and in 2024 alone the Group took delivery of 41 new-generation aircraft across all its airlines.

These major investments - totaling more than €2 billion per year - are contributing to a fleet that, by 2030, could be composed of up to 80% new-generation aircraft.

Acceptance validates proven technical capability and production scale required for Clearinghouse qualification

Milestone positions Unifuel as a credible pathway towards 100% drop-in SAF for commercial airline adoption

LOS ALTOS, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–As the global aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions while demand for air travel continues to grow, Universal Fuel Technologies’ (Unifuel) Ethanol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced via the company’s Flexiforming technology has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse, which supports the technical evaluation of new aviation fuels, for qualification. This acceptance positions Unifuel among an exclusive group of companies advancing toward ASTM qualification, the essential gateway for new fuels to enter commercial aviation markets.

“The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse is an important validation of our Flexiforming technology and significantly derisks our road to approval for commercial use,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. “This advancement indicates that our SAF can meet the toughest performance standards without sacrificing scalability or quality, and has technical credibility in the eyes of industry experts.”

The ASTM D4054 evaluation process is the aviation industry’s framework for ensuring that new fuels can safely power aircraft engines. It includes multiple tiers of testing, data collection, and technical review by experts from leading aerospace companies. Acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse requires demonstrating, by independent testing, that a fuel is not only technically credible and can be produced at a meaningful scale, but also that it has met strict quality and safety criteria.

“We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,” said Dr. Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director. “This marks a significant milestone for Universal Fuel Technologies towards their goal of commercial acceptance.”

The acceptance follows a successful five-month pilot project where the company produced nearly 100 liters of sample material for four different SAF pathways under stable process conditions. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol, and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), into SAF. The samples then underwent comprehensive testing by Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, the world-leading authority on SAF research.

“The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse confirms that Flexiforming can produce high-quality synthetic aviation turbine fuel with a clear route to ASTM qualification,” said Denis Pchelintsev, Co-Founder of Universal Fuel Technologies. “We’re positioned to support the aviation industry’s urgent need for cost-effective synthetic aviation turbine fuel that doesn’t compromise on performance or safety.”

Following Unifuel’s D4054 Clearinghouse acceptance, the company will proceed with producing larger fuel samples for detailed Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing required for ASTM qualification. The initial qualification could come as soon as the end of 2026 as a blend component with fossil jet. From there, further testing is planned, with the goal of leading to a 100% drop-in fully synthetic jet fuel in the future.

Unifuel’s advancement through the qualification process is supported by Flexiforming’s unique capabilities, which upgrade various renewable feedstocks—including ethanol, methanol, renewable naphthas, and liquefied petroleum gas—into high-quality SAF. In ethanol-to-jet applications, Flexiforming uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other processes, cutting production costs by up to 50%. The technology is also valuable as a complementary process, upgrading low-value naphtha byproduct from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, creating new revenue opportunities for renewable fuel producers.

The company’s growing purchase of carbon credits shows its urgent need to meet climate goals.","Sasol Ltd., a South African energy and chemicals firm, is gaining attention. They reported stronger earnings and are shifting their strategy to buy more carbon credits. The move comes as the company, the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the region, boosts coal production and grows its renewable energy portfolio.

Investors, regulators, and climate observers are watching closely to see how Sasol balances its reliance on fossil fuels with its stated commitment to reaching net-zero emissions.

Earnings Power: Fueling a Dual Strategy

In its latest earnings report, Sasol posted a year-on-year improvement supported by stable product prices and efficiency gains. The company’s operating profit rose due to stronger chemical sales.

However, this was partly offset by higher costs in its coal division. Earnings were strong, giving Sasol the money to invest in fossil fuels and low-carbon projects.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, the company earned 10.60 rand per share. This is a turnaround from a loss of 69.94 rand per share. Asset write-downs fell sharply to 20.7 billion rand, down from 74.9 billion rand last year.

Sasol gained from a 4.3 billion rand settlement with Transnet over oil transport fees. Capital expenditure dropped 16% to 25.4 billion rand. This helped improve the company’s financial profile.

Management highlighted that a resilient balance sheet is critical as the company continues its transition journey.

Sasol has steady cash flows. This helps support its short-term coal operations. It also funds longer-term projects like renewable energy growth and carbon reduction efforts.

Sasol’s renewed profit helped lift investor sentiment. Following the earnings, the company’s shares climbed 7% in pre-market trading. Its stock on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: SOL) surged by 44% over the last quarter.

Analysts predict that earnings per share will increase by 20% year-on-year. This shows rising confidence in the company’s ability to balance profit and sustainability.

Rising Carbon Credit Purchases: Flexibility or Delay?

One of the biggest headlines is Sasol’s decision to boost its purchase of carbon credits.

In the fiscal year that ended in June 2025, Sasol’s carbon credit purchases increased to R723 million, a 25% increase year-on-year.

This amount was nearly triple the value of the credits it bought in 2023.

Since 2019, Sasol has acquired more than 11 million South African carbon credits, which has reduced its carbon tax liability by more than R650 million.

Most of these credits come from international renewable energy and reforestation projects, while some are linked to African-based carbon offset programs. Sasol plans to grow its carbon credit portfolio, showing its commitment to climate responsibility.

Some offset projects supported by Sasol include:

Wonderbag: In 2021, Sasol announced it would use carbon credits generated by the Wonderbag project, which provides non-electric heat-retention cookers to reduce household emissions.

Bethlehem Hydro: In 2020, Sasol purchased over 100,000 credits from Bethlehem Hydro, a 7MW hydropower plant that was the first Independent Power Producer in South Africa.

Nitrous oxide abatement: As far back as 2007, Sasol received credits for a nitrous oxide abatement project at its nitric acid plants in Sasolburg and Secunda.

However, it recognizes that cutting emissions from its own operations is tough in the near term. The company plans to steadily increase reliance, but acknowledges that credits are a temporary solution.

The use of credits has generated debate. Supporters say it gives companies flexibility to meet interim targets while low-carbon technologies scale.

Critics argue it can delay direct emissions cuts. Sasol’s growing use of offsets shows the urgent climate pressures and the challenges of moving away from coal.

RELATED: How Kinetic Coalition Leverages Energy Transition Credits to Close Coal Plants Early

Coal’s Grip: South Africa’s Energy Dilemma

Sasol is one of South Africa’s top coal users. It relies on coal for power and to make synthetic fuels and chemicals. Its Secunda plant is one of the single largest point sources of carbon dioxide globally, emitting more than 56 million tons of CO₂ equivalent each year.

The world’s biggest producer of fuels and chemicals from coal emits around 63 million tons of CO₂ equivalent each year. This makes it one of Africa’s largest industrial polluters.

The company believes coal is still essential for South Africa’s energy and industry right now. This is especially true due to the country’s electricity shortages and its dependence on Eskom, the state utility. Sasol knows that relying on this can lead to risks such as regulatory pressure, investor scrutiny, and possible costs from future carbon pricing.

Counting Carbon: Sasol’s Net-Zero Targets and Progress

Despite its coal footprint, Sasol has stepped up efforts to diversify its energy mix. The company is putting money into renewable energy projects. This includes solar and wind farms. These efforts will help provide cleaner electricity for its operations.

Moreover, partnerships with independent power producers are helping Sasol shift portions of its energy use away from coal-generated power.

In addition, Sasol is advancing work in green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Its Fischer-Tropsch technology, long used for coal-to-liquids production, is being adapted for cleaner feedstocks, such as natural gas and green hydrogen. The company announced pilot projects to produce low-carbon chemicals for local and global markets.

Sasol aims to cut its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% by 2030. This goal uses a 2017 baseline, which is about 72 million tons of CO₂e. Progress: current emissions are down about 13% from baseline.

It aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. However, it admits that success relies on policy support, technological progress, and available funding.

In summary, Sasol’s key emission reduction initiatives are:

Green hydrogen projects – Developing hydrogen production in South Africa through partnerships to support cleaner fuels and power.

Renewable energy procurement – Securing up to 1,200 MW of renewable electricity (wind and solar) to replace coal-based power at operations.

Energy efficiency improvements – Implementing process optimization and equipment upgrades to reduce energy use across its facilities.

Coal-to-gas transition – Shifting part of its feedstock mix from coal toward natural gas, which has a lower carbon footprint.

Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) – Exploring technologies to capture CO₂ from operations for use in chemicals or fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development – Advancing projects to produce low-carbon jet fuel from sustainable feedstocks.

Offsets and carbon credits – Expanding purchases of carbon credits to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions.

Markets in Motion: Offsets, Renewables, and Risks

Sasol’s strategy reflects broader challenges facing energy and industrial companies worldwide. Carbon credits are gaining popularity. The voluntary carbon market was worth over $2 billion in 2024. It’s expected to grow to nearly $50 billion by 2030, under the best-case scenario.

However, the credibility of offsets is under scrutiny, and investors are demanding more transparency on how credits are used.

At the same time, global coal demand remains strong, particularly in emerging markets. South Africa’s energy system still relies heavily on coal, which generates about 80% of the country’s electricity. This makes decarbonization complex, as companies like Sasol must balance energy security with climate commitments.

Meanwhile, renewable energy costs continue to fall. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of new power generation in most regions. For Sasol, scaling renewables not only helps reduce emissions but also lowers long-term energy costs.

Balancing Growth, Risk, and Climate Goals

Sasol’s higher earnings give it the financial strength to follow its dual-track strategy. This means it can keep expanding coal operations and invest in low-carbon solutions. The company’s growing purchase of carbon credits shows its urgent need to meet climate goals. It also reflects the challenge of cutting emissions from coal-heavy operations.

Sasol’s future will depend on whether it can scale up renewable energy, develop viable low-carbon technologies, and manage the risks tied to its coal reliance. Its net-zero commitment remains a long-term goal. Yet, the company’s latest moves suggest it is trying to walk a fine line between financial performance and climate responsibility.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2423893263.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 09:56:46.804333

Abu Dhabi is well placed to lead the UAE’s next wave of climate innovation, particularly in scaling hardware-intensive technologies at the intersection of climate, infrastructure and manufacturing. While the UAE has made global progress in clean energy and sustainability, a critical gap remains: the absence of infrastructure and mechanisms to pilot and scale climate-deep tech solutions. These include innovations such as green construction materials, energy storage systems, low-carbon industrial processes and other technologies vital to the future of infrastructure.

On 21 May 2025, a closed-door roundtable was held under Chatham House Rules during Make it in the Emirates (MIITE) Week to explore how Abu Dhabi could lead the development of a national piloting programme. The session brought together key stakeholders from government, industry, academia and finance. Participants reached a clear consensus: the UAE must create real-world testing environments, align regulatory pathways and de-risk capital-intensive innovation. These steps are essential to bridge the “valley of death” that many startups face as they move from prototype to deployment.

This brief presents the outcomes of that roundtable discussion and has been created in collaboration with Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW), Global Climate Financial Centre (GCFC), UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators (UICCA), Hub71 and PwC Middle East. It identifies the infrastructure, capital and policy gaps that currently constrain scale-up and offers a three-pillar action framework for Abu Dhabi to lead this transformation, building on existing programmes by Hub71, Masdar City and ADIO and aligning with national industrial and climate goals such as the Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology’s (MOIAT) Operation 300bn.

Defining the focus

“Climate-deep tech” refers to hardware- and systems-intensive technologies that address climate mitigation or adaptation and are relevant to the future of infrastructure, including energy storage, green construction materials, carbon capture and industrial process decarbonisation. This brief does not cover general software-based climate solutions or consumer apps.

1. Key findings and gaps

1.1 Piloting infrastructure: What’s missing?

Abu Dhabi provides strong support for incubation and now has the opportunity to enhance its infrastructure for real-world piloting and light manufacturing.

Specific gaps include:

High OPEX for pilot sites, including real estate and utilities. One startup reported annual costs of Dhs150m for a modest pilot site

Insufficient number of climate-tech tailored zones (e.g. Hub71 + ClimateTech that was launched during COP28 to accelerate startups developing climate solutions), especially for industrial decarbonisation and grid-related innovation

Insufficient number of testing environments or regulatory sandboxes for first-of-a-kind (FOAK) technologies

These additions would help startups move beyond lab-scale validation. Without purpose-built zones and environments that support experimentation, Abu Dhabi risks losing commercially promising innovations to other markets.",https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/zz-test-brand-assets-pages-25/l2-l3-primary-context/desktop/pwc_digital-banner_1600x900_gettyimages-1092342600.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 10:56:50.696383

The latest revision of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), favours green hydrogen over blue hydrogen, helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally.
""European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,"" said Alan Gelder.
Average green hydrogen costs dropped 18% in the latest EU auctions, with German bids falling more than 55%.
But it requires policy intervention to lower green hydrogen production costs and increase the refineries' offtake.","High costs have kept green hydrogen projects from taking off, but new regulations in the EU’s refining sector offers a solution to launching this carbon friendly technology at scale, according to a new Horizons report from Wood Mackenzie.

According to the report, “Isn’t it ironic? How Europe’s oil refiners could offer a route to scale up green hydrogen”, European refiners are set to require approximately 0.5 million tpy of green hydrogen by 2030 to comply with EU regulations, replacing about 30% of current CO2 emitting hydrogen production. Refining represents one of the largest hydrogen opportunities globally, which, alongside ammonia and methanol production, accounts for 98% of current demand.

The latest revision of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), favours green hydrogen over blue hydrogen, helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally.

""European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,"" said Alan Gelder. ""Numerous green hydrogen projects have already targeted the sector.""

The report finds that of the 6 million tpy of low-carbon hydrogen capacity that has taken a final investment decision (FID), European refineries have already committed more than US$5 billion of capital.

Refiners demonstrate strongest market appetite

Recent EU Hydrogen Bank auction results reveal refineries' commitment to green hydrogen adoption, with the sector showing the highest willingness to pay premium prices at an average levelised cost of hydrogen of US$9.23/kg – demonstrating their requirement to meet regulatory mandates. This compares favourably with Wood Mackenzie's asset-level modelling of refinery-targeted projects, which produces costs of US$7.04 - 8.30/kg.

The encouraging market signals extend beyond pricing. Average green hydrogen costs dropped 18% in the latest EU auctions, with German bids falling more than 55%. However, progress remains uneven across the bloc, with slow national adoption of RED III legislation hampering project development in many member states.

Long-term growth lies in transport fuels

While refinery decarbonisation offers the strongest near-term investment case, the marine and aviation sectors present massive long-term growth opportunities for green hydrogen derivatives. The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation framework alone requires sustainable aviation fuel to power 6% of the jet pool by 2030, with 1.2% coming from green hydrogen-based e-fuels.

By 2050, sustainable aviation fuel mandates could require 8 million t of green hydrogen – representing a compound annual growth rate of over 15% for this sector alone. Similarly, Europe's FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the International Maritime Organisation's Net Zero Framework are driving interest in hydrogen-derived marine fuels.

""The opportunities for low-carbon hydrogen have come full circle,"" said Murray Douglas, Vice President of Hydrogen Research at Wood Mackenzie. ""The traditional sectors of refining, ammonia and methanol are showing the most progress, ahead of the many other new demand sectors being touted for hydrogen. Parts of the refining sector can be decarbonised quickly – and at an acceptable cost. But it requires policy intervention to lower green hydrogen production costs and increase the refineries' offtake.

""Marine and aviation hold much of the long-term potential for hydrogen derivatives, as these sectors are the most challenging to electrify. The challenge lies in competing fuels, the costs of production and the final shape of the policies providing support.""

Policy gaps remain key barrier

Despite the progress, significant hurdles remain. Current EU policy requires RFNBOs to account for only 1% of transport sector energy use by 2030 - a modest target that reflects the challenges in expanding supply. Member states have been slow to transpose RED III into national legislation, creating regulatory uncertainty that has slowed project development across most of the EU.

The report concludes that while European refiners could play a critical role in scaling up the green hydrogen industry, success depends on continued cost reductions and stronger policy support to fully kick-start demand across the continent.",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/oil-refinery-plant-01.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:06.874459

Those firms, like most in the field, are pure electric. But Canadian start-up Horizon is taking a different approach, which it hopes could secure a sizeable chunk of the market.

“We saw a decent gap in the marketplace opening up for a longer-range, all-weather, faster machine that could carry more and had several other layers of safety and redundancy on board,” said CEO and co-founder Brandon Robinson to Professional Engineering. “We thought it was smart to have a power source on board that is 30 to 40 times as dense as even the best aerospace-grade batteries.”

For the Cavorite X7, that power source will be jet fuel or potentially sustainable aviation fuel in future. With 800km (500 miles) forecast range and a maximum speed of 450km/h (280mph), the six-passenger, one-pilot aircraft could fly much further than pure electric eVTOLs and much faster than helicopters.

The hybrid approach is not the only unusual feature of the X7 – unlike other flying taxis it has fixed wings, lined with battery-powered ducted fans. These will be uncovered for electrically powered ascent and descent before the aircraft switches to a fossil-fuelled rear propeller for horizontal flight, and the ducted fans are covered by sliding panels.

Stressing a “very operational and engineering-focused background”, Robinson said the company was wary of the challenges and strict manufacturing tolerances involved with tilt rotors, tilt wing mechanisms and open rotors.

“We wanted the simplest possible way to transition from hover to forward flight,” he said. The approach avoids significant aerodynamics challenges from variable pitch articulating mechanisms, he added, with a half-scale prototype already demonstrating successful transitions between hovering and horizontal flight.

The X7’s performance advantages could draw attention in the next eVTOL hype cycle – but it remains to be seen if they will be significant enough for customers to overlook ongoing fossil fuel consumption.",,N,,2025-08-26 09:56:56.812750

This initiative aims to integrate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into its procurement practices, thereby promoting cleaner transportation solutions.

The MoU outlines a systematic collaboration framework targeting low-carbon solutions.

Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment at SHEIN, believes this partnership highlights sustainable choices in logistics: ""Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide SHEIN with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.""

SHEIN's goal through this venture is to progressively expand the use of SAF, aiming to significantly alleviate the carbon footprint inherent in its delivery processes.

Integrating SAF in supply chains

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) represents a crucial step forward in supply chain management.

Derived from renewable feedstocks, SAF offers a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, delivering reduced lifecycle carbon emissions.

In this collaborative effort, Lufthansa Cargo will supply SHEIN with SAF, supporting this commitment with 'Proof of Sustainability' certificates established on verified standards. These will quantify the emissions saved through the switch from fossil-based fuels to SAF, embodying a tangible step in sustainable procurement strategies.

Lufthansa's expertise in sourcing and deploying SAF is integral to this partnership. The exchange of knowledge and practices between Lufthansa and SHEIN will help optimise the logistics behind greener freight operations.

This agreement treats SAF not just as a standalone solution but as a part of a broader environmental initiative within logistics procurement.

Data transparency and sustainability

Transparency in data is pivotal for evaluating and fostering sustainability across procurement functions.

Lufthansa Cargo’s CEO, Ashwin Bhat remarked on the significance of the deal: “Signing this memorandum with SHEIN represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence.”

By focusing on shared approaches to traceability, the pair aim to develop systems that foster accountability, optimise fleet efficiency and enhance overall supply chain resilience.

The agreement extends beyond SAF usage to include cooperation on environmental reporting and data sharing. Both companies are delving into traceability partnerships, examining ways in which data can be utilised to track and improve emissions as well as the broader ecological footprint.

Commitment to sustainable logistics

While SHEIN and Lufthansa Cargo's agreement does not enforce mandatory emissions targets, the partnership signals a joint commitment to trialling innovative solutions within logistics procurement.

By leveraging this experience, they aim to implement lessons across their broader logistics operations.

Ethan adds: ""While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonisation strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency and exploring other low-carbon solutions.”

SHEIN relies extensively on air freight for swift delivery from manufacturers to consumers, making this partnership critical for reducing their transportation carbon emissions.

LanzaTech Global's stock experienced a significant shift in momentum on August 25th, 2025, with a KDJ Death Cross and a Bearish Marubozu at 14:45. This technical indicator suggests a potential downtrend, with sellers gaining control of the market. The bearish momentum is expected to continue, indicating a decrease in the stock's value.

The company's Q2 2025 earnings report, released on August 19, 2025, provides insights into its financial health. LanzaTech's revenue fell 48% to $9.1 million, driven by the absence of sublicensing income and project completions. However, the CarbonSmart segment saw a rise to $3.8 million, signaling progress in scaling its carbon accounting software [1].

The company's strategic restructuring includes workforce cuts and a shift to licensing, supported by a £6.4 million UK grant for sustainable aviation fuel projects. Despite a $40 million equity raise, cash reserves remain low at $39.6 million, with $128.3 million in liabilities, raising liquidity concerns [1].

Long-term success hinges on scaling carbon tech partnerships and cost control amid high execution risks and regulatory uncertainties. The UK's Project Dragon, funded by a £6.4 million grant, aims to leverage LanzaTech's ethanol-to-jet technology in the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market [1].

Analysts project $57.8 million revenue for 2025 but warn of a high-risk profile due to operational inefficiencies and competitive pressures in the SAF market [2]. The company's ability to monetize its technology and secure partnerships will be critical for its long-term viability.

For investors, the key question is whether LanzaTech can sustain its pivot to commercial execution without further dilution or strategic overreach. The company's strategic direction is sound, but the path to profitability remains uncertain.

Looking ahead, China will develop more system-friendly power stations to improve forecasting accuracy for wind and solar generation. The country also aims to improve the grid's flexibility by integrating wind, solar, hydro, and thermal power under unified operational control.

Du said China will strengthen the coordinated development of the main grid, distribution networks, and microgrids to boost overall grid capacity and accommodate large-scale renewable integration.

China also plans to build cross-provincial transmission corridors and launch flexible mutual aid projects between provinces to ensure more efficient energy distribution, he added.

""While continuously improving the power system’s ability to absorb new energy, we will also actively explore non-electric utilization pathways,"" Du said. These include promoting large-scale applications of green hydrogen produced from wind and solar energy.

Du concluded that this green hydrogen will support downstream uses such as green metallurgy, ammonia synthesis, methanol production, and sustainable aviation fuel.

About Universal Fuel Technologies","LOS ALTOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As the global aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions while demand for air travel continues to grow, Universal Fuel Technologies’ (Unifuel) Ethanol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced via the company’s Flexiforming technology has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse, which supports the technical evaluation of new aviation fuels, for qualification. This acceptance positions Unifuel among an exclusive group of companies advancing toward ASTM qualification, the essential gateway for new fuels to enter commercial aviation markets.

""The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse is an important validation of our Flexiforming technology and significantly derisks our road to approval for commercial use,"" said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. ""This advancement indicates that our SAF can meet the toughest performance standards without sacrificing scalability or quality, and has technical credibility in the eyes of industry experts.""

The ASTM D4054 evaluation process is the aviation industry’s framework for ensuring that new fuels can safely power aircraft engines. It includes multiple tiers of testing, data collection, and technical review by experts from leading aerospace companies. Acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse requires demonstrating, by independent testing, that a fuel is not only technically credible and can be produced at a meaningful scale, but also that it has met strict quality and safety criteria.

""We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,"" said Dr. Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director. ""This marks a significant milestone for Universal Fuel Technologies towards their goal of commercial acceptance.”

The acceptance follows a successful five-month pilot project where the company produced nearly 100 liters of sample material for four different SAF pathways under stable process conditions. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol, and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), into SAF. The samples then underwent comprehensive testing by Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, the world-leading authority on SAF research.

""The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse confirms that Flexiforming can produce high-quality synthetic aviation turbine fuel with a clear route to ASTM qualification,"" said Denis Pchelintsev, Co-Founder of Universal Fuel Technologies. ""We're positioned to support the aviation industry's urgent need for cost-effective synthetic aviation turbine fuel that doesn't compromise on performance or safety.""

Following Unifuel’s D4054 Clearinghouse acceptance, the company will proceed with producing larger fuel samples for detailed Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing required for ASTM qualification. The initial qualification could come as soon as the end of 2026 as a blend component with fossil jet. From there, further testing is planned, with the goal of leading to a 100% drop-in fully synthetic jet fuel in the future.

Unifuel's advancement through the qualification process is supported by Flexiforming's unique capabilities, which upgrade various renewable feedstocks—including ethanol, methanol, renewable naphthas, and liquefied petroleum gas—into high-quality SAF. In ethanol-to-jet applications, Flexiforming uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other processes, cutting production costs by up to 50%. The technology is also valuable as a complementary process, upgrading low-value naphtha byproduct from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, creating new revenue opportunities for renewable fuel producers.

This accomplishment is rare, especially in China, where manufacturing is a central component of the economy. As of now, only approximately 6,000 factories in the country have received this distinction, with a mere 1,300 awarded in 2025.

This not only highlights Avery Dennison's commitment to sustainability but also sets a precedent for procurement practices in reducing environmental impact within the industry.

Enhancements in sustainable operations

The “green factory” accreditation attests to Avery Dennison’s progressive improvements in its operational processes.

Observers may first notice advanced automated logistics and precise coating and die-cutting lines, but the true essence of this recognition lies in foundational enhancements such as energy efficiency and closed-loop systems for wastewater and emissions management.

Moreover, the company has implemented systematic strategies for material reuse, serving as “proof that sustainability and industrial performance can go hand in hand,” according to Mike Colarossi, Head of Enterprise Sustainability at Avery Dennison.

Such advancements represent a model for procurement leaders aiming to integrate sustainability alongside performance.

Sustainability targets and procurement implications

The Guangzhou feat is a part of Avery Dennison's broader pursuit of sustainability objectives, aligning with seven of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

These ambitious targets include ensuring all core product categories meet the ‘Sustainable ADvantage standard’, with Avery Dennison’s Solutions Group and Materials Group already significantly compliant by 2024.

The goals also stress a 70% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 levels and a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions against 2018 levels.

Concretely, the company has already decreased Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 54%, with long-term plans for net-zero emissions by 2050.

For procurement professionals, this highlights the importance of sustainable supply chain management and emission reduction strategies as integral procurement parameters.

At the heart of this transformation lies a technology poised to redefine propulsion: hydrogen-electric fuel cells. With the aircraft fuel cell market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.07% from 2025 to 2030 (reaching $3.3 billion by 2030), the sector is attracting strategic capital from investors seeking to capitalize on decarbonization. While the headline CAGR may fall short of the oft-cited 28.4% figure, the underlying drivers—hydrogen innovation, regulatory tailwinds, and eVTOL demand—suggest a far more dynamic opportunity, particularly in the fastest-growing subsegments.

The Triple Catalyst: Innovation, Regulation, and Urban Mobility

The propulsion fuel cell market is being propelled by three interlocking forces:

Hydrogen-Electric Innovation:

Hydrogen fuel cells offer a gravimetric energy density of ~1,500 Wh/kg, far outpacing lithium-ion batteries (300–400 Wh/kg). This makes them ideal for eVTOLs and regional aircraft, where range and payload capacity are critical. Breakthroughs in low-temperature proton exchange membrane (LTPEM) and high-temperature PEM (HTPEM) technologies are reducing costs and improving efficiency. For instance, ZeroAvia's ZA600 propulsion system, now in FAA certification, promises 40% lower operating costs than turbine engines.

Regulatory Tailwinds:

The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates 2% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, scaling to 63% by 2050. While SAF is a near-term solution, hydrogen-electric systems are the long-term answer. The FAA and EASA are fast-tracking certification pathways, with EASA's 2030 target for electric VTOL certification and the FAA's 2024 Hydrogen-Fueled Aircraft Safety Roadmap. These frameworks reduce uncertainty for investors, enabling firms to scale R&D with confidence.

eVTOL and Urban Mobility Demand:

The eVTOL market is forecasted to grow at 54.9% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, with hydrogen-electric propulsion expected to dominate the fastest-growing segment (66% CAGR). Urban air mobility (UAM) and cargo eVTOLs require zero-emission, long-range solutions—hydrogen's refueling speed and energy density make it the clear winner. Companies like Airbus and H2MOF are pioneering hydrogen storage systems that could enable 24–36 hour endurance for drones and helicopters.

Strategic Capital Allocation: Prioritizing R&D-Backed Firms

Investors should focus on firms with robust R&D pipelines and partnerships with aerospace giants. Three stand out:

ZeroAvia (ZAVIY):

The UK-based firm has secured provisional type certification for its 600 kW hydrogen-electric engine and is in conditional talks with major airlines. Its ZA2000 project for larger aircraft, using liquid hydrogen, positions it as a leader in scaling propulsion systems.

Airbus (AIR.PA):

The aerospace giant is leveraging its scale to integrate hydrogen into its A320neo and A350 XWB variants. Its NEWBORN project (a €44.8M EU initiative) aims to develop scalable fuel cell systems for regional and long-haul aircraft. Airbus's 2030 target to launch a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft underscores its commitment.

Plug Power (PLUG):

While best known for industrial hydrogen solutions, Plug's collaboration with eVTOL startups and its modular fuel cell stacks position it to supply propulsion systems for urban mobility. Its recent partnership with Gloyer-Taylor Laboratories to develop lightweight LH2 tanks could be a game-changer.

The Investment Case: Balancing Risk and Reward

The propulsion fuel cell market is still nascent, with challenges including hydrogen infrastructure gaps and supply chain bottlenecks. However, the alignment of regulatory, technological, and market forces creates a compelling risk-reward profile. For instance, H2MOF's metal-organic framework (MOF) storage technology could reduce hydrogen delivery costs by 50–80%, addressing a key barrier to adoption.

Investors should adopt a phased approach:

- Short-term (2025–2027): Allocate capital to firms with FAA/EASA certification milestones (e.g., ZeroAvia).

- Mid-term (2028–2030): Target companies scaling hydrogen storage and infrastructure (e.g., Plug Power).

- Long-term (2030+): Position in firms developing hybrid systems and long-haul hydrogen aircraft (e.g., Airbus).

Conclusion: A Net-Zero Imperative

The transition to hydrogen-electric propulsion is not just an environmental imperative—it's a $40.7 billion market by 2030. For investors, the key is to back firms that combine technical innovation with regulatory agility. ZeroAvia, Airbus, and Plug Power exemplify this, but the sector's breadth also includes niche players like H2MOF and PowerCell Group (which is developing 300 kW ITPEM stacks).

As the FAA and EASA finalize certification standards, the next 12–18 months will be pivotal. Those who act now—allocating capital to R&D-backed innovators—will be well-positioned to ride the hydrogen-electric wave shaping the future of flight.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-26 05:56:08.925139

This article focuses on some of the key points to note in respect of hydrogen developments from the following publications:

Hydrogen update to the market: July 2025

Consultation for Hydrogen blending into the GB gas transmission network

1. Hydrogen Update to the Market: July 2025

On 23rd July 2025, DESNZ published its Hydrogen Update to the Market policy document (the “Update”) which summarises key policy progress in the first six months of 2025 to deliver the low carbon hydrogen economy and also looks forward to upcoming hydrogen policy milestones and opportunities for the sector. This follows previous updates to the market (as separately detailed at: Hy time for hydrogen - key takeaways from the UK's hydrogen strategy; Hydrogen transport and storage: Update on proposed business models and UK Hydrogen Strategy : UK hydrogen sector updates: hydrogen production - kicking off the next allocation round) and sets out the Government’s latest position. As part of this, the government intends to publish an updated UK Hydrogen Strategy in Autumn 2025 setting out its vision, objectives and approach to delivering hydrogen projects over the next decade.

Hydrogen Production

Hydrogen Production Business Model

The Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (‘HAR’) are the main mechanism for supporting low-carbon hydrogen production, with HAR1 completed, HAR2 shortlist announced (comprising 27 projects), and HAR3 and HAR4 planned for 2026 and 2028, respectively. Details of the shortlisted HAR2 projects are available here.

The Government is removing Climate Change Levy costs from electricity used in electrolysis to lower production costs for low carbon hydrogen. Consultation responses on the appropriate legislative approach to take in respect of the removal are being considered by the Government and a Government response will be provided in due course.

The Government is also due to respond later this year on its views for having the Gas Shipper Obligation (“GSO”) as the long-term funding mechanism for initial hydrogen production projects funded through the HPBM. This was subject to earlier consultation the details of which can be found here.

Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (“LCHS”)

The Hydrogen Production Business Model incentivises investment in low-carbon hydrogen, with projects required to meet the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (i.e a GHG emissions intensity of 20g CO2e/MJLHV of produced hydrogen or less) and subject to strict methodology for calculating these emissions.

Updates to the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard are expected in 2025 and the Government is exploring updates to the low carbon certification scheme as well as the LCHA in 2025. Future versions may consider updates in respect of transport and storage emissions, international alignment and the introduction of production pathways.

In summary, DESNZ’s key future milestones in respect of hydrogen production and the HAR process are as follows:

publish the next version of the LCHS this year;

provide an update on the low carbon hydrogen certification scheme this year.

seek feedback on the proposed design and delivery of HAR3 through a market engagement exercise, with the aim of publishing later this year;

publish a review of the Hydrogen Allocation Rounds beyond HAR4 later this year;

complete HAR2 in early 2026;

launch HAR3 in 2026;

launch HAR4 in 2028;

Hydrogen Transport and Storage Networks:

Hydrogen Transport and Storage Business Models

The Government is also developing business models for hydrogen transport and storage, based on a Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model, alongside a government subsidy mechanism. It is aiming to launch the first allocation rounds in 2026. With respect to hydrogen storage, DESNZ’s minded to business model remains as a revenue cap and floor mechanism to be awarded via a subsidy competition. Strategic planning for hydrogen infrastructure is being integrated with the wider energy system, with the National Energy System Operator taking a leading role from 2026.

Further, the Government is assessing hydrogen’s role in heating and consulting on its potential contribution to heat decarbonisation, and ongoing consultations are evaluating the feasibility and benefits of blending hydrogen into existing gas networks.

The Update reiterated Government’s commitment of over £500 million, as set out in the Spending Review 2025, for the development of the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, where it expects the first network will be operational from 2031.

Uses of Hydrogen

Hydrogen to Power Business Model

Hydrogen is positioned as a key technology for low-carbon, dispatchable power generation and long-duration energy storage, with a new Hydrogen to Power Business Model launching in 2026. The Dispatchable Power Agreement mechanism that was used on CCUS projects has been confirmed as the chosen business model for this. Later this year, the Government is launching a market engagement exercise which will provide additional information on the business model. This will include the Government’s minded to positions on the eligibility and assessment criteria and suggested next steps for distributing support via the business model.

Hydrogen in Transport

In terms of transport, hydrogen is expected to play a complementary role to electrification, especially in heavy goods vehicles, maritime, aviation, and off-road machinery. Several demonstration projects and regulatory changes are underway to support hydrogen adoption in these sectors.

Off-road machinery: A statutory instrument allowing hydrogen powered off-road machinery and agricultural vehicles on the road came into force on 29 April 2025. Government is expected to publish an off-road machinery decarbonisation strategy following the Non-road mobile machinery: decarbonisation options call for evidence, however the timeframe for delivery of the strategy is unclear.

Maritime: The Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy, which amongst other things, sets out a commitment to regulate greenhouse gas emission intensity of maritime fuels and energy sources, was published in April 2025. Additionally, the government expects to introduce domestic fuel regulations in respect of zero and near-zero greenhouse gas emission fuels, further to a consultation in 2026.

Aviation: The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Mandate – the key policy encouraging the supply of sustainable aviation fuels to decarbonise aviation fuel - was launched in January 2025. Provided it meets eligibility criteria, hydrogen is eligible for support under the Mandate. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which introduces the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Revenue Certainty Mechanism, is expected to become law by the end of 2026. The third competition window for the Advanced Fuels Fund closed at the end of March this year, with the winners announced on 22nd July 2025. The competition winners can be viewed here.

Regulatory Framework

To be able to support the first small-scale hydrogen pipeline projects and to be flexible enough to support the hydrogen economy as it matures, a consultation on the proposed economic framework for 100% hydrogen pipelines has been launched. Please see here for further commentary on this.

2. Consultation on Hydrogen Blending into the GB Gas Transmission Network

Hydrogen Blending and the Purpose of the Consultation

The Government is again consulting on hydrogen blending (i.e blending low carbon hydrogen with other gases into the existing gas network). The aim is to assess the case for hydrogen blending including the required commercial, market, technical, safety, and billing arrangements required to accommodate such blending. Please see here for the consultation.

A previous consultation in 2023 assessed the strategic and economic value of blending up to 20% hydrogen by volume into the existing GB gas distribution networks, as well as avenues for implementing blending (the “2023 Consultation”). Following this consultation, previous government published their strategic policy decision in support of blending up to 20% hydrogen by volume into the GB gas distribution networks in specific circumstances.

The Consultation also seeks to understand the impact on existing end users directly connected to the transmission network and developments across Europe in respect of the EU Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package. It is expected that, if a positive future decision enabling transmission-level hydrogen blending is made, the earliest that blending at a commercial scale could be made would not be until 2028.

To support the Consultation, safety and feasibility tests and demonstrations of different levels of blending (up to 5%, 10%, and 20%) within the GB gas transmission network have been carried out by National Gas Transmission (NGT). DESNZ’s minded to position is to further consider whether blending of up to 2% hydrogen by volume should be supported and enabled.

Strategic role of hydrogen blending

At distribution level, blending could function as an offtaker of last resort/minority offtaker and could mitigate both the risks of hydrogen producers not being able to sell sufficient volumes of hydrogen and cross-chain volume risks in respect of hydrogen transport and storage (T&S) infrastructure development. Where large-scale hydrogen T&S infrastructure is not available, blending could assist electrolytic hydrogen producers, particularly those producers located behind electricity network constraints, with supporting the wider electricity system and allowing blending to play a role as strategic enabler.

For Carbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS)-enabled and other non-electrolytic hydrogen projects, their strategic value could lie in producing hydrogen at scale, such as industrial clusters. DESNZ’s position is that CCUS-enabled and other non-electrolytic who intend to use blending as a majority offtaker from the outset will not be able to benefit from hydrogen production revenue support.

At transmission level, the strategic roles for blending could be similar to those identified at distribution level, for example, offtaker of last resort and strategic enabler, as noted above.

EU Interactions

The impact of transmission-level hydrogen blending on cross-border trade with the EU via interconnectors requires separate consideration. The EU Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package (comprising Directive (EU) 2024/1788 and Regulation (EU) 2024/1789)(the “Package”), which does not apply to the UK, was adopted in May 2024. The Regulation became applicable on 5 February 2025 and Member States are required to transpose the provisions of the Directive into national legislation by 5 August 2026. Whilst the Package sets the basis for enabling harmonisation of hydrogen blending across Member States to enable up to 2% hydrogen blends across EU gas transmission networks, it does not specifically require individual Member States to blend hydrogen into their own transmission networks. Government is undertaking engagement exercises with neighbouring Member States to better understand the impact of the Package in respect of hydrogen blending and risks concerning security of supply.

Hydrogen Deblending

Deblending hydrogen could assist NTS end users who are unable to, or are likely to have significant safety and technical issues, receive variable hydrogen blends. A limitation to hydrogen deblending is that it is considered to be a relatively unproven technology at large scale, particularly within distribution and transmission networks.

The Consultation sets out two possible future scenarios:

Deblending at UK gas interconnector entry points – government does not currently view this as a feasible option due to costs and technical challenges of large scale blending, however further engagement with neighbouring EU Member States and the Commission is to be expected.

Deblending at local end user level – further work is required to be undertaken by NGT to understand the feasibility of isolating blending gas within the NTS to protect sensitive end users, and what measures, if any, could assist with managing blend variability to manage those impacts to end users.

Implementation options

Government’s position is that transmission blending, if enabled, should be implemented using existing gas market arrangements where appropriate, including for example, gas billing arrangements.

Considerations in respect of the HPBM

Government envisages that, if enabled and if supported by government, the most appropriate mechanism for transmission blending would be through the HPBM. Blending is currently considered a ‘Non-Qualifying Offtaker’ under the LCHA. Designing and integrating subsidy support for both distribution and transmission blending within the HPBM, would require to be reflected in the LCHA. Further consideration will need to be given to those HAR1 projects that have already entered into a LCHA. Sales of hydrogen to RTIs is not currently permitted under the LCHA, government will need to consider how commercial arrangements for blending will work for example, the use of gas shippers (who would at present be considered an RTI) for purchasing hydrogen for blending. If blending is enabled by government, consideration will be made in respect of eligible offtaker’s for future HARs and CCUS allocation rounds of the HPBM.

Market and trading arrangements

DESNZ’s minded to position in respect of market and trading arrangements for transmission-led blending is analogous to the network-led hybrid approach that the 2023 Consultation considered. This would allow both the gas transmission system operator and gas shippers to purchase low carbon hydrogen and shippers can sell hydrogen produced for blending.

Low carbon hydrogen certificates

In respect of low carbon hydrogen certificates for transmission blending, government have confirmed that further to the 2023 Low Carbon Hydrogen Certification Scheme Government Response, they require further consideration of how certificates could work for blending.

Implications, next steps and conclusions

The Update sets out a clearer roadmap of the key milestones DESNZ are working towards and for DESNZ’s ongoing commitments to advancing the UK hydrogen industry. The forthcoming UK Hydrogen Strategy in Autumn will be welcomed by industry and is expected to provide even greater clarity and direction, reinforcing the UK’s position as a leader in the global hydrogen market.",https://cms-lawnow.com/var/dpcontent/storage/images/1/5/1/5/22295151-1-eng-GB/8789dad98b10-Hydrogen-renewable-energy-production-hydrogen-gas-for-clean-electricity-solar-and-windturbine-facility.-3d-rendering.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 05:56:12.833376

The aim is to provide real-time visibility into ground operations and improve aircraft turnaround times.

Formed in 2015, i6 has built a digital platform that connects all parts of the fuel management cycle, allowing airlines to digitally track fuel inventory, manage contracts with fuel suppliers, enable communication between pilots and fueling teams, calculate optimal fuel amounts, and collect and analyze data about fueling operations.

“Fuel is a large proportion of every airline’s bottom line—something in the region of 35%—so everybody’s keen to know how much they’ve got and where it is,” i6 CEO Alex Mattos says. “What we’re trying to do is connect the refinery to the wingtip, all the way through the chain, to make sure everybody knows where it all is.”

Mattos says one of the key benefits of i6’s software is enabling paperless fueling operations, which provides real-time visibility that can help airlines make decisions about fuel supply, catch errors and connect systems to allow better agility. “Airlines can make decisions on their fueling later because we connect digitally from an airline’s systems to the fueling systems, so we can see, ‘I’ve made a change.

The weather’s bad, or there’s more cargo, or this is a holiday plane so everyone’s got all their luggage,’ and we can change our fuel loads much quicker,” he says.

Carriers such as British Airways, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic are already using i6 software to manage fueling operations digitally, and Mattos says the technology has helped to improve turnaround times, minimize fuel costs, reduce paperwork errors and provide greater visibility.

Mattos says i6 is now examining how its technology could be further applied to provide efficiencies in maintenance, too. “Fuel is part of maintenance records,” he says. For instance, he points out that airlines use fueling in ground testing, and fuel records and aircraft technical records interact when pilots determine how much fuel they want for a flight.

I6’s software already integrates with electronic flight bags to exchange data about flight schedules and fuel loads, and Mattos says carriers such as Virgin are now working with the company to integrate their engineering technical logs with the software so maintenance staff can pull up digital records about fuel, such as provider, amount, type, density, temperature and more.

He adds that the software’s digital footprint may also prove appealing as more airlines convert to sustainable aviation fuel, since it can track quality control, blending ratios and other crucial fueling factors.

I6 is also expanding its airline customers and its partnerships to more locations. Mattos says i6 is currently conducting a network trial with Aer Lingus and, as Delta’s international digital fueling partner, the company hopes to grow its work with the airline to additional locations such as the Caribbean.

Used cooking oil collected from eateries at Changi Airport is powering some heavy vehicles, such as those used to remove debris from runways, as part of a renewable diesel trial, Changi Airport Group (CAG) said on Aug 19.

The seven vehicles have performed well since the trial at the airport started in May, said CAG.

The six-month trial is part of a push by the airport operator to find cleaner alternatives for its existing fleet of 60 vehicles deployed airside, where loading and unloading of aircraft, as well as take-offs and landings, take place.

The renewable diesel is being used to fuel heavy vehicles and specialised equipment that do not yet have viable electric variants.

CAG said electric variants are more readily available for light vehicles, such as forklifts and tractors.

Most heavy vehicles used in the aviation industry are still diesel-powered, such as airport runway sweepers.

These specialised vehicles are used to remove debris, including foreign objects, from runways and taxiways, and are crucial for maintaining runway safety.

Another example is runway rubber removal vehicles, which remove rubber deposits left by aircraft tyres, which can affect braking and safety.

The used cooking oil collected from Changi Airport eateries contributes to the feedstock – or raw material – to produce the renewable diesel used in the trial, CAG said.

The feedstock is converted into high-quality renewable diesel fuel that has a similar chemical composition to fossil diesel, it said.

This is done at a refinery in Tuas run by Neste Singapore, a renewable energy company.

Renewable diesel can be adopted as an easy replacement for fossil diesel as it can be used in existing diesel engines without modification.

Minimal adjustments are required for renewable diesel to use existing transportation, storage and distribution infrastructure.

The six-month trial will use approximately 14,000 litres of renewable diesel, said Mr Steven Bartholomeusz, Neste’s Asia-Pacific head of public and regulatory affairs.

CAG began its trial in May with a 50 per cent renewable diesel blend. This was upped to 100 per cent in August.

At 100 per cent renewable diesel, up to 90 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions will be produced over the fuel’s life cycle, when compared with fossil diesel, CAG said.

Renewable diesel can also be blended with fossil diesel in any proportion, helping companies to match the use of clean energy to their decarbonisation goals.

Mr Gerald Ng, CAG’s vice-president for regulatory affairs and sustainability, said the vehicles in the trial have performed well on the 50 per cent renewable diesel blend, and “without any impact to vehicle operations and efficiency”.

Renewable diesel trials have taken place at Changi Airport since 2024, when the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced a year-long trial of the fuel, also for heavy and specialised airside vehicles.

These trials are the result of the sustainable air hub blueprint launched in 2024, which aims to help reduce domestic aviation emissions by 20 per cent (from 2019 levels) by 2030 and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

Other initiatives from the blueprint include a passenger levy on flights departing from Singapore from 2026 to fund the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as well as increased deployment of solar panels at the airport.",https://www.britcham.org.sg/sites/default/files/2025-08/f92c1588acd29bcd3ed9e4f207590ba36430d104670b5e1681597f3f37b897a8.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 09:57:36.478506

This event is notable as it represents the first time Airbus in Canada has directly provided official sustainability documentation for SAF to a customer, setting a new precedent in Airbus’ operations.

The flight underscores Airbus’ ability to issue Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) directly to operators and supports the aviation industry’s broader commitment to decarbonisation. With a 50% SAF blend certified through the mass balance method, this ferry flight—operated by Air France’s 46th A220-300, named “VAISON-LA-ROMAINE”—resulted in a reduction of over 25 tonnes of lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of aviation decarbonisation. Combining both is a natural step, and Air France-KLM is proud to take part in this Airbus milestone with the delivery of one of our A220s. As one of the largest SAF purchasers globally, receiving SAF directly at delivery increases transparency and supports industry advancement,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM.

Since the announcement of SAF availability at Airbus’ Mirabel site—allowing its use in A220 production, test flights, and customer acceptance flights—Airbus has reinforced its commitment to incorporating SAF not only in internal operations but also in customer ferry flights across its global network of final assembly lines and delivery centers.

“In 2025 alone, we anticipate a reduction of around 400 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions at our Mirabel facility, thanks to the integration of 170,000 litres of neat SAF,” said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada. “This ferry flight, using PoS credits for 50% SAF, is a major milestone ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year. Globally, 78% of Airbus aircraft delivered in the first half of 2025 included SAF, reflecting our customers’ strong commitment to decarbonisation.”

All Airbus aircraft, including the A220, are currently certified to fly with up to 50% SAF, with a target of achieving 100% SAF compatibility by 2030. According to PoS issued under the CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme, approved by ICAO, the SAF supplied at Mirabel offers an 85% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to fossil-based jet fuel—a crucial development in achieving net-zero emissions in aviation by 2050.

The SAF used in Mirabel is managed through the mass balance approach, a chain-of-custody model that tracks the volume of certified material entering and exiting the system, minus any processing losses. The SAF is blended with Jet A-1 fuel following industry standards and is fully auditable.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030. According to the PoS under CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme approved by ICAO, the SAF received at Airbus in Mirabel is certified for 85% reduction in GHG emissions on its lifecycle compared to fossil fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the aerospace industry’s progress towards decarbonization by 2050.

SAF management in Mirabel is done using mass balance, a chain of custody model in which a company accounts for volumes of certified products by looking at the volumes entering the operation and the equivalent volume of products leaving the operations as a measurement, minus any processing losses. As such, the SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel (Jet A-1) as per established industry standards and auditable bookkeeping.

Air France’s first A220-300s, part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft, have been flying on its medium-haul network since October 2021.

About sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

SAF is a blended drop in fuel, certified against aviation fuel technical standards. It is a blend of a synthetic component made from renewable feedstocks and conventional fossil fuel. This blend, up to 50%, has the same characteristics as aviation fuels and are certified as such (e.g. Jet A/A1 (ASTM), Number 3 Jet Fuel (China), TS1 (Russia)).

As it is a drop in fuel, it does not require any change to the engines nor to the aircraft and its uptake and combustion has no impact on the safety of operations nor on maintenance tasks.

To be certified as ""sustainable"", the synthetic blend component must comply with sustainability standards, including minimum Green House Gas (GHG) savings. Hence, the GHG savings on a Life Cycle Assessment basis is only accounted for the synthetic blend component - and not for the conventional fossil fuel. Sustainability criteria is defined by regulations like ICAO CORSIA, EU RED, and UK SAF Mandate. To know more about Airbus’ efforts to support SAF adoption, visit our SAF page.

Industry case studies highlight innovation, policy, and partnerships for decarbonizing India’s hard-to-abate sectors

The session convened policymakers, industry leaders, technocrats, green technology innovators, academicians, think tanks, investors, and solution providers to deliberate on practical strategies for accelerating low-carbon pathways across India’s most emission-intensive sectors. Curated under the aegis of TERI’s Industry Charter for Near Zero Emission Ambition by 2050, the roundtable showcased a selection of industry case studies and innovative solutions, underscoring the importance of collaborative action and knowledge-sharing in enabling climate-resilient growth.

Opening the session, Mr Arupendra Nath Mullick, Associate Director, TERI-Council for Business Sustainability, highlighted, “The heavy industries shall be providing the materials to support a modern economy. Together with champions of the Indian industry, we acknowledge that businesses play a vital role by understanding the opportunities of low-carbon economy and challenges on one hand, and by mobilizing resources and offering know-how and solutions, on the other.”

The discussion was moderated by Mr RR Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, who emphasized a phased yet ambitious approach to transition. “India is responding to both global impulses and its domestic commitments under the NDC. While immediate actions are important, achieving net zero will require a comprehensive sectoral framework. Both supply- and demand-side measures, across energy efficiency, industrial transitions, technology and finance, and demand management, will be central to this journey. While India has already released its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) covering key sectors, the detailed sectoral roadmaps are still under preparation. These will be vital in guiding how we achieve our long-term climate objectives,” Mr Rashmi averred.

The panel featured perspectives from industry implementers and solution innovators, sharing on-the-ground experiences and breakthrough practices.

Mr Sanjay Kumar Singh, Director- Strategy & External Relations, Jindal Steel Ltd., reflected on the complexities of greening India’s steel sector, particularly given the mix of large integrated producers and medium-sized secondary steel producers. Mr Singh stated, “Most major steel producers have set decarbonization targets between 2047 and 2050. But greening the sector does not automatically mean zero emissions. For instance, blast furnaces will continue to rely on coke, which emits carbon dioxide. The real challenge lies in how much of these emissions can be captured. Moreover, nearly 40% of India’s steel is produced by small and medium enterprises, who face greater hurdles in adopting new technologies. Transition costs, technology access, and skill development remain pressing issues. While large players are beginning to adopt new processes, the broader question is: how do we ensure the entire steel sector becomes truly green, and who bears the responsibility for that transition?”

Mr Sangeet Jain, Board member and VP ESG strategy & Alliances, LanzaTech Pvt Ltd., highlighted the circular solutions for hard-to-abate sectors through carbon recycling technologies. “With the power of biology, we are now able to recycle carbon in new and impactful ways. Our technology converts waste gases from industries like steel and ferroalloys into ethanol and other chemicals and has already been deployed at multiple commercial scales worldwide. In India, projects such as our collaboration in Panipat demonstrate the potential of these solutions, including pathways to produce sustainable aviation fuel. These ‘carbon-smart’ chemicals are already being used in products like polyester, showing how recycled carbon can create tangible consumer goods. The challenge before us is to scale and deploy more such units, enabling low-carbon fuels and chemicals to become mainstream in India’s industrial ecosystem,” added Mr Jain.

Mr Yogesh Patgunan, Circular Economy Strategist, Sperry Green Technology Pvt Ltd noted, “Hard-to-abate plastics like PP, ABS, and HIPS are critical to industries but pose serious sustainability challenges. Through our Circular Production Program, we are demonstrating how waste audits, reverse logistics, advanced recycling, and digital traceability can turn these complex waste streams into high-quality, traceable, and profitable circular solutions for businesses.”

The session reaffirmed that decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors is not merely a technological challenge but a collective endeavour–requiring policy vision, financial innovation, and strong industry commitment. As Knowledge Partner, TERI reiterated that platforms such as the Industry Charter for Near Zero Emission Ambition by 2050 will continue to act as catalysts for collaboration–bringing together stakeholders to pilot solutions, share knowledge, and scale transformative action. By fostering partnerships across sectors and borders, TERI remains committed to advancing India’s climate and development goals while contributing to the global net-zero transition.",https://www.teriin.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/Photo%201.png,N,,2025-08-26 03:56:30.132938

The initiative was launched with the maiden flight of Pelita Air on the Jakarta–Bali route, demonstrating the potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to transform the aviation industry.

The programme is being developed by PT Pertamina (Persero) through its RU IV Cilacap Refinery. The SAF product is designed to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and to support Indonesia’s commitment to reducing emissions.

According to Pertamina, SAF derived from UCO can cut carbon emissions by up to 84% compared to conventional jet fuel, without compromising safety or performance.

Secretary General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), Dadan Kusdiana, who represented the Minister of ESDM during the launch, explained that the initiative is aligned with President Prabowo Subianto’s policy framework.

“This is the President’s programme, Asta Cita, which we must continue to implement. Energy security, and in this case, it’s not just about energy security but also self-sufficiency. So, self-reliance is also becoming stronger,” Dadan said in a written statement on Friday, 22 August 2025.

The government sees SAF as both a practical and strategic solution. Beyond environmental benefits, the use of SAF also represents a step towards greater energy independence, reducing reliance on imported fuels.

Pertamina has emphasised that its SAF innovation opens “concrete opportunities for the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint without compromising safety and performance standards”.

The maiden flight demonstrates Indonesia’s readiness to integrate SAF into commercial aviation and sets the groundwork for broader adoption across the sector.

Pelita Air Recognised for On-Time Performance

The use of SAF comes as Pelita Air, a subsidiary of Pertamina, continues to strengthen its reputation for reliable service. On Thursday, 21 August 2025, the airline received formal recognition from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) at the Ministry of Transportation.

Pelita Air was named the airline with the best On-Time Performance (OTP) throughout 2024.

The award was presented by the Director of Air Transport, Agustinus Budi Hartono, during a coordination meeting in Bogor, West Java. The DGCA noted that the recognition reflects Pelita Air’s ability to comply with regulations while consistently prioritising passenger service.

“This award serves as a reminder to us that every passenger’s time is very valuable,” Agustinus said.

“Punctuality is not just about meeting service indicators, but about respecting the journeys, plans, and important activities that our customers undertake every day.”

Pelita Air management also highlighted the importance of punctuality as part of a wider commitment to passenger satisfaction.

“We believe that meaningful flights are not only measured by departure and arrival punctuality, but also by the comfort and peace of mind passengers experience during their journey,” the airline noted. “Our hope is that every experience with Pelita Air can provide relevant added value for our customers.”

The achievement was described as the result of coordinated teamwork across all levels of the airline. Operational discipline, reliability, and cooperation between departments have been credited with ensuring that flights remain safe, comfortable, and on time.

Fadjar Djoko Santoso, Vice President of Corporate Communication at Pertamina, praised the airline’s success as a reflection of the group’s broader mission.

“As part of Pertamina, Pelita Air proves that consistency, discipline, and professionalism are the keys to gaining public trust,” he said. “This On-Time Performance award is not only a source of pride, but also motivation to continue providing reliable, safe, and punctual air transportation services.”

With its adoption of SAF and its recognition for punctuality, Pelita Air illustrates how innovation and service standards can combine to strengthen both environmental sustainability and passenger confidence in Indonesia’s aviation industry.

“Anything that increases the market for our crops is a very good thing,” Mr Nankivell said.

He is a third generation farmer on 7,500 acres where he grows canola, cotton and wheat with his parents Paul and Rosemary. He believes diversified markets will be the key to seeing the children he shares with wife Nellie, Jack, 1, and Olivia, 2, carrying on the family farm.

“Farms are getting bigger and it is getting harder to compete so something like this would be great for us,” Mr Nankivell said.

Australia is the fourth largest canola producer in the world and exports 70 per cent of the crop, much of which is processed into biofuels. Currently 90 per cent of all liquid fuel in the country is imported.

Sydney Airport chief executive Scott Charlton said Sustainable Aviation Fuel made from canola had the potential to be the next great Made in Australia story.

“New South Wales produces nearly a third of Australia’s canola, we’ve got the feedstock, and we’ve got the bulk of the nation’s aviation industry right here in Sydney. All of the pieces are in place for Sydney and NSW to lead the way,” he said.

“Right now, most of our canola harvest is shipped offshore – and much of it ends up as biofuel overseas. Let’s keep it here, create high-value local jobs, and build the economic benefits at home.”

Mr Charlton said a refinery should be built at Kurnell to supply the airport. “Sydney Airport accounts for almost 40 per cent of Australia’s aviation fuel uplift, so having a SAF refinery next door at Kurnell makes sense in terms of helping meet the industry’s net zero commitments,” he said.

CommBank Agriculture Economist Dennis Voznesenski said NSW accounts for almost a third of Australian canola production and is well placed to be a centre of what could be a promising SAF industry.

“NSW has large local feedstock availability which positions it well to be a supplier of feedstock to an Australian SAF industry,” he said. That in turn would create more jobs.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/32848b9b27421f5dc0f87754c4ddc71f,N,,2025-08-25 20:56:29.170134

Australia imports 90 per cent of its liquid fuels and holds just 17 days of aviation fuel in reserve.
In a world where supply chains are increasingly uncertain, building a domestic SAF industry could make us more resilient and self-reliant.
That’s the vision we’ll be putting forward at this year’s Bush Summit: a future where our skies are powered by the hard work, ingenuity, and resources of regional Australia.","In the years ahead, Australian farms — like the canola fields of regional NSW — could produce the fuel that powers our aircraft, creating jobs, boosting the economy, and keeping more of the value here at home.

That’s the opportunity we have with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Globally, aviation has committed to net zero by 2050, and SAF can help us get there. It has the potential to cut emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel and unlike

other future technologies, can be used in today’s aircraft and pumped through existing fuel infrastructure.

The potential feedstocks are everything from used cooking oil to household rubbish. But the real opportunity for regional NSW lies in canola.

NSW produces almost a third of the national canola crop — and Australia is the fourth-largest producer in the world. More than 70 per cent of that crop is exported, with the vast majority of exports going to Europe, where up to 80 per cent is used to make biofuels like SAF.

Our farmers are already growing the crops that power the world’s biofuel industry — but the jobs and economic benefits are being realised overseas.

We can change that. With the right policy settings, we could establish a SAF refinery at Kurnell, connected directly into Sydney Airport through existing pipelines. This would be a nation-building project: creating new markets for farmers, high-value jobs, and a new home-grown industry.

So how do we do it? The first step is to scale up both demand and supply, which will need industry working with government to establish supportive policies. Managing transport and logistics costs will be critical, so production facilities should be located as close as to the point of consumption as possible. That’s exactly why NSW, as a leading canola producer, alongside Kurnell’s fuel infrastructure and Sydney as Australia’s global aviation hub, makes so much sense as the home of a domestic SAF industry.

The economics are strong. A Qantas report found a domestic SAF industry could contribute $13 billion to GDP, support nearly 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain, and create another 5,000 jobs to build and run the facilities.

It’s also about fuel security. Australia imports 90 per cent of its liquid fuels and holds just 17 days of aviation fuel in reserve. In a world where supply chains are increasingly uncertain, building a domestic SAF industry could make us more resilient and self-reliant.

At Sydney Airport, we’ve already shown it works. Earlier this year, with Qantas, we imported nearly two million litres of SAF — the largest commercial shipment in Australian history — and delivered it to aircraft through existing infrastructure.

What’s needed now is partnership between industry and government. With the right policy support, Australia can build a world-leading SAF industry.

That’s the vision we’ll be putting forward at this year’s Bush Summit: a future where our skies are powered by the hard work, ingenuity, and resources of regional Australia.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ffddead0b36df33daa99980c696d7a1b,N,,2025-08-25 19:56:20.200063

Neste Oyj (OTC: NTOIF) is a Finnish energy company, and it's built a global reputation as a heavy hitter in renewable fuels. The company operates across four key areas: Renewable Products (think renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and feedstock for bioplastics), Oil Products (classic gasoline, diesel, aviation and marine fuels, plus specialty products like bitumen), Marketing & Services (serving everything from retail and commercial transport to municipal heating and EV charging), and an 'Other' bucket offering engineering solutions and licensing for refinery technologies.

Recent Performance

Neste’s shares have slipped 19.48% over the past year, while the S&P 500 climbed 13.63%. That underperformance tells you a lot about recent hurdles: operational snags in renewables, plant stoppages, slimmer margins due to oversupply, and regulatory uncertainty—all while big US tech firms kept the wider market rally ticking along.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Neste’s revenue has grown at about 9% a year over the past eight years, thanks to steady expansion in its renewable operations. Looking ahead, analysts expect just a 1% annual growth rate for the next three years, with net income dipping by about 1% as margin challenges linger. Growth levers still exist: there’s fresh capacity ramping up in Singapore and the US, Porvoo refinery’s shift to renewables, rising appetite for renewable aviation fuel as low-carbon rules tighten, and an ongoing push into renewable chemicals and circular solutions.

Quality & Moat

Returns on equity have been healthy, holding around 17% in 2023, and free cash flow remains robust (2.97 per share operating cash flow in 2023) – all of which covers ongoing investments and a solid dividend. Neste’s position as a leader in renewable diesel tech, plus its global feedstock network, gives it a real competitive edge. The balance sheet is pretty solid too: a current ratio near 2.1× and moderate debt (debt/EBITDA around 6×). That said, with tighter margins, interest coverage has come under a bit of strain.

Valuation

At $17.15, Neste shares trade at a forward P/E of about 19.1×, cheaper than the overall market’s 25.6×. Its enterprise value/sales sits at roughly 1.4×—well below the sector’s average of 4.4×. Add in a punchy 5.3% dividend yield (above most energy peers), and there’s an attractive story here for income hunters.

Market Sentiment

The mood has shifted: RBC now rates Neste a 'Sector Perform', having trimmed its price target due to operational hiccups and uncertainty around sustainable aviation fuel. It’s now one of Europe’s most shorted stocks—plenty of investors are betting on it to fall. Institutional ownership is moderate at about 26.6%, and both retail and long-only funds have pulled back recently amid those margin wobbles.

Key Risks

Regulatory Uncertainty: Changes in US and EU fuel mandates or tax incentives—think RFS and LCFS—could throw off demand or squeeze margins for renewable fuels.

Feedstock Volatility: Prices for feedstock—like vegetable oils and waste fats—swing with crop cycles and trade tariffs, which can eat into margins.

Project Execution: Delays or overruns at major plants (Porvoo, Rotterdam, Singapore) could dent returns and cut into cash flow.

Operational Disruptions: Plant incidents, such as a fire at Rotterdam, have the potential to suddenly pinch volumes and pressure earnings.

Leverage: With debt/EBITDA near 6×, financial risk ramps up if margins don’t recover. Interest coverage has also seen a squeeze.

Market Volatility: Stock beta is around 1.08 and short interest is elevated, meaning the shares can swing harder—especially if sentiment sours.

Bull Case

Leading Renewable Platform: Neste has a strong first-mover advantage and scale in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, typically enjoying better margins than rivals.

Attractive Valuation: Forward P/E and EV/Sales are both at a hefty discount to the industry, plus there’s a high dividend yield to sweeten the deal.

Policy Tailwinds: Tougher low-carbon fuel mandates in North America and Europe look set to drive future growth.

Cash Flow Generation: Strong free cash flow supports the current dividend, potential buybacks, and paying down debt.

Strategic Refinery Transformation: Turning the Porvoo refinery into a renewables hub would lock in a reliable feedstock supply and cement margins for the long haul.

Bear Case

Margin Compression: Ongoing oversupply in renewable diesel and lower RIN prices could keep margins under pressure.

Slowing Growth: Forecasts call for nearly flat revenue growth as the core Oil Products unit matures.

Operational Risks: Start-up snags and unexpected outages at new plants could push out profitability gains.

Regulatory Shifts: If tax credits like the BTC are cut or expire, returns could take a material hit.

High Short Interest: With many investors betting against the stock, poor results could lead to more selling pressure.

On Our Radar

2025 Q3 Earnings: Set for around October 30th 2025—keep an eye on what management says about margins and volume momentum in renewables.

Porvoo Investment Decision: The next steps in the Porvoo refinery revamp are due by the end of 2025, including capital spending plans.

EPA RFS Rulemaking: The US EPA will finalize the 2026 Renewable Fuel Standard volumes in November 2025, which could shape demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

Capital Markets Day: Expected in November 2025—management should lay out their medium-term strategy and project updates.

Investment Conclusion

Neste’s role as a renewable fuels leader and its appealing price tag could catch the eye of patient, income-oriented investors. But with ongoing margin swings, operational execution risks, and regulatory uncertainty, it’s not a slam-dunk for everyone. Long-term investors might see today’s valuation as a golden entry point, while risk-averse buyers may prefer to wait for steadier earnings and firmer policy support before jumping in.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-08-25 15:56:24.632287

The aircraft delivered is the 46th A220 to enter Air France’s fleet and has been named Vaison-la-Romaine. According to Airbus, using a 50% SAF blend on the ferry flight resulted in a reduction of more than 25 tonnes of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard jet fuel. SAF is considered one of the key ways the industry can reduce emissions and, according to the Air Transport Action Group’s “Scenario 3,"" could account for more than half of aviation’s total carbon dioxide reduction by 2050.

Currently, according to the European manufacturer, all Airbus aircraft are currently certified to operate with up to a 50% blend of SAF and conventional kerosene, and it has set a target for every model, including its helicopters, to be fully compatible with 100% SAF by 2030. Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM, said:

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical, and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game-changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress.”

Airbus Delivered 78% Of Its Aircraft With SAF Blend In The First Half Of 2025

Airbus has offered aircraft deliveries with SAF onboard since 2016, and as of this year, all five of its delivery centers in Toulouse, Hamburg, Mobile, Tianjin, and Mirabel can provide the option to customers. Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada, said that on a global scale, “78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year.” In fact, last year, 75% of the 766 aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend.

In addition, the planemaker has been using sustainable fuel in its own operations for nearly a decade and has committed to increasing the share of SAF used internally to at least 30% by 2030. At Mirabel, which develops and produces the A220, the company expects to integrate around 170,000 liters of pure SAF into activities this year, which is projected to cut carbon emissions by about 400 metric tonnes in 2025.

Airbus has also expanded SAF use across its transport and testing functions. Since 2019, its Beluga fleet has used SAF to carry aircraft parts between production sites, including Hamburg, Broughton, Bremen, Toulouse, and St Nazaire. In 2022, the company started using SAF on test flights.

Airbus Has Also Partnered With Other Carriers To Trial SAF On Commercial Routes

The manufacturer has also worked to embed SAF into its employee travel. Since 2022, Volotea has operated the Hamburg–Toulouse shuttle for Airbus staff using a 34% SAF blend. In addition, Air France-KLM and Airbus introduced a SAF fares agreement in 2024, under which Airbus purchases SAF options for business travel between Paris and five European cities: Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, and Toulouse.

Furthermore, Airbus has supported airline partners in trialing SAF on regular routes. Between November 2024 and January 2025, it partnered with easyJet on the Toulouse–Bristol service, financing 106 tonnes of SAF to cover the equivalent of a three-month schedule at a 30% blend.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/adobe-express-file-2025-08-25t190738-669.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 15:56:28.950411

Starting Wednesday, airlines departing from UK airports must incorporate at least 2% lower-carbon jet fuel, marking a significant milestone in environmental policy.

The Department for Transport’s ambitious plan outlines a progressive implementation strategy. Beginning with a 2% requirement in 2025, the mandate will incrementally increase to 10% by 2030 and reach 22% by 2040. Exploring the evolving landscape of aerospace innovation reveals how technological advancements are driving environmental transformations.

Sustainable aviation fuel represents a groundbreaking approach to reducing carbon emissions. Produced from agricultural waste and used cooking oil, SAF generates approximately 70% less carbon compared to conventional jet fuel. Remarkably, it can be blended with traditional kerosene up to 50% without requiring aircraft engine modifications.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane emphasized the broader implications, stating, “From this moment on, aviation will be a greener, more sustainable form of travel.” The mandate is expected to create thousands of jobs and support the UK’s economic growth while addressing climate concerns.

The compliance mechanism offers flexibility for fuel suppliers. They can either directly provide the required SAF, purchase certificates from overperforming companies, or pay a government penalty of £4.70 per litre for non-compliance. Understanding the intricacies of modern aircraft technologies highlights the complex engineering challenges in sustainable aviation.

Tim Alderslade from Airlines UK supported the initiative, describing the mandate as a “powerful and practical tool for driving down aviation carbon emissions.” The industry recognizes the critical need to transition towards a net-zero future.

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive to produce than conventional jet fuel, but experts anticipate the price gap will narrow as production scales up. Examining the future of global transportation demonstrates how technological innovation can address environmental challenges.

The government has pledged to introduce revenue certainty mechanisms to attract investment in new UK sustainable fuel production plants. This approach aims to create a robust domestic sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem.

Environmental groups have cautiously welcomed the move, seeing it as a significant step towards reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. The mandate represents a critical intervention in the fight against climate change, positioning the UK as a potential global leader in aviation sustainability.",https://19e62ff8.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 17:56:28.368550

HONG KONG, HONG KONG, August 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- BRK Technology Co., Limited today announces the launch of its 2025 partner pilot programme to evaluate algae-based, drop-in renewable fuels across aviation, marine and heavy transportation sectors. The initiative represents a structured effort to produce operational data for industries under increasing pressure to reduce lifecycle emissions while maintaining performance and cost stability.

The programme will focus on sustainable aviation fuel feedstock analysis, marine engine blend assessments and controlled tests for construction, mining and logistics fleets. Each pilot will be designed around measurable baselines and independent lifecycle evaluation to compare greenhouse-gas intensity with petroleum-derived fuels used over the preceding 12-month period. According to Mr. Jin Wong, Chief Executive Officer at BRK Technology, “the objective is to generate practical evidence that algae-based fuels can function as true drop-in renewable options, delivering reduced emissions intensity without major infrastructure change.”

Wong states that the pilot structure reflects growing market demand for credible field validation. Aviation studies will examine certification pathways and refining feasibility, marine pilots will address stability and handling in harbour and auxiliary engines, and heavy machinery trials will assess reliability under load. Results are intended to inform regulators, operators and investors as sustainable fuel pathways scale towards commercialisation.

Mr. Wong explains that “partnership pilots are the link between laboratory innovation and operational deployment. Industrial operators need clear performance data that supports compliance and investment planning. Our approach in 2025 is to provide evidence through controlled and transparent projects.”

The company’s research continues to focus on engineered microalgae strains with higher lipid content and environmental resilience, alongside process optimisation for cultivation, extraction and refining.

Regulatory engagement also continues, with the company preparing for a potential stock exchange listing. BRK Technology confirms that it is working with advisers and regulators, with further announcements expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. Proceeds from a potential listing are expected to support expanded R&D, scaled production and further pilot collaborations.

The timing aligns with policy incentives such as the European Union’s Fit for 55 package and the United States Inflation Reduction Act, which support wider adoption of sustainable aviation fuel. BRK Technology notes that algae-based fuels, produced on non-arable land with closed-loop carbon cycle potential, are well placed for integration into compliance-driven markets.

Applications for the pilot programme will be prioritised for partners able to define clear baselines and measurable outcomes. Priority areas include:

• Certification-aligned aviation feedstock and refining assessments.

• Bench and controlled field tests for heavy machinery under sustained industrial loads.

• Marine blend and stability evaluations for harbour craft and auxiliary engines.

• Lifecycle assessment protocols aligned with reporting requirements for regulators and investors.

Wong adds that “progress in algae-based biofuels requires open collaboration with engine manufacturers, regulators and operators. Our 2025 programme is structured to accelerate this process while providing transparency and maintaining technical rigour.”

Industry observers highlight that global sustainable aviation fuel capacity remains below 1% of total jet fuel consumption as of mid-2025, despite rising demand from airlines committed to carbon-neutral pathways. Algae-based approaches are viewed as promising due to scalability and independence from food-based feedstocks. Heavy industries including mining, logistics and construction are also seeking renewable fuels that can be used in existing fleets without capital-intensive retrofits.

Mr. Wong concludes that “our role is to provide analysis, evidence and pathways for deployment. The 2025 pilot programme is designed to test algae-based solutions under operational conditions and contribute to the sector-wide evidence base required for broader decarbonisation.”

The subject? A now-retired Airbus A310, tail number B-2301, which holds the distinction of being the first Airbus aircraft delivered to China.

More than just a relic, this aircraft marks the beginning of a now four-decade-long cooperation between Airbus and China’s civil aviation sector. Originally delivered on June 25, 1985, the aircraft symbolized a turning point in China’s aviation history, arriving at a time when the country’s commercial fleet barely exceeded 200 planes.

It was handed over to the Shanghai branch of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the predecessor to China Eastern Airlines, and quickly became a familiar presence on routes connecting Beijing, Guangzhou, Tokyo, Osaka, and Hong Kong. Now, Airbus is restoring this historically significant aircraft in celebration of 40 years of continuous partnership with China.

Inside the Airbus-China Partnership

According to Xinhua News Agency, the A310’s arrival in 1985 was more than a commercial move—it was a strategic gesture. Christian Scherer, CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, reflected on its significance: “This A310 did start what became a phenomenal success story, friendship, and basis of trust… even beyond that between Europe and China.”

At the time, China was ramping up its reform and opening-up policy, and modern aircraft like the A310 offered exactly what the country needed: more capacity, quieter engines, and better efficiency. Its arrival paved the way for a long line of Airbus models, including the A300, A320, A340, A350, and A380, now operating in China’s vast aviation network.

Today, China boasts a commercial fleet of more than 4,300 aircraft, with over 2,200 manufactured by Airbus, making it the company’s largest single-country market.

From Museum Display to Immersive Exhibition

Since its retirement in 2006, the A310 B-2301 has been displayed at the Civil Aviation Museum in Beijing, donated by Airbus to the China Civil Aviation Science Popularization Foundation. Although the aircraft hasn’t flown in nearly 20 years, it has remained a symbol of Sino-European cooperation in aviation.

Now, Airbus plans to fully restore the aircraft’s original interior and cockpit, turning it into an interactive exhibit by 2027. The project aims to offer visitors a chance to experience the aircraft as it once was—boarding the cabin, exploring the flight deck, and learning how this widebody jet helped shape China’s aviation infrastructure.

Wang Yanan, a professor at Beihang University, calls it more than a restoration: “It’s a science and culture communicator. It tells the story behind aircraft design, manufacturing, and operation.”

Airbus Deepens Its Roots in China

This restoration isn’t a nostalgic one-off. It’s part of a broader, ongoing effort by Airbus to embed its operations into China’s aerospace sector. Over the past two decades, Airbus has expanded its presence in the country through a network of industrial and R&D facilities. These include:

A320-family final assembly line and widebody completion and delivery center in Tianjin

Engineering and customer support centers in Beijing

Aircraft life-cycle services center in Chengdu

Composites manufacturing hub in Harbin

Innovation center in Shenzhen

R&D center in Suzhou

In total, Airbus employs more than 2,300 staff in China and continues to invest in new ventures—including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development and digital aviation services.

A Future Built on Mutual Innovation

The future of this partnership looks as ambitious as its past. According to Airbus’ Global Market Forecast 2025, annual air travel per person in China is expected to triple from 0.6 in 2024 to 1.8 by 2044. In that same window, the country will likely require 9,570 new aircraft, or nearly a quarter of global demand.",https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/the-first-commercially-delivered-airbus-a310-exhibited-at-civil-aviation-museum-in-beijing.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 14:56:34.188303

Currently, the state’s six ethanol plants consume approximately 210 million bushels annually, representing 40 to 60 percent of North Dakota’s corn output.
Each bushel produces about 3 gallons of ethanol, 15 pounds of livestock feed, and up to 1 pound of corn oil (USDA NASS, 2024; North Dakota Ethanol Council, 2024).

Special to the Farmer

There may not be a more debated topic among North Dakota’s ag community than carbon dioxide and its various uses. But when it comes down to what is best for the state’s corn farmers, Jeff Zueger says there is no debate about new legislation coming out of Washington, D.C.

Zueger, CEO of Harvestone Low Carbon Energy Partners, which operates the Blue Flint ethanol plant in Underwood and Dakota Spirit plant in Spiritwood, and a director on the North Dakota Ethanol Producers Association (NDEPA) board, discussed the impact of the recent tax bill on AM 1090 The Flag.

The legislation, commonly called One Big Beautiful Bill, passed recently and Zueger says it offers benefits for North Dakota’s corn growers and ethanol producers, along with strengthening the state’s role in renewable energy.

North Dakota’s corn production has expanded significantly over the past 20 years. According to the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), in 2004, the state harvested 1.05 million acres of corn, yielding 113 million bushels at an average of 108 bushels per acre. By 2023, production soared to 543.4 million bushels from 3.8 million acres, with an average yield of 143 bushels per acre.

And the state’s ethanol industry has been eager to swallow it up. Currently, the state’s six ethanol plants consume approximately 210 million bushels annually, representing 40 to 60 percent of North Dakota’s corn output. Each bushel produces about 3 gallons of ethanol, 15 pounds of livestock feed, and up to 1 pound of corn oil (USDA NASS, 2024; North Dakota Ethanol Council, 2024).

Zueger detailed how the bill will help all these numbers stay strong. “Sure, so for us, there were a couple of really important pieces in the bill, primarily around carbon capture and storage and how we treat U.S. feedstocks, corn in particular, in the ethanol production industry. So we ended up coming out of the final bill with quite a few wins for our industry that we got to walk through,” he said.

The legislation builds on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Inflation Reduction Act, enhancing tax credits that support sustainable practices. Key components of the bill include the 45Q and 45Z tax credits. Zueger explained, “So 45Q is a tax credit that is tied to sequestration of CO2. So permanently storing carbon dioxide, and or beneficial use of carbon dioxide. So converting carbon dioxide into fuels, converting carbon dioxide into fertilizer. So 45Q previous to the One Big Beautiful Bill had tax credit levels that were lower than they are today.”

The bill increases these credits to $60 per ton for beneficial uses, such as enhanced oil recovery, and $85 per ton for sequestration, incentivizing investments in carbon capture technology.

The 45Z clean fuel production credit, extended through 2029, removes penalties like indirect land use charges that previously disadvantaged U.S. corn.

“And under the One Big Beautiful Bill,” Zueger noted, “it was extended to 2029, which was really good for our industry. And then also get away again, with direct land use. So 45Z clean fuel production credit takes into account farm practices all the way to tailpipe emissions for renewable fuel.”

These changes directly benefit North Dakota’s corn growers. By eliminating indirect land use penalties, which many say unfairly linked U.S. corn production to global deforestation, the bill ensures fair competition with countries like Brazil.

“The other piece that One Big Beautiful Bill did was kind of protect the U.S. feedstocks for things like sustainable aviation fuel and renewable base fuel,” said Zueger. “Up until that bill passed, Brazil was going to eat our lunch as it relates to providing ethanol for feedstock for staff.”

The bill mandates that renewable fuel feedstocks come from the U.S., Canada, or Mexico, figuring to support local farmers and rural economies in towns like Underwood and Spiritwood.

Zueger says the legislation also positions North Dakota to tap into the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market, saying that if you consider it as a 100 million gallon a year aviation fuel market that could be 50% renewable based, that allows for price strength for farmers wanting to sell their corn.

Despite these opportunities, some landowners remain wary of carbon capture due to concerns about CO2 pipeline safety.

Zueger addressed the issue.

“Well, I think it’s why we’d say that as perhaps you don’t understand the safety elements associated with long-term permanent storage of CO2. So, I think there’s some real benefits with demonstrating carbon capture and storage as it relates to long-term enhanced oil recovery.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2327/2024/06/21021310/US-CONGRESS-PHOTO-PEXELS.png,N,,2025-08-25 11:56:39.090116

Headline Takeaway: Veralto (VLTO) is showing a recent price rise of 1.88%, but technical signals suggest weak momentum and the need for caution.

News Highlights

Recent global news appears to have little direct impact on Veralto, but broader economic trends remain in focus. Notably:

Fuel Ethanol Market Growth: A report released on May 29 highlights the rising commercial viability of sustainable aviation fuel via new ethanol technologies. Veralto could benefit if its ethanol production aligns with this trend.

UN Condemns Medical Supply Looting in Gaza: While unrelated to Veralto’s core operations, this incident underscores global instability, which could affect energy markets and ethanol demand in the long run.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Veralto currently holds an average rating score of 4.00 and a weighted rating score of 4.75, based on the recent activity of three analyst firms. These scores reflect a modestly optimistic outlook, though with differences in analyst expectations (e.g., “Strong Buy” and “Neutral” ratings both present). This divergence means investors should watch for further clarity before committing to long-term positions.

The current stock price trend is positive (1.88% rise), and it appears to align with the market’s weighted expectations, suggesting some degree of consensus despite the mixed ratings.

Key Fundamental Factor Values:

ROA (Return on Assets): 3.10% (Internal diagnostic score: 4.63)

ROE (Return on Equity): 8.34% (Internal diagnostic score: 4.63)

EV/EBIT: 80.64 (Internal diagnostic score: 0.00)

Net Income to Revenue: 41.30% (Internal diagnostic score: 4.63)

CFOA (Cash Flow from Operating Activities): 4.73 (Internal diagnostic score: 4.63)

Money-Flow Trends

Veralto’s fund-flow patterns over the last period reveal a mixed picture. While small investors are showing a positive trend (50.06% inflow ratio), larger institutional investors are more cautious, with medium and extra-large money flows trending negatively. The overall inflow ratio stands at 48.48%, and block trading activity (48.28% inflow ratio) also shows a negative bias.

With an internal fund-flow score of 7.62, the stock is still considered in a “good” category, but investors should watch for shifts in large capital flows which can quickly change the momentum.

Key Technical Signals

Veralto’s technical outlook remains unclear and volatile, with internal diagnostic scores from recent indicators showing a range of signals:

Bearish Engulfing: Score 7.31 (internal diagnostic score) – A strong bearish candle pattern observed on 2025-08-11.

WR Overbought: Score 6.41 – Seen on multiple dates (2025-08-13, 2025-08-12, 2025-08-08), indicating potential overbought conditions.

RSI Overbought: Score 1.00 – A strong negative signal seen on 2025-08-13.

MACD Death Cross: Score 6.18 – Observed on 2025-08-18, suggesting bearish momentum.

WR Oversold: Score 3.96 – A positive signal on 2025-08-18.

The key insights from the technical analysis suggest mixed momentum, with long and short signals in balance and the overall trend being weak and unclear.

The EU’s sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) blending mandate creates an opportunity for Finland to become a significant producer of synthetic fuels in the future.

Finnish company Liquid Sun is launching a globally unique pilot project to produce renewable, eSAF from biogenic CO₂ emissions. Originating from research at Tampere University, Liquid Sun has developed an innovation based on low-temperature electrolysis (LTE) technology that converts CO₂ emissions and renewable H2 into eSAF. For this pilot, Liquid Sun has partnered with Finnair, ABB, Fortum, and Finavia. In Finland, biogenic CO₂ emissions are generated, for example, by the forest industry and biogas plants.

The pilot electro-fuel production unit, to be located in Espoo, will be fully operational in autumn 2025. This is the first pre-commercial production pilot of its kind, aiming to establish a functioning ecosystem and value chain for synthetic fuel production in Finland. In this collaborative project, the companies will jointly develop eSAF production, conduct validation, and build capabilities for globally scalable processes to secure the future supply of domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the rapidly emerging sustainable aviation fuel market. To achieve this goal, it is critical that the project brings together industrial partners across the eSAF value chain with a shared ambition to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels,” said Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun.

At the beginning of 2025, the EU aviation blending mandate entered into force, requiring the gradual increase of renewable fuel use in aviation through 2050. From 2030, the mandate will expand to include fully synthetic fuels made from CO₂. By 2050, the blending requirement will rise to 70%, of which half must be eSAF. The mandate applies to airports with at least 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tons of cargo annually. In Finland, this includes Helsinki-Vantaa and Rovaniemi airports.

“As the owner of Finland’s airports, we at Finavia want to do everything we can across the aviation value chain to support more sustainable air travel. This means bold climate collaboration with our stakeholders and actively understanding and testing new technologies across our airport operations,” said Henri Hansson, SVP, Airport Infrastructure, Sustainability, Safety, Security & Compliance at Finavia.

Due to this regulatory framework, Finland has a unique opportunity to become a leading producer of renewable aviation fuels. The Finnish forest industry alone generates 20 million tons of biogenic CO₂ annually, with additional emissions from biogas plants. These diverse sources enable decentralized eSAF production, which in turn strengthens energy security and balances electricity grid load nationwide.

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, and its energy transition will require new innovation and collaboration across the value chain. We want to contribute to developing Finland’s capability in synthetic aviation fuel production while advancing the industry’s carbon neutrality goals,” said Riku Aho, Vice President Energy Transition, at Finnair.

“Fortum’s target is to help societies to reach carbon neutrality and our customers to decarbonize their processes. For aviation fuel production, we are pleased to offer renewable energy and, in the future, H2 from the pilot plant we are currently building,” said Satu Sipola, Vice President, H2 and Project Execution at Fortum.

“The goal of ABB Oy’s H2 Springboard program is to promote the development of Finland’s H2 economy ecosystem and to accelerate the scaling of H2 technology solutions. The Liquid Sun project is an excellent example of broad ecosystem collaboration for developing pioneering solutions,” said Simo Säynevirta, Head of H2 Springboard ecosystem at ABB.

There is a technological race underway to deliver cost-efficient and scalable solutions, and Finland’s conditions and capabilities are highly favorable. ""We believe rapid piloting and validation is the right approach when building an entirely new industry for synthetic fuels. If successful, this project can give Finland a significant competitive advantage,” said Pasi Keinänen, Liquid Sun.

Although shipping accounts for only about 3% of global carbon emissions, the sector carries nearly 90% of global trade, making it central to global decarbonization efforts. Taiwan’s three leading carriers— Evergreen Marine, Yang Ming Marine, and Wan Hai Lines—are stepping up efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in response to international carbon pricing regulations.

According to RECCESSARY carbon market analyst Sherry Hu, Taiwan’s shipping industry faces two major challenges in its green transition: Cost pressures and fuel supply. Companies that fail to adopt cleaner fuels early may struggle with rising costs in the long term.

ETS surcharges and 2027 carbon pricing raise pressure on shipping

Energy efficiency and carbon reduction have become global priorities, not only for ESG compliance but also to avoid rising regulatory costs. Both the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the European Union have introduced measures targeting shipping emissions.

As of 2024, major carriers have begun collecting surcharges under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The IMO is also preparing its own carbon pricing mechanism that could reach up to USD 380 per metric ton, with enforcement expected by 2027 and mandatory payments starting in 2028.

With more than 50,000 cargo ships operating worldwide, the shipping industry is heading into a high-cost era. Shipowners must gradually phase out older vessels and energy-intensive equipment, while replacing high-polluting heavy fuel oil with alternatives such as methanol, low-sulfur fuels, or liquefied natural gas. Hu emphasized that striking a balance between operating costs and decarbonization investment will be critical to the success of this transition.

A study by Taiwan’s Ministry of Transportation highlights three main pathways for reducing shipping emissions: developing dual-fuel ships powered by cleaner energy, lowering energy consumption through slow steaming or efficiency improvements, and offsetting emissions through carbon credits or carbon taxes.

Strategy 1: Replacing aging ships with LNG and methanol dual-fuel vessels

Wai Hai’s 2023 Sustainability Report shows that the company has phased out older vessels and added 23 high-efficiency ships, cutting its annual carbon emissions by 17% in 2023 compared with 2022, and by 48% from its 2008 baseline. In April, the company announced plans to purchase four 16,000 TEU methanol dual-fuel container ships and to add 34 more newly built vessels over the next five years.

Yang Ming’s 2023 Sustainability Report stated that the company has signed a contract with HD Hyundai Heavy Industries to build five 15,500 TEU LNG dual-fuel container ships, scheduled to enter service from 2026. The company also completed procurement last year for seven 15,500 TEU LNG dual-fuel vessels and six 8,000 TEU methanol dual-fuel container ships, a move aimed at phasing out aging vessels in its fleet that are over 20 years old.

Yang Ming announced on July 24 that it will order three additional 8,000 TEU methanol dual-fuel-ready containerships from Nihon Shipyard Co., Ltd. and Imabari Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. Combined with the three vessels of the model purchased this March, Yang Ming will have a total of six methanol dual-fuel-ready container ships scheduled for delivery between 2028 and 2030.

According to Evergreen’s 2023 Sustainability Report, the company invested in 24 16,000 TEU methanol vessels and six 2,400 TEU dual-fuel container ships in 2023. This February, Evergreen further expanded its fleet by purchasing eleven ultra-large 24,000 TEU LNG dual-fuel container ships, bringing its total investment to more than TWD 100 billion.

Strategy 2: Accelerating adoption of alternative fuels amid competition with aviation

Beyond investing in next-generation vessels, alternative fuels have become a priority. Yang Ming reported conducting its first biofuels trial in South Korea in 2024, using B30 fuel blended with locally sourced waste cooking oil. The fuel meets ISO 8217 standards and carries ISCC sustainability certification, aligning with the EU’s Green Fuel for Maritime initiative. According to the company, the biofuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 25% compared with conventional marine fuels.

Wan Hai announced on Oct. 7, 2024 that it has started using biofuels across its global fleet. The first vessel to adopt the fuel was the WAN HAI 510, which operates on the Far East-India route. The biofuel is produced by blending methyl esters derived from recycled cooking oil with conventional low-sulfur fuel oil, enabling a reduction of about 20% in carbon emissions compared with standard low-sulfur fuel.

Since the beginning of this year, Evergreen has begun using biofuels certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) system to reduce emissions. The company said that it has conducted tests of blended marine biofuels across different vessel types, flag states, and engine models since 2023.

To prepare for the delivery of new dual-fuel vessels, Evergreen has already signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with five green methanol suppliers and is in talks with four more, with the aim of securing fuel supply at ports across Europe, the U.S., and Asia in line with future operational routes.

However, the biofuel market is already highly competitive. The aviation sector is struggling with shortages of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), along with high costs and technical hurdles. Hu warned that if significant demand from the shipping industry emerges after the IMO’s carbon pricing mechanism takes effect in 2027, it could intensify competition with aviation for limited resources.

Hu added that most new production capacity is being directed toward aviation, meaning the share available for shipping could be limited in the short term. She suggested that if the IMO allocates carbon pricing revenues to support the expansion of biofuel and other low-carbon fuel capacity and supply chains, it could help ease scarcity and cost pressures over the longer term.

In the short term, the risk of passing carbon costs onto customers will be difficult to avoid. Hu noted that in the medium to long term, if the IMO’s Net-Zero Fund channels substantial investment into low-carbon fuel supply and port infrastructure, it could gradually reduce the cost of fuel substitution while enhancing emissions reductions.

A further uncertainty lies in whether both the EU ETS and the IMO will impose carbon charges on overlapping routes during the initial phase. This would be particularly sensitive for European services, but carriers that proactively adjust route planning and fuel strategies may be able to mitigate the risk of double charges.

Note: TEU stands for Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit, the standard measurement for a 20-foot shipping container. One TEU refers to the length of a single 20-foot container and is commonly used to describe the capacity of container ships and terminals.

Of the 24 products thought to be counterfeits, 14 came from AliExpress, one came from Shein and nine came from Temu.
“The proliferation of counterfeits on Temu, AliExpress, and Shein is more than a series of isolated mistakes.
The full report from the ITIF stated that the organization believes Temu, Shein and AliExpress have varying problems when it comes to enforcement of intellectual property rights.
Shein, Temu and AliExpress did not immediately return Sourcing Journal’s request for comment on the ITIF’s assertions.","The Information Technology & Innovation Fund (ITIF) has called on the office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Jamieson Greer to include Shein, Temu and AliExpress on this year’s Notorious Markets List (NML) for Counterfeiting and Piracy.

The USTR’s office opened the public comment period for the NML last week. According to the USTR website, the NML “highlights online and physical markets that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy.”

ITIF contended that Temu, Shein and AliExpress meet that description. The non-profit said that it ordered 51 products from the three marketplaces and found 24 of those products to be “likely counterfeits.” The products examined ranged across consumer categories, including apparel, luxury goods and toys. Of the 24 products thought to be counterfeits, 14 came from AliExpress, one came from Shein and nine came from Temu.

Eli Clemens, an ITIF policy analyst and the author of the report, said the companies need to be more closely watched to protect American consumers.

“The proliferation of counterfeits on Temu, AliExpress, and Shein is more than a series of isolated mistakes. It reflects a fundamental failure by these platforms to prioritize anti-counterfeiting efforts, leading to poor outcomes for brands and consumers alike,” Clemens said in a statement. “Counterfeit products are not only bad for the economy, but they also pose potential safety risks to consumers.”

According to ITIF, the suspected counterfeits used intellectual property from brands like Ralph Lauren, New Balance, Carolina Herrera, Brooks and Nike, among others.

The full report from the ITIF stated that the organization believes Temu, Shein and AliExpress have varying problems when it comes to enforcement of intellectual property rights.

While just one Shein product was a suspected counterfeit, the trade organization still took issue with the company’s approach toward intellectual property.

“IP infringement on Shein remains a live issue in the form of unauthorized reproduction of creative works by independent designers,” the trade organization wrote in the report. “These cases often avoid brand names and logos entirely, making them harder to detect with automated tools and more burdensome for individual rights holders to challenge.”

Shein has faced multiple lawsuits alleging that it has ripped off artists’ and companies’ proprietary designs.

As far as AliExpress is concerned, the ITIF contended that counterfeits on the marketplace are more blatant.

“AliExpress appears to host vendors that misuse brand trademarks across multiple product types, particularly in low-cost categories such as accessories, toys and shoes. Likely counterfeits purchased on AliExpress often appear crude, with unauthorized use of brand names and logos applied to goods that the legitimate rights holder does not produce, or products with inferior quality than would be expected from the original manufacturer,” the ITIF said.

Temu, meanwhile, allegedly offers what the ITIF called “highly deceptive” counterfeits.

“These goods often bear barcodes, certification marks, or manufacturer references that appear authentic. This makes Temu counterfeits more difficult for consumers to spot while browsing, and more difficult to determine are counterfeit upon receipt of the goods. Taken as a whole, potential counterfeit vendors on Temu appear to have a strategy aimed at selling counterfeit goods as legitimate-looking products to maintain customer trust while still profiting from infringing sales,” the ITIF wrote.

The 2024 NML, released in January ahead of the new administration, included Pinduoduo, which is also owned by Temu’s parent company, PDD Holdings. Temu did not see any mention on the list. Former USTR Katherine Tai indicated upon release of the 2024 report that the government has continued to track the growth of China-headquartered marketplaces. Douyin Mall, owned by TikTok parent ByteDance made the list, alongside Taobao, DHGate and others.

U.S. politicians have long harbored concerns about Shein and Temu’s purported links to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in part because both are China-founded businesses. Shein is currently headquartered in Singapore, though reportedly, the company is actively considering a move back to China to align with its aspirations for an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong. Temu is currently headquartered in Boston, though its parent company PDD Holdings is based in Dublin.

AliExpress, owned by Alibaba Group, remains the only company of the three headquartered in China. The company saw inclusion on the 2021 and 2022 NMLs. ITIF said it remains unclear what prompted the company’s removal from the list in 2023.

Shein, Temu and AliExpress did not immediately return Sourcing Journal’s request for comment on the ITIF’s assertions.

In addition to calling on the USTR to add the three companies to the 2025 NML, the ITIF has recommended some policy actions. It has stated it believes that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) should leverage artificial intelligence for identifying counterfeit products. The ITIF said it believes the automated nature of AI systems could help scale up enforcement, while also preempting some counterfeits from being sold.

Additionally, it suggested that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) establish a “Foreign Counterfeit Complaint Center” (FC3), which would draw inspiration from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center. The FC3 would give consumers a way to report potential counterfeits to the government while simultaneously offering a way for the agency to track patterns and compile evidence against companies and marketplaces as necessary.

Part of the reason for these additional recommendations, the ITIF said, is that CBP failed to stop potential counterfeits from entering the U.S. The ITIF noted that the agency detained four suspected counterfeit products from AliExpress but ultimately released them. The non-profit said more oversight could help other counterfeits from entering the country in the future.

“Addressing the counterfeit trade requires sustained U.S. action to recalibrate platform and vendor behavior through regulatory, trade, and technological measures,” Clemens said in a statement. “Holding foreign e-commerce platforms to the same standards as domestic ones is essential to protecting consumers, fostering innovation and safeguarding the integrity of global markets.”

“Partnering with Xiamen Airlines enables us to scale the production of SAF from waste feedstocks more rapidly,” EcoCeres CEO Matti Lievonen was quoted as saying.

EcoCeres has raised concerns about the European Union (EU)’s treatment of biodiesel imports from China.

In January, the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) published proposals that it said would improve the EU’s system for quality verification, including annual on-site audits.

The EBB – which represents 34 companies that produce 75% of Europe’s biodiesel output – also called on the EU to impose effective sanctions against fraudulent imports, including retroactive invalidations of certificates, to compel all players in the sector to exercise due diligence, Biofuels Digest wrote on 6 August report, citing a South China Morning Post report.

For biofuels imported into the EU, the EBB recommended mandatory content tests to determine sustainability, with results logged in an EU database.

EcoCeres CEO Matti Lievonen said the content tests for imports could be discriminatory to product from outside the EU.

“There should not be a battle between EU and non-EU producers,” he said.

“The focus of any reform should be on ensuring a level playing field.”

Describing the current system as redundant, he said a streamlined, centralised framework could maintain consistency and reduce potential future supply disruptions.

The U.S. had a $60 billion trade deficit in June 2025, which is down from $71.7 billion in May 2025.
The biggest issue that keeps coming up among ag groups is the $300 billion trade deficit with China, according to 2024 numbers.
That’s a 5.7% increase over 2023, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.","American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall was clear in his message to President Donald Trump when the two met several weeks ago. Duvall told him that farmers like him do not support tariffs.

“We don’t support your tariffs, but we sure hope that your efforts and your direction that you’re taking trade in is successful,” Duvall recalled saying while talking to crowds at Farmfest on Wednesday, Aug. 6.

Trump assured him that these deals would bring people to the table to level the playing field.

Duvall also had the opportunity to speak with United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who told him there would be no trade agreement without agriculture having a big stake in it.

But until those deals are made with key trade partners like Canada, Mexico and China, Duvall also knew it was clear that things are going to be difficult with the large incoming crop to deal with at a time when crop prices were slipping lower.

“You go into the banker and talk about next year’s crop, and it’s going to be a difficult situation unless we have ... a bright outlook on the future when it comes to trade,” he said.

Luke Lindberg, on his second day on the job as under secretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, echoed what Duvall said, that agriculture must be in any trade deal. He saw the recent negotiations that have resulted in some trade deals as a glimpse into the “golden age of agriculture” from a trade perspective.

“Never before have we had more movement on the trade front to open up new markets and provide new opportunities for our farmers and ranchers than what President Trump has been able to do in his first seven months in office,” Lindberg said.

Lindberg mentioned a trade deal with Japan that is meant to bring $4.5 billion in new ag sales. According to the White House, Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

While Lindberg shared his excitement about trade deals as a milestone, the delivery and payment for agricultural products was the finish line they needed to reach.

“The actual victory comes when we get sales done,” he said.

Lindberg said what concerns him is that the U.S. has a $50 billion trade deficit. The U.S. had a $60 billion trade deficit in June 2025, which is down from $71.7 billion in May 2025. So far, the big change is not in exports, but in fewer imports, according to data from the USDA.

Chad Willis, also on the trade panel with Duvall at Farmfest, is a Willmar, Minnesota, farmer and past president of the U.S. Grains Council.

He was asked by moderator Don Wick, of the Red River Farm Network, what the U.S. role is in building trade relationships. Willis explained that the U.S. must continue to fund overseas trade missions in order to hold up those relationships built over decades. He referenced funds that help the U.S. promote ethanol overseas.

“So that’s why I’m glad to see this extra money now for promotion in the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ as they call it, ’cause it’ll help organizations such as U.S. Grains and Soybeans, Meat Federation, to do more overseas. Trade is all about relationships,” he said.

Willis referenced a supplemental agricultural trade program in the reconciliation bill that passed in July . This makes available $285 million “to encourage the accessibility, development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial export markets for United States agricultural commodities” starting in 2027 and each fiscal year after.

The biggest issue that keeps coming up among ag groups is the $300 billion trade deficit with China, according to 2024 numbers. That’s a 5.7% increase over 2023, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

Randy Spronk, past chair of the U.S. Meat Export Federation, spoke about hurdles to overcome in this area, including a current 57% tariff on pork products imported into China. That was previously a 172% tariff.

“The rest of the world is about 12%,” he said.

Tariffs are a major determining factor in whether China buys U.S. products, yet Spronk added that he believes the U.S. product remains the best value when it goes to China.

He mentioned that the “variety meats” from pork and beef products, such as organs and other subprime edibles, are sought after in China, while less sought after in the U.S. Getting those products to China adds the highest value to each animal. But removing the tariffs will open the doors back to trading with China, according to Spronk.

China was the second largest importer of U.S. pork and pork variety meat last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation; nearly 70% of that volume is variety meat.

Darin Johnson, president of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, is hopeful for other soybean markets to open up, like India, but he’s not convinced that anything at the moment can replace the loss felt by China choosing South America for its soybean needs.

“In the end, it is, China is a tough, that’s a tough number to replace,” he said.

That number is 115 million metric tons that China purchases in a year. They were buying 58% of the total U.S. exports of soybeans. The U.S. exports about 50% of its soybeans.

“That’s equivalent to all the other countries' imports,” Johnson continued. “So it’s, it’s really quite a staggering number when you think about it that way.”

The next highest is the European Union, at 14 million metric tons, about 100 million tons less than China.

The importance of adding value to a lower-priced commodity was emphasized by Willis. He mentioned turning corn to ethanol as one of those areas and added that Canada is the No. 1 ethanol export market. Mexico could be a large opportunity, he said.

Feeding the grains to cattle that can be shipped to other countries was another way Spronk saw to add value.

“Gotta add value to that kernel, especially at these prices that we’re experiencing right now,” he said.

In the absence of a trade deal with China, Johnson responded to an audience question that farmers are going to have a very difficult time continuing without government assistance.

“Cause right now we’re operating really probably anywhere, depending on your farm, probably a dollar to potentially $2 for soybeans under the cost of production,” he said.

Johnson gave credit to the farmers in the room as a group of people who are willing to give up their retirement or equity in order to stay on the farm and give the next generation a chance at survival.

“I mean, it makes my hair stand up on my arms thinking about it,” he said.

He was aware that there were some farmers in the building who had been continuing the farm for six or seven generations.

“We are going to need some assistance if these negotiations do take some time, which, understandably, we want to make sure that we get it right, too.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/ff644b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2592x1728+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2Fad%2Fec14014748abae6b2e4ff0bfca45%2F9773181468948-unloading-soybeans-into-semi-6894.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 11:57:13.362568

In some sectors, such as life sciences and therapeutics, venture capital had flowed freely, analysts said, thanks to low interest rates, demand for digital technologies and an increased appetite for risk.

“You saw a lot of those types of investments happening in the Baltimore region as well that ended up yielding some great outcomes,” said Kory Bailey, GBC’s chief ecosystem officer. “In years after that …investors were being a little more cautious.”

Funding each of the past three years in the region has been steady yet well below 2021’s high of $1 billion for 87 startups. Last year, it totaled nearly $665 million. Meanwhile, the number of new businesses getting that capital has decreased each year, from 89 in 2022 to 60 last year.

Building a startup ecosystem where the region can compete with other cities will hinge on attracting more private investment and focusing on strengths such as national security and global economic competitiveness, more likely to win federal support under the Trump administration, Bailey said. The region is well-positioned to do so, he said, thanks to anchor health care systems and defense facilities, along with access to airports and the Port of Baltimore.

But “if we want to accelerate that growth and be on pace with other regions that have really leaned into their sector strengths, we’ve got to be more intentional about how we elevate the innovations and leaders that are happening now,” Bailey said.

By tracking startups, the business group expects to focus on and drive investment to companies in the hottest sectors, hitting milestones for job creation, investment and revenue. That can be difficult, as many entrepreneurs launch or fizzle out with little fanfare or public reporting. GBC hasn’t been able to track startup failures, Bailey said, “Startups inherently all don’t win.”

Ongoing reductions in federal spending in research and education is “concerning,” he said. But he is hopeful opportunities for growth will expand through the private sector, philanthropy or other entities committed to the region’s prosperity.

In its latest report in March, UpSurge tracked 486 operating technology startups, about the same as in a 2024 report. Most offer health care services or products and often form through the transfer of technology from incubators at places such as Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, Baltimore and Blackbird Labs.

Besides Baltimore city’s 336 tech startups, clusters have emerged in Howard County, with 68, Baltimore County, with 55 and Anne Arundel County, with 43. After health care, key industries include information technology, such as cybersecurity and AI applications, followed by finance, manufacturing, media, education, energy and advertising. GBC wants to expand the database to non-tech service startups.

‘Taking that leap’

Baltimore-based Elos Thermal, started by two 2019 graduates of Archbishop Curley High School, is one of those that’s taking off.

Thunlwyn Garcia and Anthony Dragisics played soccer at two different Division 1 colleges and commiserated about competing in adverse weather. Garcia, who studied entrepreneurship at Mount St. Mary’s College, approached Dragisics, then a Villanova University business major, with an idea for insoles that could regulate temperature while offering pain relief.

With money borrowed from parents, they used 3D printers in their dorms to make prototypes. In their senior year, they secured a patent, convincing them to push ahead full-time after graduating in 2023.

“It was a big decision for sure, taking that leap,” said Dragisics, 24, an Ellicott City native. “We felt confident this had a place in the market.”

From Spark Coworking Baltimore at Market Place downtown, where the partners said they’ve learned from more experienced entrepreneurs, they plan to launch Elos insoles nationally in October through Amazon and specialty retail shops. They’ve so far sold about 500 units to skiers, hikers, runners and other athletes in a limited launch in February on Elos’ website. Production is now handled in Asia.

“Finding good partners has been the most challenging,” Dragisics said. “We underestimated how long it takes to form good relationships and partnerships.”

Building a startup

Shaw, of BrightWave, said his algae-growing products have global appeal, but he found expertise to start the business much closer to home. The co-founders became interested in algae because of its growing popularity as a biofuel.

In 2019, the new company rented space near algae specialists at the Institute for Marine and Environmental Technologies, part of the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science, working with scientists on research and development and building prototypes.

They sought advice from the state Department of Commerce, which led them to Early Charm, a Pigtown-based company that creates, owns and operates businesses that commercialize new technologies. Early Charm provided more business leads.

They assumed they’d have to go overseas for manufacturing, but found Early Charm’s subsidiary, Sanosona, could take on production and assembly. BrightWave also found local plastics, packaging and other suppliers.

Initially, “it was almost a foregone conclusion that if we want to do this right and keep our manufacturing costs down, it was going to have to be offshore, and it turned out to be the complete opposite,” Shaw said.

One of the biggest challenges was attracting institutional investors. Deals with private investors came close but fell through. After months of dead ends, the founders ended up funding their startup.

“Hard tech is a tough sell for investors,” Shaw said. “Investors wanted to see monthly baked-in revenue. That wasn’t our model.”

While uncertainty over grant funding is concerning for firms similar to BrightWave, Shaw says his firm, expecting $3 million in revenue this year from the U.K. deal, is set up to weather the storm. It has avoided relying on grants and seeks both public and private sector customers, many from overseas.

Carton, who says his new tech consulting firm will pursue a people-first approach, expects challenges ahead for startups that lose federal funding or work with clients affected by cuts. But starting out has become easier, in some ways, he said, with services and information more available online. That can reduce the time and expense of registering a business, finding contractors or traveling to in-person meetings, lowering barriers to entry.

In the past, he co-founded a web development firm in 1996 that became digital agency Carton Donofrio Partners, which employed 100 people at its peak but no longer exists. He later helped start ad agency idfive, a marketing and communications agency in Baltimore’s Mount Vernon neighborhood.

“The appeal is setting your own path,” Carton said. “These days, it sort of feels like, yeah, it’s risky, but so is anything. Being employed anywhere these days is not a guarantee.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qc2hkiIIK.hRxuPI75s8xg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/baltimore_sun_tribune_local_552/446587f2f877ad114f44ee41c4e421c6,N,,2025-08-25 11:57:20.224046

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken action on a backlog of 175 Small Refinery Exemption (SRE) petitions covering compliance years 2016 through 2024. After reviewing each case with the U.S. Department of Energy, EPA granted 63 full exemptions, 77 partial exemptions, denied 28 petitions, and found 7 ineligible.

EPA reaffirmed its policy, first set in the 2020 Renewable Volume Obligation rule, to grant partial relief—typically a 50% exemption—when a small refinery shows partial hardship. This approach aims to recognize that not all small refineries face the same level of challenge while keeping national renewable fuel goals on course.

“The EPA inherited a messy situation and we appreciate the agency’s commitment to ending the years-long SRE litigation and restoring stability to the RFS. NOPA is confident the agency understands that strong RVOs will have profoundly positive impacts on U.S. farmers and rural America. We urge the EPA to build on this progress and quickly finalize the RVOs in a way that delivers these positive impacts, by finalizing a re-allocation policy that fully accounts for gallons lost due to SREs in 2023-2025 and any projected SREs for future years, expanding volumes for the biomass-based diesel category to at least 5.25 billion gallons and ensuring domestic feedstocks and fuels are prioritized. These measures are essential to ensuring the program strengthens domestic markets and keeps investment and jobs in rural America,” said Devin Mogler, President and CEO, National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA)

EPA also clarified how Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) will be handled when exemptions are granted for past years. RINs may only be used in the year they are generated or the following year. Because of that two-year window, 2022 and earlier RINs cannot be used to meet open 2024 or future obligations. EPA says this limit should prevent older RINs from affecting current or future biofuel demand.

Looking ahead, EPA plans to send a supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget to address reallocation of exempted volumes for 2023 and later years. The agency does not plan to reallocate volumes from 2016–2022 due to the RIN timing limits. EPA will also explain how it plans to project SREs in setting percentage standards for 2026 and 2027, helping to keep intended renewable fuel volumes in place.

Industry reactions were mixed but focused on maintaining market stability. Groups representing oilseed processors and biofuel producers urged EPA to fully reallocate gallons lost to 2023–2024 exemptions and to finalize strong volume targets. Others warned that refunding retired RINs must not weaken demand for biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, or farm-based feedstocks.

For farmers and rural communities, the key takeaway is that EPA’s approach seeks to balance hardship relief with steady growth in homegrown fuels.",,N,,2025-08-25 11:57:30.747758

AeroSHARK Certification for A330

Lufthansa Technik is seeking certification through a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), which enables a series of modifications to the A330-200s and A330-300s fuselage and nacelles. AeroSHARK is a fuel-saving technology that works by reducing drag. It was developed by Lufthansa Technik and BASF, and the process involves applying a sharkskin film called riblet film. Riblets are microscopic grooves that help guide air or water efficiently over a surface. On an aircraft, they help direct airflow along the fuselage, reducing drag and improving aerodynamic performance.

The company already holds certifications for AeroSHARK modification on the Boeing 777-300ER, 777-200ER, and Boeing 777F. The Airbus A330 is the next candidate to receive AeroSHARK after the Boeing 777. The A330 is one of the most widely used wide-body aircraft globally, second only to the Boeing 777 in fleet size and popularity among long-haul operators. The A330’s strong standing in the market opens new opportunities for AeroSHARK.

The certification process is expected to be completed in 2026. Aircraft modifications require official approval from aviation authorities. The process involves detailed analyses and test campaigns that ensure compliance and aviation safety standards are met. All aircraft models requiring modification must undergo their own STC.

AeroSHARK Benefits

Lufthansa Technik and BASF Coatings have successfully adapted the principle of drag reduction through riblets to withstand the harsh conditions of daily airline operations, which makes AeroSHARK the first and only certified riblet film solution available for commercial aviation. AeroSHARK achieves a reduction of about one percent in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

According to Lufthansa Technik, the riblet technology is more effective in reducing aerodynamic drag when the aircraft is in a cruise flight. This makes long-haul aircraft great candidates for these types of modification due to their long distances.

Lufthansa Technik stated that large-scale AeroSHARK modifications have been successfully applied to 28 Boeing 777 aircraft of several airlines and one Lufthansa Boeing 747, which was used as a testbed. The company added that AeroSHARK-modified aircraft have accumulated over 232,000 successful flight hours, saving more than 13,000 metric tons of jet fuel and reducing CO2 emissions by over 42,000 metric tons.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/250117_LH-Super-Star-012-2117.jpg_main-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1708&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-25 11:57:38.945653

What Are The Major Factors Driving The General Aviation Global Market Growth?

The surge in business aviation requirements is forecasted to stimulate the expansion of the general aviation market in the near future. With the designation of business aviation being applied to those aircraft utilized for business goals by firms or individuals, distinct from conventional commercial airline services, it presents improved adaptability, time effectiveness, and accessibility to isolated areas in a bid to boost corporate efficiency and connectivity. The burgeoning needs of corporate travel and the drive for better utilization of time are causing the demand for business aviation to spike. General aviation buttresses business aviation by offering adaptable, competent, and immediate air travel alternatives, therefore adding to corporate movement and accessibility to remote or inadequately serviced areas. Honeywell, a technology and manufacturing corporation based in the US, reported in October 2023 that the demand from new clients in business aviation is predicted to spur an additional demand for 500 aircraft and a 6% increase in flight activity in the coming decade. These factors, in conjunction with the expected double-digit bump in turbofan deliveries in the years 2023 and 2024, implies that the escalating demand for business aviation is fuelling the expansion of the general aviation market.

With a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.17% from 2025 to 2034, the market is set to expand from $112.1 thousand in 2024 to $359.5 thousand by 2034. This growth is driven by a confluence of regulatory tailwinds, corporate decarbonization mandates, and the urgent need for reliable, low-carbon backup power in an era of digital transformation. For investors, this represents a high-growth opportunity at the intersection of energy transition and critical infrastructure.

Market Drivers: Regulatory Push and Corporate Sustainability Imperatives

The adoption of HVO as a drop-in replacement for diesel in data center backup generators is accelerating due to its ability to reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 90%. This aligns with the net-zero targets of hyperscale operators and the tightening emissions standards in key APAC markets.

Japan's Green Growth Strategy is incentivizing biofuel integration in energy systems, with Tokyo and Osaka becoming hubs for HVO-powered hybrid power systems.

India's National Biofuel Policy offers streamlined approvals and tax incentives, enabling data centers in Mumbai and Chennai to transition to HVO and hydrogen fuel cells.

Singapore's Green Growth Strategy has positioned the city-state as a pioneer, with ST Telemedia Global Data Centres (STT GDC) leading the charge by deploying 50,000 liters of HVO across its facilities.

These policies are not just environmental mandates but also economic enablers. Governments are offering preferential financing and subsidies for biofuel blending, offsetting HVO's current 10–30% price premium over diesel. For instance, Australia's push for decarbonization has spurred partnerships between data centers and biofuel producers like Neste and TotalEnergies, who are scaling production in response to demand.

Infrastructure Expansion: Scaling Biofuel Production for Digital Resilience

The scalability of HVO infrastructure is being validated by strategic investments and partnerships. In 2025, Neste, Repsol, and Shell have expanded their HVO production capacities in Singapore, Japan, and India, leveraging APAC's regulatory frameworks to meet the surging demand for backup power solutions.

Singapore's STT GDC has partnered with global biofuel producers to integrate HVO with on-site solar and battery storage, creating hybrid systems that reduce generator runtime and emissions.

India's GDS Services is transitioning its diesel generators to HVO and hydrogen, aiming for 100% renewable energy in its data centers.

Japan's energy firms are piloting HVO with microgrid systems, demonstrating its viability in grid-unstable regions.

These projects highlight HVO's role in addressing two critical challenges: energy security and carbon neutrality. As data centers face increasing uptime demands and grid instability in developing markets, HVO's long storage life and compatibility with hybrid systems make it a scalable solution.

Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

While feedstock supply constraints and infrastructure compatibility issues persist, technological advancements and policy support are mitigating these risks. For example, innovations in feedstock sourcing—such as using used cooking oil and tall oil—are reducing dependency on edible vegetable oils. Additionally, partnerships between data center operators and biofuel producers are streamlining supply chains and validating cost efficiencies.

Investment Opportunities: Biofuel Producers and Digital Infrastructure Players

The APAC HVO market offers dual investment avenues:

1. Biofuel Producers: Companies like Neste (NESTE.HEL), TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA), and Repsol (REP.MC) are expanding their HVO production in APAC, positioning themselves as key beneficiaries of the 10.17% CAGR.

2. Data Center Operators: Firms such as STT GDC and GDS Services are integrating HVO into their backup systems, enhancing their ESG profiles and operational resilience.

For investors, the focus should be on firms with strong partnerships in APAC and a clear roadmap for scaling biofuel infrastructure. Additionally, ETFs tracking renewable energy or green infrastructure in the region could provide diversified exposure.

Conclusion: A Cornerstone of the Green Digital Economy

The Asia-Pacific HVO for Data Center Backup Market is not just a niche segment but a cornerstone of the region's green digital infrastructure. With regulatory frameworks, corporate commitments, and technological integration aligning to drive adoption, HVO is poised to become the standard for backup power in a decarbonized future. For investors, this represents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on a market that is both scalable and mission-critical.

As the APAC data center market grows to meet AI-driven demand and global sustainability goals, HVO's role in ensuring reliable, low-carbon operations will only intensify.

KUCHING, Aug 25: Sarawak takes a unique approach to waste, materials or substances deemed no longer valid, by embracing the philosophy of ‘don’t waste the waste; monetise the waste’.

Speaking during the launching ceremony of the Centre for Technology Excellence Sarawak (CENTEXS) Lawas, streamed live with the Sarawak Public Communication Unit (UKAS) today, Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg used the example of oil palm kernel waste, which could be processed into livestock feed.

By doing so, he said, the kernel waste, together with Napier grass, would allow the State government to reduce its dependence on imported livestock feed.

This would produce more nutritious livestock feed, leading to healthier animals with greater weight gain, and since heavier animals have higher market value, this could bring greater profits to farmers.

At the same time, Abang Johari also said that biomass from palm oil waste could be made into biofuel, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“But to do so, we must have enough raw materials. That is why I have asked the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) to draft a law to mandate the collection of agricultural waste in the State.

“This is so that, in terms of volume, we can produce materials from waste to generate energy. Don’t waste the waste—monetise the waste,” he said.

Deputy Premier Datuk Amar Awang Tengah Ali Hasan; Sarawak Minister for Education, Innovation, and Talent Development Dato Sri Roland Sagah Wee Inn; Sarawak Deputy Minister for Food Industry, Commodities, and Regional Development Datuk Dr Abdul Rahman Ismail; and CENTEXS chairman Tan Sri Mohamad Morshidi Abdul Ghani were also present. — DayakDaily",https://i0.wp.com/dayakdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/premier-centexs-lawas-01.jpg?fit=800%2C533&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-25 06:56:24.451740

Indeed, corporates that had survived (and sometimes thrived) with drastically reduced business travel seemed hesitant to head full force back into the expense of travel.
Suppliers remarked consistently in earnings reports on the lagging recovery of transient business travel from large corporates.
Accor CEO Sebastien Bazin predicted international business travel would remain 20 percent reduced forever—he later publicly acknowledged that prediction was shortsighted.
(The omicron variant swept across the globe in January and February put an additional damper on optimism for robust winter business travel.)","Restarting business travel post-pandemic wasn’t a straightforward exercise in 2022. Pent up leisure travel had rocketed out of the gate spiking prices for airfares and hotels. According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. domestic airfares hit their post-pandemic height in 2022 at about $415 on average for Q2, Q3 and Q4 after falling to pandemic-era lows of under $300. Hotels were way up as well. Average daily rates were more than $148, up more than 13 percent over previous record highs in 2019 and up more than 43 percent from pandemic lows.

Rising prices also were attached to labor shortages across airlines, hotels, travel management companies, restaurants and more. Associated with that were rising wages that pushed costs and pricing up. Inflation—especially with food and fuel—was reducing margins. Travel customers of all stripes bore the brunt of some of those costs.

For managed travel, in particular, dissatisfaction with travel management company partners was on the rise. TMCs had been gutted in terms of travel agent staffing, and it was not easy to win those employees back. Many had retired or moved to other industries. Adding to the difficulty in revving up agency engines was the fact that travel remained very complex in 2022, with one TMC industry leader estimating that 40 percent of itineraries required agent service in some respect as compared to 10 percent prior to the pandemic. Frustration levels were high on both sides, with agencies eking out margin on depressed volume with increased servicing requirements.

Indeed, corporates that had survived (and sometimes thrived) with drastically reduced business travel seemed hesitant to head full force back into the expense of travel. Suppliers remarked consistently in earnings reports on the lagging recovery of transient business travel from large corporates. Accor CEO Sebastien Bazin predicted international business travel would remain 20 percent reduced forever—he later publicly acknowledged that prediction was shortsighted. (The omicron variant swept across the globe in January and February put an additional damper on optimism for robust winter business travel.) But there were a couple of rising stars in that commentary as well, becoming especially apparent by the second quarter:

Groups & meetings—Companies couldn’t get enough of getting their people together in 2022. They concentrated on smaller events after Zoom fatigue and other impacts of an extended period of remote work had turned into feelings of worker isolation, collaboration gaps and, in many cases, loss of loyalty to the organization.

In addition to reimplementing traditional meetings, companies had become well aware of the “Great Resignation,” which had been building since March 2021 and was in full force in late 2021 and going into 2022. Businesses were working hard to reinforce their cultures even as many workers continued to demand the convenience of remote work from day to day. Getting teams and some larger corporate groups together at offsites created opportunities to reinforce corporate bonds through shared experiences. Meeting space and other offsite event spaces were in high demand, but companies still felt the sting of meetings cancellations from Covid. The result was drastically shortened planning times combined with market compression. That, of course, led to higher prices.

It should also be noted that while the idea of ‘hybrid’ events remained top of mind for companies and travel managers, the shine was coming off the concept as companies realized how expensive hybrid events could be. Planners reported it was like organizing two separate events. Technologies like Hopin—which had reached Unicorn status in the depths of the travel downturn—began losing value and laying off workers as an industry thirsty for in-person human interaction pushed for real face-time.

Small & Midsize Enterprise Business Travel—While large enterprises overall were holding back on traveling at 2019 volumes, the small and midsize business sector was leaning into full travel mode. Hotels and airlines alike reported the return of the SME sector to business travel en masse and many travel suppliers shifted their business travel focus to that sector, which in large part was—and still is—unmanaged. Travel management companies—including the megas—began making concerted moves to attract and serve that market as well. Loyalty programs were at the center of those efforts as travel suppliers looked to woo travelers themselves. Give it another year, and you’ll see new SME-focused business programs roll out from a number of major suppliers.

American Express Global Business Travel completed its acquisition of Egencia in November 2021 and through 2022 began reformulating its strategy around shifting the growing SME segment to managed channels. CTM continued its SME acquisitions in 2022, buying 1000 Mile, as specialist in the market, after taking over U.S. midmarket specialist Travel & Transport in 2021. Both Travel Perk and Navan (then still known as TripActions), whose business models had already attracted primarily SME customers, were making major acquisitions. After acquiring Reed & Mackay in 2021, Navan went on a European tour picking up TMCs in Sweden and Germany in 2022 and launched its ToGo platform with Lufthansa. The TMC attracted a $300 million investment and filed initial paperwork to public, but held back on the latter. TravelPerk, after acquiring NexTravel and Click Travel in 2021, raised another $115 million and increased its valuation to $1 billion.

Sustainability

In the industry push to return to full travel volumes, the simultaneous rise of sustainability efforts in organizations across the gamut made for an odd bedfellow. Travel suppliers—particularly airlines—were at the center of the sustainability dialog and it’s hard to overstate the unprecedented number of announcements coming from the travel industry in 2022 about their sustainability efforts.

Hertz was among the most dramatic, investing in a huge purchase of electric vehicles and pledging to support the development of a cross-continent charging grid. The car rental company announced at the tail end of 2021 that it had made a deal to buy 100,000 Telsas to add to its fleet. It would take that delivery over time, and by 2024 EVs would make up 20 percent of its fleet. The company said it would make a huge investment in the U.S. charging grid as well. Within a couple of years, however, the deals would languish and Hertz would announce fleet sell-offs for its EVs.

Airlines were pledging to buy sustainable aviation fuel at outstanding rates; they were investing in refineries and working up schemes to ensure corporate clients were able to buy into shared purchases. On the other hand, companies like Shell, Accenture and Amex GBT were looking for ways to certify and track those SAF purchases to ensure that purchases were credited to the buying companies, but also by design aggregating corporate customer demand and allowing airlines to access that demand in one place.

Indeed, TMCs made themselves central to the sustainability efforts of their clients. In a depressed travel volume environment, focusing on carbon emissions data, reporting and consultation was one way TMCs could produce another revenue stream, but also clients were clamoring for the data. The European Union spent 2022 passing the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which eventually would require businesses of a certain size to offer a numeric value for carbon emissions, specifically for business travel. As a result, the industry reacted with a flurry of partnerships with the likes of Thrust Carbon, Chooose and Squake for carbon calculation capabilities. How that number might then inform programs that would reduce carbon emissions would be the next step—some companies made huge strides toward mitigating carbon emissions associated with travel. To date, those reductions have been tied to reduced travel and/or changing travel modalities from air to rail, particularly in Europe.

In the U.S., at least, the Biden Administration had baked sustainability initiatives and incentives into both its Inflation Reduction Act and its infrastructure bill that laid down foundational plans for an EV charging grid, enhanced rail services and other large-scale projects as well as incentives for states, businesses and individuals to make their own investments to reduce climate change. Politically and practically, such moves became untenable in the U.S. when Donald Trump was elected back into office and stopped many of the initiatives that Biden put in motion—at which points corporations themselves became quieter about what green initiatives they might be funding or participating in. The EU, for its part, also pushed back the dates for companies to begin reporting their carbon emissions.

Technology & Distribution

New Distribution Capability announcements continued to trickle down the pike in 2022, but none were as breathtaking as American Airlines’ December announcement that it would remove 40 percent of its inventory from EDIFACT channels by April 1, 2023, and that agencies would be required either to connect with the airline directly or consume, display and enable purchasing via New Distribution Capability content by that date or risk losing access to the content.

The response to the announcement varied from agency to agency. For many, however, it meant taking their focus off improving call center technologies and agent servicing levels and shifting those resources to solving for a looming NDC cutover on April 1. The move engendered resentment from agencies, and when American made good on its promise come April, the industry response was negative overall.

Despite understanding American’s desire to reduce distribution costs and increase control over retailing—and admitting that the hardline stance would force the industry to advance—agencies were critical of the carrier’s lack of specific guidance on its requirements for agencies to retain their “preferred” status and what that status delivered. While many agencies were able to offer booking for NDC content, most were unable to service that content on the launch date. Buyers responded by pushing travelers to other airlines, a move that ultimately would punish the carrier significantly in terms of earnings. American in 2023 would make more changes to its approach to corporate clients—many of which would not go well.

Also, in November 2022, openAI would launch ChatGPT. BTN did not report on it at the time, but its availability and the launch of additional large language model artificial intelligence would change the trajectory of business travel’s future.

Conclusion: A Resilient Aviation Leader Lufthansa's strategic resilience lies in its ability to adapt to macroeconomic shifts while maintaining a long-term vision for sustainability and profitability.","The European aviation sector is navigating a complex landscape of macroeconomic shifts, regulatory pressures, and evolving consumer demand. Amid this uncertainty, Lufthansa Group has emerged as a standout player, leveraging strategic operational reforms, fleet modernization, and a keen understanding of macroeconomic tailwinds to position itself for long-term resilience. For investors, the airline's 2023 recovery and 2024–2025 strategic initiatives present a compelling case for a recovery play in a sector poised for renewed growth.

Operational Turnaround: A Foundation for Sustainable Growth

Lufthansa's 2023 performance underscored its ability to adapt to post-pandemic dynamics. The airline expanded capacity by 16% year-on-year, reaching 84% of 2019 levels, while achieving a 15% revenue increase to €35.4 billion. Adjusted EBIT surged 76% to €2.68 billion, driven by robust MRO segment growth and improved unit revenues. This turnaround was not merely a function of demand recovery but a result of disciplined cost management and operational efficiency.

The airline's 2024–2025 strategies further reinforce this momentum. A focus on reducing fixed costs, streamlining fleet complexity, and enhancing customer-centric services has created a more agile business model. For instance, Lufthansa's shift to a point-to-point model via Lufthansa City Airlines at Frankfurt and Munich hubs has improved route profitability while catering to leisure travelers—a segment showing sustained demand.

Fleet Modernization: Fuel Efficiency and Environmental Leadership

A cornerstone of Lufthansa's strategy is its systematic fleet renewal. Since 2022, the airline has integrated fuel-efficient aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 into its long-haul operations, replacing older models. These aircraft reduce fuel consumption by up to 25% compared to their predecessors, directly lowering operating costs and carbon emissions. By 2025, the A350 and 787 are expected to account for 30% of the long-haul fleet, a move that aligns with both economic and environmental priorities.

Lufthansa's commitment to sustainability extends beyond hardware. The airline has set science-based targets to reduce net carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 (vs. 2019 levels) and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Initiatives like the “R strategies” (reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, replace) and the introduction of Green Fares—allowing passengers to offset emissions via sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchases—position Lufthansa as a leader in the industry's decarbonization efforts.

Macroeconomic Tailwinds: Fuel Prices, Demand, and Regulatory Shifts

The European aviation sector is benefiting from favorable macroeconomic conditions. Jet fuel prices, a critical cost driver, have declined by 13% in 2025 compared to 2024, averaging $86 per barrel. This reduction, coupled with improved load factors (projected at 84% in 2025), has bolstered profit margins. For Lufthansa, fuel now accounts for 25.8% of operating costs, down from 26.4% in 2024—a modest but meaningful improvement.

Regulatory trends, however, present both challenges and opportunities. The EU's mandate for 2% SAF blending by 2025 has increased compliance costs, with suppliers charging “compliance fees” to cover potential expenses. While this adds short-term pressure, Lufthansa's early investments in SAF partnerships and its MRO segment's expertise in sustainable technologies position it to navigate these hurdles. The airline's ability to balance regulatory compliance with cost efficiency will be critical in maintaining its competitive edge.

Strategic Positioning in a Fragmented Market

Lufthansa's multi-airline model—comprising Lufthansa Airlines, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings—allows it to target diverse market segments. Premium carriers like Lufthansa and SWISS focus on high-frequency, high-yield routes, while Eurowings' low-cost model addresses price-sensitive travelers. This diversification mitigates risks from sector-specific downturns and enhances overall resilience.

Moreover, Lufthansa's joint ventures with United Airlines, Air Canada, and ANA have expanded its global reach, particularly in Asia—a region expected to drive 40% of global air travel growth by 2030. These partnerships not only enhance connectivity but also provide access to high-growth markets, reinforcing Lufthansa's long-term value proposition.

Investment Thesis: A Recovery Play with Long-Term Potential

For investors, Lufthansa represents a unique opportunity at the intersection of cyclical recovery and structural transformation. The airline's 2023 financials—€1.67 billion net income and a 7.6% EBIT margin—demonstrate its ability to generate returns even in a volatile environment. Its 2025 Q1 results further validate this trend, with adjusted EBIT improving to -€722 million (from -€849 million in 2024) and net debt declining to €5.3 billion.

While challenges remain—such as supply chain bottlenecks and the high cost of SAF—Lufthansa's proactive strategies, including fleet modernization and digital innovation, provide a buffer against headwinds. The airline's focus on customer experience (e.g., Lufthansa Group Travel ID for personalized services) and operational efficiency (e.g., automation of flight irregularity management) also enhance its ability to retain market share.

Conclusion: A Resilient Aviation Leader

Lufthansa's strategic resilience lies in its ability to adapt to macroeconomic shifts while maintaining a long-term vision for sustainability and profitability. As European aviation recovers and demand for air travel continues to grow, the airline's operational discipline, technological investments, and regulatory foresight position it as a prime candidate for sustained outperformance. For investors seeking exposure to a sector poised for growth, Lufthansa offers a compelling case—a recovery play with the potential to deliver both near-term returns and long-term value.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-25 06:56:32.005231

Syngas-based FT CANS technology can play a key role in realising this ambition.","Relying on a single feedstock for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is not a realistic option. The amount of SAF needed for the aviation sector to meet the growing number of mandates and targets globally will require contributions from all feedstocks and multiple process routes. To date, the focus has been on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from used cooking oil. However, the availability of this feedstock is limited, with around 80% of that used in the EU being imported.

Although regions such as the US, Europe, and the UK have led the way with mandates and incentives for SAF production, attracting feedstocks from around the world, this reliance on imports poses a significant threat to meeting SAF targets, especially as other regions inevitably set their own goals. Relying too heavily on HEFA and imported feedstocks is not a long-term solution.

Diversification of feedstocks is vital for resilience

Feedstock diversification is essential for building resilience within the biofuels industry. Relying on a single type of feedstock may leave fuel suppliers vulnerable to market volatility and supply chain disruptions in an emerging market. Fuel suppliers, who are the obligated parties under mandates in the EU and UK, are expected to meet SAF targets in multiple regions, including the USA, Japan and a growing list of others. By incorporating a variety of feedstocks, both fuel suppliers and countries can take greater control of their own supply and ensure access to SAF from domestic feedstocks.

Unlocking SAF at scale through feedstock diversity

The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, based on a syngas platform, is an ASTM-approved route for producing synthetic SAF blendstocks. Syngas is a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) and the FT process builds the hydrocarbon chains needed for SAF. Syngas can be produced from a huge range of feedstocks, such as municipal solid waste (MSW), waste biomass, and captured carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (when combined with H2). Companies such as Johnson Matthey (JM) are leading the way in delivering syngas technology and the leveraging the versatility provided by the FT route to enable scalable SAF production.

FT CANS: A step-change in Fischer Tropsch technology

The FT CANS, the technology developed by Johnson Matthey and bp, marks a significant advancement in FT technology. The combination of reactor design and innovative catalyst offers several technical benefits that enhance the efficiency and scalability of the FT process:

The FT CANS technology utilises a modular reactor design that reduces the amount of catalyst required, lowering capital costs by approximately 50% compared with traditional fixed-bed FT systems. The modularity also allows for easy scalability, enabling plant sizes to match available feedstock quantities. Our largest announced project to date is expected to deliver a capacity of 13,000 barrels per day when operational.

Heat management is critical in the highly exothermic FT process. The FT CANS reactor features a unique configuration that improves heat transfer and control. As a result, the system boasts high conversion rates, with CO conversion efficiencies exceeding 90%. This is achieved via an innovative radial flow design that maximises contact between syngas and catalyst, facilitating efficient mass transfer and boosting productivity and selectivity towards desired hydrocarbon products.

Conclusion

Processing eligible feedstocks for SAF production not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also yields economic benefits. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the use of SAF can reduce net carbon emissions by over 80% across its life cycle compared with fossil-derived jet fuel.

Adopting a diverse range of feedstocks for fuel production offers a long-term solution for creating synthetic fuels and meeting the increasing SAF targets worldwide.

Overall, harnessing feedstock diversity is a critical enabler for producing synthetic fuels at scale. Syngas-based FT CANS technology can play a key role in realising this ambition. As the industry evolves, collaboration between governments, industry stakeholders, and research institutions will be vital to unlock the full potential of feedstock diversity for SAF.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/syjnmhg5/paul-ticehurst.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134005831265130000,N,,2025-08-25 06:56:35.627287

“This multinational is enticed by the constantly growing flights of ultra fast fashion players.","Lufthansa Cargo, the European leader in air freight and the freight division of Lufthansa Group, has committed to ensuring the international delivery of ultra fast fashion brand Shein’s items, by progressively using sustainable aviation fuel.

This agreement illustrates the paradox between political regulation and economic interests. It has already drawn criticism from the Fédération Française du Prêt à Porter Féminin (FFPAPF).

A memorandum of understanding (MoU), signed on August 19, 2025, indicates that within the next six months, the two partners must define and implement concrete actions.

Supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a fuel produced from renewable raw materials (used oils, agricultural residues, waste, biomass, or even e-fuels based on green hydrogen and captured CO₂).

Strengthening the traceability of operational and environmental data. The stated objective is to provide transparency on the environmental and logistical impact of air transport for Shein’s items.

Political will and economic stakes

This agreement, as the press release states, “establishes Lufthansa Cargo as a central player in the logistics of Shein’s items”. However, on January 29, 2025, the German government officially announced a comprehensive action plan to regulate online commerce, aligning with the action taken by the European Commission.

The paradox lies in the gap between the stated political objective of regulating ultra fast fashion players and the economic realities of large groups that rely on these same platforms to develop their business.

Beyond freight transport, the group carried over 130 million passengers in 2024 (source: Lufthansa Group’s 2024 annual report).

Greenwashing according to the Fédération Française du Prêt à Porter Féminin

“We are witnessing the worst kind of hypocrisy: how does transporting polyester and disposable products with kerosene that consumes less CO₂ make them more ecological?” Yann Rivoallan, an outspoken critic of ultra fast fashion and president of the FFPAPF, told FashionUnited. “It is, pardon my French, ‘putting lipstick on a pig’”.

“This multinational is enticed by the constantly growing flights of ultra fast fashion players. To give themselves a clear conscience or to meet certain standards, they dare to use the weapon of greenwashing.

There are three main ways of meeting the EU RFNBO targets: e-fuel use in the transport sector, green hydrogen use in fuel-cell vehicles and green hydrogen use in the refining process.
The European Commission launched its European Hydrogen Bank in 2023 to support domestic production of green hydrogen.
By producing their own green hydrogen, refiners can guarantee offtake and overcome a significant challenge facing many other project developers.
This is critical to low-carbon hydrogen demand growth, but it depends on the provision of national subsidies for green hydrogen development.","Low-carbon hydrogen has gained momentum over the past decade, driven by climate targets and supportive policy frameworks. Project development is stalling, however, as buyers baulk at stubbornly high costs and expensive long-term supply agreements.

Somewhat ironically, European oil refining could hold the key to unlocking demand growth. Even as growth in electric vehicles across the continent continues to erode road-transport fuel demand, European Union (EU) regulations are forcing the bloc’s beleaguered refiners to decarbonise faster than anywhere else.

Low-carbon hydrogen also offers help to the hard-to-decarbonise marine and aviation sectors. Electrolytic green hydrogen’s ability to deliver almost carbon-free hydrogen through renewables means that EU regulations – and subsidies – broadly favour it over blue hydrogen, which uses carbon capture and storage to cut emissions from fossil-fuel feedstocks.

Consequently, European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation. Numerous green hydrogen projects have already targeted the sector. Of the 6 Mtpa of low-carbon hydrogen capacity that has taken a final investment decision (FID), European refineries have already committed more than US$5 billion of capital.

The investment case for these projects has been boosted significantly by the latest revision of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), which is helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally. Other EU policies to speed up the decarbonisation of the maritime and aviation sectors pave the way for sustained future demand growth.

Current policy will only take the sector so far, however. The cost of green hydrogen production must continue to fall, while regulation will need to go even further to fully kick-start demand. If these hurdles can be overcome, European refiners could play a critical role in scaling up the green hydrogen industry.

This comes at a cost, however. European refiners have been part of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for more than a decade and are charged for the CO2 they emit beyond a certain free allowance. This allowance will gradually be eliminated over time, raising the cost for refiners. Producing green hydrogen on site using renewable-powered electrolysis would eliminate many of those CO2 emissions and, hence, emission-related carbon costs.

The rising burden of emissions costs has promoted energy-efficiency initiatives and made the idea of producing on-site green hydrogen more appealing. However, high European electricity costs have stymied this to some extent. So, to promote the broader adoption of green hydrogen, governments must consider bold policy initiatives and incentives , such as investment subsidies and favourable financing.

The EU policy solution

The EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED) aims to drive reductions in the energy sector’s carbon emissions by increasing the contribution of renewable sources. The latest iteration, RED III, provides essential support for green hydrogen adoption , as it seeks to promote ‘renewable fuels of non-biological origin’ (RFNBOs) ‒ that is, liquid or gaseous fuels that derive no energy content from biomass. Green hydrogen is deemed an RFNBO if it meets strict EU sustainability and traceability criteria.

There are three main ways of meeting the EU RFNBO targets: e-fuel use in the transport sector, green hydrogen use in fuel-cell vehicles and green hydrogen use in the refining process. The EU uses “multipliers” in its RED III accounting methodology. The actual RFNBO content is accounted for at higher levels, promoting use in those sectors with the highest multipliers, such as e-fuels for aviation and maritime, followed by refining. Because of the high cost of e-fuels and limited uptake of fuel-cell vehicles, the refining route is currently the most suitable and achievable means of compliance.

We forecast European refiners will require around 0.5 million tonnes per year (Mtpa) of green hydrogen to comply with regulations. This would replace about 30% of Europe’s current refinery-based, CO2-emitting, purposely produced hydrogen – at a substantial investment of more than US$15 billion for the green hydrogen production capacity.

On paper, RED III bodes well for green hydrogen’s near-term growth in the European refining sector, at least once adopted into national legislation by the 27 EU member states. But much more is still required. RED III requires that RFNBOs account for only a minimum of 1% of the energy used by the transport sector by 2030. This share, low by any measure, is in large part an acknowledgement of the challenges involved in expanding RFNBO supply.

Locking in significant longer-term growth will require further action in three key areas: costs, technology and the wider regulatory environment.

Tackling costs to secure offtakers

The major hurdle for European refiners is the cost of producing green hydrogen , which remains significantly higher than for traditional hydrogen production units. Renewable electricity sourcing is the overwhelming driver of these high costs, though the levelised cost of renewable electricity in Europe is forecast to decline one-fifth by the end of this decade. Automated manufacturing, standardisation and efficiency improvements will also help drive cost reductions for electrolyser stacks.

Accessing low-cost renewables and operating electrolysers at high utilisation levels are essential, with the latest market signals offering encouraging signs. The European Commission launched its European Hydrogen Bank in 2023 to support domestic production of green hydrogen. The most recent auction results reveal how costs have changed since the pilot auction was awarded in 2024.

The average levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) across all bids from the second-round auction, which closed in February 2025, fell 18% to US$8.35/kgH2, with average bids in Germany falling more than 55%. The results also provide offtake prices that each end-use sector is willing to pay. Here, refineries were among the highest, at a weighted average of US$9.23/kgH2, demonstrating a willingness to pay a premium to meet regulatory mandates. Wood Mackenzie’s asset-level modelling of projects targeting the refining sector in Europe produces an LCOH of US$7.04 to US$8.30/kg – reinforcing the progress in this sector.

Cost reductions also hinge on ongoing project deployment, which should enable improvements in project delivery and operation. Critically, many European refiners are now looking to produce green hydrogen on site to decarbonise their refinery operations and supply fuels compliant with RED III. By producing their own green hydrogen, refiners can guarantee offtake and overcome a significant challenge facing many other project developers.

Technology risks and competing technologies

Developers continue to wrestle with contingency costs for these first-of-a-kind projects, with lenders, in turn, applying a risk premium. Reducing premiums relies on successful technology deployment and the developers’ ability to demonstrate timely commissioning and operational reliability. Accelerating the deployment of such capital-intensive technology is difficult, illustrating why government support is so essential early on.

Chinese-made electrolysers are competing with Western technology. Yet, to date, post-FID European projects have opted for Western electrolysers. Others, however, are weighing up the benefits of the upfront capital cost savings offered by Chinese alkaline electrolysers. Electrolyser manufacturers face stiff competition, which promises lower project costs, but it’s piling the financial pressure on many of them, with some already failing.

Green hydrogen is not the only route open to refiners, though, and alternative paths to decarbonisation are gaining traction. Carbon capture and storage will be more suitable for some. This can help to manage emissions across the broader refinery complex. It can also support a switch to blue hydrogen, although for European refiners, this will not directly contribute to their RED III targets.

Policy and regulatory uncertainty

The EU’s RED III legislation is an important part of the push to grow the green hydrogen economy in Europe, with both Repsol and TotalEnergies confirming in recent earnings calls that green hydrogen is the most competitive route to regulatory compliance. Member states have been slow to convert the ambition of RED III into national law, however, which has slowed green hydrogen project development across most of the EU. As of August 2025, national legislative adoption was as follows:

Figure 3: EU countries are dragging their heels on adopting RED III

The potential for green hydrogen to help cut emissions from refining while complying with RED III obligations is the strongest investment case at present, but green hydrogen can also deliver lower-carbon fuels to other transport sectors. Marine and aviation are already starting to make progress.

Decarbonising the maritime sector

The marine sector flies the flag for green hydrogen project development , though policy support, as ever, is required. Europe’s FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the imposition of carbon costs on shippers have helped to drive interest, with the added benefit of the multiplier for RFNBO-compliant hydrogen and its derivatives in the marine sector to meet RED III transport targets. Europe has also carved out €800 million from its latest Hydrogen Bank auction to support maritime supply projects.

The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework, published in April 2025, broadens interest globally. It introduces global greenhouse gas fuel intensity targets and a credit-trading system, with a fund potentially unlocking more than 80 Mtpa of hydrogen-derived fuels in the long term. However, under the current IMO pricing mechanism, it will take time for hydrogen-based fuels to be competitive with incumbent fuels, and further penalties or rewards will be required to displace fuel oil more quickly.

Project developers

Faced with high costs and uncertain market conditions, several major low-carbon hydrogen developers have scaled back their ambitions for the industry. This reflects a broader trend of project developers becoming more selective, prioritising capital efficiency and risk mitigation over expansive hydrogen portfolios.

At the same time, Shell, BP and TotalEnergies have all reaffirmed their commitment to decarbonising their European refining operations with green hydrogen. Companies must continue to pursue cost reductions, maximise capture of available government incentives and capitalise on future demand growth opportunities in fuel supply to the marine and aviation sectors.

Governments

The EU’s RED III regulation supporting green hydrogen use in the refining sector has led the way in terms of public-sector incentives. This is critical to low-carbon hydrogen demand growth, but it depends on the provision of national subsidies for green hydrogen development. To secure future growth, the EU must double down on its efforts to drive the sector and push member states to codify support into domestic laws and regulations . Pressure on national government budgets from rising defence spending and higher welfare and health costs risks a curtailment of subsidies to the low-carbon economy. Reaffirming commitment to these sectors will spur continued investment.

Markets

Europe has been the standard bearer to date, but other markets will need to lock in green hydrogen demand growth to help decarbonise liquid transport fuels. Wider refinery adoption needs three things to happen: lower renewable power prices, the imposition of a cost on carbon emissions and credits for the lower carbon intensity of greener products. To date, few markets outside Europe fit the bill.

Adoption in China is largely driven by government mandate and often lacks full green credentials. Low industrial power prices and competitive domestic electrolyser costs, however, are also helping to close the gap on hydrogen from reformed imported natural gas.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SEE-5-e1753113319320.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 06:56:56.979720

According to Travel Pulse Canada, Flair completed 99.3% of scheduled flights even in snowy January, followed by Porter at 98.4%, with Air Canada and WestJet both at 97.3%.
On top of being the most reliable air carrier in Canada, Flair uses Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its growing fleet of Boeing 737 jets.","On August 20, 2025, Flair Airlines has appointed three new executive leaders including Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) Eric Tanner. Tanner was interviewed by the Time On The Wing podcast just before his promotion and explained why he believes that not only does the ultra-low-cost-carrier (ULCC) model not apply to Flair but it doesn’t work in the North American market.

Flair was founded in 2005 and has been rapidly growing thanks to affordable airfares and reliable service. Tanner previously served as the vice president of revenue management and network planning and before that he was the director of network planning and scheduling.

More Than The Bare Essentials

Tanner specifically pointed our how Flair’s aircraft have the same number of seats as WestJet and its baggage policies are akin to that of Porter Airlines during his interview on the podcast that was produced with Visual Approach Analytics. WestJet has even launched a new airfare category dubbed “Ultra Basic” to compete with Flair’s prices.

One factor that Tanner hits on repeatedly in his explanation of the Flair model is the competition in Canada, and North America, that is much fiercer than what European ULCC’s like Ryanair face. That competition drives the quality of service up and makes the experience better for customers than the bare-bones flying style of Spirit, Frontier, Allegiant, Avelo, and others.

Flair no longer brand’s itself as a ULCC but it remains the low-cost leader for Canadian flyers. As Tanner remarked in one Linkedin post:

“As Canada’s only affordable airline left, Flair Airlines plays an essential role in keeping air travel affordable. We are excited to work with stakeholders across the industry to lower prices for our shared customers.”

Flair Airlines Pushing FWD

The services and amenities are certainly more spartan than Air Canada but for many travelers the price point is the only point of concern. Frugal Canadian flyers don’t need to worry about service disruptions thanks to the carrier’s excellent performance and policies. Flair is the only airline with an On-Time Guarantee (OTG) that compensates passengers if they arrive late by more than 60 minutes.

In April of 2025, Flair also launched the FWD platform as a comprehensive customer service portal with services like “Immfly” in-seat ordering for food and drinks and “iCoupon” meal credit redemption. Tanner also stated in his recent interview that the buy-onboard, duty-free shopping experience is comparable to waht Air Canada offers.

Growth is happening at the airline thanks to its popularity with suctomers. Other newly appointed leadership at Flair includes Caitlin Peddle as Chief People Officer (CPO) and Juliana Ramirez as Chief Digital Officer (CDO). All of the new executives are internal promotions, chosen for their record of contribution to the Flair’s success.

Grean, Clean, And Canada’s Most Reliable

Flair Airlines achieved a milestone in commercial aviation on April 22, 2025, when all 79 scheduled flights for the day successfully completed operations with zero delays or cancellations, achieving 100% on-time arrivals. According to Travel Pulse Canada, Flair completed 99.3% of scheduled flights even in snowy January, followed by Porter at 98.4%, with Air Canada and WestJet both at 97.3%.

On top of being the most reliable air carrier in Canada, Flair uses Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its growing fleet of Boeing 737 jets. The age of the twenty-strong fleet is very low, which means less emissions, thanks to eighteen 737 MAX 8 jets composing the bulk of the carrier’s aircraft.

Venice Airport’s bold sustainability strategy blends agrivoltaics, hydrogen, AI, and biodiversity protection, proving that the future of aviation must be innovative, integrated, and deeply human-centred. Head of Sustainability at Gruppo SAVE Group, Davide Bassano, tells International Airport Review.

As climate pressures mount and decarbonisation deadlines loom, airports around the world are searching for ways to accelerate their sustainability efforts. At Venice Airport (VCE) and its sister sites managed by SAVE Group, the approach is striking in both its scope and originality – spanning agrivoltaic solar energy, hydrogen-powered drones, AI for climate control, and even trained falcons for wildlife management.

Speaking with Davide Bassano, Head of Sustainability at Gruppo SAVE Group, one thing is immediately clear: they are treating the climate crisis not just as a technical challenge, but as an operational, environmental and human one.

Ambitious energy goals: agrivoltaics and hydrogen integration

The group has committed to achieving net zero by 2030 – a highly ambitious timeline – and it’s backing that pledge with action. “We fixed the target to be net zero within 2030, so it’s a very short time,” said Davide. “In the next master plan, we’ve already planned to dismiss any fossil fuel and to provide all energy demands of the airport with renewable power sources.”

One of the most innovative parts of this plan is a 68 MW agrivoltaic system – solar panels installed above land still usable for agriculture. “It seems quite smart, actually, because we don’t deplete any environmental value of the ground and at the same time we match the energy demands of the airport,” he explained. The project is currently undergoing environmental ministry approval.

The airport is also integrating hydrogen production on-site. Using surplus renewable energy, SAVE plans to power airport vehicles and local public transport. “Our idea is to make any connection with the airport provided by the local transportation company green,” said Davide.

Hydrogen drones and the future of airside logistics

SAVE Group is exploring the use of hydrogen-powered drones to deliver urgent medical supplies from Padua Airport to regional hospitals. These drones offer longer range and lighter weight than their battery-powered counterparts, and the hydrogen will be produced using solar-powered electrolysis.

But the main challenge isn’t the drone, the vertiport, or the electrolyser – it’s the regulatory framework. “We are dealing with urban traffic over the city centre and there are a lot of rules still missing,” said Davide. The goal is to conduct the first prototype flights in late 2026.

Biodiversity: where falcons and flamingos coexist with aircraft

Two new falcons have recently joined the staff at Venice Airport for deterrent action and removal of flocks of birds. So why do they use real birds instead of technology?

“It seems from the medieval age, but in fact they are very effective,” said Davide. “The use of falcon is very selective… they recognise the species, they act, and the result is the storm of birds around understand immediately that it is a forbidden area. There are other methods like the small guns, sirens or acoustic devices, but they are very disturbing for the rest of the biodiversity.”

What’s even more surprising is that some protected bird species are choosing the airport grounds as a rest and breeding area to get away from the urban activity of the city. “Once they have learned not to interfere with the airport operations they have their own area, and they rest, they reproduce… and it doesn’t seem to affect the safety of the operation. It reverts the paradox that the airport is a noisy, polluted area,” said Davide.

Climate adaptation: it’s about infrastructure – and people

One of the most forward-thinking elements of SAVE’s strategy is its recognition that climate change impacts human performance, not just infrastructure. In a 2024 assessment, they evaluated how extreme heat affects airport workers, particularly those on the apron. Airport workers were included as an “asset” in the assessment.

“If you need to work for eight hours in a terminal with 45 degrees, it’s quite heavy for our staff,” said Davide. The airport has introduced hydration stations, rest areas, and is researching protective uniforms, such as glasses and new types of hats.

We realised it’s important to also consider the human capital, the worker, and if their performance decreases because of climate change

They have also begun integrating occupational health and safety into their climate risk assessments. “We realised it’s important to also consider the human capital, the worker, and if their performance decreases because of climate change,” Davide said, noting that 40% of their operations rely on short turnaround times from local carriers.

AI and Scope 3: 30% energy savings already

To reduce Scope 3 emissions, Venice Airport is using an AI-powered terminal climate control system that anticipates passenger flows and adjusts temperatures accordingly. “We try to set the proper temperature using the forecast of people in the area,” said Davide. Since its implementation in late 2023, the system has saved almost 30% in energy. It’s now being rolled out at Verona Airport too.

Circular economy: incentivising better waste sorting

SAVE is promoting a circular economy through both infrastructure and behavioural nudges. A new pneumatic waste collection and sorting system has been deployed across its airports, and they have also started charging tenants based on the volume and type of waste they generate. “We count the number of the bins, and we invoice the service,” said Davide. “When you touch the pockets, you get immediate results!”

A holistic sustainability ethos

From smart infrastructure to sustainable transport, from protecting biodiversity to supporting the wellbeing of apron workers, Venice Airport’s strategy goes well beyond carbon calculations.

For sustainability professionals in airports worldwide, Gruppo Save’s approach is a powerful reminder: the future of aviation isn’t just electric or hydrogen – it’s integrated, humane and boldly inventive.

À ce jour, seuls 74 des 636 aéroports engagés dans le programme ont atteint ce niveau d’accréditation à l’échelle mondiale. Nous publions ci-dessous le communiqué (Photo : rb/www.imazpress.com)

L’aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros est le sixième en France et le deuxième dans la zone Afrique.

L’aéroport s’était engagé dans le programme ACA en 2018, obtenu l’accréditation de niveau 2 en 2019 et l’accréditation de niveau 3 l’année suivante. En 2023, la Société Aéroportuaire avait déjà réduit de moitié ses émissions (en tonnes équivalent carbone) par rapport à 2014, dans le périmètre de ses activités et de sa consommation d’électricité.

L’accréditation de niveau 4+ consacre le franchissement d’une nouvelle étape. L’aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros s’engage désormais dans une stratégie de décarbonation à long terme, conforme à l’Accord de Paris, en impliquant les partenaires de la plateforme sur la même voie. Un périmètre beaucoup plus large d’émissions est pris en compte, incluant la moitié de la consommation de carburants des avions desservant l'aéroport. La réduction des émissions générées par le trafic aérien exigera donc des efforts considérables.

L’ACA 4+ distingue les aéroports de niveau 4 qui, de plus, compensent leurs émissions résiduelles des scopes 1 et 2 en achetant des crédits carbones. L’Aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros a fait ce choix : pour compenser ses émissions, évaluées à 2.830 tonnes d’équivalent CO2 en 2024, il soutient un projet de réduction de consommation de bois de cuisson à Madagascar et un projet de reboisement pérenne en Ouganda. Plus de 50.000 euros ont été investis en 2025 dans ces deux opérations.

L’accréditation ACA 4+ n’est qu’une étape supplémentaire sur la voie de la décarbonation du transport aérien, à laquelle contribue l’Aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros. Elle consacre des efforts engagés depuis plus de dix ans par la Société Aéroportuaire pour réduire son empreinte environnementale, maîtriser ses consommations énergétiques et se doter de centrales photovoltaïques qui répondent aujourd’hui à près de 30 % de ses besoins.

La décarbonation de l’aviation est un défi forcément collectif, qui concerne en premier lieu les compagnies aériennes et les avionneurs. Les appareils devront être en mesure d’incorporer une part croissante de carburant durable (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF) dans le kérosène afin de tenir les objectifs fixés par l’Union européenne. L’aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros se prépare pour sa part à adapter ses installations de stockage de carburant de manière à pouvoir distribuer du SAF aux compagnies aériennes dès 2030.",https://imazpress.com/thumbs/1200x630/source/0942162001710496855.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 03:56:52.778195

Cette entente illustre le paradoxe entre régulation politique et intérêts économiques et suscite déjà les critiques de la Fédération Française du Prêt à Porter Féminin (FFFPAPF).

Un protocole d’accord (MoU - Memorandum of Understanding), signé le 19 août 2025, indique que, dans les six prochains mois, les deux partenaires doivent définir et mettre en œuvre des actions concrètes :

Approvisionnement en SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), carburant produit à partir de matières premières renouvelables (huiles usagées, résidus agricoles, déchets, biomasse, voire e-fuels à base d’hydrogène vert et de CO₂ capté).

Prise en compte officielle des volumes de carburant d’aviation durable consommés, certifiés par des « Proof of Sustainability ». Ces certificats sont basés sur des normes permettant de tracer et de documenter la réduction des émissions obtenues par rapport au kérosène conventionnel.

Renforcement de la traçabilité des données opérationnelles et environnementales, l’objectif annoncé étant de faire la transparence sur l’impact environnemental et logistique du transport aérien des articles Shein.

Quand volonté politique et enjeux économiques ne vont pas de pair

Cet accord, comme l’indique le communiqué, « inscrit Lufthansa Cargo comme acteur central dans la logistique des articles Shein ». Or, le 29 janvier 2025, le gouvernement allemand a officialisé un plan d’action complet pour encadrer le commerce en ligne et s’inscrit dans l’action menée par la Commission européenne.

Le paradoxe ? L’écart entre l’objectif politique affirmé de réguler les acteurs de l’ultra fashion et les réalités économiques des grands groupes qui s’appuient sur ces mêmes plateformes pour développer leur activité.

The new office will serve as Daher Aircraft’s Brazilian headquarters, handling customer relations, fleet support, and operational development for the two aircraft families. The announcement was made during LABACE 2025, Latin America’s largest business aviation event.

“With a booming private and utility aviation sector and increasing demand for aircraft that are both high-performance and useful, our TBM and Kodiak models are a perfect fit for Brazil’s operational needs,” said Nicolas Chabbert, General Manager of the Aircraft Division. “Establishing a local presence will allow us to better support our customers and underscores our commitment to contributing to the future of Brazilian aviation.”

Growing demand for versatile aircraft

Brazil’s aviation market has seen steady growth in recent years, fueled by economic expansion, infrastructure challenges, and a need for reliable air links to remote areas. According to Brazilian civil aviation data, business and utility aircraft movements have been trending upward, particularly in the country’s central and northern regions where ground connectivity is limited.

By basing a permanent team in São Paulo, Daher aims to shorten response times for maintenance and technical support while strengthening relationships with operators. The company said the office is the first step in a long-term strategy to grow its footprint in Latin America.

Strategic growth in Latin America

For Daher, the São Paulo office is part of a broader strategy to strengthen its position in key growth markets. The company, which also operates logistics hubs in North America and Europe, said it sees Latin America as a natural expansion area given the region’s geography and growing demand for both executive and utility aviation.

The move also places Daher closer to potential partners and clients in agriculture, charter operations, and public services, where rugged, reliable turboprops are essential for everyday operations.

With this investment, Daher positions itself to compete more aggressively in a region where manufacturers like Embraer and Textron have long dominated the turboprop market.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/08/Daher-TBM-and-Kodiak-aircraft.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 01:56:11.199085

Travellers who require additional baggage allowance, greater flexibility in flight changes, and refund options can choose our flex fares. Additionally, we also offer competitive group fares through our dedicated online group booking portal, making it easier for larger groups to plan and travel with ease.

For leisure travellers, we collaborate with trusted tour operators to develop attractive and affordable travel packages that highlight the appeal of both Nepal and Malaysia. We also offer our Bonus Side Trip program, which allows international passengers flying to Malaysia to add a domestic destination within Malaysia at no extra base fare—ideal for tourists who want to explore beyond Kuala Lumpur. By aligning our products and partnerships with the evolving needs of these two key segments, Malaysia Airlines remains committed to strengthening connectivity and enhancing the overall travel experience for passengers to and from Nepal.

Why is Malaysia Airlines not yet operating flights to Nepal’s newly opened international airports Gautam Buddha International Airport and Pokhara International Airport? Do technical, regulatory, or commercial considerations currently limit service there?

At present, Malaysia Airlines is focused on consolidating our operations from Kathmandu, where we operate 10 weekly flights to Kuala Lumpur. This allows us to optimise connectivity for Nepalese travellers across ASEAN and Australasia, while serving the continued growth in both labour and leisure segments.

We deeply appreciate the efforts by the Nepali authorities to expand aviation infrastructure, and we welcome their proactive engagement with international carriers. The opening of Gautam Buddha International Airport and Pokhara International Airport marks an important milestone in Nepal’s aviation landscape, and we recognise the long-term potential these airports represent. We continue to closely monitor the operational readiness and commercial viability of these new airports. As part of our ongoing network strategy review, we remain open to exploring future opportunities for expansion into additional points in Nepal when the timing and market conditions are aligned.

Are there ongoing discussions with Nepali authorities or airport operators about launching services to these new gateways? If so, what are the key challenges and timelines?

While we have not entered into formal discussions at this stage regarding operations to Gautam Buddha International Airport or Pokhara International Airport, we continue to monitor developments at both locations closely. Currently, our priority is to strengthen and optimize our existing 10 weekly services from Kathmandu, while enhancing onward connectivity to ASEAN and Australia via Kuala Lumpur. That said, we value the proactive efforts of Nepali authorities in expanding aviation infrastructure, and we remain open to exploring opportunities at these new airports as and when commercial, operational, and regulatory conditions align.

What digital innovations is Malaysia Airlines adopting to enhance customer experience in an increasingly online booking and travel environment?

Malaysia Airlines is undergoing a focused digital transformation aimed at elevating the end-to-end travel experience and meeting the evolving expectations of today’s connected travellers. We have invested in a mobile-first website and a user-friendly MH mobile app, enabling customers to book, modify, and manage their trips with ease—from seat selection and upgrades to meal preferences and real-time flight alerts. A major innovation being rolled out is our MHconnect in-flight Wi-Fi platform, which began progressive deployment from January 2025. This service offers complimentary Wi-Fi across all cabins, enabling passengers to stay connected, stream entertainment, and access digital content throughout their flight.

In addition, we are enhancing inflight entertainment systems, introducing digitally curated menus, and refining self-service features at airports to reduce wait times and improve convenience.

Looking ahead, we are investing in AI-driven personalisation to tailor offers and communication, biometric boarding and touchless check-in to streamline airport processes, and predictive service tools that will help us anticipate and respond to passenger needs proactively. Ultimately, these digital innovations are part of our vision to become a truly modern, digitally enabled airline—delivering both cutting-edge conveniences, with the hallmark warmth of Malaysian Hospitality.

We value the proactive efforts of Nepali authorities in expanding aviation infrastructure, and we remain open to exploring opportunities at these new airports as and when commercial, operational, and regulatory conditions align

Sustainability is a pressing issue in global aviation. How is Malaysia Airlines aligning its operations and fleet plans with environmental targets and carbon-reduction goals?

Sustainability is at the heart of Malaysia Airlines’ long-term vision. A key pillar of our strategy is fleet modernisation, which enables us to reduce emissions while delivering a better travel experience and stronger operational performance. We are progressively introducing next-generation aircraft such as the Airbus 330neo (A330neo) and Boeing 737-8, both of which offer significantly improved fuel efficiency, lower carbon emissions, and reduced noise footprints. The A330neo, for instance, delivers up to 14 percent greater fuel efficiency than its predecessor and features a refreshed cabin with enhanced comfort and inflight entertainment. The B737-8 enhances economics on short-haul routes while providing a quieter, more comfortable journey for passengers.

Tree-planting and other “offsets” that absorb carbon dioxide are offered by some airlines today, but there are worries about how reliable and permanent they are.
But green synthetic jet fuel has a guaranteed market, because of the EU rules, and a high price point that could get the nascent industry going.
Current DAC might cost about $500 per tonne of carbon dioxide, with a possible long-term target of $200.
A Dubai-London economy class return flight, with ticket price currently about $800, would emit about 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide.","Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways and other airlines are at the heart of the Gulf’s economic diversification plans. With few usable land links, the region’s emergence as a tourism and business hub flies on the wings of a jet. But they could hit turbulence: the push to cut the heavy carbon dioxide emissions from flying.

Air travel is perhaps unfairly demonised among activities that emit greenhouse gases. It contributes about 2.5 per cent of global emissions, less than the 8 per cent coming from cement or the 7 per cent from steel making.

But there are good reasons to worry about aviation’s carbon footprint. It generates additional global warming through contrails – the linear high-altitude clouds formed around jet exhausts under certain atmospheric conditions. Its pollution continues to grow fast, unlike some other sectors, possibly almost tripling by 2050. Private jets have come under harsh criticism in Europe because of their high per person emissions and perceived frivolous use by the rich, with calls for a ban.

And, unlike renewable or nuclear electricity generation, or electric road vehicles, low-carbon alternatives to petroleum-powered jets are not viable yet.

The issue will become more acute in the next few years. The huge and growing middle classes of South-East Asia, India and Africa are reaching levels of income where taking flights for pleasure and business becomes normal.

Supersonic flight may be returning to our skies, three decades or so after Concorde stopped operations. New technologies with less sonic boom and better fuel consumption could make it viable again. London to Dubai flights in three hours or so would be attractive to the wealthy and to top businesspeople.

But a modern supersonic flight would still burn two to three times as much fuel per person as a business class seat on a current wide-body jet.

Efficiency has crept up over the years, with today’s flights using half the fuel needed in 1990. These incremental gains can continue for a while. Tree-planting and other “offsets” that absorb carbon dioxide are offered by some airlines today, but there are worries about how reliable and permanent they are.

Yet, to meet international climate goals, all new aircraft delivered from the mid-2030s would need to be zero-carbon. That is only a decade away. How could this be achieved?

Electric aircraft on the drawing board today could manage short haul flights up to 500 kilometres, enough to connect Dubai to all the Gulf capitals other than Kuwait City. Such short routes, though, represent only a small per cent of overall emissions.

Longer distances would require dramatic advances in battery chemistries. More realistically, although there might be some savings from hybrid electric models, medium- and long-haul flights will continue to rely on chemical fuels well beyond 2050.

That means some combination of three things: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from biological materials, synthetic fuels that are practically equivalent to today’s jet fuel, or hydrogen.

SAF is already used today. Emirates has demonstrated A380 flights running entirely on SAF, and the UAE in 2023 announced a target to blend one per cent SAF into jet fuel by 2031. The EU has more aggressive requirements, requiring two per cent from this year, rising to 70 per cent by 2050.

But traditional pathways for making SAF either rely on waste feedstocks that will be in short supply, or on crops such as palm oil that contribute to deforestation.

A variety of chemical processes can turn hydrogen into near-perfect substitutes for kerosene. They are even superior: cleaner and less prone to form contrails. The hydrogen can be derived from water using renewable electricity, and combined with carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere.

Hydrogen could also be used directly as fuel. It emits only water vapour when burnt. Hydrogen contains a tremendous amount of energy for its weight, three times as much as jet kerosene, but it has low density, requiring large tanks. Entirely new aeroplanes and engines would need to be designed, tested and delivered, and a new hydrogen fuelling infrastructure set up. That does not seem likely to happen on the required scale before the 2040s.

But, whether SAF, synthetics or hydrogen, airlines and fuel suppliers are passing the buck to each other. Airlines complain there is not enough sustainable fuel on the market and that it is too expensive; fuel companies say they need long-term commitments to be able to invest in production.

One obvious solution would be to require private planes to move very quickly to zero-carbon flight. Their wealthy users can presumably afford it, and it would kick-start the market for SAF, synthetic fuels or more ambitious designs.

But for mass aviation, more scalable and affordable solutions are needed. This poses one risk and two big opportunities for the Gulf.

The risk lies between moving too quickly or too slowly. Too fast, and Gulf airports would lose custom either to competitors in the bloc or regional rivals such as Turkey. Too slowly, and they may weaken global climate efforts, and provoke a backlash from climate-conscious partner nations. They might, for instance, lose access to European routes, or face boycotts by tourists.

The first opportunity, by contrast, is to produce synthetic fuels. Demand for green hydrogen has grown much slower than Gulf states had hoped. But green synthetic jet fuel has a guaranteed market, because of the EU rules, and a high price point that could get the nascent industry going. The Gulf’s high-quality wind and solar resources, its open land, geographic centrality, and long experience in oil refining and petrochemicals, all make it a leading contender as a synthetic fuel provider.

The other opportunity is more controversial. Why go to the trouble of pulling carbon dioxide from the air just to make fuel? Planes could continue running on conventional petroleum-based jet kerosene, while offsetting its emissions entirely with the direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide. The offending carbon would then be permanently disposed of deep underground or turned into solid minerals.

Current DAC might cost about $500 per tonne of carbon dioxide, with a possible long-term target of $200. A Dubai-London economy class return flight, with ticket price currently about $800, would emit about 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Assuming that half of this could be saved with greater efficiency and SAF, the inclusion of DAC at future costs would bump up the ticket price by about a quarter.

That is expensive, but not insane. The Gulf’s exceptional energy and geological resources could make it a hub not just for luxury holidays, but for DAC too. That is an ideal way for both the oil and airline industries of the Gulf to keep flying high.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/SOKKIPG2XZBR7FD422QVZZTFLU.jpg?smart=true&auth=d54e4c6e6e8250bbb201f1838def28c829f7222b733e23ad27c422748f9876a6&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-08-24 23:56:47.296646
