Sustainable aviation fuel incorporates renewable carbon like biogenic waste and organic waste coming from used cooking oil or animal fats.","Simon Pouilly, International Sales Manager, TotalEnergies: I’ve always been fascinated by planes. In my head, you know, I said one day I will work close to the airlines. And now for two years I've been working in the aviation sector. I do care about the future. I think we all have to find a solution for lower emission energies. Energy is not just about fuel. It's about people, progress and finding the right balance. Reusing used cooking oil and animal fats will be part of this journey. My job is about selling sustainable aviation fuel, which is known as SAF, to the aviation sector. The key part of my role everyday is to respond to the needs of the clients. To work together with them to find solutions and reduce their carbon emissions. Aviation is evolving. What do you think about the partnership between TotalEnergies and Air France?

Antoine Laborde, Head of Fuel Procurement, Air France-KLM: Sustainable aviation fuel is starting to play a bigger role in the industry. In 2024, Air France-KLM bought around 100,000 tons of SAF, making Air France-KLM one of the biggest buyers of SAF of all of world airlines. As you know, aviation is under strong pressure in order to reduce its CO2 emissions. And yet, in 2024, just 0.3% of total aviation fuel was SAF. So it’s very important that all together, the airlines but also the fuel producers, will bring this knowledge, will communicate the importance of SAF so that we can reach our sustainability ambitions. Let me show you, come. The great thing about SAF is that you don’t need to change the aircraft, or to change the engine, or anything in the airport, and you get the CO2 benefits of using SAF.

Simon Pouilly: TotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company, primarily producing hydrocarbons while expanding its investment in lower carbon energies like sustainable aviation fuel. Welcome to the CRES. Sustainable aviation fuel incorporates renewable carbon like biogenic waste and organic waste coming from used cooking oil or animal fats. Today, aircrafts can be fueled with a mix of SAF and conventional fossil fuel up to 50% of the total blend. At the lab, we are working for the next generation of production based on agricultural waste and potential ethanol intermediates. Grandpuits used to be an oil refinery and TotalEnergies is investing to transform it to become a biorefinery. It will produce up to 230,000 tons of SAF per year from 2026. SAF reduces the life-cycle CO2 emissions by at least 65% compared to its fossil fuel equivalent.

Antoine Laborde: TotalEnergies will supply us with up to 1.5 million tons of SAF over the next 10 years. The commitment and consistency of TotalEnergies is at the heart of this great partnership.",https://totalenergies.com/sites/g/files/nytnzq121/files/styles/crop_landscape_ratio_9_5/public/images/totalenergies_cnbc-saison-5-episode-5-futur-en-vol_2025.png?itok=EMzMiN-m,N,,2025-07-10 16:13:34.731355

To date, all the SAF managed through Avelia has been supplied by Shell, but the companies now are opening it up to participation from other SAF suppliers as well.
Both corporations and airlines, as well as freight intermediaries, will be able to manage SAF purchases from other suppliers in the program.
""Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF,"" Shell Aviation president Raman Ojha said in a statement.

American Express Global Business Travel partnered with Shell and professional services company Accenture in 2022 to launch Avelia, a blockchain-powered ""book-and-claim"" platform through which travelers could pay for SAF even if it was not available at their departure airport.

As of the end of the first quarter of this year, more than 57 companies were participating in the program, and it had executed more than 900 ""retirements,"" the permanent assignment of benefits of a SAF purchase to a specific user. That represents more than 33 million gallons of SAF at 17 airport locations, which reduced carbon by more than 300,000 tons, according to the companies.

To date, all the SAF managed through Avelia has been supplied by Shell, but the companies now are opening it up to participation from other SAF suppliers as well. Both corporations and airlines, as well as freight intermediaries, will be able to manage SAF purchases from other suppliers in the program.

That will include a ""bring your own SAF"" model, in which airlines can manage their SAF portfolio in Avelia, bringing in purchases that otherwise would have been tracked offline, according to the companies. Avelia also is setting up a governance structure to enable that multi-party involvement.

""Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF,"" Shell Aviation president Raman Ojha said in a statement. ""We are proud to help enable broader participation and transparency in the sector’s efforts to reduce life cycle [greenhouse gas] emissions while supporting our customers in reaching their climate goals.""

SAF can cut life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions up to 80 percent compared with conventional jet fuel, but the International Air Transport Association estimates that SAF production this year will account for only 0.7 percent of total jet fuel production.

Three ads, shown on LinkedIn, Google, and Instagram between 22 November 2023 and 5 January 2024, were under scrutiny. They featured imagery of Aston Martin’s F1 car bearing Aramco branding and text highlighting research into “ultra-efficient hybrid internal combustion engines and advanced fuels.”

The Instagram video included a voice-over posing questions about innovation, emissions and reaching global net-zero targets.

Aramco responded by stating the ads were not promoting its broader activities or environmental record, but were specifically focused on its role in the F1 partnership and efforts to enhance vehicle performance. The company also noted it does not sell products directly to UK consumers and did not believe further environmental context was necessary.

The ASA agreed, stating the ads would be understood by viewers as highlighting research into performance-related technologies within a motorsport context.

The watchdog determined that while some questions in the ads, such as “How can we pioneer fuel that could lower emissions?”, implied environmental ambition. But it ruled that these were speculative and not positioned as factual claims about Aramco’s current operations.

In assessing the phrase “advanced fuels,” the regulator found it was used in a technical rather than environmental context and did not require further clarification in the absence of explicit green claims.

The decision comes despite the regulator’s recent track record of banning similar fossil fuel-linked campaigns for failing to include material information.

In recent months, the ASA has ordered high-street bank Lloyds to pull a social media campaign for implying climate credentials without acknowledging its fossil fuel financing. It also banned a Virgin Atlantic radio advert promoting sustainable aviation fuel, and a TotalEnergies campaign that claimed it was on the “road to carbon-neutral” while underplaying its ongoing fossil fuel operations.

Racing to net-zero

F1 is aiming to enable the use of 100% alternative, lower-carbon fuels in its race cars by 2026. The partnership between Aston Martin F1 team and Aramco aligns with this aim.

F1 has also set a 2030 net-zero target. It is striving for a 50% reduction in absolute emissions by this point and will offset the remaining residual emissions.

As the world’s largest oil producer, Aramco extracts more than 12 million barrels of oil and gas per day.

In 2024, the company invested more than $50bn across its portfolio, spanning traditional hydrocarbons and expanding renewable energy assets.

As part of its ‘energy transition strategy’, Aramco has committed to developing up to 12 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind capacity by the end of the decade.

The company has positioned its work in motorsports as a testbed for innovative technologies, including low-emission fuels and lighter automotive components, with potential applications beyond the racetrack.",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/AdobeStock_614584068_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 14:12:24.244491

Indian Oil Corp plans to temporarily shut down its 300,000 barrels-per-day diesel desulphuriser unit at its Panipat refinery for an upgrade. This upgrade aims to produce 30,000 metric tons per year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil (UCO). Indian Oil will also invite bids for a green hydrogen plant and a sustainable aviation fuel project.

Indian Oil Corp plans to shut its 300,000 barrels-per-day diesel desulphuriser unit at its Panipat refinery for an upgrade aimed at producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) next year, Arvind Kumar, its head of refineries, said on Thursday.

The overhaul of the diesel unit is scheduled for late this year or early next year, Kumar told an industry event in New Delhi.

India aims to have 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in aviation fuel by 2027, doubling to 2% in 2028.

The refinery's diesel output would not be hit due to the shutdown as the refiner has additional diesel hydrotreaters at the Panipat site.

The upgraded unit will process used cooking oil (UCO) to produce 30,000 metric tons per year of SAF, he said.

Live Events

Indian Oil, the country's largest refiner, will also look at upgrading some kerosene-producing units at other refineries to make SAF, he said.

He also said that Indian Oil will soon invite bids for a 70,000 tons-per-year green hydrogen plant and a sustainable aviation fuel project.

Indian Oil has already awarded a bid to build a 10,000 tons-per-year green hydrogen facility at the Panipat refinery to engineering major Larsen and Toubro. L&T will build and operate the plant and sell green hydrogen to Indian Oil at 397 Indian rupees ($4.64) per kilogram.

India has set a target for refiners to meet half of their hydrogen demand through green hydrogen by 2030, he said.

Puri detailed India’s strategy to manage the uncertain global energy scenario, which includes diversifying crude import sources from 27 to 40 countries, boosting domestic production, developing alternative fuels, transitioning toward a gas-based economy, and aiming to become a global refining hub by raising refining capacity to 310 MMTPA by 2028 and expanding petrochemical capacity to build a $300 billion industry by 2030.

Despite geopolitical challenges worldwide, India has managed to balance energy availability, affordability, and sustainability. It remains the only major economy to reduce fuel prices amid rising global oil costs. “Our target is to achieve energy independence by 2047 and reach Net Zero emissions by 2070,” he stated.

He highlighted India’s renewed push in hydrocarbon exploration, announcing the opening of 2.5 lakh sq km under the OALP Round-10. “With this significant move and the near discovery of a Guyana-scale oilfield in the Andaman Sea, India is undertaking one of its most ambitious exploration efforts under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our goal is to expand exploration acreage to 0.5 million sq km by 2025 and 1 million sq km by 2030,” he said.

This plan is backed by important policy changes, including the shift from a Production Sharing Contract system to a Revenue Sharing Model under HELP. Amendments to the ORD Act of 1948 aim to improve lease management, safety, and dispute resolution while integrating renewables into hydrocarbon projects. Furthermore, the reduction of ‘No-Go’ areas by 99% has opened over 1 million sq km for exploration, supported by initiatives such as the National Seismic Program, Andaman Offshore Project, Mission Anveshan, and the Extended Continental Shelf Survey.

As the world’s third-largest energy consumer with a demand of around 5.4 million barrels per day, India is positioned as both a key growth engine and a long-term stabilizer of global oil markets. “India will account for nearly 25% of the incremental global energy demand growth in the coming years,” he noted.

The Minister also emphasized the growing role of biofuels, mentioning the Global Biofuels Alliance, which now includes over 29 countries and 14 international organizations collaborating to scale up sustainable biofuels. Within India, the use of ethanol, compressed biogas (CBG), biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is accelerating as part of the country’s decarbonization plan. “India believes the global energy transition must be just, inclusive, and equitable. For 1.4 billion Indians and many more in the Global South, it must also guarantee development with dignity,” he added.

Puri also highlighted India’s inclusive approach to energy access. Over 103 million LPG connections have been provided to women from economically weaker households through the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana — the world’s largest clean cooking program — significantly improving energy access and public health.

As a result, LPG coverage in India has surged from 55% in 2014 to nearly universal access today. Despite a 58% rise in international LPG prices, beneficiaries of the scheme pay only $6–7 for a 14.2 kg cylinder — about 39% less than the $10–11 charged in July 2023 — thanks to substantial government support and oil marketing companies absorbing $4.7 billion in losses last year to keep prices affordable.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ANI-Hardeep-Singh-puri.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 14:12:31.903050

China’s Greater Bay Area ideal SAF hub: Cathay Pacific

Shanghai, 10 July (Argus) — China's Greater Bay Area (GBA) could become a global demonstration zone for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) within 2-3 years, said Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific's head of climate action Nikola Xing at the Sustainable Aviation Forum in Guangzhou today. The GBA's strategic advantage is its world-class airport cluster, which includes the Guangzhou Baiyun, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macau airports, as their proximity makes SAF deliveries easier, he said. The cluster is expected to generate demand for up to 15mn t/yr of jet fuel, but the proportion of SAF in this mix remains undetermined. Hong Kong is expected to set a SAF consumption target in 2025, but has not yet done so. Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has set a SAF consumption target for 2025 of 50,000t (1,000 b/d), but the country does not have a mandate for SAF usage yet. Cathay Pacific consumed 217.8t of SAF between 2016 and 2023 and aims to use SAF for 10pc of its total fuel consumption by 2030, Xing said. The airline also started using SAF to offset 10pc of emissions from staff duty travel starting from 2024. Cathay Pacific also aims to support the development of SAF technologies and signed an initial agreement with State Power Investment (SPIC) in 2023 to encourage the use of the power-to-liquid (PtL) pathway. Most SAF plants produce via the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway, but interest is growing in the alcohol-to-jet and PtL pathways.

Opec sees oil demand rising to 123mn b/d by 2050

London, 10 July (Argus) — Opec has raised its long-term oil demand forecast by nearly 3mn b/d, driven by stronger growth in India and the Middle East and a shifting policy landscape that it says is reinforcing fossil fuels' role in the global energy mix. ""There is no peak oil demand on the horizon,"" Opec secretary-general Haitham al-Ghais said in the group's latest World Oil Outlook (WOO), repeating a line he used in last year's edition and underscoring Opec's ongoing rejection of forecasts that see oil use peaking before 2030. Opec argues that such forecasts underestimate demand growth in developing economies and overstate the pace of the energy transition. The 2025 WOO lifts Opec's 2050 oil demand projection to 122.9mn b/d, from 120.1mn b/d in last year's WOO. Its 2040 forecast is revised up to 120mn b/d from 117.8mn b/d. The 2030 outlook is unchanged at 113.3mn b/d, but the group sees a steeper rise in demand in the later years of the forecast. While the overall trajectory remains consistent with last year's WOO, the new report places greater emphasis on policy recalibration in major economies. It highlights growing political resistance to decarbonisation targets — particularly in the US and parts of Europe — and said energy affordability and supply security are increasingly shaping national strategies. These shifts, Opec suggests, are slowing the pace of energy transitions and supporting continued oil demand growth. The 2025 WOO adopts a more cautious tone on electrification, citing infrastructure and cost challenges, and acknowledges the geopolitical effect of the US' second withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement — a development not covered in last year's edition. India leads the pack India makes the biggest single contribution to the long-term demand increase. Opec forecasts the country's oil use to more than double from 2024, to 13.7mn b/d by 2050. Demand in China, on the other hand, rises in the medium term but flattens after 2035, reflecting slower economic growth and rising electric vehicle uptake. OECD demand is projected by Opec to edge up to 46.6mn b/d by 2030 — from 45.7mn b/d in 2024 — before entering a steady decline. By 2050, it is put at 37.2mn b/d, led by sharp reductions in Europe's transport and residential sectors. The sectoral breakdown remains broadly unchanged from last year. Road transport, petrochemicals and aviation account for most of the demand growth between 2025 and 2050. Oil use in road transport is forecast to rise by 5.3mn b/d, aviation by 4.2mn b/d and petrochemicals by 4.7mn b/d. Supply to match demand On the supply side, Opec projects global liquids output at 113.6mn b/d by 2030 and 123mn b/d by 2050. It still expects US production to peak at just over 23mn b/d around 2030, before falling to 19.6mn b/d by mid-century. Non-Opec+ supply is seen plateauing in the 2030s, with Opec+ producers expected to meet most of the incremental demand, lifting their share of global supply to 52pc by 2050 from 48pc in 2024. Opec estimates $18.2 trillion of investment will be needed to meet oil demand through to 2050, up from $17.4 trillion in the 2024 report. Of the total, $14.9 trillion — more than 80pc — is allocated to upstream. The group reiterated that underinvestment could threaten future supply security and market stability. The report notes refining capacity is expected to keep pace with long-term demand growth, but warns of a potential short-term tightening later this decade as the rise in oil demand outpaces new capacity — particularly in Asia-Pacific.

US’ 50pc Cu levy unlikely to dent Japan’s metal output

Tokyo, 10 July (Argus) — The US' sweeping 50pc tariff on copper imports effective from 1 August is expected to have minimal impact on Japanese metal producers given limited shipments to the US market. The impact of the blanket 50pc tariff by the US government will be negligible, a domestic electric copper producer told Argus on 10 July, because the company primarily supplies copper products to Asian nations. There are virtually no shipments to the US market, it added. The company's selling prices are likely to remain stable given that most purchase agreements are locked in through term contracts, the firm said. The company has not yet received unexpected windfall orders following the White House's announcement of the tariff hikes. Another Japanese metal producer echoed this sentiment, saying that the US' tariff measure is unlikely to hit its operations given limited deliveries to the country. The firm owns stakes in a South American copper mine project but its copper offtake from the mine is not destined for the US market, reinforcing the limited direct impact from the tariffs. But the company expressed concerns over potential broader implications, citing uncertainty around Washington's definition of ""copper products"". The impact could be larger if the US government plans to enforce tariffs on a wider range of copper-based products. The producer's concern also lingers over potential indirect impacts from possible disruptions in the metal supply chain. The company ships processed copper products to Asian nations for further manufacturing in the region, but some of the final products are partly exported to the US market. The company could face challenges if these end-products fall under the new tariff, it added. Japan produced around 1.6mn t of copper ingot in 2024, up by 4.9pc from a year earlier, according to the industry group Japan Mining Industry Association and the Japan Mining Promotive Foundation. Around half of total domestic output is exported, with the majority going to Asian markets, according to a market participant.

Trump threatens 50pc Brazil tariff: Update

Updates with comments from Brazil's vice president Washington, 9 July (Argus) — US president Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 50pc tariff on imports from Brazil from 1 August, citing the ongoing trial of that country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump's letter to Brazil's president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, released on Wednesday, is one of the 22 that the US leader sent to his foreign counterparts since 7 July, announcing new tariff rates that the US will be charging on imports from those countries. But his letter to Brazil stands out for allegations of a ""witch hunt"" against Bolsonaro, who — much like Trump — disputed his electoral defeat and attempted to stay in office. Brazil's supreme court qualified Bolsonaro's actions in 2022 as an attempted coup, ordering him to stand trial. Trump said he will impose the 50pc tariff because ""in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections and the Fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans"". The latter is a reference to orders by judges in Brazil to suspend social media accounts for spreading ""misinformation"". Trump separately said he would direct US trade authorities to launch an investigation of Brazil's treatment of US social media platforms — an action likely to result in additional tariffs. Trump's letter to Lula also contains language similar to that included in letters sent to 21 other foreign leaders, accusing Brazil of unfair trade practices and suggesting that the only way to avoid payments of tariffs is if Brazilian companies ""decide to build or manufacture product within the US"". The Trump administration since 5 April has been charging a 10pc extra ""Liberation Day"" tariff on most imports — energy commodities and critical minerals are exceptions — from Brazil and nearly every foreign trade partner. Trump on 9 April imposed even higher tariffs on key trading partners, only to delay them the same day until 9 July. On 7 July, Trump signed an executive order further delaying the implementation of higher rates until 12:01am ET (04:01 GMT) on 1 August. Trump earlier this week threatened to impose 10pc tariffs on any country cooperating with the Brics group, which includes Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa. Lula hosted a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro on 6-7 July. Brazil vice president Geraldo Alckmin, speaking to reporters before Trump made public his letter to Lula, said: ""I see no reason (for the US) to increase tariffs on Brazil."" The US runs a trade surplus with Brazil, Alckmin said, adding that ""the measure is unjust and will harm America's economy"". Trump has justified his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs by the need to cut the US trade deficit, but the punitive duties also affect imports from countries with which the US has a trade surplus.

The company just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s got investors buzzing: a nearly $1 billion plan to build a network of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facilities to decarbonize the skies. Let’s dive into what’s driving this stock’s meteoric rise, what it means for traders, and the risks and rewards of jumping into this high-flying name.

The Catalyst: A Billion-Dollar Bet on Green Skies

XCF Global isn’t just talking the talk—they’re walking the walk when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel. Today’s press release laid out a bold vision: invest close to $1 billion by 2028 to crank out SAF, renewable diesel, and other eco-friendly fuels at multiple new facilities across the U.S. and beyond. This isn’t some pie-in-the-sky dream either; they’ve already poured $350 million into their New Rise Reno facility, which is up and running, producing SAF, renewable diesel, and naphtha since February 2025. That’s real revenue, folks, and the market’s clearly eating it up.

The plan includes three new U.S. sites—New Rise Reno 2, Ft. Myers, Florida, and Wilson, North Carolina—each designed to pump out 40 million gallons of renewable fuel annually. Add that to the existing Reno plant, and XCF’s eyeing a total capacity of 160 million gallons per year by 2028. They’re not stopping at home either; a partnership in Australia aims to bring their modular, patent-pending tech Down Under, tapping into a global market where over 2 billion people already live under SAF mandates, with that number expected to double by 2030. CEO Mihir Dange is swinging for the fences, saying, “We’re not simply dreaming about decarbonizing the aviation industry—we’re building it right now.” That’s the kind of gusto that gets Wall Street’s attention!

This news is a classic catalyst, folks. Big expansion plans, especially in a hot sector like clean energy, can light a fire under a stock. Posts on X are buzzing with excitement, with traders pointing to the 80%+ pre-market pop as a sign of momentum. But before you hit that buy button, let’s break down what’s at play here and how you can navigate this wild ride.

Why SAFX Is Soaring: The Green Fuel Revolution

So, why’s the market going gaga over SAFX? It’s all about timing and trends. The aviation industry’s under pressure to cut carbon emissions, and SAF—made from waste oils, green waste, and non-food crops—is a drop-in solution that doesn’t require airlines to swap out their fleets. Governments worldwide are rolling out mandates and tax credits to push SAF adoption, and XCF’s positioning itself as a first-mover in this niche. Their New Rise Reno facility is already churning out fuel, and with $350 million invested, they’ve got skin in the game.

The numbers tell a story too. XCF’s market cap, as of recent data, is around $125.66 million, with about 149.3 million shares outstanding and a tight free float of less than 20%. That low float can amplify price swings—when demand spikes, like today, there aren’t many shares to go around, so the price rockets. But here’s the flip side: that same low float can make the stock a rollercoaster when sentiment shifts. Volatility’s been a hallmark of SAFX, with a 52-week range from $1.51 to a jaw-dropping $45.90, and a beta of -3.71 signaling it moves in wild, unpredictable ways compared to the market.

The company’s also got a narrative that’s catnip for investors: clean energy, job creation (60 full-time jobs in Reno already), and a scalable model with modular plant designs. Their international push, starting with Australia, shows they’re not just a one-trick pony. But let’s not get too starry-eyed—there’s plenty of risk here, and we’ll get to that in a sec.

Trading in Today’s Market: Lessons from SAFX’s Surge

XCF’s monster move is a textbook case of how news can drive a stock. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just dipping your toes in, here’s what this kind of action teaches us about navigating the markets:

Tap here to join over 252,000 traders getting free AI-powered trade alerts and tips sent straight to your phone. These alerts can help you spot opportunities across the market, though they’re not specific to SAFX.

Volatility Is a Double-Edged Sword: SAFX’s 80%+ jump as of this writing is thrilling, but its history of swinging from $1.51 to $45.90 shows it can be a wild ride. Low-float stocks like this can spike fast but also drop just as quickly if the hype fades. Always know your risk tolerance before diving in.

Do Your Homework: XCF’s got a compelling story, but digging into their financials reveals challenges. Their last quarter showed a net income loss of $1.43 million, worse than the prior quarter’s $314,000 loss. With only three employees and disputes with their Reno facility’s landlord and lender, there are red flags. Check filings, read the fine print, and don’t just chase the headlines.

Timing Matters: Early movers in pre-market trading often set the tone for the day, but momentum can fizzle. If you’re eyeing SAFX, watch how it trades after the opening bell. Big pre-market gains can lead to profit-taking, so don’t assume the party lasts all day.

Think Long-Term: As a wise trader once said, “Small gains add up over time; focus on building wealth gradually, not chasing jackpots.” SAFX’s story is exciting, but trading isn’t about one big score—it’s about consistent, disciplined moves.

Risks and Rewards: Is SAFX a Golden Ticket or a Turbulent Flight?

Let’s talk turkey about SAFX’s potential. On the reward side, XCF’s in a sweet spot. The global push for net-zero emissions means SAF demand is set to soar, and XCF’s already producing fuel while others are still planning. Their modular plant design could let them scale fast, and the $1 billion investment plan signals ambition. If they execute, they could grab a chunk of a growing market, especially with partnerships like the one in Australia. A successful expansion could mean big revenue growth, and for a small-cap stock, that’s the kind of story that can drive multiples higher.

But don’t get blinded by the green glow. The risks are real. XCF’s financials are shaky—those net losses aren’t pretty, and their tiny employee count raises questions about operational capacity. Disputes with their landlord and lender over the Reno facility could disrupt production or drain cash. The stock’s volatility is a gut-check; a beta of -3.71 means it doesn’t just dance to its own tune—it’s doing a full-on breakdance. Plus, SAFX doesn’t pay dividends, so you’re banking on price appreciation, which is never guaranteed. And let’s not forget the broader market—economic shifts, regulatory changes, or a drop in oil prices could mess with SAF demand.

Then there’s the execution risk. Building three new plants and going international sounds great, but $1 billion is a big number for a company with a $125 million market cap. They’ll need to raise cash, likely through debt or dilutive stock offerings, which could spook investors. The SEC filings also warn about regulatory hurdles, competition, and the risk of not meeting Nasdaq’s listing standards. This isn’t a slam dunk, folks.

The Big Picture: Why SAFX Matters for Traders

XCF Global’s surge today is a reminder that the market loves a good story, especially one tied to a megatrend like clean energy. But it’s also a wake-up call to trade smart. Stocks like SAFX can be a trader’s dream—big moves, big potential—but they’re also a minefield of risks. Whether you’re bullish on their SAF mission or skeptical of their financials, the key is to stay informed and nimble.

BBC News, Bristol

Plans to expand Bristol Airport to 15 million passengers a year will be ""destructive"" to the climate and pose health risks, a councillor has said.

Under the proposals, the airport's runway will be extended and flights to the US and the Middle East, including additional late-night services, will be introduced.

Bristol Airport said the move was in response to a ""growing demand"" for travel, and would boost job opportunities and economic growth in the region.

But speaking at a council meeting, councillor Izzy Russell said: ""Time and time again we have made it clear that expansion is not wanted or needed.""

Two years ago, the airport won permission from the High Court to expand from 10 million to 12 million passengers per year, although this has yet to be implemented.

At a Bristol City Council meeting on Tuesday, the majority of councillors formally opposed the airport's new plans, the Conservative members backed them, and Labour councillors abstained from a vote.

However, the decision on granting planning permission will ultimately be taken by North Somerset Council, as the airport falls within its patch.

Green councillor Ms Russell, who tabled the motion, explained the symbolic vote served as ""a sign of solidarity"".

""This airport expansion is not just a destruction of our environment, it represents the erosion of democracy,"" she said.

Ms Russell cited concerns with congestion, noise pollution at night, carbon emissions, health risks and ""precious wildlife being increasingly encroached upon"".

She added that ""sustainable aviation fuel"" only makes up a small percentage of total aviation fuel, and electric and hydrogen planes are unfeasible anytime soon.

But according to Labour councillors, in the event the airport does not expand, people will still want to fly to America or the Middle East.

They will just do so from London instead, resulting in more emissions.

""The world is heating up, we are in a climate emergency, and the airport is a big contributor to emissions,"" Labour councillor Susan Kollar said.

""But I'm not convinced that stopping one regional airport from expanding is the best way to reduce emissions.

""We need to decarbonise air travel and the best way to do this is tackling demand and providing alternatives.""

She also suggested the government roll out a frequent flyer levy to discourage excessive flying.

A Bristol Airport spokesperson said the plans have been published following an ""extensive consultation with local communities and businesses"".

""The airport is vital in providing a gateway for visitors to explore the South West – supporting the tourism sector that many local businesses and attractions rely on,"" they said.

The airport is the largest private sector employer in our area, providing about 5,500 jobs on-site, the spokesperson added.

""We expect our proposals to deliver 1,000 additional on-site jobs and support many more in our region, boosting economic growth.

""We hope to be able to work with Bristol City Council, so that we maximise the economic benefits for our city,"" they added.

The plans are expected to be submitted to North Somerset Council in the autumn.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/342f/live/2ee536f0-5d61-11f0-ac62-59034e8db663.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 11:19:14.929302

Why It Matters for Northwest Arkansas Northwest Arkansas has seen a surge of startup activity in recent years but still faces gaps in early-stage capital.

Editor’s note: Serafina Lalany is the executive director of the Northwest Arkansas Council’s StartupNWA.","Congress just passed the Budget Reconciliation Bill, a sweeping 1,200-page piece of legislation that will significantly impact the U.S. economy.

Commonly referred to as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” it has drawn national attention for its more controversial provisions, including a permanent extension of the 2017 tax cuts and significant funding reductions for healthcare and SNAP benefits.

But beyond the headlines, several lesser-known measures could reshape the trajectory of early-stage companies and investors across the country. For regions like Northwest Arkansas, the bill may unlock new momentum in building a stronger innovation economy.

This analysis focuses on a narrow slice of the law: provisions that directly affect how capital is taxed, deployed and recovered in the innovation economy. In many respects, the legislation is good news for founders, funders and the future of startup formation.

A Boost for Early-Stage Investment

One of the most impactful changes is the expansion of Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) treatment. The law raises the cap on tax-free gains from $10 million to $15 million and clarifies eligibility for more business models. It also introduces a partial exclusion structure for holders under five years. For founders finalizing equity grants or converting Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs), this change could lock in long-term upside. For early investors, it shifts incentives toward high-risk, high-reward startup investing, the kind of capital most needed in emerging ecosystems like Northwest Arkansas.

Expensing Changes Give Startups Breathing Room

The bill restores full expensing for domestic R&D and makes 100% bonus depreciation for qualified equipment permanent. These changes are critical for capital-intensive startups in biotech, hardware and energy. Expensing real costs in the year they’re incurred helps stretch runway and defer taxes. It also improves optics for later-stage investors evaluating burn rates and margins. These provisions give early-stage companies in places like Northwest Arkansas more room to grow.

AI and Clean Tech: Mixed Signals

The bill includes $150 million in federal funding to build science-grade AI infrastructure through the Department of Energy. This signals growing federal interest in AI for research, defense and health care. For companies in these areas, the funding could accelerate development.

At the same time, lawmakers dropped a proposal for national AI standards, leaving most companies to navigate a patchwork of state laws. That creates a divide: science-focused AI may benefit from new investment, while commercial AI faces continued uncertainty.

Clean tech saw setbacks and new openings. EV credits end after the third quarter of 2025, and incentives for solar, wind and hydrogen are being phased out earlier than expected. That sharpens the divide between companies that can stand alone and those that rely on subsidy. One bright spot: the bill expands eligibility for Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), allowing more clean energy projects, including sustainable aviation fuel and domestic nuclear, to access infrastructure capital.

Boosts for Defense, Biotech and Manufacturing

Other sectors saw targeted support. Defense tech received increased investment across autonomous systems, cybersecurity and Indo-Pacific resilience. Biotech retained orphan drug protections and benefits from restored R&D expensing. Manufacturing gained a 35% CHIPS investment credit and full expensing for new U.S.-based facilities, lowering costs for domestic production.

Why It Matters for Northwest Arkansas

Northwest Arkansas has seen a surge of startup activity in recent years but still faces gaps in early-stage capital. For local founders and angel investors, the QSBS expansion could make equity more attractive, especially for patient capital. Programs like VC Immersions, which connect startups with national investors, are well-positioned to help founders seize this moment. The region’s push into applied AI, manufacturing and logistics tech could also benefit from the bill’s incentives and shift in national priorities.

A More Technical, But No Less Consequential Shift

While the full impact of this legislation won’t be clear for years, many of its provisions could open new opportunities outside traditional investment hubs. It doesn’t include a flashy grant program or targeted stimulus. Instead, it changes the mechanics: tax treatment, expensing and sector-specific incentives. For the right companies in the right regions, that shift could be just as powerful. The challenge now is knowing how to put them to use.

Trump threatens 50pc Brazil tariff

Washington, 9 July (Argus) — US president Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 50pc tariff on imports from Brazil from 1 August, citing the ongoing trial of that country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump's letter to Brazil's president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, released on Wednesday, is one of the 22 that the US leader sent to his foreign counterparts since 7 July, announcing new tariff rates that the US will be charging on imports from those countries. But his letter to Brazil stands out for allegations of a ""witch hunt"" against Bolsonaro, who — much like Trump — disputed his electoral defeat and attempted to stay in office. Brazil's supreme court qualified Bolsonaro's actions in 2022 as an attempted coup, ordering him to stand trial. Trump said he will impose the 50pc tariff because ""in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections and the Fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans"". The latter is a reference to orders by judges in Brazil to suspend social media accounts for spreading ""misinformation"". Trump separately said he would direct US trade authorities to launch an investigation of Brazil's treatment of US social media platforms — an action likely to result in additional tariffs. Trump's letter to Lula also contains language similar to that included in letters sent to 21 other foreign leaders, accusing Brazil of unfair trade practices and suggesting that the only way to avoid payments of tariffs is if Brazilian companies ""decide to build or manufacture product within the US"". The Trump administration since 5 April has been charging a 10pc extra ""Liberation Day"" tariff on most imports — energy commodities and critical minerals are exceptions — from Brazil and nearly every foreign trade partner. Trump on 9 April imposed even higher tariffs on key trading partners, only to delay them the same day until 9 July. On 7 July, Trump signed an executive order further delaying the implementation of higher rates until 12:01am ET (04:01 GMT) on 1 August. Brasilia did not immediately react to Trump's threat of higher tariffs. Trump earlier this week threatened to impose 10pc tariffs on any country cooperating with the Brics group, which includes Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa. Lula hosted a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro on 6-7 July. By Haik Gugarats Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025. Argus Media group .

Australian liquid fuels policy to free up ACCUs: CEFC

Sydney, 9 July (Argus) — Annual demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) could be reduced by as much as 7.5mn t of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2050 if Australia adopted policy changes to develop a low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry, according to a report this week. Encouraging companies to reduce direct scope 1 emissions through changes to the federal safeguard mechanism and/or voluntary adoption would drive the development of an Australian LCLF market and free up ACCUs for use in sectors that cannot achieve on-site decarbonisation due to technical challenges, state-owned green investment fund Clean Energy Finance (CEFC) said in a report authored by consultancy Deloitte . Under its central case scenario, which would involve constraining the use of carbon offsets, CEFC said that a 7bn litres/yr LCLF market could be created by 2050, abating up to 12mn t CO2e in 2040 and 20mn t CO2e in 2050 as a result. Annual ACCU demand across six sectors covered by the report — mining, aviation, rail, heavy freight, maritime, and construction — could be reduced by around 6.8mn t CO2e by 2050 in that case, to 2.4mn t CO2e/yr. Demand for ACCUs could reach as low as 1.7mn t CO2e by 2050 under an accelerated scenario, which would involve EU-style mandates for LCLF. Demand for ACCUs would be around 9.2mn t CO2e/yr under the base scenario, which assumes a market-led transition in which carbon prices remain low and LCLF demand is driven by a small group of customers willing to pay significant premiums to reduce their scope 3 emissions. 30pc cap under the safeguard mechanism The central case scenario assumes a hypothetical government intervention to cap the use of ACCUs under the safeguard mechanism at 30pc of the baseline for liquid fuel-related emissions. Currently, there is no limit to the number of ACCUs or safeguard mechanism credits (SMCs) that facilities can use to manage their excess emissions under the scheme, but those that surrender carbon units equivalent to 30pc or more of their baselines need to publish a statement explaining why they have not undertaken more on-site abatement activities . The central case scenario also assumes the removal of baseline adjustments for trade-exposed baseline-adjusted facilities . Adopting a minimum 70pc direct on-site decarbonisation would trigger a positive supply-side response, driving significant technology deployment and competition between pathways and feedstocks, the CEFC said. Stakeholders claim that the current safeguard mechanism and ACCU pricing are not enough to drive early LCLF uptake, the report said. Policy intervention is needed to accelerate the bridging of the cost gap between the LCLF production cost and the ACCU price, which is currently not expected to happen until the 2040s, the report said. A market-led transition, on the other hand, would lead to greater pressure on the ACCU market, with up to 7.35mn t CO2e of ACCUs needed to meet demand in 2035 and 15.5mn t CO2e in 2050. ACCU supply reached an all-time high of 18.78mn in 2024 and is forecast at 19mn-24mn for 2025 . But the industry needs to boost future issuances to address an expected shift in the supply-demand balance within a few years .

EIA cuts 2025 US biofuel outlook, ups 2026 view

New York, 8 July (Argus) — The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year. US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook . That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production. EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth. The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import. Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years. In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation. Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report. EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption. But the agency now sees US production and consumption balanced at 49,000 b/d next year, a 1,000 b/d increase from its June expectations. The Environmental Protection Agency last month proposed substantially raising biomass-based diesel mandates in the next two years, while also potentially throttling credits for biofuels made abroad or from foreign feedstocks. And President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend a sprawling budget bill that extends a tax credit for biofuels through 2029 and, starting next year, ups subsidies for crop-based fuels while limiting eligibility to North American feedstocks.

French diesel, HVO customs data mislabelled: Eurostat

Barcelona, 8 July (Argus) — French firms have mislabelled imports of 10ppm diesel as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) this year, following confusion over new customs codes, EU data service Eurostat has said. The confusion has come about after the introduction of a new import-export (CN) code for HVO that took effect at the start of 2025. Some French data will be restated. A diesel code of 27101943 was discontinued at the end of 2024 and was replaced by 27101944. A new CN code 27101942 for HVO was introduced. HVO is produced by treating vegetable oil with hydrogen, counts against biodiesel blend mandates, but is molecularly separate from biodiesel output by esterification. When customs data for 2025 began to be published at the end of the first quarter, France appeared to be importing large amounts of HVO from Saudi Arabia and the US. Cargoes from the former amounted to around 255,000t in the first quarter. Saudi Arabia has no HVO production known by Argus , nor does it re-export cargoes. It is France's largest diesel supplier. There were also 140,000t labelled as HVO from the US in January-March. But because the EU has anti-dumping and countervailing duties on US HVO imports, shipments of this size appeared questionable. The US is the second biggest diesel supplier to France. The mislabelling has made French and EU HVO traffic difficult to track. It has distorted French diesel import data , which show imports have fallen sharply. Argus first questioned the numbers in March when initial 2025 customs data were released. These queries were rebuffed, but after a follow up in May Eurostat said French customs had ""confirmed that there has been an input error"". New data will be supplied by France at an unspecified time this year, it said. By Adam Porter Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

Now in its 20th edition, the 2024 Sustainability Report arrives in a challenging business environment marked by growing uncertainties in global supply chains. Against this backdrop, the report highlights key achievements in carbon reduction operations and new lower-carbon businesses under the company’s Green Transformation roadmap, aimed at driving sustainable and profitable growth.

GS Caltex is evolving into a Lower Carbon Refining & Chemical Complex by implementing structural changes in its energy practices through measures such as the expansion of self-generated power, the introduction of carbon-free steam, and the use of renewable energy. Solar power systems installed in 2024 are now operational in facilities nationwide. The company also plans to directly purchase over 100 MW of renewable energy, which is expected to reduce tens of thousands of tons of CO₂ annually and lower long-term electricity costs.

To build a New Energy Platform for the energy transition, GS Caltex is advancing lower-carbon businesses in hydrogen; carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS); bio-based solutions; and chemical/material recycling technologies. The company recently secured land at the Yulchon Convergence Logistics Complex in Yeosu to establish a hydrogen hub. It also became the first Korean refiner to export ISCC CORSIA-certified sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at commercial scale.

Aligning its new businesses with carbon reduction efforts, GS Caltex plans to issue carbon credits in the Voluntary Carbon Market. These credits will be certified by Verra’s Verified Carbon Standard Program, based on CO₂ reductions achieved through the company’s nationwide EV charging network.

A key driver of progress in lower-carbon businesses is GS Caltex’s revised investment decision-making process. The company now incorporates carbon pricing into evaluations of major investments, considering both short-term profitability and long-term climate risks.

GS Caltex is also advancing its biofuels, recycling, and lower-carbon projects after establishing a corporate-level Business Council in 2024. At the same time, its enhanced compliance due diligence and information security frameworks are helping it proactively manage a broad range of risks.

Additionally, the company is strengthening the reliability of ESG disclosures by adopting a new ESG disclosure system connected to existing platforms to improve data consistency. The system is structured in accordance with global ESG guidelines, positioning the company to efficiently meet future domestic ESG disclosure requirements.

“We are committed to sustainable management that goes beyond short-term achievements to strengthen our core competitiveness. Amid rapid change, we will steadfastly fulfill our responsibilities and strive to become a centennial company by sincerely challenging ourselves and pursuing innovation,” said GS Caltex CEO Saehong Hur.

In February, the European Union imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese biodiesel imports, ranging from 10% to 35.6%, with sustainable aviation fuel being exempt.","Chinese biodiesel pioneer Zhuoyue New Energy has unveiled plans to invest approximately CNY700 million (USD97.6 million) in a new biofuel production facility in Thailand, underscoring its commitment to international expansion and renewable energy development. The project will be located in Chonburi province and executed in two distinct phases, the company announced recently.

In the initial phase, Zhuoyue will establish a production capacity of 300,000 tons of biodiesel per year, with a projected construction timeline of 12 months. The second phase will focus on producing 100,000 tons annually of either hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), aligning with growing global demand for cleaner alternatives in aviation and road transport.

Zhuoyue has already completed all necessary regulatory formalities to move forward with the Thai project. This includes offshore investment registration with the Chinese government, securing a formal approval certificate from Thailand’s Board of Investment, and signing a land lease agreement for the site of the plant. Based in China's Fujian province, Zhuoyue has long been recognized as a trailblazer in the domestic biofuel sector. It was the first Chinese company to commercialize biodiesel production from waste oils and has maintained leadership in production, sales, and exports for several consecutive years.

The company’s robust supply chain is centered on a reliable waste oil collection network that spans both China and Southeast Asia. In 2023 alone, Zhuoyue sold 376,000 tons of biodiesel, bringing in revenues of CNY3.3 billion (USD462 million), which constituted approximately 93% of its total annual income. Notably, export sales made up a dominant share, nearing CNY3.2 billion.

Apart from the Thai venture, Zhuoyue is also constructing another biodiesel production facility in Singapore. This plant, with an expected annual capacity of 100,000 tons, is scheduled to commence operations later this year. Its primary purpose will be to meet Singapore's demand for low-carbon marine fuels, given the city-state’s status as the world's largest bunkering port.

Despite its international growth, Zhuoyue faces certain trade challenges. In February, the European Union imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese biodiesel imports, ranging from 10% to 35.6%, with sustainable aviation fuel being exempt. Zhuoyue specifically was hit with a 23.4% tariff, which will remain in effect for five years. While this presents a hurdle for exports to Europe, the company’s strategic investments in Southeast Asia and Singapore are expected to diversify its market exposure and enhance its competitiveness in the global biofuels arena.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-10 08:04:12.819680

Its board will be chaired by CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan, while its founding CEO will be Philip Goh, airline industry veteran and former regional vice-president for Apac at the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said CAAS on Thursday (Jul 10).

Han noted that Apac’s air travel demand is expected to treble over the next 20 years, “enabling tremendous economic development and supporting the aspirations of a rising middle class”.

At the same time, Apac states are committed to tackling climate change, which will support aviation’s global net-zero emission goals.

“Asia-Pacific states want both growth and sustainability, not one at the expense of the other,” he said.

APSAC thus aims to provide “a menu of policy options and instruments” for countries to achieve sustainability goals while accounting for their own circumstances.

The centre will advance sustainable aviation in three key ways.

Firstly, it will carry out policy research in areas such as cleaner fuels, carbon accounting and carbon market development, as well as green financing. Another potential area is the economics of sustainable aviation fuel supply chains.

Secondly, it will facilitate collaboration across government, industry and academia, for joint studies and projects.

Finally, it will support capacity building by governments and companies, through offering technical assistance and training.

For a start, the centre will launch a five-day foundational course on growing aviation sustainably, with topics such as challenges and opportunities in sustainable aviation fuel, and airline and airport sustainability management. It aims to hold the first run in November 2025 or early 2026.

The industry lacks courses on understanding sustainable aviation issues from an ecosystem perspective, said Goh.

“So our very first course will be targeted at that: equipping people with that kind of broad-based (knowledge), so that they can connect what affects what, and how it all works in the end.”

He expects this course to run three to four times a year from 2026.

APSAC will also plan courses to meet needs identified in regional engagements, he added, and will look at holding country-specific workshops when it has the resources.

The centre will build a team of up to 10 people in the next year or year-and-a-half. While ASPEC identifies courses to offer and develops their curriculum, it will tap its network of industry experts to provide content and facilitate.

Here, APSAC will lean on an advisory council of key partners in aviation, energy and green financing – comprising senior executives from Airbus, Boeing, Chevron, ExxonMobil, GenZero, Iata and Neste – for guidance.

To formalise this, the council partners, CAAS and APSAC will sign a memorandum of understanding on Jul 14 at the Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium.

On the same day, CAAS and APSAC will engage the directors-general of Apac civil aviation authorities of more than 20 states in a roundtable, to understand their sustainable aviation plans and how the centre can support them.

First High-Level Aviation Week

The Roundtable on Advancing Sustainable Aviation is one of seven events in the inaugural High-Level Aviation Week.

Held by CAAS from Jul 14 to 19, it will bring together governments and industry leaders to discuss the future of aviation.

“It is a response to the fundamental changes to the global operating environment and its impact on global aviation, and the need for us to come together to ... formulate strategies that are joined up across domains and across countries,” said Han.

Besides sustainable aviation, there will be events on shaping the future of aviation; facilitating advanced air mobility (air taxis and drones); ensuring aviation safety; and building a quality workforce and enabling opportunities.

Avelia’s evolution aims to better meet customer needs, accelerate SAF adoption, and provide companies with a clear, scalable pathway to credible business travel life cycle GHG emissions reductions* from aviation.

This comes at a critical time for the aviation sector. SAF is widely recognised as the most viable solution for reducing* the life cycle GHG emissions of aviation today, with the potential to reduce life cycle GHG emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel when used neat. However, according to IATA, in 2025, SAF production is expected to reach only 2.1 million tonnes or 0.7% of total jet fuel production.

Avelia has established itself as the leading blockchain-powered book and claim solution with the aim of scaling SAF, reducing the life cycle GHG emissions of aviation and enabling greater participation in the sector’s decarbonisation efforts. Launched in 2022, Avelia helps companies to access the GHG benefits of SAF without being constrained by its physical availability at specific locations.

As of 31st March 2025, more than 57 corporations and airlines had joined Avelia and over 900 retirements had been executed. This contributed to the injection of over 33 million gallons of SAF into the existing global fuel network at 17 airport injection points around the world, resulting in over 300,000 tonnes of CO2e abated, the equivalent of over 530,000 passengers flying from London to New York.

Avelia’s evolution towards an industry-wide solution introduces functionalities that will enhance transparency, flexibility, and industry participation, including:

Independent data hosting. With the platform data now hosted and handled by Accenture, Avelia also provides a blockchain-powered transparent, secure, reliable and externally verified platform for accessing and allocating the information for the applicable SAF offering.

Multisupplier solution. Until now Avelia has only accepted SAF supplied by Shell. With this change, Avelia is in the process of evolving from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier solution, helping users access the GHG benefits of SAF from multiple SAF suppliers, including Shell. Customers, including airlines, corporations, and freight forwarders, will be able to manage SAF from different suppliers within Avelia, simplifying their SAF overview.

BYOS (Bring Your Own SAF) model. Avelia is looking to introduce a BYOS model, which enables airlines to manage more of their SAF portfolio in Avelia, including SAF originally purchased outside of the Shell supply network as well as SAF that otherwise would have been tracked offline and not on a digital registry. This feature will support the use of book and claim solutions for tracking SAF, helping build credibility for book and claim at an industry level and accelerating SAF adoption.

Multilateral governance. Avelia is in the process of setting-up a multilateral governance structure to enable multi-party involvement and more transparency information around the Avelia operating procedures.

Raman Ojha, President, Shell Aviation said: “This moment marks a significant milestone not only for Avelia but for the aviation sector. Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF. We are proud to help enable broader participation and transparency in the sector’s efforts to reduce life cycle GHG emissions while supporting our customers in reaching their climate goals.""

Evan Konwiser, Chief Product and Strategy Officer, Amex GBT said: “For the majority of companies, Scope 3 emissions represent the largest share of their total carbon footprint and reducing them can be challenging. As a leading software and services company for travel, expense, and meetings & events, Amex GBT is committed to leading with our customers on decarbonisation. As a partner in Avelia, we continue to grow and evolve the world’s first and now most established book and claim platform for SAF. Together we can accelerate its scale and increase customer access to its environmental benefits.”

Dr Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg, Global Travel and Aviation Sustainability Lead, Accenture, said: “Evolving Avelia into a multi-supplier industry solution is a decisive step to scale SAF in aviation, strengthening industry collaboration and resilience while using sustainability as a growth driver. As Avelia’s strategic advisor and technology partner, Accenture continues to shape its evolution while overseeing data processing and hosting for Shell. This safeguards data compartmentalisation and transparency, giving customers clear control. It also builds the secure, scalable foundation needed for a flexible industry platform. Together, we are enabling aviation to advance towards achieving its climate commitments.”",,N,,2025-07-10 08:04:39.956552

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian Oil Corp plans to shut its 300,000 barrels-per-day diesel desulphuriser unit at its Panipat refinery for an upgrade aimed at producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) next year, Arvind Kumar, its head of refineries, said on Thursday.

The overhaul of the diesel unit is scheduled for late this year or early next year, Kumar told an industry event in New Delhi.

India aims to have 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in aviation fuel by 2027, doubling to 2% in 2028.

The refinery's diesel output would not be hit due to the shutdown as the refiner has additional diesel hydrotreaters at the Panipat site.

The upgraded unit will process used cooking oil (UCO) to produce 30,000 metric tons per year of SAF, he said.

Indian Oil, the country's largest refiner, will also look at upgrading some kerosene-producing units at other refineries to make SAF, he said.

He also said that Indian Oil will soon invite bids for a 70,000 tons-per-year green hydrogen plant and a sustainable aviation fuel project.

“In some countries, we’re seeing aviation taxes rise while support for emissions frameworks like CORSIA erodes,” said Cerdá.","In late June, over 400 senior aviation executives, policymakers, and public officials convened in Bogotá for the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Wings of Change Americas (WOCA) conference—marking the first time the event was hosted in Colombia.

Set against the backdrop of a region grappling with economic disparities, fragmented regulation, and mounting demand for air connectivity, the two-day forum underscored the urgency of aligning policy and industry efforts to ensure aviation remains a key driver of growth and inclusion across Latin America and the Caribbean.

Latin American Aviation is at a Tipping Point

Across the region, planes are full, demand is surging, and middle-class travelers are ready to take to the skies. But years of underinvestment, erratic regulation, and tax-heavy policies are beginning to take their toll.

As Peter Cerdá, IATA’s Regional Vice President for the Americas, took the stage to deliver his opening remarks, the message was clear: aviation in Latin America and the Caribbean is not merely a mode of transportation—it’s a catalyst for economic and social transformation.

“Each flight represents a step toward opportunity,” Cerdá told delegates. “Economic opportunity, social inclusion, and regional integration. But to reach our full potential, we need to overcome the obstacles holding us back.”

Throughout the two-day summit, the exchange of ideas was shaped by a high-caliber lineup of airline CEOs who brought regional nuance and business insight to the forefront of every conversation.

Among the most prominent voices were Adrian Neuhauser (Abra Group), Frederico Pedreira (Avianca), Erika Zarante (LATAM Airlines Colombia), Pedro Heilbron (Copa Airlines), Estuardo Ortiz (JetSMART), Eduardo Lombana (Wingo), and Roberto Roselli (Plus Ultra), among others, each offering clear-eyed perspectives on growth, regulation, and sustainability. Their contributions reflected the breadth of airline models and market realities across the Americas.

Adding a strong institutional presence, Carlos Galán, the Mayor of Bogotá, emphasized the central role of Colombia’s main gateway, El Dorado International Airport, in driving local and regional progress.

A Region of Immense Potential—Grounded by Barriers

The numbers tell both a story of promise and a paradox. Air transport in Latin America and the Caribbean supports 8.3 million jobs and contributes $240 billion to the region’s GDP. Yet the average person flies less than once a year—only 0.65 trips, compared to 2.5 in North America and 4.5 in Spain.

In 2024, nearly 481 million passengers traveled across the region, a 7.8 percent increase from the previous year. Colombia’s domestic market has surged 38.8 percent over the past decade, driven in part by increased competition. In Brazil, international traffic spiked 17.7 percent in the first half of 2025 alone.

But that momentum risks stalling, according to IATA. The region’s average airline profit is just $3.40 per passenger—”less than the cost of a Juan Valdez coffee at the airport,” Cerdá quipped. “This margin leaves us highly vulnerable to external shocks—from political instability to outdated infrastructure.”

Taxes That Clip Wings

Aviation in Latin America has long battled a contradiction: it is essential, yet it is taxed as if it were a luxury.

In some Caribbean nations, taxes and fees account for up to 40 percent of the cost of a plane ticket. The latest concern comes from Brazil, where a proposed 26.5 percent VAT on airfares could slash passenger demand by as much as 30 percent.

“Airlines have worked hard to bring prices down. Since 2015, fares in Brazil have dropped over 15 percent internationally and nearly 15 percent domestically. The ball is now in the government’s court,” said Cerdá. “Punitive taxes only make flying inaccessible for the very people we need to serve.”

Under the proposed VAT, average domestic airfares in Brazil could rise from $130 to $160, while international fares may climb from $740 to $935—pricing out millions of travelers.

A Patchwork of Policies

Cerdá also warned of a “fragmented regulatory landscape.” With 33 countries and 33 sets of aviation rules, the lack of regional harmonization creates inefficiencies and hinders connectivity.

Consumer protection laws—many modeled after Europe’s EU261—are spreading across the region but are often misaligned with local operational realities. Proposed laws in Peru, Colombia, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico aim to ban ancillary fees, cap fares, or penalize overbooking, potentially driving up costs for both airlines and passengers.

“The test of any regulation should be simple,” Cerdá said. “Does it solve a real problem? And do its benefits outweigh the cost?”

Overcrowded Runways, Saturated Terminals

From Bogotá to São Paulo, gleaming new terminals are opening—but many are already operating at capacity.

Major airports in Lima, Panama City, Mexico City, Santiago, and Buenos Aires are expanding, but demand continues to outpace supply. “We need a strategic vision,” Cerdá urged. “Not just for our largest hubs, but for secondary cities that are key to regional integration.”

He highlighted an IATA-led airspace and capacity study for Bogotá’s El Dorado Airport—developed in collaboration with the airport authority, government, and airlines. “The recommendations were sound,” he said. “But only a few have been implemented. We welcome Aerocivil’s renewed commitment to act on these findings.”

Net-Zero by 2050? Not Without Support

Sustainability was a recurring theme throughout the conference. While the global aviation industry remains committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, progress has been uneven.

Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is set to double in 2025 to reach 2 million tonnes, yet this will still account for just 0.7 percent of the industry’s needs. Only a handful of countries—Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico—have taken regulatory steps to encourage SAF production.

“In some countries, we’re seeing aviation taxes rise while support for emissions frameworks like CORSIA erodes,” said Cerdá. “We can’t be penalized and expected to decarbonize at the same time.”

Voices That Shape the Future

The conference also spotlighted the human side of aviation. One of the most resonant moments came during the Women in Aviation Breakfast, where Erika Zarante, CEO of LATAM Airlines Colombia, shared her path to becoming the country’s first female airline chief.

WOCA also served as a prelude to a high-level Ministerial Roundtable co-hosted by IATA and UN Tourism, bringing together 10 regional tourism ministers and airline executives for over 50 bilateral meetings aimed at strengthening air connectivity.

Looking ahead, IATA has pledged its support for the upcoming Summit of the Americas in Punta Cana this December and announced plans to collaborate with Carlos Peguero, Vice Minister of Tourism for the Dominican Republic, to keep aviation at the forefront of the regional development agenda.

A 20-Year Horizon

Projections shared at WOCA forecast that Latin America and the Caribbean’s air traffic will grow by 5.8 percent in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 3.2 percent through 2044. That translates into 218 million additional passengers over the next two decades.

“This is more than just numbers,” said Cerdá. “It’s about the future of mobility, of opportunity, and of prosperity for millions.”

He closed with a simple but powerful goal: “Everyone in this region should be able to fly at least once a year. Let’s work together to make aviation a force for good.”

The former likely isn't environmentally friendly at all from a zero emissions perspective and will have too big a demand on growing space that could be used for food, and the latter is a nonstarter because by the time it's at enough scale you can just skip the carbon and pump the hydrogen straight into your hydrogen powered gas turbine.

Is it viable? Yes, it can be produced from a variety of feedstocks (bio based and non bio) and can help scale some technology like carbon capture. Is SAF itself truly scalable to zero blend? That’s up for debate. Once you add up the setup and operating costs of plants, sourcing feedstock (potentially impacting food crops) then the equation is a little more difficult. SAF is worth pursuing to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, but it doesn’t do much for tailpipe carbon emissions reductions- that is only possible with electrification which has its own drawbacks, most significantly the energy density problem.

As with any emergent technologies, it needs to reach a critical mass before it is truly viable. Different technologies have different barriers to overcome. Sometimes the free market is sufficient to produce enough demand, whilst other times it needs to be incentivised by subsidy, regulation or both.

SAF is currently in fairly early stages and there are a lot of barriers. It’s more expensive than traditional fuels. The infrastructure of producing and transporting it currently doesn’t produce nearly enough. Engines aren’t currently certified to run on 100% SAF and may require redesign and recertification to do so. But until the demand is there, stakeholders are reluctant to invest. And until the supply is sufficient (which would help it compete on price) the airlines are reluctant to commit. The free market would not pursue SAFs on their own.

So, with many governments around the world committing to various environmental strategies and targets, aviation is an obvious industry to focus on. They can see that the free market is not moving fast enough. So governments and international bodies (ICAO) are stepping in. Subsidising SAFs, mandating carbon offsets and introducing regulation starts to make the maths of choosing traditional fuels over SAFs a bit more complicated for airlines. And this is only going to get more complicated.

I think some airlines recognise these issues with SAF but also appreciate that it could well be the future. Early birds often get the worm and so by taking a hit on costs now they hope they will have an edge in the future. So it is in their interest to bang their big Green PR strategy drum in the hope it encourages investment whilst also helping to offset a bit of the increased cost now as environmental conscious travellers look to reduce their impact. Many investors now also like to see companies across all industries to show an effort in reducing their environmental impact, so I believe Green PR is predominately for share holders rather than end users.",,N,,2025-07-10 10:10:18.571089

The project will be developed in two phases, according to a company statement issued yesterday. The first phase is set to produce 300,000 tons of biodiesel annually and is expected to be completed within 12 months. The second phase will add capacity for 100,000 tons per year of either hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), both of which are key fuels in the global low-carbon transition.

Zhuoyue has already cleared key regulatory hurdles for the project. The company has secured offshore investment registration from Chinese authorities, received approval from Thailand’s Board of Investment, and finalized a land lease agreement for the construction site.

Headquartered in Fujian province, Zhuoyue is widely recognized as China’s pioneer in industrial biodiesel production from waste oils. It has consistently held the top position in the country in terms of biodiesel output, sales, and exports, and maintains a stable supply network for waste oils across China and Southeast Asia.

In 2023, Zhuoyue sold 376,000 tons of biodiesel, generating revenue of CNY3.3 billion (USD462 million), with exports accounting for nearly CNY3.2 billion of that total — roughly 93 percent of its annual earnings.

The company is also nearing completion of a separate 100,000-ton biodiesel plant in Singapore, which is set to begin operations later this year. The Singapore facility will primarily serve the city-state’s bunkering market, the largest in the world, with a focus on low-carbon marine fuels.

However, Zhuoyue faces challenges in international markets. In February, the European Union imposed anti-dumping tariffs ranging from 10 to 35.6 percent on Chinese biodiesel imports. Zhuoyue was hit with a 23.4 percent tariff, which will remain in place for five years. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was excluded from the duties.

As Arsonneau puts it, “It’s not just about reducing emissions—it’s about building the infrastructure for the airport of the future.” In the future, it’s not just aircraft that need to fly clean.","Airports offer one of the most practical and immediate opportunities to cut carbon emissions in the aviation ecosystem. And while aircraft decarbonisation still faces technical and fuel-related hurdles, ground infrastructure presents a clearer and more electrified path forward.

Why airports are the real green frontier

Aircraft may be the visible symbol of aviation, but they are only part of the emissions equation. Airports are energy-intensive environments, operating 24/7 and relying on a vast array of power-hungry systems, including HVAC, runway lighting, baggage handling, ground support vehicles, and more. Electrifying these systems is both feasible and impactful.

Arsonneau puts it plainly, “Planes still use kerosene, and while more and more are shifting to biofuels, we’re not working on that. Where we can really help is on the ground by starting with electrifying vehicles, increasing building efficiency, and optimising energy management systems.”

Schneider Electric has developed what Arsonneau calls a “full playbook” to help airports move through the levels of the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) programme, from basic energy tracking to full carbon neutrality.

The first step, he explains, is visibility. “You need to track the energy you’re consuming, such as runway lights, airport buildings, baggage handling. You need to know where the problems are.”

From there, the roadmap continues with the electrification of ground support vehicles and airport transport fleets, replacing fossil-fuel-powered systems with electric alternatives. This shift is essential for reducing emissions across day-to-day airport operations.

Another priority is implementing advanced HVAC and building management systems, which can significantly reduce energy waste through smart automation and real-time performance monitoring.

Schneider Electric also emphasises the need to engage suppliers to tackle Scope 3 emissions, helping airports influence the broader value chain by aligning partners with sustainability goals.

Airports are further supported through consulting services that guide the procurement of green energy at competitive prices, helping operators make informed decisions that align with regulatory and ESG targets.

Finally, the roadmap includes the installation of local power generation systems, primarily solar, complemented by battery storage to support reliability and off-grid resilience.

Critically, these measures aren’t just about ticking sustainability boxes, but they come with real operational and financial benefits, offering both environmental impact and a compelling return on investment.

Proof of concept: JFK’s microgrid

Schneider Electric’s most tangible example to date is its project at New York’s JFK Terminal 1, where it installed a 12 MW microgrid combining solar, battery storage, and backup systems.

“This 12-megawatt microgrid has reduced carbon emissions by 38%,” says Arsonneau. “The return on investment is below ten years. It’s not only sustainable, it’s economical.”

Microgrids provide a safety net in environments where downtime is not an option. “You absolutely need to have power 100% of the time. A power interruption in an airport is not good at all,” he adds.

Building for sustainability

While new airport projects like the upcoming mega-hub in Dubai have the luxury of integrating sustainability from the outset, Arsonneau is quick to stress that retrofitting existing airports is just as important.

“It’s easier to start green when you’re building from scratch,” he says. “But even in existing airports, we can put digital systems in place to visualise and improve energy use. You can digitise old equipment, track consumption, and optimise operations.”

This is where Schneider Electric’s use of digital twin technology becomes critical. “A twin helps you plan the evolution of your electrical system. If I add solar, how will it perform? What’s the cost? You can simulate all this,” he says. “And it helps with safety. You don’t need to rely on outdated paper maps of electrical networks. The twin stays up to date.”

In both greenfield and brownfield scenarios, the digital twin serves as the foundation for long-term, sustainable planning and risk mitigation.

Solar power advantage

Solar presents an obvious solution in the Middle East, where sunlight is abundant and energy demand is high. “Solar is the cheapest way to produce electricity today,” Arsonneau says. “Every airport should go solar, be it on the roof, on the sides, wherever space allows.”

But solar alone isn’t enough. “The constraint is that at night, you don’t have the sun. So you need battery storage. And that’s usually not enough for the whole airport. So you need a grid connection as well.”

To make these mixed power sources work seamlessly, Schneider Electric builds microgrid systems that manage the switch between solar, battery, and grid power. “It’s about making sure there’s no drop in energy and no interruption,” he says.

This layered approach is particularly relevant in light of recent grid failures in Europe. “Barcelona and Madrid had to run generators back in April,” Arsonneau notes. “It’s a reminder that having your own on-site energy gives you resilience.”

A strategic segment for the future

The airport and aviation segment is no side project for Schneider Electric as it is now a dedicated growth vertical.

“This sector is growing at 10% yearly,” Arsonneau says. “That’s why we created this new segment, with airports as a key focus. The public wants aviation to be greener, and airports are where they can start delivering on that.”

He acknowledges the criticism the industry often receives, even though it accounts for only 2–3% of global emissions. “In sustainability, not everything is fair,” he says. “But airports are visible, and people want them to change. That’s where the opportunity is.”

One of the complexities of operating across the Middle East is adapting to the region’s diverse regulations and energy norms. “There are differences in voltage, frequency, and even data sovereignty between the UAE and Saudi Arabia,” Arsonneau explains.

But this is where Schneider Electric’s decentralised model helps. “We’re very local. We understand the norms and adapt accordingly. The idea is to push global sustainability standards but always customise to local conditions.”

Towards net zero

If the aviation industry is serious about decarbonisation, airports are the low-hanging fruit. From electrifying fleets to managing energy through microgrids, the technologies exist, and the ROI is real.

As Arsonneau puts it, “It’s not just about reducing emissions—it’s about building the infrastructure for the airport of the future.”

Why in news?

Recently, IATA (International Air Transport Association) highlighted that India has a major opportunity to become a global hub for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel – SAF is a renewable, low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from sources like agricultural waste, non-food crops, used cooking oil, algae, and municipal solid waste.

Aircraft fuel – It is chemically similar to fossil jet fuel, making it compatible with existing aircraft engines and refuelling infrastructure.

It can be used by blending biofuel with conventional jet fuel.

Lifecycle emissions – For SAF it is upto 80% lower than conventional fuel, depending on the feedstock and production method, making it central to achieving net-zero targets in aviation.

Decarbonisation – According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF alone is projected to contribute over 60% of the aviation industry’s carbon reduction targets.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is the global trade association of airlines is established in 1945, headquartered at

Montreal, Canada, and it represents around 300 airlines worldwide, accounting for over 80% of global air traffic.

Other measures such as operational efficiency, hydrogen, electric aircraft, and carbon offsetting also play a role, but SAF is considered the most impactful and immediately deployable solution.

Global SAF ecosystem – There are over 300 renewable fuel projects announced globally, but only 160 have clear SAF production plans.

India’s current SAF ecosystem – India has been exploring SAF for over a decade.

Several Indian energy companies are developing SAF production capabilities and government has signalled intent to introduce blending targets, but a formal roadmap is awaited.

What are the opportunities for India to Become a Global SAF Hub?

Abundant feedstock availability – India generates large quantities of biomass, agricultural waste, and ethanol, which can be channelled towards SAF production without compromising food security.

Existing refining infrastructure – India’s oil refineries can be upgraded to produce SAF, reducing capital investment requirements compared to greenfield plants.

“Make in India for the world” potential – India can meet domestic SAF demand and export surplus to international airlines operating in the region, creating an economic and strategic opportunity.

Estimated production potential – By 2050, India could produce up to 40 million tonnes of SAF, significantly contributing to global supply chains.

What are the key challenges that India must address?

Lack of clear policy framework – A comprehensive SAF policy with time-bound blending targets, production incentives, and certification guidelines is urgently needed.

Feedstock prioritisation and sustainability – SAF feedstock selection must avoid competition with food crops and meet strict environmental sustainability standards.

Global certification compliance – SAF produced in India must adhere to international sustainability and emission reduction certification requirements to be globally accepted.

Investment in research and development – India must invest in SAF R&D to diversify production technologies, including pathways like Alcohol-to-Jet, Power-to-Liquid, and others.

Global competition – With the US and Europe rapidly building SAF ecosystems, India must act swiftly to capture market share.

What are the suggested measures?

Time-bound blending targets – The government should finalise ambitious yet achievable SAF blending mandates aligned with global standards like CORSIA.

Financial and production incentives – Production-linked incentives, tax breaks, feedstock subsidies, and concessional financing should be provided to encourage SAF production.

Sustainable feedstock aggregation – A robust supply chain for sustainable feedstock aggregation must be established through farmer incentives and technology support.

Technology neutrality and competition – All SAF production pathways should be encouraged, with market forces determining the most efficient technologies.

Public-private collaboration – Strong partnerships between government, private companies, and research institutions are essential to accelerate SAF ecosystem development.

Conventional jet fuel is made from petroleum, and its increased use pushes up the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. When thinking about ""decarbonizing the skies,"" the key to success is using recycled aviation fuel made from used cooking oil and urban trash, also known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Energy companies have an essential role to play in creating supply chains for SAF.

Used Frying Oil to Power Jet Engines Flying With Japan's First Mass Produced SAF

Airplanes will take to the skies fueled by oil already used to make tempura. Compared to petroleum-based fuel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel emits far fewer greenhouse gases because it is made from used materials such as cooking oil, wood chips, used plastic, and used paper. The reason for this low impact is that plants are the original raw materials processed to create SAF, and flora absorb CO2 as part of photosynthesis to live and grow.

Yokohama-based Saffaire Sky Energy LLC commenced mass production of SAF for the first time in Japan in FY2025. The company was established by Cosmo Oil Co. Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings Co., Ltd, along with the other founding partners JGC Holdings Corporation and Revo International Inc. The new firm will produce 30,000 kiloliters of SAF annually from 100% used cooking oil to be manufactured at Cosmo Oil's Sakai Refinery in Sakai-city, Osaka. The company will supply this sustainable fuel to Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and DHL Express, a major German international logistics company.

As people and goods increasingly move around the world, demand for air transport services will grow. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that the worldwide passenger number for air travel will exceed 5 billion people for the first time in 2025. Meanwhile, the Japanese government has a goal of making the nation a tourist-oriented nation and boosting the number of visitors to Japan from overseas to 60 million by 2030.

Aircraft CO2 emissions are far higher than trains. At one time, people in Europe traveling by air who were aware of climate change criticized themselves feeling a sense of “flight shame,” a judgement that was also cast onto air travel more generally. This growing sense of crisis is the reason SAF was first introduced for distribution across Europe. Global demand for SAF is now also expected to grow rapidly. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aims to reduce aviation industry greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relying on SAF to achieve this 2030 target. On the domestic front, Japan’s government has set the goal of replacing 10% of aviation fuel consumption across the nation with SAF by 2030.

In addition to tackling the conditions creating global warming, Japan is also confronting the serious issue of energy security. Saffaire Sky Energy producing SAF from used cooking oil procured domestically in Japan is a boon. This company's production of ""domestically produced fuel"" is highly significant exactly because Japan relies almost entirely on fossil fuel imports from overseas.

The key to the Saffaire’s SAF production is the stable supply of raw materials. In Japan, there is a system already in place whereby the majority of used cooking oil is collected from businesses. The firm procures used cooking oil to produce SAF from restaurant chains such as Marugame Seimen, a noodle shop chain operated by Marugame Udon, Inc. and Sushiro, a major Kaiten Sushi chain operated by Akindo Sushiro Co. Ltd.

In contrast to this, much of the cooking oil used in households is simply thrown away. It is now important to build a framework to lift the contribution of cooking oil from residential homes. To achieve this, the firm has partnered with large shopping outlets such as AEON Mall to place collection containers for used cooking oil at five commercial facilities across Osaka Prefecture near the Sakai Refinery.

Recycling has become a common practice for aluminum cans and plastic (PET) bottles with much investment into systems to collect, process and turn the discarded items into resources again.

This initiative reinforces ESMA’s alignment with the EU Green Deal, the Paris Agreement, and broader ESG objectives while advancing its internal carbon neutral strategy toward net-zero by 2050.

ESMA identified key emissions sources—business travel, energy consumption, and food services—as primary focus areas. The plan outlines actions such as:

Introducing an annual GHG budget for air travel

Optimizing office space by closing underused floors

Shifting catering to lower-carbon food options

Promoting eco-friendly staff practices

“As regulators hold markets accountable, we must apply the same standards internally,” said ESMA Executive Director Natasha Cazenave, emphasizing the agency’s leadership role in operational sustainability.

Up to 72% of ESMA’s 2027 reduction target can be achieved through direct measures, including replacing long-haul business flights with premium economy, increasing energy efficiency, and renegotiating office use. Beyond 2027, greater collaboration with external stakeholders—landlords, caterers, and the aviation sector—will be essential to meet the 2030 target.

(Nanowerk News) For researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, a new avenue for reducing carbon emissions can be found on the side. A side of salad dressing, that is. In 2020, the United States federal government committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. An important step toward carbon neutrality is embracing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from renewable feedstocks. As part of this initiative, Illinois engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel. Hong Yang, a professor of chemical & biomolecular engineering in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, and Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural & biological engineering in the Grainger College of Engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem. Their findings, published in Science Advances (""Upgrading biocrude oil into sustainable aviation fuel using zeolite-supported iron-molybdenum carbide nanocatalysts""), present a low-cost, scalable and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts. Illustration of the experimental setup. (Image: Reprinted from DOI:10.1126/sciadv.adu5777, CC BY) “There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,” said Zhang. “Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.” Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour. Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone. After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, the researchers used HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang’s lab. “Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,” Yang said. For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels. “We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition” said Siying Yu, a chemical & biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper. Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they’d like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.",https://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news3/id67182.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 01:02:39.072895

The Eagle County Board of Commissioners on Tuesday signed a letter of interest with SynTec Holdings of Morris, Illinois. That non-binding agreement is the first step toward SynTec building a plant on 13 acres of property at the landfill and using up to 90 tons per day of municipal solid waste to convert into aviation fuel.

According to the letter, which is a non-binding agreement, the county will authorize a 10-year lease with a 10-year renewal option with SynTec, which will build and operate a facility to convert solid waste into aviation fuel. That fuel would then be transported to Signature Aviation’s private aviation facility at the Eagle County Regional Airport, formerly the Vail Valley Jet Center. That fuel will then be mixed with standard aviation fuel and used in the private jets that use the facility. Signature Aviation has had a sustainable fuel program since 2022, but that fuel is trucked in from outside Eagle County.

According to the document, SynTec will be responsible for obtaining all necessary county land use approvals and will also be responsible for all project financing.

The letter states that the county will benefit from extending the life of the landfill. Syntec’s plant will use only “clean” household waste. No hazardous or construction waste will be allowed.

Asked by Commissioner Jeanne McQueeney to define “sustainable aviation fuel,” SynTec CEO Wayne McFarland said that his firm’s process “puts less or no new carbon into the environment.” Another gallon of fossil fuel drilled, refined and put into a vehicle puts more carbon into the environment, McFarland said. Sustainable fuel uses material that has already put carbon into the environment, extracts energy from it, and uses it as fuel.

McFarland said the project will ultimately be an “amazing” one for Eagle County.

“There are no downsides to this,” he said, noting that the amount of waste used will allow the county to be almost “landfill-free.” And, he added, with people flying out of the Eagle County Regional Airport on sustainable fuel, “Everybody’s going to want to be you.”

Commissioner Matt Scherr noted that the document approved Tuesday is just a letter of intent.

Trump threatens 50pc Brazil tariff

Washington, 9 July (Argus) — US president Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 50pc tariff on imports from Brazil from 1 August, citing the ongoing trial of that country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump's letter to Brazil's president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, released on Wednesday, is one of the 22 that the US leader sent to his foreign counterparts since 7 July, announcing new tariff rates that the US will be charging on imports from those countries. But his letter to Brazil stands out for allegations of a ""witch hunt"" against Bolsonaro, who — much like Trump — disputed his electoral defeat and attempted to stay in office. Brazil's supreme court qualified Bolsonaro's actions in 2022 as an attempted coup, ordering him to stand trial. Trump said he will impose the 50pc tariff because ""in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections and the Fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans"". The latter is a reference to orders by judges in Brazil to suspend social media accounts for spreading ""misinformation"". Trump separately said he would direct US trade authorities to launch an investigation of Brazil's treatment of US social media platforms — an action likely to result in additional tariffs. Trump's letter to Lula also contains language similar to that included in letters sent to 21 other foreign leaders, accusing Brazil of unfair trade practices and suggesting that the only way to avoid payments of tariffs is if Brazilian companies ""decide to build or manufacture product within the US"". The Trump administration since 5 April has been charging a 10pc extra ""Liberation Day"" tariff on most imports — energy commodities and critical minerals are exceptions — from Brazil and nearly every foreign trade partner. Trump on 9 April imposed even higher tariffs on key trading partners, only to delay them the same day until 9 July. On 7 July, Trump signed an executive order further delaying the implementation of higher rates until 12:01am ET (04:01 GMT) on 1 August. Brasilia did not immediately react to Trump's threat of higher tariffs. Trump earlier this week threatened to impose 10pc tariffs on any country cooperating with the Brics group, which includes Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa. Lula hosted a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro on 6-7 July. By Haik Gugarats Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025. Argus Media group .

Australian liquid fuels policy to free up ACCUs: CEFC

Sydney, 9 July (Argus) — Annual demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) could be reduced by as much as 7.5mn t of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2050 if Australia adopted policy changes to develop a low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry, according to a report this week. Encouraging companies to reduce direct scope 1 emissions through changes to the federal safeguard mechanism and/or voluntary adoption would drive the development of an Australian LCLF market and free up ACCUs for use in sectors that cannot achieve on-site decarbonisation due to technical challenges, state-owned green investment fund Clean Energy Finance (CEFC) said in a report authored by consultancy Deloitte . Under its central case scenario, which would involve constraining the use of carbon offsets, CEFC said that a 7bn litres/yr LCLF market could be created by 2050, abating up to 12mn t CO2e in 2040 and 20mn t CO2e in 2050 as a result. Annual ACCU demand across six sectors covered by the report — mining, aviation, rail, heavy freight, maritime, and construction — could be reduced by around 6.8mn t CO2e by 2050 in that case, to 2.4mn t CO2e/yr. Demand for ACCUs could reach as low as 1.7mn t CO2e by 2050 under an accelerated scenario, which would involve EU-style mandates for LCLF. Demand for ACCUs would be around 9.2mn t CO2e/yr under the base scenario, which assumes a market-led transition in which carbon prices remain low and LCLF demand is driven by a small group of customers willing to pay significant premiums to reduce their scope 3 emissions. 30pc cap under the safeguard mechanism The central case scenario assumes a hypothetical government intervention to cap the use of ACCUs under the safeguard mechanism at 30pc of the baseline for liquid fuel-related emissions. Currently, there is no limit to the number of ACCUs or safeguard mechanism credits (SMCs) that facilities can use to manage their excess emissions under the scheme, but those that surrender carbon units equivalent to 30pc or more of their baselines need to publish a statement explaining why they have not undertaken more on-site abatement activities . The central case scenario also assumes the removal of baseline adjustments for trade-exposed baseline-adjusted facilities . Adopting a minimum 70pc direct on-site decarbonisation would trigger a positive supply-side response, driving significant technology deployment and competition between pathways and feedstocks, the CEFC said. Stakeholders claim that the current safeguard mechanism and ACCU pricing are not enough to drive early LCLF uptake, the report said. Policy intervention is needed to accelerate the bridging of the cost gap between the LCLF production cost and the ACCU price, which is currently not expected to happen until the 2040s, the report said. A market-led transition, on the other hand, would lead to greater pressure on the ACCU market, with up to 7.35mn t CO2e of ACCUs needed to meet demand in 2035 and 15.5mn t CO2e in 2050. ACCU supply reached an all-time high of 18.78mn in 2024 and is forecast at 19mn-24mn for 2025 . But the industry needs to boost future issuances to address an expected shift in the supply-demand balance within a few years .

EIA cuts 2025 US biofuel outlook, ups 2026 view

New York, 8 July (Argus) — The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year. US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook . That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production. EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth. The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import. Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years. In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation. Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report. EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption. But the agency now sees US production and consumption balanced at 49,000 b/d next year, a 1,000 b/d increase from its June expectations. The Environmental Protection Agency last month proposed substantially raising biomass-based diesel mandates in the next two years, while also potentially throttling credits for biofuels made abroad or from foreign feedstocks. And President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend a sprawling budget bill that extends a tax credit for biofuels through 2029 and, starting next year, ups subsidies for crop-based fuels while limiting eligibility to North American feedstocks.

French diesel, HVO customs data mislabelled: Eurostat

Barcelona, 8 July (Argus) — French firms have mislabelled imports of 10ppm diesel as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) this year, following confusion over new customs codes, EU data service Eurostat has said. The confusion has come about after the introduction of a new import-export (CN) code for HVO that took effect at the start of 2025. Some French data will be restated. A diesel code of 27101943 was discontinued at the end of 2024 and was replaced by 27101944. A new CN code 27101942 for HVO was introduced. HVO is produced by treating vegetable oil with hydrogen, counts against biodiesel blend mandates, but is molecularly separate from biodiesel output by esterification. When customs data for 2025 began to be published at the end of the first quarter, France appeared to be importing large amounts of HVO from Saudi Arabia and the US. Cargoes from the former amounted to around 255,000t in the first quarter. Saudi Arabia has no HVO production known by Argus , nor does it re-export cargoes. It is France's largest diesel supplier. There were also 140,000t labelled as HVO from the US in January-March. But because the EU has anti-dumping and countervailing duties on US HVO imports, shipments of this size appeared questionable. The US is the second biggest diesel supplier to France. The mislabelling has made French and EU HVO traffic difficult to track. It has distorted French diesel import data , which show imports have fallen sharply. Argus first questioned the numbers in March when initial 2025 customs data were released. These queries were rebuffed, but after a follow up in May Eurostat said French customs had ""confirmed that there has been an input error"". New data will be supplied by France at an unspecified time this year, it said. By Adam Porter Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

The advocacy supports the business action and the business action strengthens the advocacy while both accelerate results.","Circularity isn’t just about environmental responsibility; it’s a competitive business strategy.

Individual business action is important but true transformation happens at the market level.

The most effective leaders are combining internal circular initiatives with external collective advocacy.

We don’t have time for incremental change. In addition to its devastating planetary impacts, the linear “take, make, waste” system does not offer the long-term stability and resilience our economy needs to deliver prosperity.

The business case for change has never been stronger: economic headwinds, supply chain disruptions, consumer distrust and geopolitical conflict are reshaping the landscape. In times of disruption, entrenched systems are questioned, opening the door for innovation and new market leadership.

Leaders have two choices: act with urgency to accelerate change or adapt to markets that will change around them.

Risk-savvy industries are sounding the alarm

Business leaders increasingly agree that finding ways to succeed commercially while respecting planetary boundaries is a key business imperative. Just ask anyone in the insurance industry – the supreme arbiters of risk.

Insurance leaders have been consistently warning that the effects of climate change will make insurance premiums unviable, potentially undermining the entire financial system and putting capital at risk. In the food industry, manufacturers are seeing that unless they act to help nature thrive, their supply chains will literally dry up.

“

The most visionary business leaders are looking beyond their own operations to transform the conditions in which they compete.

”

Innovative leadership can shape the future of markets but it requires a shift in mindset.

The circular economy is not a nice-to-have sustainability play; it’s a competitive strategy to generate long-term value, reduce risk to capital and build resilience, balancing commercial interests with the needs of the planet.

Through design, we can eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials at their highest value and regenerate nature, creating an economy that benefits people, businesses and the natural world.

It’s firmly on leaders’ agendas. Today, 75% of businesses recognize circularity as important, up from 40% just three years ago. Capital investment in circular initiatives has grown by over 70% in the same period. The shift is real and it’s happening now.

Scale over individual action unlocks potential

Here’s what we’ve learned: individual business transformation gets you started but market transformation gets you results. The more businesses prioritise reuse initiatives, the easier it becomes for the entire market.

The most visionary business leaders are looking beyond their own operations to transform the conditions in which they compete. Because while markets continue to externalize environmental costs and undervalue crucial transition investments, even the most committed businesses hit systemic barriers.

This requires more than just agreeing on a vision – it’s a new type of leadership. Businesses need to collaborate and cooperate in new ways to break down shared barriers.

Individual business action towards a shared vision is crucial to identifying systemic barriers and can accelerate solution development. However, it’s time to take the next step, to take everything we’ve learned about roadblocks to change and build shared pathways through them.

Commercial collaboration changes the game

Commercial collaboration paired with collective advocacy can unlock circular solutions at scale. When businesses align on systemic barriers, we can present a unified voice to policymakers, who need clear evidence of positive business intent to create supportive policies.

Policy alone will not move fast enough, though – businesses can go further. By working together, companies can invest in solutions, launch joint ventures, share infrastructure or co-develop products and services that create new circular value.

“

The circular economy is a strategic business imperative.

”

Take critical minerals. Tech and energy firms, as well as governments, are seeking to safeguard access to critical minerals such as copper, nickel, and lithium, in the face of an expected fivefold rise in demand by 2040.

A circular economy for these materials could keep them circulating at their highest value, closing the supply-demand gap while insulating companies against supply shocks and price volatility. The environmental wins are substantial but the business case drives action.

Collaboration the catalyst for circular scale

Commercial collaboration can accelerate innovation, create new markets, build key infrastructure and drive customer adoption much more efficiently and effectively than businesses focusing only on transforming themselves. And they can still compete robustly in the marketplace.

With the right governance, safeguards and ambition, commercial collaboration can expedite system change well within the bounds of competition laws.

We have to redesign the “rules” and how businesses operate within them. To achieve a thriving circular economy, we need policies that support innovation and innovation that supports infrastructure.

The plastics industry is working towards this right now. Over 280 companies, including market leaders such as PepsiCo and Unilever, have joined the Business Coalition for a Plastics Treaty to speak with an aligned voice in advocating for global regulatory changes for every business using plastic.

In parallel, these businesses continue to work towards reducing their own use of virgin plastic. The advocacy supports the business action and the business action strengthens the advocacy while both accelerate results.

Towards market transformation

This twin strategy of working towards changes at the market level while pursuing parallel investments within businesses can break markets out of linear limitations. It takes negotiating skills and new thinking but next-gen collaboration and cooperation create unstoppable momentum.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_6uIwcv_i75P65cl_ty65hMgzIe1pKI9yimAcAtCM0G0.jpeg,N,,2025-07-09 17:20:11.816963

As part of their ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship and innovation in aviation, Integrity Flight Support is proud to announce its partnership with 4AIR, offering Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through a flexible and accessible program known as Book & Claim.

What is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel. Rather than being derived from petroleum, SAF is made from sustainable feedstocks, including used cooking oils, tallow, and municipal waste, with the potential to include algae or power-to-liquid fuels in the future.

SAF is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works seamlessly with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. When blended with conventional Jet-A fuel, SAF meets all safety and performance standards (ASTM D1655 or DEFSTAN 91-91), and significantly reduces lifecycle carbon emissions — up to 90% with neat SAF, and typically 20–25% when blended.

Despite its benefits, SAF remains scarce at most airports due to logistical and supply challenges — that’s where Book & Claim comes in.

✈️ What is Book & Claim — and How Does It Work?

Book & Claim is a long-standing chain of custody model that enables flight operators to purchase the environmental benefits of SAF, even when physical SAF isn’t available at their airport.

Here’s how it works:

Producers deliver SAF into a local pipeline or airport fuel system near where it’s made, minimizing transportation emissions and costs.

The fuel is sold as regular Jet-A (without its sustainability attributes) to a third party.

You, the operator, purchase the environmental attributes of that SAF, known as a “green premium.”

You get to claim the emissions reductions as part of your carbon footprint reduction strategy, while contributing to increased demand and future scalability of SAF.

This approach is similar to how Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) work in the electricity market. The actual molecules of SAF don’t reach your aircraft, but your purchase helps displace fossil fuel use globally, encourages more SAF production, and allows you to meet sustainability targets — all without changing where or how you fuel.

✅ Why Book & Claim Makes Sense

Immediate Emission Reductions: Supports decarbonization goals without needing physical SAF delivery.

Market Expansion: Helps SAF producers reach broader markets, boosting industry viability.

Cost Efficiency: Reduces distribution costs and makes SAF more affordable over time.

Verifiable Transactions: All transactions are third-party verified through platforms like 4AIR’s Assure SAF Registry, ensuring emissions reductions are never double-counted

The strategic launch underscores ORLEN's commitment to its 2035 strategy, which prioritizes the expansion of its product portfolio while addressing the urgent need for decarbonization across both supply and demand chains

SAF is distinguished by its production from renewable or waste-derived feedstocks, adhering to strict sustainability criteria that prevent deforestation or the depletion of vital food and water resources. These feedstocks can include a diverse range of materials such as used cooking oils, as well as municipal, industrial, agricultural, and forestry waste. Crucially, the renewable component of SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel, making it fully compatible with existing aircraft engine technologies. This seamless integration allows for immediate adoption by airlines, facilitating an instant reduction in emissions from flight operations. SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% throughout its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and production method.

The introduction of SAF has been met with enthusiasm from key stakeholders in the Polish aviation sector.

Beyond its environmental benefits, ORLEN's introduction of SAF is also a proactive measure to comply with the European Union's ambitious ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation. This regulation mandates that sustainable aviation fuels must constitute at least 2% of total jet fuel sales by 2025, with further increments planned to reach 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and a significant 70% by 2050. The regulation applies to EU airports that handled over 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tonnes of cargo in the preceding year.

To meet the increasing demand and regulatory obligations, ORLEN is actively developing a hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) facility at its Plock refinery. This facility will enable the domestic production of aviation fuel from used cooking oils, reducing reliance on imported SAF components. The HVO project, with an estimated value of over PLN 1.4 billion, is slated for completion in 2025. Until the facility becomes operational, ORLEN will continue to source SAF components from abroad.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-09 15:12:12.109814

The Royal Air Force display team, the Red Arrows, will make aviation history at the forthcoming Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), as the display will be powered entirely by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The performances will be the first time a national aerobatic team has not only flown on SAF, but also used a biofuel in the production of the iconic vapour trails.

Usually created by injecting a mixture of diesel and dye into the hot exhaust of the Hawk, for RIAT the Red Arrows will use a hydrotreated vegetable oil, a renewable biofuel, to paint the skies.

It follows the Red Arrows’ first 100% SAF flight in June, as part of King Charles’ official birthday celebrations.

The RAF pushes forward with sustainable aviation fuel

While civilian aviation led much of the early work on sustainable aviation fuel, air forces around the world are now taking steps to modernise fleets and reduce carbon footprints. It’s not just about saving the planet, but also delivers fuel resiliency in a time of geopolitical instability.

The Royal Air Force (RAF) has been particularly proactive on sustainability. In 2022, it flew a Voyager, the military version of the A330, on 100% SAF in a world-first for the type.

Then, in 2023, in conjunction with the Sustainable Skies World Summit, a Voyager powered by 43% SAF successfully completed an air-to-air refuelling flight from Brize Norton.

In 2023, the RAF conducted mid-air refuelling of both the Typhoon and the C-130 Hercules, and the Typhoon first flew a display on 100% SAF at RIAT in 2024.

The Typhoon is set to display using 100% SAF again this year. Kate McKinley, Director of People and Sustainability at Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises, said:

Three Air Displays Powered By SAF

The RAF is exploring alternative fuels to power both current and future aircraft, aiming to reduce dependence on global fossil fuel supply chains and enhance energy security, ultimately strengthening operational resilience. According to a statement by the RIAT, the Red Arrows will perform three times on the SAF, as well as feature in various special formation flypasts across the weekend event.

Also flying on SAF will be the RAF’s Typhoon display team, which made history by performing its first full routine using sustainable fuel at last year’s show. More than 170,000 people are expected at RAF Fairford for the aviation showcase, which is due to take place on Friday 18th, Saturday 19th, and Sunday 20th.

The flights are being made possible through the support of Air Space Intelligence, Intel Foundry, and Team Lewis, with HVO supplied by Power Electrics and SAF provided by AFS Aviation. Commenting on the news, Kate McKinley, Director of People and Sustainability at Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises, said:

“Their nine-ship team are known across the world, so we are delighted to be hosting this landmark display here at RAF Fairford. In 2024 we were lucky enough to secure the RAF Typhoon’s first public display on SAF and being able to continue the Typhoon for another year and add the Red Arrows is great for us as an event.”

The RAF Started Testing SAF In 2021

The RAF has been steadily advancing its testing of sustainable aviation fuel on military aircraft. In November 2021, it successfully flew a microlight powered by synthetic fuel derived from air and water. A major milestone followed in 2022, when an RAF Voyager (Airbus A330 MRTT) became the first large military aircraft to complete a 90-minute flight powered entirely by 100% SAF.

Less than a year later, the RAF expanded its SAF trials to include air-to-air refueling missions. It conducted its first such operation using a SAF blend of 46 to 48%, refueling both a Eurofighter Typhoon and a C-130J Hercules. During 2023, the RAF’s Voyager was used in a routine training mission with a 43% SAF blend for air-to-air refueling of Typhoon fighter jets.

SAF is made from a variety of renewable and waste-based feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, animal fats, agricultural and forestry residues, and even municipal waste. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute up to 65% of reductions by 2050.

Net-Zero Emissions By 2050: A Pipe Dream?

ambitious and far from easy. While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a promising part of the solution, it is not a silver bullet. SAF faces significant hurdles, including high production costs, limited scalability, and concerns about its true environmental impact.

In the UK, for instance, SAF is primarily produced from used cooking oil, some of which is imported from Asia. This long-distance shipping contributes to carbon emissions, with maritime transport accounting for about 2% of global CO2 output. Speaking to the BBC, Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, expressed skepticism: “It's very hard to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel. There are aviation fuels that are less polluting than those currently used, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.”",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/red-20250505-255-ve_day_80_flypast-295_1-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 15:12:19.755090

This agreement marks the latest commitment in a long-standing partnership that began in 1994, when the airline installed the CF34-3B engine on its CRJ200s.

The CF34 family has been the backbone of OO's fleet, with more than 1,200 engines in service, including the CF34-3 B, 8C, and the new 8E variants. Reiterating its reputation for dependability, GE Aerospace reports a remarkable dispatch reliability of 99.97% over a 12-month period.

Fleet Modernization, Sustainability

According to SkyWest's Chief Commercial Officer Wade Steel, the CF34 is ""the workhorse of regional air travel."" With strong operational commonality, the airline's fleet renewal strategy is maintained with the new engine order.

Crucially, in line with industry-wide initiatives to lower carbon emissions, all CF34 engines are authorized for use with SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) blends.

Market Impact, Strategic Partnership

Russell Stokes, president of GE Commercial Engines & Services, emphasized the partnership's long-term character. The 60-engine spare parts agreement demonstrates both SkyWest's growth and GE's commitment to supporting regional carriers.

Operating out of nearly 500 aircraft and reaching 265 North American destinations, OO carried 42 million passengers in 2024 under code-share agreements with United Airlines (UA), Delta Air Lines (DL), American Airlines (AA), and Alaska Airlines (AS).

""This RFS proposal is the most exciting since the RFS was expanded in 2007,"" Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw told the EPA.
Finalizing the proposed renewable fuels blending levels will provide the right boost at the right time for our farmers.
And 24 billion gallons must mean 24 billion gallons for total RFS volumes.
Cooper also said the RFA ""strongly supports"" EPA's proposed 50% reduction in RINs generated for import-based renewable fuels and fully agrees that there are ""reduced economic, energy security, and environmental benefits"" provided by imported renewable fuels.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- Biofuels groups testifying in a public hearing on Tuesday on the Renewable Fuel Standard volumes proposal could hardly contain their excitement about what they say is one of the strongest-ever RFS proposals for 2026-2027 volumes.

All the while, the groups expressed concern about how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will address a backlog of more than 180 small-refinery exemptions still pending from previous years.

Biofuels interests told the agency they supported the commitment to account for prospective SREs in the final rule and to reallocate gallons exempted.

""This RFS proposal is the most exciting since the RFS was expanded in 2007,"" Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw told the EPA.

""I cannot overstate the optimism it has caused in rural America at a time when farm income has plummeted and talk of tariffs triggers uncertainty. Finalizing the proposed renewable fuels blending levels will provide the right boost at the right time for our farmers. It will enhance American energy dominance, lower prices for consumers and improve the environment. IRFA urges the EPA to maintain the robust RFS levels in the final rule.""

When it comes to RFS volumes and the effect SREs can have, Shaw said ""at the end of the day, 15 billion gallons needs to mean 15 billion gallons for conventional renewable fuels like ethanol. And 24 billion gallons must mean 24 billion gallons for total RFS volumes. SREs should be few and far between.""

Shaw said the agency could reallocate gallons lost to any exemptions.

""The optimism around the RFS is real today and it would be a mistake to pull the rug out from under one of the only bright spots in the current ag economy,"" he said.

Shaw also called on the EPA to unleash E15 access by eliminating regulations.

""EPA needs to reboot the effort begun during President Trump's first term to remove outdated regulations limiting E15 sales,"" Shaw said.

""E15 should be allowed in all fueling infrastructure from the storage tank through the nozzle. Requiring retailers to spend thousands of dollars to replace perfectly compatible equipment serves only to slow down the growth of consumer access to E15.""

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said during the hearing that ""strong"" renewable volume obligations will play a key role in delivering on President Trump's vision for U.S. ""energy dominance and rural prosperity.""

""If finalized, these RVOs would unlock investments, create jobs and support growth in rural America by expanding our country's renewable fuel production and use,"" she said.

""By setting conventional biofuel blending volumes at 15 billion gallons for two years, this proposal will create the kind of certainty that spurs innovation and truly unleashes American energy dominance. This is the strongest RFS proposal we've ever seen, with the highest volumes ever, showing this administration's commitment to American biofuel producers and the farmers that depend on them.""

Skor joined other biofuels interests in urging the EPA to make it clear that small-refinery exemptions will not be ""granted recklessly"" and that any gallons lost will be accounted for in the market.

""Only with these pieces in place can this proposal truly deliver the game-changing impact the president wants it to have and that the nation's biofuel producers and rural communities are counting on,"" Skor said.

Clean Fuels Alliance America CEO Donnell Rehagen said the proposed bump in biomass-based diesel volumes have already had a positive effect on the markets.

""Our industry has made substantial investments over the past several years in both biofuel production, feedstock supply, and distribution infrastructure,"" he said during the virtual hearing.

""Domestic production of biodiesel and renewable diesel has doubled since 2020 and continues to grow. We supplied more than 5 billion gallons of biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) to the U.S. market in 2024 and we are poised to deliver more in 2026. We are pleased that since the proposed rule came out the markets have reacted in a positive fashion. However, uncertainty around small-refinery exemptions still hangs over the industry. We ask that you sustain the volumes as proposed to ensure that our capacity is fully utilized.""

Brian Jennings, CEO of the American Coalition for Ethanol, said while his group supports EPA's proposal, he encouraged the agency to consider using its statutory authority to exceed the 15-billion-gallon conventional biofuel threshold.

Jennings said that would help offset the potential impact of lost export markets and ensure U.S. ethanol producers are not displaced by surplus renewable identification numbers, or RINs, from other categories.

Jennings highlighted ACE's ongoing efforts to establish the link between low-carbon farming practices and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production tax credit recently extended by Congress.

Jennings emphasized the importance of rewarding farmers for implementing practices that reduce the carbon intensity of ethanol.

""In partnership with USDA, DOE, 13 ethanol companies and hundreds of farmers, ACE is currently leading a project to unlock new markets and tax credits, such as 45Z, based on low-carbon farming,"" Jennings said.

Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper said the proposal was ""an important step toward achieving President Trump's vision for lower gas prices, a stronger agriculture industry, and American energy dominance.""

While the RFA applauded EPA's decision to prospectively reallocate any renewable fuel volumes lost to small-refinery exemptions in the final rule, Cooper cautioned that the EPA must be ""extremely judicious"" in determining whether any refiners have truly suffered, or will suffer, ""disproportionate economic hardship"" related to compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard, adding that ""it is critically important that EPA accurately estimate exempted volumes in the final rule to ensure that the volume requirements that are actually implemented in 2026 and 2027 match those that are published in the rule.""

Cooper also said the RFA ""strongly supports"" EPA's proposed 50% reduction in RINs generated for import-based renewable fuels and fully agrees that there are ""reduced economic, energy security, and environmental benefits"" provided by imported renewable fuels.

He said the enhanced recordkeeping and reporting procedures in the proposal, however, are not needed for corn-based ethanol given that the U.S. does not import corn ethanol and corn imports make up just one 10th of 1% of the U.S. corn supply.

By aggregating and matching supply and demand, it is hoped that the hydrogen mechanism will help firms identify infrastructure needs, access financial solutions, and build long term partnerships.
The hydrogen mechanism is just the first step, with the Commission set to roll out additional tools in the coming months.
This includes a raw materials mechanism - to help industries secure access to essential minerals and metals – and the gas mechanism – to support the transition from natural gas to renewable gases like biomethane.
Stakeholders can now register on the platform and subscribe to the hydrogen mechanism, with the Commission encouraging companies of all sizes – from energy producers to industrial consumers – to participate.","The Commission’s new digital hub, launched by the EU under Regulation (EU) 2024/1789, is designed to help European companies secure critical resources while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. It will serve as a central marketplace for energy and raw materials, starting with the launch of its first mechanism – the hydrogen mechanism.

Garrett Monaghan, renewable energy expert at Pinsent Masons, said: “The mechanism will enhance security of supply while also enabling the decarbonisation of sectors such as industry and transport where reducing carbon emissions is both difficult and urgently needed.”

The hydrogen initiative, launched on 2 July, will match suppliers of hydrogen and its derivatives, such as ammonia, methanol and electro-sustainable aviation fuel, to offtakers, building on the success of the AggregateEU platform that achieved similar goals within the gas market. The platform will also perform a number of other services, such as displaying information about available financing solutions as well as collecting and using market data to assess supply and demand. The hub will also use market insights to support the development of infrastructure for hydrogen transport and storage, providing a platform for assessing potential interest in infrastructure projects.

By aggregating and matching supply and demand, it is hoped that the hydrogen mechanism will help firms identify infrastructure needs, access financial solutions, and build long term partnerships. The first round of matching supply and demand is planned for September, and the mechanism is authorised to operate under the European Hydrogen Bank until 31 December 2029.

The hydrogen mechanism is just the first step, with the Commission set to roll out additional tools in the coming months. This includes a raw materials mechanism - to help industries secure access to essential minerals and metals – and the gas mechanism – to support the transition from natural gas to renewable gases like biomethane. These mechanisms will be integrated into the same online hub.

Stakeholders can now register on the platform and subscribe to the hydrogen mechanism, with the Commission encouraging companies of all sizes – from energy producers to industrial consumers – to participate.

EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook.
The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation.
In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.
The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.","The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year.

US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production.

EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth.

The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import.

Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years.

In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation.

Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.

EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.

This move aims to diversify Mexico's energy mix and reduce its reliance on fossil fuel production.

The updated statute outlines PEMEX's participation in the exploration of hydrogen fields and geoenergy projects. The NOC will also explore electricity generation projects based on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Additionally, PEMEX plans to engage in the generation of biofuels, including biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

One initiative to promote clean energy use includes establishing a photovoltaic generation network for self-consumption. This involves installing solar panels on the rooftops of PEMEX franchised service stations, aiming for energy savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

In geoenergy, PEMEX anticipates geothermal projects and electricity generation at existing assets, such as disused offshore platforms. Mexico possesses high meteorological and oceanic potential from tides, currents, waves, and wind, which can be leveraged with these out-of-operation platforms. The company also plans specific projects to reduce gas flaring.

Furthermore, PEMEX is collaborating with the Federal Electricity Commission on three cogeneration power plants. These, located at the Tula and Salina Cruz refineries and the Cangrejera Petrochemical Complex, are projected to generate an estimated 2,422MW. Their purpose is to use residual heat from industrial plants to produce electricity efficiently. Operations for these plants are expected to begin in 2029 and 2030.

SAF and Brazil’s Potential as a Sustainable Fuel Hub A particularly insightful discussion during the summit centered on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), underscoring Brazil’s potential to become a global SAF leader.","By Victoria Moura, Agritecture | Post–World Agri-Tech South America 2025 Recap

At the World Agri-Tech South America Summit in São Paulo, one message resonated above all: Brazil’s agriculture is evolving into a new agri-culture—one defined not merely by yields and exports but by how technology, sustainability, and collaboration converge to future-proof food systems in a climate-challenged world. Brazil already feeds 10% of the global population while using land with remarkable efficiency, having increased its agricultural production by nearly 600% over the past 40 years while expanding its planted area by only around 100% (Embrapa, 2023). However, to maintain its competitiveness while meeting growing international demands for traceability, quality, and environmental stewardship, systemic transformation is essential, and technology will be at the heart of this transition.

Building the Right Tech for Real Farmer Needs

Brazilian agrifoodtech funding surged in early 2025, with US $76.8 million raised in Q1 alone—a 32% increase from the previous quarter and an 85% year-over-year rise—positioning Brazil to capture 55% of all Latin American agtech funding in 2024, despite representing just 1.5% of global agtech investment (AgFunderNews, The Brazilian Report). Additionally, consultancy Liga Ventures reported that Brazilian agtech startups received over BRL 1 billion (~US $177 million) in 2024, the second-highest year on record.

This momentum reflects growing confidence in agtech’s potential to drive transformation in Brazil’s agriculture. Yet, as emphasized during summit discussions with Embrapa, Danone, and ABAG leaders, a critical disconnect remains: many startups focus on developing sophisticated, capital-intensive technologies designed to attract investors, while often overlooking the urgent, practical needs of farmers on the ground. This gap is particularly relevant in Brazil, where over 80% of the country’s more than 5 million agricultural establishments are smallholder farms (IBGE Agricultural Census, 2023).

Smallholder farmers require affordable, low-complexity technologies that can address critical challenges such as irrigation, pest management, and soil health while enabling adaptation to climate variability and water stress. For example, a 2020 Embrapa survey found that only ~3% of irrigating producers had properties over 1,000 hectares, while 64% irrigated less than 5 hectares, underscoring that irrigation in Brazil is predominantly practiced by small- to mid-scale farmers (Embrapa). Research by the World Bank (2024) highlights that prioritizing irrigation and basic mechanization in smallholder systems can increase yields by up to 50% while reducing labor demands and post-harvest losses by 30%.

Silvia Dávila of Danone highlighted this need for targeted, appropriate technologies, citing Danone's Flora Project as an example, which increased smallholder milk farmers’ incomes by 17% while reducing methane emissions by 40%. “Supporting farmers with the right tools transforms communities while advancing climate goals,” Dávila emphasized, underlining that impactful technology must be designed with, not just for, farmers.

A key discussion point arising from these insights is the need for startups and investors to collaborate with cooperatives, extension services, and local governments to design solutions that consider Brazil’s geographic and socioeconomic diversity while building viable business models for rural communities.

Integrating Technology Across the Supply Chain

Brazil’s agricultural supply chain is vast, complex, and costly, with logistics—including road and port expenses—accounting for 30–40% of the total cost of soybeans, according to a USP/Esalq study, with overall transport costs estimated to be 8–9 times higher than in the United States, significantly reducing competitiveness (Datamar News). Road transport, predominantly reliant on diesel trucks, forms the backbone of Brazil’s export logistics, leaving the sector heavily exposed to fuel price volatility and infrastructure bottlenecks.

Meanwhile, Brazil imports about 85% of its fertilizer needs, making input costs highly vulnerable to global price swings, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical disruptions (University of Navarra). During the World Agri-Tech South America Summit, Embrapa’s leadership emphasized that fostering local bioinput industries and expanding domestic fertilizer production are critical strategies to reduce Brazil’s vulnerability while promoting sustainability and climate resilience within the sector.

Otavio Lopes of EY argued for a paradigm shift: moving from a linear, reactive supply chain toward an interconnected, predictive ecosystem. “We need to transition from cost-focused to resilience-focused systems,” he noted, emphasizing the necessity for digital integration, real-time data visibility, and blockchain-enabled traceability across the supply chain to meet the evolving expectations of global markets and consumers demanding deforestation-free, ethically sourced products.

A critical insight is that technology integration must align with infrastructure development and policy frameworks, enabling supply chains to evolve into systems that are efficient, climate-resilient, and inclusive of smallholders, who collectively produce a significant share of Brazil’s coffee, fruits, vegetables, and dairy exports.

“Digitization in agriculture is not just about software adoption; it is about a cultural change within organizations. As an export leader, Brazil’s continued strength globally will depend on tech integration, digitalization, and innovation. With climate pressures, rising consumer expectations for quality, and tightening sustainability regulations globally, efficiency and traceability are not luxuries—they are prerequisites for remaining competitive.” (Victoria Moura, South America Representative at Agritecture).

Financing Innovation: The Role of Credit

Adopting technology and sustainability practices requires financing structures aligned with the realities of Brazil’s farmers. In its 2025/26 agricultural plan, the Brazilian government allocated a record R$78.2 billion to PRONAF, a 3% increase from the previous cycle. However, while credit lines for essential food production remain relatively low—around 2% for organic and 3% for staple crops—other lines, including some family-farming commodity and investment loans, now carry rates ranging from 5–6.5%, and even up to 8% in certain categories (Exame, 2025). These higher rates, introduced amid broader economic tightening, risk limiting access for low-income farmers who depend on affordable credit to modernize, invest in sustainable practices, and adopt new technologies.

Brazil’s rural credit system remains heavily dependent on public policy, but private financial institutions are increasingly stepping in to complement these efforts. As Bradesco’s Head of Agribusiness, Nadege Saad, emphasized during the summit, “credit is a tool, but without guidance and data, it becomes a burden rather than a solution.” This reflects a key point raised during the event: credit accessibility must be paired with technical assistance and digital tools to ensure effective capital allocation, improve productivity, and reduce default risks.

IFC specialists in 2024 further underscored that integrating climate-smart criteria and fintech innovations into rural credit structures can create a virtuous cycle of sustainability and financial resilience. This includes redesigning credit lines to incentivize eco-friendly practices—such as offering preferential rates or rebates for farmers adopting drought-resistant crops or efficient irrigation systems—and leveraging digital farm management and risk assessment platforms, enabling lenders to track crop conditions and climate risks in real time for improved credit decisions (World Bank Blogs).

Additionally, IFC and its partners are exploring carbon credit integration within rural credit programs, allowing farmers who adopt regenerative practices to generate tradable carbon credits that can supplement loan repayments or farm income, making sustainable investments more financially attractive (World Bank Blogs, Agreena). These blended approaches—linking financial incentives, digital monitoring, and carbon markets—can accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices while lowering the risk profile of loans by enhancing farm resilience and diversification.

This signals an opportunity for agritech startups and financial institutions in Brazil to collaborate on embedded fintech solutions, offering credit products tied to technology adoption for irrigation, bioinputs, precision tools, and renewable energy systems.

Automation and the Workforce: A Brazilian Perspective

Although Brazil has historically benefited from affordable and abundant rural labor, the reality is shifting. The rural population declined from 15.3% in 2012 to 12.7% in 2022 (IBGE, 2023), driven by rural-to-urban migration and aging demographics, with over 33% of farmers now above the age of 55 (MAPA, 2024). The lack of generational renewal is evident, with young people discouraged by legal restrictions on youth labor, limited infrastructure in rural areas, and a desire for urban employment opportunities. According to IPEA (2024), this trend risks a 12% reduction in Brazil’s agricultural workforce over the next decade if interventions are not made.

Furthermore, the high cost of formal employment due to CLT labor laws and taxes means hiring a worker can cost employers 100-150% more than the nominal wage (CNA, 2023). This structural burden pressures producers, making automation an increasingly attractive option.

Automation in agriculture is not about replacing labor—it’s about enhancing it. According to McKinsey (2024), automation can increase productivity by 25% while reducing operational costs by 15-20%, allowing workers to shift to higher-value roles such as farm oversight, data analysis, and precision operations management.

“Automation allows us to manage complexity, reduce human error, and optimize decision-making in a way that manual processes simply can’t match,” said Marcelo Batistella of BASF during the summit, emphasizing that automation is not a threat but a tool to improve efficiency, quality, and competitiveness.

An additional dimension is that precision agriculture and site-specific management practices, enabled by automation, are crucial for scaling regenerative agriculture across Brazil’s large farming areas while maintaining environmental stewardship, as variable-rate irrigation and nutrient management can reduce input use by 20-30% while improving yields (CGEE, 2024).

Regenerative Practices, Bioinputs, and Climate Goals

Latin America holds 31% of the world's freshwater resources and 40% of the world’s biodiversity (along the Caribbean). Comprising almost half of South America's territory (47.3%), Brazil is positioned at the frontline of climate action within agriculture. Regenerative agriculture practices, including no-till farming, cover cropping, integrated crop-livestock systems, and bioinputs, are central to building climate resilience while supporting soil health and carbon sequestration.

Brazil’s National Bioeconomy Strategy aims to reduce dependence on imported synthetic fertilizers and promote the use of bioinputs, with Embrapa reporting that biological nitrogen fixation in soybeans alone saves Brazilian farmers approximately US$15 billion annually while reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Embrapa, 2024). “Bioinputs are not just environmentally sound; they’re economically smart, reducing reliance on imports and building resilience,” emphasized Alessandro Cruvinel of the Ministry of Agriculture.

Adopting regenerative practices also aligns with market trends, as global buyers increasingly demand deforestation-free, low-carbon supply chains. In fact, studies have found that sustainability certifications often translate into sizable price uplifts – e.g. coffee farmers under Fairtrade or organic standards have earned 20–30% higher prices than conventional growers (MDPI, 2024).

Key discussion points include the need for scalable models that align regenerative practices with credit incentives and digital monitoring tools to measure soil health and carbon sequestration for carbon credit programs.

SAF and Brazil’s Potential as a Sustainable Fuel Hub

A particularly insightful discussion during the summit centered on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), underscoring Brazil’s potential to become a global SAF leader. Brazil’s experience with ethanol and biofuel leadership positions it well to align energy, food, and climate strategies efficiently.

Brazil has officially moved to raise the mandatory ethanol blend in gasoline from 27% to 30% (E27 to E30) as of August 2025 (Reuters, 2025). Approved by the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE), this policy is framed as a step toward cleaner energy and reduced fossil-fuel dependence. According to the Brazilian government, increasing the ethanol content “eliminates [fuel] imports, reduces emissions, [and] strengthens national biofuel production” (gov.br). Practically, the E30 mandate is expected to drive over R$10 billion in new investments and create more than 50,000 jobs as biofuel supply expands (gov.br), underscoring Brazil’s commitment to sustainable energy transitions while also supporting domestic agriculture and benefiting sugarcane and corn ethanol producers (Reuters, 2025).

In the aviation sector, global demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to soar to 449–500 billion liters annually by 2050, aligning with the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) net-zero carbon goals and representing about 65% of total aviation fuel needs by mid-century (AirInsight, LH Consulting). This surge in demand offers a significant export opportunity for biofuel-producing nations like Brazil. Analysts note Brazil’s SAF production potential could exceed its domestic jet-fuel consumption, positioning it as a major SAF exporter if scalability challenges are addressed (Sustainable Aviation Futures). One study found Brazil could produce around 9 billion liters of SAF from residual feedstocks alone—enough to meet the country’s annual jet fuel demand of 7.8 billion liters while generating a surplus for export (Revista Pesquisa FAPESP). Leveraging its abundant sugarcane, corn, and other biomass resources, Brazil has a competitive advantage in SAF production.

However, realizing this potential will require investment in new biorefineries, supportive policies, and technological scale-up to bring down costs. Panelists in the Sustainable Fuels: Scaling Biofuels and Tapping into Carbon Markets for Sustainable Growth session at the summit emphasized the need for blended finance models, clear policy frameworks, and stable demand signals to build investor confidence in SAF infrastructure, alongside supply chain integration to secure consistent biomass supply without disrupting food production. This points to a broader insight: the future of sustainable fuels must intersect with food systems planning to ensure synergies rather than trade-offs.

A Well-Rounded Event Fostering Connection and Collaboration

The World Agri-Tech South America Summit was a comprehensive gathering of stakeholders shaping the future of agriculture. The event brought together C-suite leaders, cooperative heads, startup CEOs, policymakers, and research institutions such as Embrapa and the Ministry of Agriculture, creating a platform for collaboration across the sector’s most pressing challenges and opportunities.

Panel discussions explored critical topics from financing and bioinputs to regenerative practices, SAF production, and precision agriculture. The event also offered startup pitches, interactive roundtables, and targeted networking opportunities, including a Women in AgriTech brunch, facilitating deeper collaboration among participants. Networking moments—whether during pre-booked 1:1 sessions, over high-quality Brazilian meals, or at the lively closing party with live music—were invaluable for turning ideas into action and building enduring partnerships.

The June 2025 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to develop an electro-synthetic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) facility in Jesup, Georgia, marks a pivotal shift for RYAM—from a traditional cellulose producer to a leader in carbon-negative infrastructure. While the partnership's immediate focus is on decarbonization and renewable fuel production, its long-term potential as an overlooked “AI-infrastructure play” lies in its ability to leverage emerging technologies to optimize energy systems. Here's why investors should take notice.

The Strategic Pivot: From Cellulose to Carbon Capture

RYAM's collaboration with Verso Energy targets three interconnected projects at its Jesup, Georgia, site:

1. Biogenic CO₂ Capture and Storage (CCS): RYAM's existing manufacturing processes produce biogenic CO₂, a byproduct of its cellulose production. The CCS project aims to capture this CO₂, which is carbon-neutral due to its origin from biomass, and store it permanently.

2. Renewable Hydrogen Production: A green hydrogen unit will use renewable energy (likely solar or wind) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This hydrogen will serve as a critical feedstock for the e-SAF production process.

3. e-Fuel Synthesis: The final facility will convert captured CO₂ and green hydrogen into e-SAF via Power-to-Liquid technology. This fuel, with lifecycle emissions 90% lower than conventional jet fuel, could meet growing demand from airlines and governments under EU ReFuelEU and U.S. tax incentive frameworks.

The project's genius lies in its use of RYAM's existing infrastructure—a $1.6 billion asset base—as a launchpad for these new ventures. By repurposing its Jesup site, RYAM avoids costly greenfield construction and taps into a steady supply of biogenic CO₂, turning waste into revenue.

The AI-Infrastructure Angle: A Subtle but Strategic Edge

While the MoU does not explicitly mention artificial intelligence, the broader trend in energy infrastructure increasingly relies on smart systems to optimize efficiency, predict maintenance needs, and manage complex supply chains. For instance:

- Process Optimization: AI-driven algorithms could refine the electrolysis process for hydrogen production or fine-tune CO₂ capture efficiency.

- Grid Management: As renewable energy sources power the plant, AI could balance energy demand and storage to minimize grid strain.

- Carbon Accounting: Blockchain and AI could enable real-time tracking of carbon credits, a critical feature for compliance with global emissions targets.

RYAM's pivot to infrastructure—where scalability and operational precision are paramount—positions it to integrate such tools as the market matures. This could give it an edge over competitors still reliant on static, legacy systems.

Market Catalysts and Risks

RYAM's stock has lagged behind broader markets, trading at a valuation that ignores its clean energy potential. Key catalysts include:

- Feasibility Study Results (2025–2026): A positive outcome could trigger a final investment decision (FID) by early 2027, unlocking a potential 50–100% upside as CO₂ monetization begins.

- Regulatory Tailwinds: The EU's ReFuelEU mandate, which requires 2% SAF blending by 2028, and U.S. tax incentives for SAF producers create a $15–20 billion market opportunity by 2030.

Risks remain, however:

- Capital Costs: The project's estimated €1–2 billion price tag requires securing financing amid a volatile credit market.

- Technology Scaling: While Power-to-Liquid is proven in labs, industrial-scale deployment faces hurdles like hydrogen storage and grid integration.

Investment Thesis: A Hidden Gem in the Energy Transition

RYAM's undervalued stock and strategic foresight make it a compelling play on clean energy infrastructure. Investors should:

1. Buy on dips below $15/share: Current valuation does not reflect the CO₂ monetization opportunity or the scalability of Jesup's model.

2. Watch for FID announcements: A green light by early 2027 could catalyze a re-rating.

3. Consider ESG-focused ETFs: Pair RYAM with broader energy transition plays like NIO or Plug Power (PLUG) for diversification.

Conclusion: RYAM's Quiet Revolution

Rayonier Advanced Materials is not just a cellulose supplier—it's a pioneer in repurposing legacy infrastructure for the green economy. While AI may not yet be part of its toolkit, its strategic bet on carbon-negative energy systems aligns with the broader trend toward smart, data-driven infrastructure. Investors who recognize this shift early could benefit as RYAM transitions from a overlooked mid-cap stock to a cornerstone of the $1 trillion sustainable fuels market.

Sees new opportunities in Malaysia for growth in life sciences and healthcare as well as new energy

DHL is well-positioned to support Malaysia’s trade and logistics ambitions with expanded investments and capabilities

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA – Media OutReach Newswire – 9 July 2025 – DHL, the world’s leading logistics provider, has reaffirmed its commitment to Malaysia through Strategy 2030, a five-year roadmap aimed at accelerating sustainable growth with an expanded focus on high-value sectors. The country is a vital link in DHL’s network, poised to capitalize on opportunities as a leading hub for trade and an emerging destination for supply chain diversification.

Malaysia has long been strategically important for DHL and hosts four of DHL Group’s globally operating divisions, which together command a portfolio of solutions encompassing domestic delivery, e-commerce shipping and fulfilment, road, air, and sea freight, international express, and industrial supply chain management. These are underpinned by an IT data centre and regional shared services that drive backend functions for DHL’s cross-border presence.

Since the company established its roots here in 1968, it has grown in tandem with a vibrant economy that is now the fifth-largest in Southeast Asia. Across the four divisions, DHL employs a workforce of over 4,500. Continued investments in infrastructure and capabilities reflect confidence in Malaysia as an attractive destination for facilitating global trade and logistics.

Recognizing Malaysia’s competitive advantages and business potential, DHL plans to further enhance its product offerings and operational capabilities in the local market, focusing on several key drivers.

Geographic Tailwinds

Emerging geographical and economic developments continue to have profound effects on companies’ supply chain diversification strategy, omnishoring as well as domestic and foreign direct investment. To help businesses capitalize on these developments, DHL will build on its strong global footprint and local expertise. DHL has identified Malaysia as one of the 20 high-growth markets that could stand to benefit the most from these changes. This is solidified by Malaysia’s record of a historic high of RM378.5 billion in approved investments in 2024. FDI accounted for 45 percent of the figure, led by the United States, Germany, China, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

In fact, DHL has long contributed to such foreign inflows through its partnership with the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA). In May, both parties signed a renewed memorandum of understanding, building on joint efforts since 2023 that have yielded significant investment outcomes in key priority sectors across eight states: Kedah, Penang, Perak, Johor, Melaka, Sabah, Sarawak, and Selangor.

In recent years, DHL has consistently invested ahead of the curve to support the growing needs of businesses expanding their operations in Malaysia. These investments include:

A new Kuala Lumpur Gateway in 2024, the largest local DHL Express investment to date at EUR60 million (MYR300 million)

EUR131 million (MYR655 million) investment by DHL Supply Chain allocated until 2028 towards expanding warehousing capacity, staff, and sustainability activities. These include the new Penang Logistics Hub 5 and South Region Hub opened earlier this year, with one more planned for Penang and another in the Central region

Julian Neo, Managing Director of DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei, said: “Trade has remained resilient across the region, boosted by shifting attention to these parts of the world for manufacturing and sourcing operations. Thanks to our forward-looking approach, we are in a strong position to respond with the timely and strategic improvements we made. With a presence that spans more than 220 countries and territories, we retain a crucial role in connecting businesses seamlessly to international value chains.”

Life sciences and healthcare (LSHC)

The biopharma, cell and gene, and clinical trials market is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) exceeding 10 percent until 2030. DHL is well-positioned to address these shifts, with its track record of over 30 years in specialized pharma logistics. In 2025, the company acquired specialty courier CRYOPDP and announced an investment of EUR 500 million (approximately MYR 2.4 billion) to enhance its LSH capacity in the Asia Pacific region. Currently, DHL has 300,000 square metres of fully compliant warehousing space in 15 countries across the region.

Christopher Lim, Managing Director of DHL Global Forwarding Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei said: “Today, 10 of the world’s top medical device companies have established operations here, elevating Malaysia into the league of global medical device hubs. These MNCs are driving innovation, diversifying the nation’s export portfolio and shifting the focus beyond glove production to high-value advanced devices manufacturing. We are ready to support Malaysia’s ambitions to grow this sector, backed by our team of trained life sciences specialists, a globally validated IT platform, and stringent operational protocols, we ensure the integrity and compliance of every shipment.”

In Malaysia, these cover end-to-end solutions including cold chain management for DHL Supply Chain’s customers, the latest being a global medical device manufacturer. DHL Global Forwarding also has a cold room at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the only one of its kind on the premises, compliant with Good Distribution Practice and World Health Organization standards. DHL Express extends its Medical Express service (otherwise known as WMX) locally, achieving speed and reliability for research, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Leveraging their expertise in parcel delivery and returns, DHL eCommerce is a partner to a local healthtech company, Esyms, where DHL enables safe and timely delivery of medications from hospitals and clinics to patients’ doorsteps.

New energy and auto-mobility

New Energy is a key growth sector under DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, where the Group is developing end-to-end logistics solutions for eight segments: wind, solar, electric vehicle (EV) and batteries, battery and energy storage system, EV charging, grid, alternative fuel and hydrogen.

In Malaysia, dedicated logistics solutions are increasing in demand with the transformation of the renewable energy and auto-mobility sectors, bolstered by positive momentum in the country’s EV agenda. This can be attributed to favourable government initiatives, including the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021–2030, the National Automotive Policy 2020, and the National Energy Transition Roadmap. DHL is a leader in the local automotive industry from freight solutions to being an MNC pioneer in the 3PL (third-party logistics) space, offering a comprehensive range of services from spare parts fulfillment to setup and management of regional distribution centers.

Mario Lorenz, Managing Director for DHL Supply Chain Malaysia, said: “Last year, Malaysia’s vehicle market hit a record high of more than 800,000 units sold[1], so it is still a high-growth segment for us. However, we are not just focusing on internal combustion engines; we have developed solutions for the industry of the future – electric vehicles. Our expertise in managing the movement of spare parts, service logistics, and handling regional distribution is transferable to EVs. Malaysia is also in the pipeline for a DHL EV Centre of Excellence, joining a network of similar facilities in 10 countries that cover capital equipment for new EV-related factories, inbound-to-manufacturing (I2M), finished vehicles, and aftermarket logistics.”

E-commerce

B2C and B2B digital sales continue to be a steady contributor to profitability for DHL. Malaysia’s e-commerce market maintains a bullish outlook with a projected CAGR of 11.25 percent until 2029[2]. The company has long been an ecosystem partner for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, with an eye on increasing their share of national exports.

To this end, DHL developed the GoTrade program to equip entrepreneurs with practical knowledge and resources to navigate the complexities of shipping abroad and accessing overseas consumers. Since its inception in 2020, the initiative has trained over 9,100 SMEs across the United States, Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia Pacific. Locally, DHL has partnered the Malaysia External Trade Development Corp (MATRADE), reaching more than 2,000 participants through 18 workshops from 2023 to 2024.

Saurabh Kumar, Managing Director of DHL eCommerce Malaysia, said, “As online shopping continues to shape the way we live and work, we are perfectly equipped to help homegrown B2B and B2C brands thrive in the digital marketplace through innovation and best-in-class delivery services. We currently work with a diverse range of customers from global names to local brands across industries. This breadth of experience reflects our ability to meet the evolving needs of the domestic e-commerce ecosystem.”

Leading the way in sustainable logistics

In recognizing the heightened importance that logistics plays in global trade, equal attention must be given to its adverse effects on the climate. The industry as a whole generates an estimated 3.4 billion[3] tons of CO2e annually, with DHL contributing one percent of the total. The company became the first logistics business to pledge to a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050, and is pursuing measurable goals to decarbonize its operations towards 2030 interim milestones. With Strategy 2030, DHL added a fourth bottom line, “Green Logistics of Choice”, to the existing “Employer of Choice,” “Provider of Choice”, and “Investment of Choice”.

In Malaysia, the pursuit of more sustainable logistics operations took shape in 2022 with the introduction of six electric vans as DHL Express became the first company in the country to implement EVs for logistics use. The number has since risen to 74 electric vans and nine electric scooters. This puts the local division squarely on track to achieve the groupwide target of electrifying two-thirds of the pickup and delivery fleet by 2030.

DHL Express and DHL Global Forwarding also support customers in reducing their Scope 3 emissions via GoGreen Plus service, utilizing sustainable aviation fuel and sustainable marine fuel. To date, more than 90,000 customers in Asia Pacific have used the service for their time-definite international shipments, while 180,000 tons of TtW-CO2e on Full Container Load and Less than Container Load shipping have been mitigated.

India can potentially manufacture 40 million tonnes of SAF by 2050, which positions it as a key player in shaping a greener, more resilient aviation future. Let’s understand SAF and its key environmental benefits.

SAF for reducing airline emissions

Aircraft emit water vapour, soot, sulfur aerosols, nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), which contribute to the formation of contrails – clouds that form when water vapour condenses and freezes around small particles (aerosols) in aircraft exhaust. All of these factors have additional warming effects on the atmosphere.

Moreover, aviation’s share in global emissions is expected to increase due to two key reasons. Currently, less than 10 per cent of the global population relies on air travel. But this number is projected to more than double in the coming decades. Second, unlike aviation, other high-emission sectors such as electricity, cement, and steel production are gradually moving to greener alternatives.

In this context, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), also known as aviation biofuel, has emerged as a credible alternative with the potential to reduce aviation-related emissions. SAF is made from sustainable sources and has characteristics similar to Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), but with a significantly lesser carbon footprint. It is a ‘drop in’ fuel, meaning it can be blended with ATF without requiring any change in the existing machinery of aircraft.

SAF can be derived from a range of materials, including

— Oils and fats such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO), oil-rich seeds from plants, algae oils, animal fats

— Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)

— Agricultural and forestry residues such as wood waste, sugarcane bagasse, corn stover, husks and straw, sugars and starches.

There are various methods to produce SAF, with each using different combinations of raw materials. For SAF to be truly sustainable, it is important that the feedstock used in its production does not compete with food production, cause deforestation, or harm biodiversity.

Toward net-negative emissions

SAF offers multiple benefits. The primary advantage is its ability to significantly reduce emissions and its compatibility with the current global aircraft fleet. It means SAF can be used without modifications to existing planes, engines, or fueling infrastructure. It is estimated that SAF has the potential to reduce GHG emissions in air travel by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.

In addition to SAF, there are other innovations like Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origins (RFNBOs). It is produced using renewable electricity through Power to Liquid PtL technology that combines Green Hydrogen with Carbon captured from atmospheric CO₂. It offers the potential for even net negative emissions. SAF combustion produces far less harmful gases and particulate matter, contributing to cleaner skies.

The adoption of these biofuels can lead to new demand for feedstock and open new revenue streams in agriculture and waste management. In addition, diversification of fuel sources in the aviation sector can help reduce import dependence and protect the sector from global oil price volatility. This, in turn, could lead to a more stable aviation sector, possibly making air travel accessible to larger sections of society. Moreover, SAF adoption will also generate employment opportunities in the sustainability sector.

However, despite these benefits, there are a few barriers to the widespread adoption of SAF. First, the cost of producing these biofuels, which is more than double that of conventional fuels, makes its large-scale adoption difficult for airlines without passing the burden onto consumers.

The production, storage, blending, and transportation of SAF require the development of new infrastructure, which would add significantly to the initial cost of adoption. Another key issue is the availability and sustainability of feedstock required for SAF production. The characteristics and variety of necessary feedstock mean that there is no guarantee of year-round supply.

Further, there is a significant risk that the production process can have adverse environmental impacts if not managed properly. For SAF to be considered truly sustainable and to ensure a significant reduction in GHG emissions, it is crucial to ensure that its production does not have negative social or environmental impacts.

How SAF reshapes global and Indian aviation

Notably, there is now a global push to increase the blending of SAF in commercial aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) – the UN’s specialised agency for the development of air transport – has established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). It mandates that international airlines must offset their emissions growth post-2020, and the use of SAF is incentivised as a compliance mechanism.

Similarly, the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative has introduced binding SAF blending targets, aiming for 2 per cent SAF by 2025, 6 per cent by 2030, and 70 per cent by 2050, with sub-mandates for synthetic fuels. Another innovative mechanism is the World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative, which has set the blending target of 10 per cent SAF by 2030. It also seeks to address the high cost of SAF through innovative financing and supportive policy frameworks.

However, India has a nuanced and pragmatic approach to SAF, advocating for nationally determined targets rather than binding international mandates. India’s position is based on the twin goals of prioritising energy security and food security, and seeking to balance sustainability goals with passenger demand. Despite these reservations, India is a party to the CORSIA and is positioning itself to be a key player in the global SAF landscape. Notably, the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) was launched by India during the G20 Summit in New Delhi in 2023 with the aim to expedite the worldwide adoption of biofuels, including SAF.

India has also set SAF blending targets of 1 per cent for domestic airlines by 2025 and 1-2 per cent for international flights by 2027-2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 and the potential to scale up to 15 per cent by 2040. The abundant supply of agricultural residues bolsters India’s goal of becoming SAF exporter. However, challenges like high costs and underdeveloped supply chains need to be taken care of.

To address such issues, policies like tax incentives and public-private partnerships have been proposed. SAF presents a near-term, drop-in solution to reduce emissions from the aviation sector while longer term decarbonisation technologies continue to evolve. Despite existing challenges, the international consensus to push for SAF through initiatives like the CORSIA and ReFuelEU offers hope for overcoming barriers to large-scale adoption. For India, SAF provides an opportunity to leverage its resources to be a market leader in the sector and make meaningful contributions to global decarbonisation efforts, while also keeping local realities and national priorities in mind.

The usually diesel-fueled smoke pod will also switch to a biofuel based on vegetable oil.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been trialed by the Royal Air Force since 2020, when the Ministry of Defence’s aviation fuel standards were updated to permit its use in defence aircraft. Blends of conventional fuel and SAF have since been used to fill Typhoon fighter aircraft, P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, and C-130 transports (retired 2023) – including delivery through air to air refueling. A 100% sustainable fuel flight took place in November 2022 utilising an A330 Voyager from RAF Brize Norton.

SAF can reduce the carbon emissions generated by an aircraft by around 80%. It is produced from agricultural and industrial byproducts, including waste cooking oils, animal fats, and even municipal solid waste. While helping to fulfil government and service objectives related to combating climate change, SAF also provides a way to reduce reliance on foreign supplies of crude oil and general fossil fuel products. It is designed to blend with conventional fuel to allow mixed supplies, easing logistical burdens, and offer the opportunity of a gradual introduction.

The Red Arrows’ planned full display powered by sustainable fuel at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), the UK’s largest airshow, follows a successful flypast conducted over London in June using a SAF blend.

Squadron Leader Andy King, Senior Engineering Officer for the Red Arrows team, said “At the heart of the Royal International Air Tattoo is a mission to inspire future generations of aviators – a goal shared by the Red Arrows.”

“This makes this year’s Air Tattoo an ideal occasion to showcase the Red Arrows’ ground-breaking, world-leading move to more sustainable fuels – powering a display that has the same thrilling, entertaining and exciting aerobatics and teamwork that has captivated millions of enthusiasts at the show across the decades.”

Three displays will be flown at RIAT using sustainable fuel, along with a number of formation flypasts over the weekend. The Royal Air Force Typhoon display team will also use a SAF blend, mirroring their first use of the fuel during last years’ display. At that time, Air Vice-Marshal Shaun Harris remarked that “As well as contributing to reduced carbon emissions as part of the Defence Aviation Net Zero Strategy, our ability to use new fuels ensures that the Royal Air Force can continue to operate anywhere we are needed globally.”

In addition to using SAF to power the aircraft, the Red Arrows’ signature red, white, and blue smoke will also be generated using sustainable Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) fuel. This fuel is carried in a pod underneath the teams’ Hawk T1 aircraft, and is injected into the engine exhaust through three small pipes. The instant vaporization of the fuel creates a thick white smoke trail – dye is added to two of the three tanks inside the belly pod to create the red and blue trails. Each aircraft can generate five minutes of white smoke, and one minute each of red and blue.

Making the smoke trails ‘green’ has been an aim for the team since at least 2022, as part of the Royal Air Force’s overall aim to be a net-zero force by 2040. As stated above, this strategy is important both from a climate perspective as well as from a national security one.

Sustainable fuels in other forces

The Royal Air Force is not alone in seeking the expansion in use of sustainable fuels. The U.S. Department of Defense has issued a number of contracts seeking development work in this area, eyeing similar goals to the RAF in reducing reliance on singular fuel sources. It’s additionally noted that SAF could be a safer option, able to be produced at airfields themselves essentially on demand and reducing the need for extremely vulnerable fuel transport trucks.

Lockheed Martin cleared the F-35 Lightning II for synthetic fuels in January of this year, with Norway becoming the first operator of the aircraft to utilize the fuel in their aircraft.

Commercial aviation is also investing in sustainable fuels. Virgin Atlantic completed their first transatlantic flight with SAF in 2023, using a Boeing 787 flying a routine service between London Heathrow Airport and New York John F. Kennedy Airport. The flight took place in cooperation with the UK Government and with support from aircraft and engine manufacturers Boeing and Rolls-Royce.",https://theaviationist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RedArrowsSAF_1-706x397.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 13:22:18.688499

However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits.
The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits.
Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026.","On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBB), which significantly rolls back many of the core tax incentives that clean energy projects have relied on since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Under the new law, tax credits for wind and solar projects phase out much sooner. To qualify, these projects must either be completed by the end of 2027 or begin construction within the next 12 months. This compressed timeline will likely force developers to accelerate their project schedules or risk losing critical tax credits. In contrast, the OBBB largely preserves tax credits into the next decade for newer clean energy technologies, like battery storage and carbon capture.

However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits. Originally introduced under the Biden administration, and limited to electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing tax credits, these “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules have now been expanded under the OBBB to cover virtually all tax credits. The expanded FEOC rules deny credits to projects that are owned or controlled by certain foreign entities — or that purchase components from or make payment to these foreign entities. Notably, the list of FEOCs includes all companies owned or controlled by the Chinese government or its citizens.

Under the OBBB, wind and solar projects face a shorter window to qualify for tax credits. Projects that were under construction by the end of 2024 are largely unaffected by the new law. Projects first starting construction in 2025 must generally comply with the FEOC ownership requirements, and projects beginning construction in 2026 or later must navigate a complex set of FEOC sourcing and payment rules, including proving that an increasing share of components are sourced outside of China.

Going forward, a key factor for most clean energy projects will be the date they begin construction, as this will determine both their eligibility for tax credits and the extent to which they must comply with the FEOC rules. Over the past 12 years, the IRS has issued a series of notices that define what it means for a project to be “under construction” along with related rules on transfers and completion deadlines. The OBBB clarifies that this existing guidance continues to apply for purposes of the effective date of the “material assistance” FEOC rules described below.

However, the Trump administration issued an executive order on July 7, 2026, directing the US Treasury department to revisit the begun construction rules with respect to solar and wind facilities within 45 days, including by “restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” These guidelines (and the extent to which they are changed for solar and wind) are now likely to become central to how developers assess the value of their pipelines and plan future investments. Many in the industry will now rely on these IRS rules to guide investment decisions and accelerate project timelines, as construction start dates become a critical factor in securing favorable tax treatment under the new law.

This Client Alert provides a detailed description of the OBBB’s changes to the tax credits across different technologies and the FEOC rules.

Solar and Wind ITC and PTC

Projects that began construction before 2025 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. Projects that start construction in 2025 or later are eligible under existing law for tax credits that are similar to the investment tax credit (ITC) or production tax credit (PTC) and referred to as “technology neutral credits.” Most of the restrictions in the new law related to renewables are aimed at curtailing these technology neutral credits.

Despite the technology neutral focus of existing law, solar and wind are subject to different — and harsher — treatment under the OBBB than other technologies. Projects have to either begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. Under pre-OBBB law, projects beginning construction in 2025 or 2026 would have until the end of 2029 or the end of 2030, respectively, to be placed in service, or else their developers must demonstrate that work is continuous based on the facts.

Solar and wind projects, as well as other projects eligible for technology neutral tax credits, will also become subject to the FEOC requirements, which are described in further detail below.

Helpfully, the OBBB does not affect eligibility for tax credit adders (e.g., for projects located in an energy community or that meet domestic content requirements), eligibility for accelerated depreciation, the ability to transfer tax credits to third parties for cash, or place restrictions on residential solar leasing. Restrictions on the latter three had been proposed in prior iterations of the bill. The final bill focuses the leasing restriction on solar water heating property or small wind energy property.

Although the domestic content tax credit bonus is retained, the OBBB fixes an apparent glitch from the Inflation Reduction Act that would have increased the qualification threshold to up to 55% over time for PTC projects but left the ITC threshold static at 40%. ITC projects that began construction before June 16, 2025, can still rely on a 40% threshold, but projects seeking to claim a domestic content adder that began construction after that date must meet a domestic content threshold of 45%, with increasing annual thresholds that match the PTC version thereafter.

Storage and Other Technologies Eligible for the ITC and PTC

Non-solar and wind technologies (e.g., storage, hydropower, and geothermal) fare much better under the OBBB. Tax credits for these projects are subject to a phase-down schedule that begins for projects that commence construction after 2033. Projects beginning construction in 2034 and 2035 will still qualify for tax credits but with a 75% and 50% haircut, respectively. These projects must meet the traditional continuity test, which requires placement in service by the end of the fourth year after the end of the year in which construction starts, or else demonstrate that construction was continuous based on the facts.

Fuel cells (including linear generators) were added as a special category of ITC-eligible technology. Fuel cell projects generally involve some level of greenhouse gas emissions, which would make them ineligible for the technology neutral ITC pre-OBBB. They are newly eligible for a 30% ITC without regard to emissions and are also exempt from prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. They cannot qualify for tax credit adders. Eligibility begins for projects that start construction after 2025.

Clean Fuels

The OBBB significantly modifies the section 45Z PTC for clean transportation fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit is extended by two years to cover fuel sold through December 31, 2029, but reduces the value of the credit for sustainable aviation fuel from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon beginning for fuel produced after 2025. The OBBB also eliminates the excise tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel with respect to any sale or use after September 30, 2025, and prohibits double counting by barring 45Z credits on any fuel produced from fuel that would have qualified for 45Z credits on its own. Fuel feedstock will have to come from the United States, Mexico, or Canada to qualify for a credit.

The new law forecloses the possibility of claiming additional 45Z credits based on “negative emissions.” The credit amount is calculated according to the “emissions factor” of the fuel, with a floor of 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU to qualify. The greater the emissions rate, the smaller the emissions factor and the smaller the tax credit. Conversely, if the emissions rate is negative, prior law appears to allow taxpayers to claim a credit above $1.00 for clean fuel and above $1.75 for sustainable aviation fuel. The OBBB prevents this result.

The OBBB also restores the expired tax credit under section 40A for small agri-biodiesel producers through 2026 and increases the credit amount from 10 cents a gallon to 20 cents a gallon. The tax credit will be newly eligible to be sold to third parties for cash.

As described in further detail below, projects intending to claim 45Z credits will become subject to FEOC ownership restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration

The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture receives relatively favorable treatment under the OBBB compared to other credits. The credit is available for carbon dioxide that is captured and then permanently sequestered, used in enhanced oil recovery, or put to another commercial use. The credit amount had been higher for a sequestration use case compared to the others on the theory that sequestration is uneconomic without the tax incentive. The OBBB puts all use cases on equal footing so that both enhanced oil recovery and commercial utilization can qualify for a credit of up to $85 per metric ton (or more in the case of direct air capture).

Similar to the 45Z tax credit for clean fuels, projects will become subject to the ownership-related FEOC restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit

The OBBB makes numerous changes to the section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, which provides a tax credit for the production and sale of certain solar, wind, and battery components, as well as the production and purification of certain critical minerals. Among other changes, the OBBB:

terminates the tax credit for wind components sold after 2027;

creates a new category of eligible critical minerals for “metallurgical coal”;

begins phasing out tax credits for critical mineral production (other than metallurgical coal, which terminates after 2029) after 2030, with termination after 2033;

subjects manufacturers to similar FEOC rules as those that apply to the technology neutral ITC and PTC; and

requires battery modules to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment,” as a condition for tax credit eligibility.

Metallurgical coal is unique compared to the other critical minerals in that it is allowed to be produced outside of the United States. Federal tax credit eligibility in general, even outside of the critical minerals context, usually requires the activity being subsidized to occur in the United States. However, the credit is only worth 2.5% of the cost compared to 10% with respect to other critical minerals. The coal must be suitable for use in the production of steel.

Notably, the OBBB does not fully restrict the sale of integrated components, which had been proposed in the initial Senate bill. The initial Senate bill would have essentially prevented manufacturers of multiple components that are integrated into an end product from claiming credits on each individual component. Instead, the OBBB permits the stacking of credits provided that the components that are integrated together are produced in the same facility, the end product is sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65% of the direct material costs of the underlying components are attributable to US mining, production, or manufacturing.

Foreign Entities of Concern

The OBBB imposes important new restrictions limiting the ability of projects to generate tax credits if certain FEOCs are involved. These restrictions fall into two categories: (1) those relating to ownership or control, and (2) those relating to assistance during construction. To the extent an FEOC restriction contains a beginning of construction concept, the OBBB memorializes long-standing IRS guidance that allows a project owner to begin construction by either incurring 5% of project costs or else beginning physical work of a significant nature.

1. FEOC — Ownership Restrictions

The first FEOC restriction generally prohibits a project owner from claiming technology neutral tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, clean fuel production tax credits, and tax credits for carbon sequestration for any tax year in which the person otherwise generating the tax credit is either a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign influenced entity.” These restrictions generally apply to tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, though the restrictions relating to foreign-influenced entities do not restrict clean fuel production tax credits until tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Specified foreign entities should be relatively easy to identify. These include entities owned by the governments of China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia; entities owned by citizens of those countries or otherwise organized or having a principal place of business in one of those countries; certain battery manufacturers; and certain other similar entities.

An entity is a foreign-influenced entity if: a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint board members or officers; a single specified entity owns more than 25% of the entity; one or more specified foreign entities owns an aggregate of 40% of the entity; or at least 15% of the entity’s debt is held by specified foreign entities (in the aggregate).

An entity is also a foreign-influenced entity if during the prior taxable year the entity made payments to a specified foreign entity pursuant to an arrangement that allowed the specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a project (in the case of technology neutral tax credits) or production of any components (in the case of advanced manufacturing tax credits). The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits. Because effective control requires examination of payments made in the prior taxable year, project owners should closely scrutinize any contract that requires a payment, or any payments recently made, which could provide a contractual counterparty with any specific authority over production of components, energy generation, or energy storage.

Contractual rights that allow a counterparty to determine the amount or timing of production, restrict access to data relating to production, determine the purchase of power output, or maintain or otherwise operate a project on an exclusive basis can create effective control. Effective control can also be granted by licensing arrangements that specify or direct material or other components in a project, allow the licensor to direct the operation of the project, limit the taxpayer’s use of the licensed property, provide a right to royalties for more than 10 years, or otherwise require the project owner to hire a project operator for more than two years at the licensor’s direction.

Finally, for projects claiming the technology neutral ITC, the OBBB imposes a recapture of 100% of the tax credit value if payments conveying effective control are made within 10 years of the project being placed in service.

2. FEOC — Material Assistance Rules

The second set of FEOC restrictions prohibits project owners from claiming technology neutral tax credits if construction on the project started after December 31, 2025, and the project receives material assistance from a specified foreign entity. A similar prohibition limits project owners from claiming advanced manufacturing tax credits for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2025, if the owner received material assistance from a specified foreign entity.

An entity receives material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity if the material assistance cost ratio applicable either to the power generation project or the manufacturing project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The applicable threshold percentages are shown in Exhibit A (below), which can be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury in the case of the applicable threshold relating to critical minerals.

The material assistance cost ratio for a power plant or battery is generally the difference between the total direct costs for manufactured products less the direct costs attributable to a specified foreign entity, divided by the total direct costs. This effectively examines the “good” costs over the total costs. The material assistance cost ratio for a manufactured component is the “good” material costs over the total material costs.

The OBBB directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue safe harbor tables applying a methodology similar to that adopted with respect to the calculation of domestic content under Notice 2025-08 for material assistance. Before these tables are issued, taxpayers can rely on Notice 2025-08 along with a supplier certification, though this has an obvious shortcoming in that Notice 2025-08 has tables for a limited subset of power production technologies. Developers of other technologies will have to rely on actual labor and materials costs to run the calculations.

Other Changes

The clean hydrogen PTC terminates for projects that begin construction after 2027. Prior iterations of the bill in both the House and Senate would have terminated the credit if construction did not begin by the end of 2025.

Bonus depreciation — the ability to write off 100% of the cost of certain business property, including renewables projects, as a depreciation deduction — is made permanent for property acquired after January 19, 2025. Bonus depreciation was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and was set to phase out after 2026 for most property. Taxpayers can elect out of bonus depreciation entirely or alternatively elect into a 40% bonus (or 60% bonus for property with a longer production period).

The PTC for nuclear facilities under 45U will become subject to the FEOC ownership restrictions.

Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026. The exact dates and mechanics vary by credit. Affected credits include the 30D clean vehicle credit, the 45W qualified commercial vehicles credit, the 30C credit for charging stations, and the residential clean energy credit under 25D.

There's just a fortnight to go until this year's Royal International Air Tattoo, and organisers have announced a 'world first' for the iconic Red Arrows.

It's as they'll be displaying Sustainable Aviation Fuel when they take to the skies above RAF Fairford.

More than 170,000 people are expected at RAF Fairford for the aviation showcase which is due to take place on Friday 18th, Saturday 19th and Sunday 20th July.

The Red Arrows’ performances across the weekend will be history-making for any national aerobatic team – using not only SAF for jet propulsion but also a renewable biofuel, known as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), to produce its distinctive trademark vapour trails.

Joining the Red Arrows on SAF will be the RAF’s Typhoon display, which also completed its first routine on SAF at last year’s show in another world-first.

Kate McKinley, Director of People and Sustainability at Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises, said: “We are thrilled to have the Red Arrows performing on sustainable fuel at this year’s Royal International Air Tattoo.

“Their nine-ship team are known across the world, so we are delighted to be hosting this landmark display here at RAF Fairford.

“In 2024 we were lucky enough to secure the RAF Typhoon’s first public display on SAF and being able to continue the Typhoon for another year and add the Red Arrows is great for us as an event.”

The Red Arrows will be performing three times on the fuel, as well as featuring in various special formation flypasts across the weekend event.

The display comes after the team first publicly flew on the fuel last month as part of the celebrations for HM King Charles’ official birthday, in the skies above London.

However, the displays at the Royal International Air Tattoo will be the first ever aerobatic performances by the Red Arrows using both SAF and HVO.

Squadron Leader Andy King, the Red Arrows’ Senior Engineering Officer and who led the pioneering fuels project, said: “At the heart of the Royal International Air Tattoo is a mission to inspire future generations of aviators – a goal shared by the Red Arrows.

“This makes this year’s Air Tattoo an ideal occasion to showcase the Red Arrows’ ground-breaking, world-leading move to more sustainable fuels – powering a display that has the same thrilling, entertaining and exciting aerobatics and teamwork that has captivated millions of enthusiasts at the show across the decades.”

The flights have been made possible by Air Space Intelligence, Intel Foundry and Team Lewis, with HVO and fuel being supplied by Power Electrics and AFS Aviation respectively.",https://cdn.apollo.audio/one/media/686e/407a/3404/6f43/8820/69c7/RED-20240412-240-Zadar%20First%20Display%20Practice-158.jpg?quality=80&format=jpg,N,,2025-07-09 08:06:36.907355

The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.","The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year.

US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production.

EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth.

The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import.

Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years.

In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation.

Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.

EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.

FROM GROUND TO AIR It’s not just sensors for test environments that are being advanced – aerospace is also seeing exciting developments in sensor technology that is used in operational settings.
SMARTER AIRCRAFT Another leading example of sensor innovation comes from Saab, which is using Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor technology in its overheat detection system (OHDS) for commercial aircraft.
The technology enables many sensing points just a few centimeters apart, each working as an individual temperature sensor.","Sensing technology has come a long way since the invention of the humble thermocouple and strain gauge. Many of these ‘classic’ sensors work by monitoring and measuring changes in wire components to calculate environmental conditions and forces such as temperatures and stress. But while this type of sensor continues to be the workhorse of many industries, including the highly demanding aerospace test environment, engineers are looking for more advanced sensors that provide single-point readings and surface-wide, high-speed data across a range of scenarios.

In a test environment, advanced sensors are required to ensure materials and components are fit for purpose, while in operational environments, they are necessary to monitor the performance of systems, including those using novel fuels and autonomous technologies.

Requirements continue to change. For example, the need to burn hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) changes the heat transfer properties of the combustion gases in aeroengines, necessitating redesigns and the validation of components. In addition, engineers and operators want more data. For instance, in terms of temperature sensing, they are interested in stable operating conditions and temperatures across an entire component rather than at one or two points, a limitation of thermocouples.

In response, innovative companies are developing new sensing solutions using the latest technology and materials to meet these monitoring needs.

PAINTING A PICTURE

A leading example of new sensor technology is Sensor Coating Systems’ (SCS) thermal history coatings (THC) and paint (THP), which remembers the highest temperature. “After operation, we shine a light on it and the luminescence afterglow, after calibration, tells us what the temperature was at every single point across the component. This provides entire temperature maps of components – something thermocouples can’t do,” explains Dr Jörg Feist, managing director of SCS and co-inventor of the technology.

“This is a small project with the potential to make a big impact” DAVID DEBNEY, HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY FOR WHOLE AIRCRAFT, ATI

The solution can be used on anything from combustion chambers to turbine blades and vanes, because it is manufactured similarly to traditional thermal barrier coatings. THC can endure long running intervals of tens or hundreds of hours at very high temperatures, while the paint variant, THP has already been proven to withstand more than 7,000 hours at temperatures below 550°C (1000°F).

The thermal mapping technology can also measure temperatures of up to and beyond 1,600°C (2,900°F) with an accuracy of ± 25°C (77°F). This was one of the main reasons it was awarded the UK Aerospace Technology Institute’s (ATI’s) “Making the Difference Award”.

“The project demonstrated that the thermal mapping technology can be used under multi-cycle test conditions where engine load conditions are changing,” says David Debney, head of technology for whole aircraft at the ATI, and chair of the award’s judging panel.

“Existing thermal paints and coatings today usually contain toxic materials. It’s therefore important to note that the solution developed in this project is also fully REACH compliant. This is a small project with the potential to make a big impact.”

UNDER PRESSURE

When it comes to pressure measurement, current strain gauge, piezoresistive and capacitive sensors can be limited by issues including thermal drift and degradation at high temperatures, vibration sensitivity causing inaccurate readings and limited dynamic range missing fast pressure changes.

Test and measurement technology provider HBK has developed new piezoelectric sensors which aim to overcome these challenges. “Our GaPO₄-based sensors solve these issues by operating beyond 700°C (1,300°F), where quartz and ceramics fail and by offering high-frequency response for precise combustion instability and shock wave measurement,” says Dr Christian Roethel, head of sales and product management at Piezocryst by HBK.

These sensors are suitable for environments such as jet engine and gas turbine combustion testing, where they can detect pressure pulsations and instability, and rocket engine development. They can measure dynamic pressure in extreme environments such as combustion chambers and fuel lines.

They can also support hypersonic and supersonic flow research, capturing transient pressure changes in wind tunnels, and structural health monitoring by identifying pressure-induced stress variations.

“As propulsion systems evolve toward cleaner combustion and higher efficiency, our sensors ensure safer, more precise and sustainable aerospace developments by optimizing engine performance, safety and emissions reduction through precise combustion analysis,” says Roethel.

The company continues to look for ways to advance its sensors. This includes by increasing the operating temperature limits. Hydrogen-based combustion happens at higher temperatures, increasing operating demands. Meanwhile research into miniaturization and advanced packaging is enabling the sensor’s use in compact, high-power-density turbines.

LASER VISION FOR AIR FLOW

Aerospace engineers at the University of Cincinnati (UC) in the USA have developed a laser-based system to visualize and measure airflow in unprecedented detail. Building on particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques, the system tracks microscopic particles seeded in the air using high-speed cameras and laser pulses, enabling researchers to calculate velocity by observing particle movement between frames, explains Daniel Cuppoletti, assistant professor of aerospace engineering at UC.

Unlike traditional methods such as pitot probes or hot-wire anemometry, which only provide single-point data, the laser-based technique offers high spatial and temporal resolution, producing full-field, image-based measurements at tens of thousands of frames per second. This enables researchers to capture complex, fast-changing aerodynamic phenomena like shock waves, vortices and noise-generating structures in supersonic and hypersonic flows.

“The timescales of these flows are incredibly short. This technique, operating at 50 to 100KHz, lets us resolve those very fast, transient phenomena,” Cuppoletti explains.

“Our sensors ensure safer, more precise and sustainable aerospace developments” DR CHRISTIAN ROETHEL, HEAD OF SALES AND PRODUCT MANAGEMENT, PIEZOCRYST BY HBK

While the laser solution is being used in R&D environments, it is not yet a plug-and-play solution. Calibration and setup are complex processes, especially for high-fidelity measurement. However, the technique is playing a crucial role in validating computational models and refining aircraft components. Its ability to visualize coherent structures supports research into aeroacoustics, a vital aspect of electric aircraft and advanced air mobility solutions being developed to enter service over the next decade.

FROM GROUND TO AIR

It’s not just sensors for test environments that are being advanced – aerospace is also seeing exciting developments in sensor technology that is used in operational settings.

Late last year BAE Systems was awarded a US$12 million contract by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a microelectronic sensor capable of high-bandwidth, high dynamic-range sensing at extreme temperatures, such as on hypersonic aircraft and missiles.

Current sensors are limited in that they can’t operate over 225°C (4,400°F) due to their materials, circuitry and/or packaging. BAE Systems is therefore designing a new pressure sensor module made of an integrated transducer and signal-conditioning microelectronics, capable of operating at 800°C (1,500°F).

“Applications such as jet engine prognostics and space exploration could benefit from the collection of real-time data using high temperature pressure sensors and circuitry through the High Operational Temperature Sensors program,” says Amrita Masurkar, technology development manager at BAE Systems’ FAST Labs R&D organization.

TAMING TURBULENCE

Elsewhere, researchers at the German Aerospace Centre’s (DLR) Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology are working on the optimal load-adaptive aircraft (oLAF) project. This aims to develop an intelligent load control system able to proactively respond to wind gusts and maneuvers by quickly adjusting control surfaces and flaps. This will enable the aircraft to better absorb turbulence and reduce material stress, making the plane more efficient and extending service life.

“Our accelerometers open the door to scalable deployment in precision applications” DAVID BLUMSTEIN, GENERAL MANAGER MOTION, SILICON MICROGRAVITY

The project uses laser systems and LiDAR to measure wind patterns and detect ongoing gusts earlier, enabling the aircraft to react even more precisely and proactively to external influences, explains the project’s manager Lars Reimer. The research has already shown that this solution can reduce fuel consumption by over seven percent, significantly decreasing CO emissions.

SMARTER AIRCRAFT

Another leading example of sensor innovation comes from Saab, which is using Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor technology in its overheat detection system (OHDS) for commercial aircraft. The technology enables many sensing points just a few centimeters apart, each working as an individual temperature sensor.

The key difference with the OHDS is that it is being installed into new aircraft rather than used during the development and testing of materials and systems. Sensing fibres distributed across the aircraft provide real-time monitoring of bleed air piping to detect hot air leakage, providing precise measurements that can be analyzed for trends and setting smart alarms.

Another innovative company in this space is Silicon Microgravity, which is making progress in the world of inertial sensing. Engineers here have developed a resonant micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer that combines the performance of quartz with the scalability and efficiency of silicon.

While the sensor’s core concept isn’t new, Silicon Microgravity’s proprietary IP enables exceptional bias stability (<0.15 μg at 25g, 0.5 μg at 100g) and low temperature sensitivity, all while benefiting from the batch-fabrication advantages of silicon.

“The result is a silicon MEMS sensor that offers near-quartz performance at a fraction of the cost, size and power demand,” says David Blumstein, general manager, motion at Silicon Microgravity.

This breakthrough addresses a long-standing trade-off in sensor design, the choice between high accuracy or affordability.

“Our accelerometers close that gap, opening the door to scalable deployment in precision applications from GPS-denied aerospace navigation to missile guidance, advanced wearables and eventually mass-market autonomous systems,” Blumstein says.

“Our goal is to replace shoebox-sized Inertial Measurement Units that cost hundreds of thousands with something that costs a couple thousand and fits in a matchbox.”

With MEMS gyroscopes and custom ASICs also on its roadmap, Silicon Microgravity clearly aims to redefine what is possible in navigation, guidance and control.

SENSORS SHAPING THE SKY

As can be judged from these few examples, sensors are evolving from test instruments to design enablers and safety guardians, helping the aerospace industry to advance and push boundaries even further.

Sensor data is no longer just for reports. It is real-time, high-resolution and feeding live systems, which in turn is enabling aircraft to respond more quickly and efficiently, providing a myriad of benefits from passenger safety and comfort through to improving sustainability, efficiency, and even capabilities.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to sensor innovation, but it’s an exciting, fast-moving area that will continue to transform aerospace design, operations and performance in the years ahead.",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sensors-lead-pic.jpg.webp,N,,2025-07-09 07:11:16.368901

Considering the continuous growth of air traffic and the limited potential of other alternative fuels, switching to SAF is unavoidable for decarbonizing aviation.

In 2024, aviation accounted for approximately 1.2 billion tons of CO2 emissions (~2.5% of global CO2 emissions). However, due to continuous air traffic growth, this sector could become a much larger contributor if transformative measures are not adopted.

The aviation sector is facing immense challenges to meet its commitment to achieve net-zero by 2050:

• Technology (e.g. new engine technologies) and operational improvements (e.g. green taxiing) will reduce CO2 emissions, but the identified levers have potential to reduce CO2 emissions by only ~15%. This reduction will be completely nullified by air traffic growth, that is expected to double by 2050

• Switching to low-carbon fuels is thus a mandatory step to decarbonize aviation and meet net-zero targets by 2050. IATA targets ~65% of CO2 emissions reduction due to the switch to low-carbon fuels.

• The remaining ~20% of CO2 emissions from the aviation sector will have to be offset (through reforestation projects for instance)

‍

‍

Exhibit 1: CO2 emissions from air traffic (world, in billions of tons) – IATA Net zero carbon 2050 resolution

‍

In terms of low-carbon fuel options, electricity is to date limited to small/regional aircraft due to battery weight.

Hydrogen has often been cited as a future alternative for decarbonizing aviation. However, its use as a direct fuel is constrained by technological (storage), infrastructure, and energy density limitations. Thus, current projects focus on small/regional aircraft as well.

- In 2022, Airbus launched a differentiated project (ZEROe) targeting an aircraft with more than 100 passengers and a range up to 3700km by 2035

- But Airbus recently scaled back its hydrogen-powered aircraft ambitions

Thus, among available options, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) stands out as the most viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation.

Exhibit 2: passengers’ capacity and range of current projects of hydrogen and electric aircraft compared to current aircraft

‍

2. SAF consumption is emerging with airline commitments and regulations

Airlines are already incorporating SAF in their fuel mix and regulations like ReFuelEU Aviation (which came into force since January 2025) will secure a growing demand for SAF.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is jet fuel produced from biomass or synthesized from renewable hydrogen (e-fuels) and captured CO2.

Its primary advantage is compatibility with existing engines and infrastructure, allowing for a drop-in replacement of fossil kerosene.

Also, the technology has been proven in commercial flights: Apart from a few flight tests conducted with 100% of SAF, many Airlines have started to incorporate a growing share of SAF (even if it is still very low) in their fuel mix.

For instance, Air France-KLM and IAG have already signed partnerships with SAF producers to secure SAF supply until 2030 and target 10% of SAF in their fuel mix by 2030 (which is greater than the 6% obligation from ReFuelEU Aviation):

- Air France-KLM reported 1.25% of SAF in their fuel mix in 2024 and signed several long-term offtake contracts with SAF producers (e.g. Engie, EDF, Elyse Energy, TotalEnergies, OMV, Raven, SAF+). Notably, the agreement with TotalEnergies represents 1.5Mt of SAF between 2025 and 2035.

- IAG reported 1.9% of SAF in their fuel mix in 2024. They signed long-term offtake contracts with SAF producers like BP, Neste, Repsol, LanzaJet, Gevo and have already reported more than $3.5 billion investment in future offtake.

‍

Exhibit 3: SAF consumption of AirFrance-KLM and IA

‍

In order to boost the development of SAF, several countries have defined SAF mandates imposing progressive blending mandates on fuel suppliers and airlines:

- Europe: Since January 2025, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation has come into force, imposing 2% of SAF in 2025, 6% in 2030 and 70% in 2050.

- UK: 2% of SAF in 2025, 10% of 2030 and for now 22% in 2040.

- Singapore has set an obligation of 1% of SAF in 2026 and is in the process of setting SAF mandates for 2030 (which are expected to be between 3% and 5%).

- Japan established a national objective of achieving 10% of SAF in 2030.

- USA has been very ambitious regarding SAF, with a national target of achieving 100% by 2050. The USA has also set strong financial mechanisms to support SAF production, especially with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), to target a SAF production capacity of 9Mt/y in 2030 and 100Mt/y in 2050. The recent election of Donald Trump has, of course, put this trajectory at risk, with several measures from his administration aimed at freezing climate-related funding, including provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

‍

Exhibit 4: Overview of main SAF mandates and national objectives in the world

‍

SAF mandates are essential to ensure a secured demand trajectory and stimulate investment. For instance, in France, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative will establish a predictable SAF demand, growing from approximately 0.2 Mt in 2025 to around 11 Mt by 2050.

‍

Exhibit 5: ReFuelEU Aviation obligationfor jet fuel suppliers to include SAF in jet fuel supplied to French airports(in Mt)

3. First challenge to scale-up SAF production capacities is to reduce production costs, to have a viable economic equation

Future SAF technologies fall into two broad categories:

 Biomass-based pathways:

- HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids): the most mature technology, which consists of refining Used Cooking Oil (UCO). The refining process has the advantage of requiring limited investment to convert current refineries

- Alcohol-to-jet: while technologically viable, regulatory constraints on agricultural feedstocks mean local production is limited in Europe. Europe is thus expected to import SAF from Brazil for instance

- Gasification (e.g. process patented from Haffner Energy): this pathway can use a variety of biomass sources and is feedstock-agnostic. However, it generates CO2 as a by-product, which must be captured or offset.

 E-fuels using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis: these rely on low-carbon hydrogen and CO2. It requires vast amounts of renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and infrastructure to capture CO2 and infrastructures to transport both hydrogen and CO2.

Technology maturity and feedstock availability represent strong barriers to SAF production today. The first barrier is the production cost: even HEFA, which is the most mature technology, is twice as expensive (~1.2 $/kg) as the current jet fuel price (~0.7 $/kg in average between 2019 and 2024). The ratio can even be greater than 4 for the Power-to-liquid process (depending on electricity price).

‍

Exhibit 6: SAF production processes and costs

4. 2nd challenge is the availability of domestic feedstock, to avoid reliance on imports. To date, France mainly produces SAF from UCO imported from Asia

HEFA is currently the most used process in France (and in the world), but it uses Used Cooking Oil (UCO), mostly imported (Europe imports ~80% of the UCO used) from China (~50% of total UCO imports).

Due to the lowest cost and higher level of maturity, almost all SAF produced in the world is with HEFA process. HEFA seems to be an attractive solution, but the potential is strongly limited due to the feedstock: Used Cooking Oil (UCO).

Indeed, UCO production and collection are very limited. In France, ~90kt is used per year. Even if it were to be used to produce SAF (it is also used to produce biofuels for road transportation), the volume would be negligible compared to the national demand for SAF: 0.2Mt in 2025 and 11Mt in 2050.

Thus, if the other technologies (Alcohol-to-jet, Gasification, Power-to-liquid) are not developed at an economic cost, France will have to continue to rely strongly on imports of UCO from Asia to produce SAF (which obviously limits the effect on the decarbonization of aviation).

‍

Exhibit 7: maturity of SAF production processes and feedstock availability

5. The groundwork to catalyze SAF production investment is in place, but the coming five years will be crucial to turn early initiatives into operational projects

To date, ~15 projects of SAF production based on these other technologies are reported in France. They represent a total SAF production capacity of ~1Mt per year by 2030 (which is greater than the need of 0.6 Mt per year to comply with ReFuelEU Aviation).

‍

Exhibit 8: list of announced projects of SAF production in France

But these projects will require massive financial investments: typical SAF production projects require more than €1 billion investment.

In total, France will need to invest around €28 billion by 2050 to build the 11 Mt of SAF production capacity required under ReFuelEU Aviation.

The groundwork to catalyse SAF production investment is in place:

 The international aviation industry has recognized the imperative to decarbonize and committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050

 SAF stands out as the most viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation

 Many countries have defined SAF mandates, which secures a predictable and growing SAF demand

Many airlines are starting to contract long-term offtake agreements with SAF suppliers (see examples from Air-France KLM and IAG on Exhibit 10), in order to secure SAF volumes up to 2030-2035, which is a very positive signal.

However, investment from infrastructure funds remains limited to date, with Hy24 and Mirova among the first in France: in 2024, they announced a €120m investment to support Elyse Energy’s SAF production projects in France (and Spain).

The next five years will be critical for the successful implementation of the ~15 SAF projects planned in France. Key priorities include:

 maturing the technology

 reducing production costs and demonstrating a viable business model

 developing a local feedstock supply chain. This will allow the shift towards SAF to become a national strategic advantage, rather than relying on used oil import from Asia

This transition to SAF also creates an opportunity for new entrants to challenge historical players (ex: TotalEnergies, BP, ExxonMobil):

 Companies from the hydrogen sector entering the field, such as Elyse Energy, H2V, Lhyfe, and Hy2gen,

 Technology providers like Haffner Energy,

 Major energy players like Engie seizing this opportunity to enter the emerging green fuels market.

This method improves energy conversion efficiency by over 30% compared to conventional BECCS and reduces carbon capture costs due to cleaner exhaust gases.","A coalition of major corporate players, including McKinsey and Google, has committed $41 million to purchase carbon removal credits from a biomass energy project in Louisiana in the US.

The initiative, led by startup Arbor, aims to produce reliable power while capturing and storing carbon dioxide at competitive costs.

Arbor, founded by a former SpaceX engineer, is developing a facility near Louisiana’s Gulf Coast expected to be operational by 2028.

The project employs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology, which converts forest thinnings into clean energy and sequesters the resultant CO₂ underground.

The Frontier coalition will acquire 116,000 carbon removal credits from the project, signalling growing confidence in BECCS solutions.

Microsoft, another active buyer in this sector, has already contracted nearly 10 million BECCS credits from various international projects this year.

Arbor’s approach introduces several advancements: biomass is gasified into a syngas mixture and combusted in pure oxygen, producing a high-purity CO₂ stream in a supercritical liquid state.

This method improves energy conversion efficiency by over 30% compared to conventional BECCS and reduces carbon capture costs due to cleaner exhaust gases.

While current costs exceed $350 per tonne of CO₂ removed, the coalition projects these could fall below $100 per tonne as the technology scales.

Arbor’s integrated capture and power generation design allows system scaling that greatly increases output without proportional cost rises.

Sustainability remains a core concern, as biomass sourcing has previously drawn criticism for impacting natural forests. Arbor’s project addresses this by using forest thinnings from commercial plantations - material typically left unused or burned - minimising ecological impact. The feedstock supply is rigorously monitored via third-party verification to prevent substitution with unsustainable sources, according to the organisation.",https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bigstock-Vector-Abstract-Futuristic-Gea-90277205-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 05:07:07.395084

Located in Chonburi province, the project will be built in two phases, Zhuoyue announced yesterday. The first phase, with an annual production capacity of 300,000 tons of biodiesel will have a construction period of 12 months, while the second one will have an annual output capacity of 100,000 tons for either hydrotreated vegetable oil or sustainable aviation fuel.

Zhuoyue has already completed the Chinese government’s offshore investment registration, obtained the approval certificate from Thailand’s Board of Investment, and signed a land lease agreement for the factory, the Fujian province-based company noted.

Zhuoyue was China’s first firm to industrialize biodiesel production using waste oils. It has consistently ranked first in the country in terms of biodiesel production, sales, and exports for years and has established a stable waste oil procurement network in China and Southeast Asia.

Last year, the company sold 376,000 tons of biodiesel, generating sales revenue of CNY3.3 billion (USD462 million), accounting for about 93 percent of its total annual revenue. Among them, exports neared CNY3.2 billion.

Zhuoyue is building a biodiesel production facility in Singapore, with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons, scheduled to come on stream this year. The products from this plant will be mainly used to meet the demand for low-carbon fuels in Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering port, according to the firm’s 2024 earnings report.

In February, the European Union announced anti-dumping duties ranging from 10 percent to 35.6 percent on Chinese biodiesel products, excluding sustainable aviation fuel. Zhuoyue was subjected to tariffs of 23.4 percent, effective for five years.

Zhuoyue’s shares [SHA: 688196] were trading down 0.6 percent at CNY47.48 (USD6.61) as of lunch break in Shanghai today.

T&E has joined airlines, e-SAF producers and NGOs in highlighting the strategic role e-SAF can play in boosting European competitiveness, autonomy and its clean tech industry.

With a potential to cut CO₂ emissions by more than 90 per cent compared to fossil jet fuel, e-SAF is the most sustainable aviation fuel, and it can be produced at scale.

With 41 announced projects, Europe could be a trailblazer for e-SAF, presenting a once-in-a-generation opportunity to align climate ambition with industrial renewal and strategic autonomy.

The EU must use the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) as a mechanism to help get these projects off the ground:

Prioritise e-SAF via a comprehensive EU strategy with targeted support and financing

Reinforce the stability of ReFuelEU by upholding the e-SAF sub-target and penalties, and focusing reviews on enabling conditions.

Ensure fair access to jet fuel infrastructure and competition across the e-SAF market

Establish a market intermediary, funded by aviation ETS revenues, to run double-sided auctions to support e-SAF production and offtakes.

Mobilise EU instruments like the Innovation Fund, SAF allowances, and Hydrogen Bank to support e-SAF.

Section 45Z (Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit) FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered.
EXCISE TAX CREDIT: Eliminates the ability to claim § 45Z and the § 6426(k) excise tax credit for the same fuel.
Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit) FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered.
RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.","President Trump signed the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” (the “OBBB”) into law on July 4, 2025. Congress passed the legislation using the budget reconciliation process to avoid the 60-vote Senate filibuster. In addition to making many of the individual tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, the bill makes significant changes to many of the clean energy credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”).

Projects that began construction before 2025 and are planning on claiming production tax credits (“PTCs”) or investment tax credits (“ITCs”) under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. However, the OBBB is a mixed bag when it comes to the other energy tax credits that were introduced or extended by the IRA. The OBBB makes substantial cuts to the tech-neutral tax credits for solar and wind and eliminates certain other energy tax credits (e.g., those for hydrogen, EVs and homeowners), but other technologies and activities (e.g., geothermal, carbon capture, nuclear, clean fuel production) experienced fewer claw backs of the benefits provided by the IRA. The OBBB also adds foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions to the surviving energy tax credits. Finally, the OBBB expands the definition of “qualifying income” (“QI”) for master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) under section 7704(d)(1)(E).

While a prior version of the OBBB released by the Senate contained an excise tax on certain wind and solar facilities deemed to have received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (“PFE”), the tax was removed shortly before its passage by the Senate and is not included in the OBBB.

On July 7, 2025, President Trump also issued an Executive Order (Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources) (the “EO”) directing the Secretary of the Treasury to, within 45 days of enactment of the OBBB, “take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” The EO specifically directs Treasury to issue new and revised guidance on “beginning of construction” (BOC), and notes that broad safe harbors should not apply “unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” In the same 45-day window, Treasury is also directed to implement the FEOC restrictions in the OBBB.

Below is a summary of the key changes for the clean energy industry as a result of the enactment of the OBBB.

I. TAX CREDIT AND DEDUCTION MODIFICATIONS

1. Sections 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit) and 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credits when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

PIS DEADLINE: Adds a placed in service (PIS) deadline for solar and wind facilities of December 31, 2027.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after July 4, 2026 (i.e., more than 12 months after the enactment of OBBB).

Akin Note: Allowing construction to begin for up to one year after enactment was a late change to OBBB. However, taxpayers’ ability to take advantage of this window may be limited as a result of guidance to be issued by Treasury implementing the EO.]

Statute makes clear that batteries are not impacted by this change. Other facilities that qualify for credits under §§ 45Y and 48E (besides solar and wind facilities) are also not impacted.

[Akin Note: The language making clear that batteries are not impacted by this change is arguably not necessary in light of the Treasury position in regulations that energy storage technologies cannot be part of qualified facilities.]

LEASING DISALLOWANCE: Disallows credits for solar electric heating and small wind residential property if the taxpayer rents or leases the property.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., after enactment of the OBBB).

[Akin Note: In earlier versions of OBBB, this rule also applied to residential photovoltaic solar systems. The final enacted version of OBBB does not disallow ITCs or PTCs for residential photovoltaic solar systems.]

PHASEOUT TIMELINE: Sets both §§ 45Y and 48E to begin phasing out in 2032.

Except for solar and wind facilities that have a special PIS deadline (see above), facilities that qualify for either §§ 45Y or 48E and:

BOC before 2034 can access the full credit;

BOC in 2034 can access 75% of the credit;

BOC 2035 can access 50% of the credit; and

BOC after 2035 cannot access either credit.

TAX OWNERSHIP OF GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMPS: For purposes of determining tax ownership geothermal heat pumps for depreciation and tax credit purposes, the fact that such property is not readily usable by anyone other than the lessee or offtaker is disregarded.

[Akin Note: This point removes a key obstacle to allowing geothermal heat pumps to be subject to “third party ownership” structures which more readily allows for tax equity financing.]

FUEL CELL FACILITIES (§ 48E (ITC) only): Removes requirement that the anticipated greenhouse gas emission rate not be greater than zero for fuel cell facilities.

Changes apply to facilities the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025.

Sets a 30% ITC rate without the ability to increase with adders and apparently without needing to satisfy Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship requirements.

NUCLEAR ENERGY COMMUNITY (§ 45Y (PTC) only): Creates an energy community adder based on local employment in nuclear facilities, nuclear R&D, and nuclear component manufacturing.

DOMESTIC CONTENT (§ 48E (ITC) only): Facilities that begin construction on and after June 16, 2025, are subject to the same domestic content thresholds for the ITC as the PTC.

Domestic content thresholds are 45% for BOC in 2025, 50% for BOC in 2026 and 55% for BOC in 2027+ (separate rates still apply for off-shore wind).

[Akin Note: This change corrects what has long been viewed as a typo or glitch in the statutory framework.]

Facilities that began construction before June 16, 2024, can utilize a 40% threshold.

2. Section 45Z (Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT EXTENSION: Extends the deadline to sell eligible fuel from December 31, 2027, to December 31, 2029.

EMISSIONS RATES: Disallows emissions rates from being negative, excludes indirect land use changes from the lifecycle analysis, and requires Treasury to provide emissions rates for each specific animal manure feedstock.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

[Akin Note: Many clean fuels producers were hoping to be able to generate multiples of the statutory credit rate as a result of their fuel having negative emissions rates. This change eliminates this possibility, which had previously been implied by other statutory language that contemplated negative emissions rates.]

FEEDSTOCK SOURCING: Requires feedstock to be produced or grown exclusively in the United Stated, Mexico or Canada.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

Disallows any feedstock sources that already generated a 45Z credit but includes a directive to Treasury to issue regulations or guidance to implement this anti-double counting rule.

RELATED PARTY SALES: Directs Treasury to expand the rule allowing sales between related parties prior to a sale to an unrelated party.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL: Eliminates the increased credit rate of $1.75/gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but the standard $1.00/gallon rate remains available for SAF.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

EXCISE TAX CREDIT: Eliminates the ability to claim § 45Z and the § 6426(k) excise tax credit for the same fuel.

Applies to fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB), and to fuel sold or used before such date if claims for the § 6426(k) excise tax credit have not been paid or allowed as of such date.

3. Section 45Q (Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT RATES: Equalizes the credit rate for all potential disposal pathways (g., EOR, secure geologic storage and utilization) to $17/MT (indexed for inflation after 2026).

Rate is $36/MT for direct air capture.

Applies to facilities PIS after July 4, 2025 (i.e., after the date of the enactment of OBBB).

4. Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

SALE OF INTEGRATED COMPONENTS: No credit for the sale of integrated components unless certain requirements are satisfied.

Applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

To the extent an eligible component (called a “primary component”) is incorporated into another eligible component (called a “secondary component”) prior to sale to an unrelated person, a 45X credit is allowed with respect to the primary component only if:

The secondary component is produced in the same manufacturing facility as the primary component; and

At least 65% of the total direct material costs of the secondary component are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States.

PHASEOUT FOR WIND ENERGY COMPONENTS: Wind energy components, sold after December 31, 2027, no longer generate a 45X credit.

PHASEOUT FOR CRITICAL MINERALS: Adds a phaseout for applicable critical minerals produced after 2030 based on timing of production.

ADDITION OF METALLURGICAL COAL: Metallurgical coal added as an applicable critical mineral.

Defined as “metallurgical coal which is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the notice published by the Department of Energy entitled ‘Critical Material list; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking’ (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))), regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.”

Generates credit at a special rate of 2.5% of costs (as opposed to 10% for other critical minerals).

Applies only to metallurgical coal produced before December 31, 2029.

REVISED DEFINITION OF BATTERY MODULE: Definition of “battery module” is updated to include a requirement for the module to include “all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.”

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., taxable years beginning after the enactment of OBBB).

5. Section 45U (Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT TERMINATION: Terminates credit for electricity produced and sold after December 31, 2032.

6. Terminated Credits and Deductions

SECTION 45V (CLEAN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT): The deadline for beginning construction under §45V is moved up to December 31, 2027 (instead of December 31, 2032).

EV RELATED CREDITS: Credits for EVs and EV charging property are eliminated.

The deadlines for acquiring an eligible vehicle under §§ 25E (Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit), 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), and 45W (Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit) are moved up to September 30, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

The deadline for PIS under § 30C (Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property) is moved up to June 30, 2026 (instead of December 31, 2032).

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.

The PIS deadline for residential clean energy property under § 25D (Residential Clean Energy Credit) of December 31, 2034, is replaced with a deadline for incurring expenditures of December 31, 2025.

The deadline for PIS for energy efficiency improvements, residential energy property expenditures and home energy audits under § 25C (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit) is December 31, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

REPEAL OF 5-YEAR MACRS: Removes the ability to utilize 5-year MACRS schedules under § 168 for “energy property” described in § 48.

Property eligible for a credit under §§ 45Y and 48E would remain eligible for 5-year MACRS.

ENERGY EFFICIENT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS DEDUCTION: Deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings is eliminated by adding a new BOC deadline of June 30, 2026.

3. Material Assistance

CALCULATION OF RATIO: Requires calculation of a percentage, the numerator of which is direct costs not attributable to PFEs and the denominator of which is all direct costs.

For Qualifying Facilities and Energy Storage Technologies under §§ 45Y and 48E, the calculation focuses on Manufactured Products (including components) and can be expressed as:

For eligible components under § 45X, the calculation focuses on direct material costs related to the production of eligible components and can be expressed as:

QUALIFIED FACILITIES AND ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY (§45Y/§48E): Requires an increasing amount of a facility’s manufactured products NOT to be manufactured by PFEs based on the beginning of construction date of the qualified facility or energy storage technology. This calculation is called the “Material Assistance Cost Ratio”.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

Material Assistance Cost Ratio calculations include qualified interconnection property (as defined in §48E(b)(4)).

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Qualified Facilities:

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Energy Storage Technology:

ELIGIBLE COMPONENTS (§45X): Requires an increasing amount of an eligible component’s direct material costs NOT to be mined, produced, or manufactured by PFEs based on the year the eligible component is sold.

Battery Components:

Critical Minerals*:

*Subject to increase by Treasury no later than December 31, 2027, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs and national security concerns

GUIDANCE ON CALCULATION: Prior to promulgation of new guidance from Treasury (required by December 31, 2026), for purposes of calculating the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, the statute permits reliance on:

IRS Notice 2025-08 (relating to certain safe harbors for domestic content adder calculations), but scope of such reliance is not yet clear; and

[Akin Note: This guidance only applies to §§ 45Y and 48E projects, and thus there is no current guidance for calculation of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio in the context of § 45X credits. Further, it is also not clear the extent to which IRS Notice 2025-08 may be relied upon for these purposes. For example, it is not clear whether the universe of manufactured products that must be tested limited to the manufactured products and components thereof identified in IRS Notice 2025-08 or whether “production costs” can be included if all of the MPCs for an APCs are not manufactured by a PFE.]

Supplier certifications are required to be made in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. § 1.45X-4(c)(4)(i) and contain:

the supplier’s EIN or similar identification number issued by a foreign government;

be signed under penalties of perjury;

be retained by the supplier and the taxpayer for a period of not less than six years and provided to the IRS upon request; and

be made from the supplier from which the taxpayer purchased any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent elements, materials, or subcomponents stating:

such property was not produced or manufactured by a PFE and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a PFE;

for purposes of § 45X, the total direct material costs for each component, constituent element, or subcomponent that were not produced or manufactured by a PFE; or

for purposes of §§ 45Y or 48E, the total direct costs attributable to all manufactured products that were not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

EXCLUSION FOR CERTAIN MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS:

For purposes of §§ 45Y and 48E, calculations exclude the cost of any manufactured product if (i) acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, (ii) PIS in a facility that BOC before August 1, 2025, and (iii) PIS before January 1, 2030 (or before January 1, 2028 in the case of wind and solar facilities).

For purposes of § 45X, calculations exclude the cost of any eligible component or constituent element, material or subcomponent if the constituent element, material, or subcomponent is used in a product sold before January 1, 2027.

Treasury is instructed to issued regulations or guidance as may be necessary to prevent abuse of this exception through “stockpiling”.

4. Audit and Penalty Provisions

EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Extends the statute of limitations from three to six years for assessing deficiencies related to the material assistance rules.

REDUCED PENALTY THRESHOLD: Reduces the threshold from 10% to 1% for the threshold to assess penalties related to a substantial understatement of income tax if the cause is an overstatement of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio with respect to the determination of credits under §§ 45Y, 48E or 45X.

NEW SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION PENALTY: Creates a new penalty based on inaccurate supplier certifications that result in a disallowance of credit.

Penalty applies where:

the certifying person knew or reasonably should have known that (A) the certification was inaccurate and (B) the certification would be used in connection with a credit determination; and

the disallowance exceeds the lesser of (x) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year to be shown on the return and (y) $100,000.

Penalty is the greater of (x) 10% of the underpayment and (y) $5,000.

An exception applies to the extent a person can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the IRS that the inaccuracy was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.

Penalty is applicable to certifications made after December 31, 2025.

5. Transferability

EXCLUSION FOR SFEs: An SFE is not eligible to be a transferee taxpayer under § 6418.

Applicable to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB).

One Saturday morning in May 2025 in the city of Melaka, volunteers in green T-shirts rushed over as Ms Adibah Rahim and her husband drove into the central square, eager to unpack, weigh and register her consignment of used cooking oil (UCO) – the “liquid gold” in European and Asian plans to ramp up production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Ms Rahim, a housewife, told The Straits Times it was her first time selling used oil, which she had collected over five to six months. She left the collection point RM90 (S$27) richer: At RM3 per liter of oil, it is a welcome boost to her family’s household budget.

“We usually collect UCO from around 200 members of the public,” said Mr Michael Andrew, sales manager for Evergreen Oil & Feed, the company running the Melaka collection with the local council. Evergreen, which runs similar collection drives elsewhere in Malaysia, supplies leading European SAF producers such as Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell and Finland’s Neste, the operator of SAF refineries in Europe and Singapore.

READ: Southeast Asia seen to boost green aviation fuel industry

The aviation industry and many governments, including Singapore’s, are pinning their hopes on SAF as a way to cut the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions, which are set to increase as demand for flying grows.

And fuel suppliers around the world are scrambling for raw materials to meet new legal SAF blending quotas in Europe and growing demand elsewhere.

When it is made from waste such as UCO, rather than agricultural commodities such as soya or palm oil, SAF purportedly has up to 80 per cent less planet-heating emissions than kerosene jet fuel. And repurposing waste cooking oil avoids using land that would otherwise be used for food crops, or fuelling forest destruction.

But behind SAF’s climate-friendly facade, a months-long investigation by Climate Home News and The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to significant fraud risks – raising doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead.

READ: PH wants partnership with Norway on sustainable aviation fuel

The concern is that barely used and virgin palm oil – the latter is not permitted under European Union rules because of its links to rainforest loss – is being passed off as UCO that traders supply to fuel companies, experts and industry operators said.

The investigation focused on the UCO trade between Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, and Spain, the EU’s largest aviation market and home to one of its SAF pioneers – oil and gas giant Repsol.

The investigation was funded by Journalismfund Europe.

Fried in Spain?

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Repsol chief executive Josu Jon Imaz held up his company’s new €250 million (S$369 million) plant for renewable fuels, including SAF, near the historic Spanish port town of Cartagena as an example of how Europe can pursue a fair green transition.

READ: Want a climate-friendly flight? It’s going to take a while and cost more

Repsol, which aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, started large-scale production of biodiesel and jet fuel – with its SAF mainly made from UCO – at the plant early in 2024.

Contrasting this with electric vehicles, many of them imported from China, Dr Imaz said the raw material for Repsol’s renewable fuels “comes from the Spanish farms and from the Spanish rural economy”.

In a promotional video for those fuels, Spanish celebrity chef Susi Diaz is seen dispensing advice to young cooks in the kitchen of her La Finca restaurant. Olive oil is then poured out of a pan into steel jugs as a voiceover explains how the waste cooking residue will be sent to the Repsol biofuel refinery.

The company is also promoting the recycling of UCO from Spanish households – of which it says only 5 per cent is currently collected – at its fuel stations across the country.

Spain’s restaurants and homes, however, are not the main source of Repsol’s UCO.

In 2024, more than 126,000 tonnes of UCO from Asia – enough to fill 50 Olympic-size swimming pools – arrived in the Spanish region of Murcia, where Repsol’s flagship biofuel plant is located, according to trade data published by Spain’s tax agency.

Nearly two-thirds came from Malaysia, whose UCO exports to the region saw a tenfold rise in the same year that the energy heavyweight fired up its Cartagena SAF refinery.

The figures do not specify who provided or bought the raw material. But trade data shows that Repsol purchased at least 53,000 tonnes of UCO from five Malaysian companies, including Evergreen Oil & Feed, in 2024. That amount represents 18 percent of the UCO the Repsol plant in Cartagena uses annually.

This is based on an analysis of Customs records provided by investigative consultancy Data Desk, which provided Climate Home News with a list of shipments of UCO certified for the European market, sourced from Malaysia by Repsol’s trading unit in Singapore.

No incidents of fraudulent UCO were detected in Repsol’s supply chain, with imports meeting EU rules on green certification.

Repsol told Climate Home News it “complements with imports when necessary” and receives raw material shipments from more than 20 countries. It declined to provide more details about the imports for “competitive reasons”.

Repsol’s heavy reliance on Malaysian supplies exposes it to fraud risks that raise wider questions about global assertions over the sustainability of SAF.

Asked what steps it takes to fight fraud, Repsol said it operates a rigorous supplier monitoring system to ensure the sustainability and integrity of its SAF production. A “very strong” compliance process means dubious raw materials and suppliers suspected of misconduct are quickly weeded out, it added.

“Any type of fraud distorts the market and undermines the confidence in the system, so it must be fought with all possible legal means,” the company said in e-mailed comments.

Shrinking air travel’s carbon footprint

Europe’s green aviation fuel refineries are boosting output because of new requirements by the EU for planes to use more SAF in the coming decades. From the start of 2025, fuel supplied to airports across Europe needs to contain at least 2 percent of SAF, with targets rising to 70 percent by 2050.

A million tonnes of SAF is needed to hit the EU’s 2025 mandate, and this will rise to 2.7 million tonnes a year by 2030 to meet the 6 per cent mandate.

SAF is crucial for shrinking aviation’s carbon footprint, according to industry body the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and is expected to account for 65 per cent of emissions reductions by 2050, when the sector has committed to reaching net zero.

In 2023, emissions from international plane travel accounted for 2.5 per cent of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions. As air travel increases, and other sectors are more easily able to decarbonize, that share is set to grow.

One of the reasons SAF is so attractive is that it is a drop-in fuel for planes, requiring no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current technology allows up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Repsol’s Dr Imaz told financial analysts early in 2024 that emissions-cutting alternatives to SAF – such as restricting short-haul flights – would represent “a drop in the ocean”.

Repsol’s plant uses 300,000 tonnes of UCO to produce 250,000 tonnes of renewable fuels, including SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil.

But surging demand for UCO, SAF’s feedstock of choice, and a far-from-perfect global certification system based on self-declaration at the start of the supply chain are encouraging fraud that undermines the new fuel’s green credentials.

‘Ridiculous’ export statistics

This investigation found that by the time Asia-based traders ship UCO supplies overseas to refineries for processing into SAF, guaranteeing their environmental integrity is virtually impossible – despite the certification system on which fuel companies and airlines rely.

A source at a leading Malaysian UCO supplier to companies including Repsol told ST that he suspects that both UCO collectors and restaurants are committing fraud by providing oil that does not qualify as used, although it is difficult to prove.

In Malaysia, which is among the world’s leading suppliers of UCO and virgin palm oil, government-subsidized cooking oil is cheaper than UCO – providing a clear incentive for fraud. Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.

In a 2024 report, Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E) cited figures showing that Malaysia already exports about three times as much UCO as it is estimated to collect domestically and import, raising concern about where that oil is coming from – and what it consists of.

In 2023, 458,000 tonnes of UCO originating in Malaysia were registered with International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), the leading certification scheme recognized by the European Commission to demonstrate compliance with its biofuel sustainability criteria.

In absolute terms, that puts Malaysia second only to China, which registered 1.65 million tonnes. Malaysia’s UCO volume, if indeed collected from its population, works out to 15.2 litres per person – the highest worldwide by far.

This figure is “ridiculous”, said Mr Cian Delaney, campaign coordinator at T&E, adding that for it to be feasible, Malaysia would need to be “a world-leading collection and refining system – which it isn’t”.

In comparison, China collected 1.4 liters per capita, while the figure is 0.9 liter in Indonesia and 3.8 litres in Spain.

Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities Chan Foong Hin has previously acknowledged there is fraud in the country’s UCO supply chain. He told Reuters in February 2025 that the government would crack down on this to uphold the country’s “reputation as a responsible exporter”.

In a response to questions from ST, he said: “To maintain supply chain integrity, various measures are in place, including traceability systems, certification requirements, and stringent export documentation. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board, in collaboration with other regulatory bodies, is actively monitoring the industry to prevent fraudulent activities.”

He also said the government was strengthening enforcement mechanisms to uphold industry credibility.

Opaque supply chain

The waste ingredients from which SAF is made change hands multiple times in a largely opaque system. To verify their sustainability, European regulators rely on checks by private auditors and agencies that issue green certificates based on their findings.

But there is a systemic blind spot: The restaurants, street stalls, households and factories from which the UCO is pooled self-declare the origin of their contributions. Aside from ad hoc spot checks and sampling, there is no way of knowing that all of these providers are telling the truth.

“The opportunity… of fraud is very high,” said Mr Vasu R. Vasuthewan, former Malaysia head for the ISCC.

The Malaysian authorities recently uncovered criminal syndicates that had pocketed thousands of dollars a day by getting hold of large amounts of subsidized cooking oil, mixing it in with UCO, and then selling it on to industrial UCO traders.

Sources within the industry told Climate Home News and ST that many households and restaurants are motivated to replace cooking oil after a single use – contrary to the standard practice of three to five times – and then sell it on as UCO. Cooking oil is considered waste when it is no longer fit for frying.

“Restaurant compliance (with sustainability standards) may be very low,” said Mr Vasuthewan, who now runs his own UCO import and export business. “Many will fake their declaration, hoping they won’t get caught.”

Mr Delaney of T&E said it is difficult for auditors to physically check the origin of the oil, since hundreds of restaurants can supply the same collection point, making it a “notable blind spot”.

Singapore, a global SAF hub in the making

Singapore is a key part of the global SAF supply chain and is positioning itself as a leader in the production and usage of such fuel. The Republic is home to the world’s largest SAF refinery by capacity: Neste’s biofuel refinery in Tuas. Its SAF production capacity is one million tonnes a year.

Government trade data shows that Singapore is a major importer of UCO from China and Malaysia; this is most likely for the Neste refinery. The Republic also has a licensing framework for local UCO collectors, who pick up UCO mainly from restaurants, hotels and commercial kitchens, with about 19,000 tonnes collected annually from 2021 to 2024, according to the National Environment Agency.

The Government regards SAF as a critical tool to reduce aviation emissions while allowing the industry to keep expanding and Changi Airport, one of the world’s busiest, to keep growing.

To ramp up SAF usage, from 2026, all flights departing Singapore’s two civilian airports must use 1 percent SAF. The goal is to reach 3 percent to 5 percent SAF use by 2030.

Fraud is a concern for the authorities and the industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) told ST that it recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and integrity in SAF feedstocks.

“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain. We share the same concerns as these pose risks to market confidence, fair trading and development of a nascent SAF market,” said CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

He said the authority is working with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection to develop “harmonised standards for feedstock verification to prevent further fraudulent practices”.

Neste told ST, in response to questions: “Neste sources traceable UCO and other renewable raw materials globally from carefully selected suppliers. Neste evaluates its suppliers and accepts renewable raw materials only from those suppliers that are able to meet strict criteria for sustainability.”

The Singapore Airlines Group said it works closely with its partners to ensure supplies meet internationally recognized standards such as the ISCC, and comply with regulatory requirements in jurisdictions with SAF mandates.

Spot checks, patchy audits

There is a system in place to keep fraudulent stocks out of the supply chain. Buyers and regulators in Europe rely on audit companies to trace the raw materials used in SAF and prove their green credentials.

Those audits are verified by authorised certification systems like the ISCC – which is led by the biofuel industry and, according to one source, enjoys “a kind of monopoly” in the sector. It then issues sustainability certificates to commodities traders and fuel suppliers.

According to the ISCC, its certification supports “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”.

While in some cases auditors conduct random field checks, that happens less often in countries outside the EU, industry experts say.

According to Mr James Cogan, compliance and markets lead at Irish biofuel firm ClonBio, it is far easier for fraud to occur outside the EU where “it’s much less visible to us”.

A 2024 analysis by T&E in China, for example, showed that sampling of points of origin happened in less than 10 per cent of the ISCC-approved audits, whereas in the EU, it was about 30 per cent.

Mr Adam Kirby, ISCC’s senior sustainability manager, told Climate Home News that auditors monitor volumes going in and out of collection points for any suspicious behaviour, in addition to carrying out spot checks. He added that the ISCC follows the requirements established by regulators like the European Commission.

In 2024, the ISCC also conducted 79 special “integrity assessments” – around two-thirds targeting Asia-based suppliers – which independently monitored the work of auditors. In a third of the cases, it found violations of its certification requirements, including an inability to demonstrate the traceability of products, leading to the withdrawal of 11 certificates.

Long paper trail

Under the current system, the entire SAF supply chain relies on a long paper trail rooted in those self-declarations and sporadic inspections at the points where UCO is collected.

In Malaysia, Evergreen’s owner C.K. Lau told ST that the company follows the proper processes in its collection based on the requirements established by the ISCC. He added that the documentation is critical as, otherwise, the company would not be able to export its UCO.

Repsol, for its part, said it requires “suppliers to be certified under European Commission-recognized voluntary regimes”.

In turn, airline companies that buy from Repsol, such as the International Airlines Group (IAG) – the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and Level – rely on documentation they get from it and other jet fuel providers, to show that the SAF they are paying for has green certification.

In exceptional cases, IAG has sent its own staff to carry out checks on the ground, as with a Shanghai-based Chinese supplier in 2024. It told Climate Home News the outcome of that audit – which included supply, record-keeping, environmental and health and safety standards – was “positive”.

Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for Iata, believes airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry. “You’ll see a race to the top… on sustainability, and it will, in a way, be self-regulated,” he added.

SAF certification faces EU scrutiny

In the meantime, following a string of fraud allegations about the authenticity of UCO-derived biofuels imported from China, the EU has been trying to ascertain whether the certification system that governments and businesses rely on is fit for purpose.

The EU authorities have been in talks to strengthen that system, leading to speculation that the ISCC could be suspended for failing to catch cases of biodiesel fraud. The ISCC denied in a statement that regulators had considered halting automatic EU-wide acceptance of its certificates, adding that its relationship with the European Commission remained constructive.

“There are always bad actors, there are always bad people, and there’s only a certain amount of policing that can be done in any industry,” said Mr Kirby. “We at ISCC have done, I think, an incredible job.”

The ISCC did not respond to follow-up questions from Climate Home News on whether it has full confidence in the current system, including self-declaration.

A European Commission spokeswoman said the bloc’s executive arm was closely monitoring the SAF market “to detect and prevent fraud, which risks undermining the EU’s ambition to effectively decarbonise air transport”.

Demand for UCO sizzles

Demand for SAF and UCO is only expected to increase as usage in Europe, Asia and elsewhere grows and as new refineries are completed in China, South Korea and Malaysia.

In 2024, Malaysia’s state energy firm Petronas, Italy’s Enilive, and Euglena of Japan announced they would develop a biorefinery at Petronas’ Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor. Due for completion in 2028, it would produce SAF and other biofuels.

Malaysia plans to mandate SAF usage by 2027, with the initial goal of blending it into aviation fuel at a 1 per cent rate.

Leading European refiners like Repsol are pushing for a level global playing field as well as more public funding to bring down costs and help develop the nascent sector on the continent.

Iata warned earlier in June that the European mandates had caused the SAF price paid by airlines to double because of hefty compliance fees being charged by producers.

Repsol’s aviation head Carlos Suarez Cubillo warned that fuel producers in parts of the world with laxer rules could produce SAF “with less regulation and less control of the feedstock… and here in Europe that could de-incentivise the production, the construction of new facilities”.

In Brazil, for example, an emerging SAF industry is gearing up to use crop-based feedstocks that are commonly linked to deforestation – and are therefore banned in Europe – such as soya and palm oil, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol, which has been linked to labour abuses and modern slavery.

An investigation by Climate Home News’ partner in Brazil, InfoAmazonia, found that the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in the Amazon region – billed as Brazil’s first SAF project – is growing the crop on land areas subject to sanctions by the national environment agency over illegal deforestation, and is struggling financially after rights abuse allegations.

Iata hopes its efforts to put in place a global registry for SAF, launched in April as a voluntary initiative, will boost transparency around feedstocks and their greenhouse gas savings – and enable airlines to have some level of visibility and comparability between countries, fuel providers and airports.

SAF producers and airlines are also looking to other waste-based materials to meet rising mandates – especially as more advanced fuels made from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, known as e-SAF, are still being developed and tested.

Repsol, for example, recently closed a deal with US vegetable oils giant Bunge to source camelina and safflower – non-food crops that can grow on poor land – to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil for biodiesel and SAF.

In January, it also announced it would invest more than €800 million in Europe’s first plant in the Catalan city of Tarragona to produce renewable methanol from organic urban waste, for use in maritime, road and aviation transport from 2029.

But in the meantime, Europe’s overwhelming reliance on UCO means it will continue to import supplies from Asia – despite the concerns over fraud, said Ms Sophie Byron, global head of biofuels pricing at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“That trade flow is not going away any time soon,” she said. /dl",https://globalnation.inquirer.net/files/2025/07/bf363599bb4b95835d1058df082bbdc39e2450d9730aed9912858986ccc73a65.jpeg,N,,2025-07-08 23:02:18.496132

This new financing model unlocks developer access to DEVCAP with lender repayment guarantee that eliminates perceived investor risk for pre-construction funding.

SEATTLE, July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels (NWABF), the developer of one of the United States' largest woody biomass sustainable synthetic aviation fuel (SAF) facilities, announced today a breakthrough financing structure that removes a long-standing barrier in the renewables industry in the United States: access to Engineering Services Development Capital (DEVCAP). This monumental pathway will allow for widescale use of nationally and internationally mandated Sustainable Synthetic Aviation Fuel (SAF) by airlines who fly across the globe.

Historically, major infrastructure and institutional investment funds have been prohibited by their charters from funding DEVCAP, leaving dozens of renewable infrastructure projects whose purpose is to create SAF for airlines on hold. To address this, NWABF has partnered with a global insurance underwriter to create an insurance-backed repayment guarantee that completely de-risks pre-construction working capital.

Under this structure, the investor or lender is named as the insured party and beneficiary and is insured against all defaults of principal and interest payments from the borrower. thereby removing 100% of the risk for financiers.

""This solution was born from our own roadblocks,"" said Dave Smoot, Managing Partner and Founder of Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels. ""Despite having one of the industry's strongest offtake agreements, from one of the industry's strongest airlines, top-tier engineering and technology partners, commitments for the project's required feedstock and the best site available in the Pacific Northwest, securing DEVCAP funding has been a challenge due to legacy financing policies. Now, with this insurance-backed guarantee, similar in nature to Corporate Surety Bonds currently and readily available in Europe and Asia, we're opening the door for all developers across the SAF and renewable energy industry. Someone had to do it.""

This financial breakthrough will lead to a variety of benefits for not just companies in need of DEVCAP across the nation, but also airline partners who will use NWABF's earth-friendly SAF and the state of Washington where thousands of jobs will be created.

What This Means for Airlines

""With this insurance-backed guarantee, similar in nature to Corporate Surety Bonds currently and readily available in Europe and Asia, we're opening the door for all developers across the SAF and renewable energy industry,"" said Dave Smoot, Founder of Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels.

New environmentally friendly regulations are requiring the airline industry to use 10% of SAF by 2029, and 100% by 2050. Once fully operational in 2029, NWABF will be producing 60+ million gallons of SAF that will allow its airline partner to decrease CO₂ emissions by up to 80% as they fly across the globe. Purchase agreements with companies like NWABF will also allow equity access to fuel supply as opposed to reliance on a volatile oil market.

What This Means for the Environment

""There is currently woody biomass and waste at up to 4-feet tall across much of the forests in Washington,"" said Smoot. ""We will be providing the outlet for clearing this out by the tons to use for creation of our SAF"". With wood leaking methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere this alone will be of great benefit to the environment through NWABF's production and manufacturing of SAF.

What This Means for the State of Washington

""We will create approximately 2,000 Jobs during construction, in addition to 200+ full-time positions as well as ancillary jobs (such as agriculture, waste collection and transport, housing, hotels and restaurants) as a result of this facility on the Columbia River,"" said Smoot. NWABF also plans to create feed stock preparation sites that will employ dozens of other Washington State residents.

NWABF is currently raising funds for its Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) Study, while concurrently developing a state-of-the-art SAF production facility along the Columbia River in Washington State, using woody biomass waste as feedstock. The site is currently being secured under a long-term lease agreement and the feedstock providers have agreed to execute long-term supply contracts. The project boasts a long-term offtake agreement with a prominent U.S. airline and is scheduled to begin production in 2029, once construction is completed, and will produce over 60+ million gallons of SAF per year.

""This structure provides a scalable financing solution for developers in SAF, biofuels and clean infrastructure sectors. It's a powerful tool that can unlock billions of dollars in delayed projects, and benefits many of the airlines who currently can't find this fuel, for use now and in the future,"" said Smoot. ""Our CFO, Bernie Asher, and the Insurance Representative have done a wonderful job road mapping a solution to this outdated industry paradigm, creating a winning solution that will benefit many project developers, technology and engineering companies, feedstock suppliers, barge companies, local communities, etc.""

A side of salad dressing, that is.

In 2020, the United States federal government committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. An important step toward carbon neutrality is embracing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from renewable feedstocks. As part of this initiative, Illinois engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

Hong Yang, a professor of chemical & biomolecular engineering in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, and Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural & biological engineering in the Grainger College of Engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem.

Their findings, published in Science Advances, present a low-cost, scalable and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

“There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,” said Zhang. “Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.”

Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour.

Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, the researchers used HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang’s lab.

“Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,” Yang said.

For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels.

“We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition” said Siying Yu, a chemical & biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper.

Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they’d like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.

“There is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed.” Yang said. “I’m optimistic because our students love this research topic. They want to work on something that will change the world.”

This study develops a methodological framework that integrates on-site electrolytic H2 production, storage, and transportation for airport applications. For the first time, the techno-economic feasibility of supplying clean liquid hydrogen (LH2) to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to support its transition toward sustainable operations by 2050 is comprehensively analyzed. The results underscore the critical role of integrating long-term H2 storage and short-term battery storage solutions to establish a reliable, self-sustained microgrid system at LAX. The estimated levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) ranges from $6.77 to $7.10 per kilogram of H2 in 2030, decreasing significantly to approximately $3.78 per kilogram of H2 by 2050, showing the viability of deploying clean H2 at LAX. Additionally, this study, for the first time, quantifies the global warming potential (GWP) of clean H2 supply pathways for airport applications, revealing a range of 0.29 to 0.35 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 by 2050, with H2 venting from electrolysis identified as the dominant contributor. The findings emphasize the feasibility of H2 as a sustainable aviation fuel and provide actionable strategies for its implementation at LAX. This work advances the hydrogen aviation field by bridging the gap between the general clean H2 supply chain strategies and the specific needs of the aviation sector, thereby contributing to California's ambitious climate goals. Future research is recommended to address limitations in cost optimization, lifecycle impacts, policy incentives, and safety innovations, enabling the scalable and practical implementation of H2 as a sustainable aviation fuel at airports.",Not Available,https://escholarship.org/images/escholarship-facebook2.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 21:59:39.088586

It’s gonna take time

Whole lot of precious time

It’s gonna take patience and time, mmm

To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it

To do it right, child

Two stories, in particular, show why some SAF projects quietly advance while others stall in the valley of good intentions.

Over at Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels

First, the team at Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels (NWABF) has unveiled what may be the most consequential SAF financing innovation in years: an insurance-backed guarantee to de-risk the engineering development capital (DEVCAP) phase that has kept so many renewable fuel ventures from getting off the launch pad. It sounds arcane, but it’s foundational.

For decades, major infrastructure lenders have been prohibited from funding pre-construction engineering and design. Projects would get tantalizingly close to reality—feedstock secured, offtake agreements inked, sites selected—but they’d stall for want of the working capital needed to finalize engineering and secure final investment decisions. NWABF, in classic Pacific Northwest style, didn’t make a lot of noise about it. They just worked the problem.

The company partnered with a global insurance underwriter to create a repayment guarantee instrument that effectively eliminates default risk for DEVCAP financiers. Lenders can now fund early engineering work with confidence that if something goes wrong, their principal and interest are insured. The implications are enormous: billions of dollars of delayed SAF projects—some languishing for years—can now clear the runway.

As NWABF’s Dave Smoot put it, “Someone had to do it.”.

This is the kind of GTESI-inflected persistence that matters. When you look across decades of advanced biofuels, you find that it’s not necessarily the most glamorous technologies that survive. It’s the teams that align incentives for all stakeholders. In this case, NWABF aligned risk tolerance, return expectations, and policy mandates into a coherent financing architecture.

Contrast that to projects that have faltered. Too often, companies expect financiers to bear outsized technical and regulatory risks without meaningful protection, or they fail to anticipate the timing mismatch between capital cycles and policy incentives. That’s when you see the press releases fade, the websites stop updating, and the same projects resurface five years later with a new logo and the same structural weaknesses.

Over at Avalon

Consider the Avalon project in Uruguay. If it feels like déjà vu, it’s because Camelina has been on the radar a long time. Back in March 2010, our team published a comprehensive report titled Camelina Aviation Biofuels: Market Opportunity and Renewable Energy Report. Even then, Camelina was identified as an oilseed crop from the mustard family that thrives in semi-arid temperate regions, possessing numerous traits that made it a high-potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

The promise was real:

Camelina proved in yield trials to be a hardy, low-input crop, requiring far less fertilizer and irrigation than soybeans or canola.

It performed well on marginal land, germinated in near-freezing temperatures, and offered agronomic benefits as a rotation crop.

Lifecycle modeling estimated GHG reductions of 75% or more versus petroleum—a figure that has largely held up.

Yet the report also underscored challenges rarely acknowledged in headlines:

Camelina was “relatively novel” in North America, with limited breeding and no large-scale seed supply chains.

Crushing and refining capacity simply didn’t exist at the necessary scale; capital costs for drop-in jet fuel far exceeded those of biodiesel.

Even as field trials expanded across more than a dozen states, contracts and guaranteed offtake commitments lagged behind.

The report concluded that “millions of acres of Camelina, and 100 million gallons per year of Camelina fuel, is still years away.”

In other words, you can’t skip the developmental rhythm. It takes time to scale seed genetics, prove yields, and build the logistics backbone. Rushing the oven doesn’t help. As any baker knows, turning up the heat just scorches the crust and leaves the middle raw.

All of this context is why Avalon’s work today is so significant. It isn’t just a fresh licensing agreement—it’s the culmination of fifteen years of patient progress: breeding improvements, policy development, and supply-chain experiments that laid the groundwork for this moment.

It also highlights a broader lesson running through both Avalon and NWABF’s projects. Whether it’s a novel financing structure to unlock engineering capital, or a new technology platform to process Camelina oil efficiently, success has required a willingness to do the quiet, unglamorous work for as long as it takes.

Looking at these projects through the GTESI persistence lens

In a GTESI frame, it’s a classic example of evolutionary persistence. While hype cycles around algae and miscanthus came and went, Camelina retained a clear value proposition: a low-carbon oilseed that could be grown without displacing food crops. Now, with Sulzer’s BioFlux technology—a proprietary liquid-full reactor that optimizes hydrogenation without vapor recirculation—the process economics have finally matured into something bankable.

It’s worth underscoring that this isn’t merely an incremental tweak. BioFlux significantly improves yield, extends catalyst life, and cuts costs. That’s how you get from “promising pilot” to real project finance.

And again, it circles back to the song refrain:

It’s gonna take patience and time to do it right.

Consider the through-line between NWABF and Avalon. Both teams recognized that no amount of technology hype can paper over weak fundamentals. You need feedstock security, robust engineering, de-risked financing, and credible offtake. You need alignment across growers, processors, airlines, and investors—and the humility to keep building while the spotlight drifts elsewhere.

If there’s a cautionary note this week, it comes in the proliferation of partial measures and symbolic gestures. We’re seeing airlines adopt tiny SAF blends—1% here, 2% there—and while every molecule matters, the question remains: what’s the pathway to 10%, 50%, or 100%?

The same goes for carbon capture pilots at airports and domestic SAF supply announcements. These are good steps, but the industry must guard against the illusion of progress. When partial measures get over-celebrated, they risk crowding out the full-stack efforts that can actually scale.

So how do you tell the difference? Which SAF efforts will persist and reshape the industry, and which will fade into footnotes?

GTESI suggests four questions worth asking:

Is the feedstock strategy resilient and scalable? Camelina, woody biomass, waste oils—these are credible, proven resources.

Is the process technology mature and differentiated? BioFlux is a great example of how core innovation can unlock cost and yield advantages.

Is the financing architecture robust? NWABF’s insurance-backed DEVCAP model removes a structural bottleneck.

Is there a clear path to offtake at meaningful volumes? Without buyers committing long-term, everything else is theory.

When you find projects answering all four, pay attention. That’s where persistence lives.

If this week proves anything, it’s that the path to sustainable aviation fuel is a slow train coming—but it is coming. Whether in the forests of Washington, the fields of Uruguay, or the labs in Dublin, the pattern holds:

It’s gonna take money.

And patience.

And time.

But when all three line up, the industry moves forward. No amount of hype can substitute for that alignment.",,N,,2025-07-08 18:06:31.669670

Investors are optimistic about continued growth in service revenue and pricing momentum ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings report.

GE Aerospace Inc. (GE) has experienced a significant stock performance boost this year, climbing over 46% year-to-date. The robust growth can be attributed to several factors, including strong aerospace demand, operational efficiency gains, and tariff-driven pricing strategies. The company's stock is currently trading near $244, well above its 50-day moving average of around $235, and approaching its 52-week high of $260.55 [1].

A key development contributing to this performance was the announcement of a multi-year service, repair, and overhaul (MRO) agreement with China Airlines. This agreement covers GE9X engines for China Airlines' 14 Boeing 777X aircraft, reinforcing a partnership that dates back to 1999. The GE9X engine, known for its 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor and full compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), has been a significant driver of the company's growth [3].

In the first quarter of 2025, GE Aerospace reported strong results, with revenue rising 11% year over year to $9.94 billion. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 60% to $1.49, beating the consensus estimate of $1.26.

As part of its broader climate strategy, the California Legislature is advancing AB 839, a bill introduced by Assemblymember Blanca Rubio that allows the Governor to certify up to three SAF projects for expedited judicial review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). While the bill aims to accelerate decarbonization in the aviation sector, critics warn the measure could set off legal disputes over due process and public health safeguards.

The CEQA Tradeoff: Speed vs. Scrutiny

At its core, AB 839 amends Sections 21189.81 through 21189.83 of the Public Resources Code to include SAF infrastructure as a qualifying project for CEQA streamlining. These projects would benefit from:

A 270-day limit for courts to resolve legal challenges,

Concurrent preparation of environmental records with EIR review,

Fast-tracked litigation procedures, including optional use of a special master,

And no judicial review of the Governor’s decision to certify a project.

While designed to reduce uncertainty for investors and developers, legal experts suggest this accelerated timeline may erode the public's ability to meaningfully engage in environmental oversight.

Precedent and Pushback

California has previously faced legal pushback for fast-tracking CEQA review of controversial projects, notably during the development of large-scale sports stadiums and high-speed rail. Although AB 839 applies only to a limited number of SAF projects, stakeholders from environmental justice communities are watching closely.

“Communities already burdened by poor air quality—especially near airports and refinery zones—deserve full transparency and a robust environmental review,” said a representative from a regional clean air coalition who asked to remain anonymous due to ongoing negotiations.

The bill attempts to mitigate concerns by requiring:

No use of fossil fuels in production,

Reduced emissions for conversions of existing Title V sources,

And impact mitigation specifically benefiting disadvantaged communities.

However, opponents argue these provisions may be insufficient without full CEQA litigation timelines.

The Stakes: SAF’s Role in California’s Climate Goals

California has ambitious aviation decarbonization targets. Under CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan, 80% of intrastate commercial aviation fuel must be SAF by 2045, totaling an estimated 3.5 billion gallons. Current SAF production, by contrast, remains limited both in scale and geographic distribution.

Proponents of AB 839 argue that CEQA streamlining is essential to meet these deadlines. The bill’s legislative findings cite urgent climate threats—wildfires, extreme heat, and emissions from hard-to-electrify sectors—as justification for prioritized review.

Without accelerated permitting, SAF proponents say, California risks falling behind other states and losing private investment to less regulatory-heavy jurisdictions.

Legal Uncertainty Ahead?

As of July 8, AB 839 remains in Senate committee, with its first hearing delayed at the author's request. Whether that signals a cooling of momentum or strategic recalibration remains unclear.

What is certain: if the bill passes and projects begin moving forward under expedited review, legal challenges are likely—particularly over CEQA’s long-standing role in environmental protection and public participation.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250707-190746-51c-A%20modern%20airport%20runway%20with%20an%20aircraft%20taking%20off%2C%20surrounded%20by%20wind%20turbines%20and%20solar%20panels%2C%20symbolizing%20sustainable%20aviation%20and%20renewable%20energy..jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:06:07.123164

To enable quantitative assessment of task imbalance \(I\), we define it for a given task using Eq.
This task imbalance metric reflects the scarcity of labels in a task relative to the most well-annotated task.
At low task imbalance values (\({I}_{i} < 0.5\)), there is no discernable performance difference between ACS and STL.
Under low task imbalance conditions, however, STL outperforms MTL-GLC due to its higher learning capacity, which is more effectively leveraged in this regime.","ACS effectively mitigates negative transfer

The seminal work introducing MTL showed that related tasks often reach local minima of validation error at different points in training, underscoring the importance of task-specific early stopping8. Building on this insight, ACS combines both task-agnostic and task-specific trainable components to balance inductive transfer with the need to shield individual tasks from NT. The backbone of our architecture is a single GNN based on message passing20, depicted in Fig. 1a, which learns general-purpose latent representations. These are then processed by task-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP) heads. While the shared backbone promotes inductive transfer, the dedicated task heads provide specialized learning capacity for each individual task. During training, we monitor the validation loss of every task and checkpoint the best backbone–head pair whenever the validation loss of a given task reaches a new minimum. Thus, each task ultimately obtains a specialized backbone–head pair.

To gauge the adequacy of this architecture, we first compare it with recent supervised-learning models on three MoleculeNet21 benchmarks—ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21—each containing two or more prediction tasks and split with a Murcko-scaffold protocol22 for fair comparison with previous works23,24,25,26. ClinTox distinguishes FDA-approved drugs from compounds that failed clinical trials owing to toxicity; SIDER comprises 27 binary classification tasks indicating the presence or absence of side effects; and Tox21 measures 12 in-vitro nuclear-receptor and stress-response toxicity endpoints. Detailed descriptions of these benchmark datasets are presented in the Methods section. In Table 1, we show that ACS either matches or surpasses the performance of comparable models; indeed, only D-MPNN26 achieves consistently similar results. While both ACS and D-MPNN employ message passing, the latter propagates messages along directed edges to reduce redundant updates. Overall, ACS demonstrates an 11.5% average improvement relative to other methods based on node-centric message passing.

We also compared ACS against recent few-shot learning approaches, including meta-learning methods and fine-tuned pre-trained models (see Supplementary Table 1). While these techniques are tailored for low-data regimes, they generally assume more reliably labeled tasks and more balanced support/query splits than the ultra-low data setting targeted by ACS. Moreover, while most meta-learning methods rely on a large number of training tasks to achieve effective generalization, traditional multi-task supervised learning approaches—including ACS—can perform reliably even with as few as two tasks. Similarly, although pre-trained models offer strong performance, they typically demand computationally expensive pretraining on large-scale unlabeled data and may struggle to generalize to sparse, domain-specific targets without significant fine-tuning. Performance and analysis of these meta-learning and pre-trained models on ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 can be found in the Supplementary Notes 1.

To clarify whether ACS’s gains stem from its overall architecture or its ability to mitigate NT, we benchmark multiple baseline training schemes (see Fig. 1). We compare ACS to MTL without checkpointing (denoted as MTL), MTL with global loss checkpointing (MTL-GLC), and single-task learning with checkpointing (STL), which devotes a separate backbone–head pair to each task; thereby removing all parameter sharing. Notably, STL has greater learning capacity than the MTL-based approaches, as it does not introduce parameter sharing. Nonetheless, ACS outperforms STL by 8.3% on average, indicating the clear benefits of inductive transfer. MTL and MTL-GLC also exceed STL, but by smaller margins (3.9% and 5.0%, respectively). The broader gap between ACS and the other MTL methods highlights the efficacy of ACS in curbing NT. On the ClinTox dataset, ACS shows particularly large gains, improving upon STL, MTL, and MTL-GLC by 15.3%, 10.8%, and 10.4%, respectively. By contrast, ACS’s edge over MTL and MTL-GLC is smaller on SIDER and Tox21—both of which differ substantially in size and sparsity from ClinTox. Tox21, for instance, is roughly 5.4 times larger than ClinTox and SIDER and has a missing-label ratio of 17.1%, whereas ClinTox and SIDER have no missing labels. Since ACS is designed to address NT arising from task imbalance, the minimal or absent label sparsity in these datasets limits the relative advantage of ACS. Accordingly, these results underscore the need to explore in more depth how dataset characteristics shape ACS’s effectiveness.

Building on this observation, we conducted extensive experiments on synthetic variations of task imbalance to further elucidate the full scope of ACS’s applicability; the results are presented in the following section. Taken together, our findings show that ACS can robustly mitigate NT by selectively adapting shared parameters while safeguarding task-specific knowledge—particularly under conditions that mirror real-world data imbalances.

Mechanistic insights and applicability domain

Previous studies have shown that synergies in MTL for molecular property prediction depend on both task-relatedness and molecular similarity6,27. However, the impacts of task imbalance on MTL remain relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically varied task imbalance using the ClinTox dataset28,29, which contains 1,478 molecules and two binary classification tasks: (1) FDA approval status and (2) failure in clinical trials due to toxicity. We then trained models under the four aforementioned schemes—STL, MTL, MTL-GLC, and ACS—to quantify how well each approaches NT.

To enable quantitative assessment of task imbalance \(I\), we define it for a given task using Eq. (1):

$${I}_{i}=1-\frac{{L}_{i}}{{\max {L}_{j}}}\atop {j{\mathcal{\in }}{\mathcal{D}}}$$

(1)

where \({L}_{i}\) is the number of labeled entries for the \({i}^{{th}}\) task in a dataset \({\mathcal{D}}\). This task imbalance metric reflects the scarcity of labels in a task relative to the most well-annotated task. By adjusting this ratio, we directly observe how NT emerges when certain tasks have substantially fewer labels.

Figure 2a, b illustrate ACS’s performance improvements compared to MTL-GLC and STL, respectively, across varying levels of task imbalance. Generally, ACS achieves the most significant gains in highly imbalanced scenarios, aligning with its goal of mitigating NT by checkpointing shared model parameters and retaining specialized task heads. Compared to MTL-GLC, ACS provides consistent performance improvement across different levels of task imbalance, as shown in Fig. 2a. This can be attributed to ACS’s more effective approach to mitigate negative transfer by checkpointing model parameters for each task individually. On the other hand, the checkpointing approach of MTL-GLC is less sensitive as it depends on variations in the global loss value. Relative to STL, the advantage of ACS tends to increase with increasing task imbalance. This is supported by the positive trend between performance improvement and task imbalance, as shown in Fig. 2b. At low task imbalance values (\({I}_{i} < 0.5\)), there is no discernable performance difference between ACS and STL. However, as \({I}_{i}\) increases beyond 0.5, the average performance gain steadily rises, with ACS achieving an average improvement of 8.1% for \({I}_{i} > 0.5\). The improvement of ACS over STL can be attributed to its ability to leverage inductive transfer while mitigating NT, a capability that becomes especially valuable under highly imbalanced conditions. Concurrently, MTL-GLC also outperforms STL under higher task imbalance conditions, albeit by smaller margins, as shown in Fig. 2c. This demonstrates how inductive transfer, which is absent in STL, can alleviate the impact of missing labels. Under low task imbalance conditions, however, STL outperforms MTL-GLC due to its higher learning capacity, which is more effectively leveraged in this regime.

These findings collectively define ACS’s applicability: it excels in high-imbalance regimes, where negative transfer is most severe, while remaining competitive as data balance and availability improve. The primary issue in these scenarios is how high-data tasks dominate shared parameter updates, leading to gradient conflicts that impair performance on lower-data tasks. ACS addresses this by preserving a checkpoint of the model before its parameters are affected by NT or noisy stochastic gradient descent updates. By doing so, ACS leverages the advantages of a more expressive network for well-represented tasks while safeguarding underrepresented tasks from the negative effects of excessive complexity.

In addition to analyzing the effects of task imbalance, we systematically evaluated how model capacity impacts ACS performance by varying the depth of the GNN backbone and the width of the MLP heads. As shown in Supplementary Notes 2, ACS performance on both ClinTox tasks remains relatively stable across a broad range of GNN and MLP configurations. While deeper GNNs (e.g., depth ≥ 7) show a slight performance decline, especially for FDA_APPROVED, the overall trends are consistent across tasks and do not indicate divergent behavior. Similarly, increasing MLP width yields comparable improvements or degradations across both tasks, suggesting that ACS adapts well to changes in per-task capacity. These results imply that the capacity mismatch between the shared backbone and task-specific heads does not appear to be a primary driver of negative transfer in this setting.

Ultra-low-data learning of molecular properties (Real-world deployment of ACS)

To evaluate the practical utility of ACS, we deployed it in a real-world application for predicting key properties of SAFs. ML approaches to SAF property prediction aim to reduce both the time and the cost of experimental testing. The design space of SAFs spans a wide variety of physical and chemical properties, which differ substantially in their cost and labor-intensiveness of collection5. Moreover, because aviation propulsion devices operate under unique conditions (e.g., below −55 °C at cruising altitude), SAF certification requires data gathered under specialized test protocols30,31. These factors lead to an incredibly sparse literature of experimentally measured SAF properties, making it a practical setting to assess the performance of ACS on limited data.

We compiled a dataset of 1,381 hydrocarbon molecules commonly found in SAFs, covering 15 critical properties for SAF design and certification. The Methods section provides details of data collection and preprocessing. A quantitative analysis of the SAF dataset reveals significant sparsity, with an average task imbalance of 0.75. The most underrepresented tasks reach a peak imbalance value of ~0.99 (Supplementary Table 4). This strong task imbalance induces NT as tasks with fewer samples exert limited influence on the shared network parameters.

For model comparison, we define two data regimes based on the number of labeled samples, n: an ultra-low-data regime (n < 150; median = 80) and a low-data regime (150 < n < 800; median = 424). We then benchmark ACS against the aforementioned baseline training schemes (as described in Fig. 1): STL, MTL and MTL-GLC. To ensure performance consistency, we employ a 5-fold cross-validation (CV) strategy during model training. As summarized in Fig. 3, ACS consistently outperforms these baseline methods, showing an average improvement of 12.9%. ACS also yields more stable performance across the 5-fold CV, reducing the coefficient of variation by 32.7% on average compared to the baseline approaches.

The advantage of ACS is especially pronounced in the ultra-low-data regime, where it achieves a 20.3% average performance gain over the other methods (Fig. 4, left). STL, which lacks inductive transfer, often fails on tasks with fewer than 60 samples. MTL and MTL-GLC do benefit from parameter sharing but still suffer from NT when large task imbalances occur. In contrast, ACS effectively mitigates NT, permitting beneficial inductive transfer even for tasks with minimal labeled data. As shown in Supplementary Notes 3, ACS maintains robust performance across all tasks, whereas the other methods show substantial variability in the ultra-low-data regime. Close inspection of MTL-GLC reveals that it can outperform STL for tasks with extremely scarce labels (owing to its inherent inductive transfer) but tends to underperform on tasks for which STL does not fail, leading to comparable overall performance. Conventional MTL shows the weakest performance overall, likely because it shares parameters without sufficient regularization against NT and lacks the higher task-specific capacity inherent to STL.

In the low-data regime (150 < n < 800), STL performance becomes comparable to that of ACS (Fig. 4, right), suggesting that tasks with larger datasets can fully leverage STL’s dedicated learning capacity. MTL and MTL-GLC also improve in this regime, as tasks with more labeled samples gain greater influence over network parameters. Nonetheless, ACS consistently provides robust performance across both data regimes, highlighting its effectiveness in scenarios with significant task imbalance and limited data availability.

Task-relatedness manifests in ACS backbones

In MTL, inductive transfer occurs when the training signals or learned representations from one task enhance the performance of another. Because ACS uses a shared backbone while allowing each task to maintain specialized parameters, tasks that are truly related produce backbones with similar latent representations. Inversely, limited task-relatedness is expected to reduce performance gains from ACS (See Supplementary Notes 5 for a detailed discussion). To investigate this effect, we calculated the cosine similarity between the final graph embeddings of each SAF dataset molecule across the task-specific backbones. For a given pair of task-specific latent vectors (u, v), the cosine similarity is defined as \(\frac{{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot {\boldsymbol{v}}}{\left|\left|{\boldsymbol{u}}\right|\right|{||}{\boldsymbol{v}}{||}}\). Higher similarity values indicate stronger alignment between task-specific backbone parameters. This alignment reflects convergent learning: although each backbone is optimized for a different property, related tasks discover overlapping representational structures in the molecular latent space. Because these embeddings are learned independently from a shared input, consistent alignment suggests the presence of common underlying molecular patterns or physical mechanisms. To account for any molecule-specific anomalies, we compute this metric separately for each molecule and then average the results across all molecules in the SAF dataset, yielding a single value for each pair of tasks. Figure 5 highlights the task pairs that rank in the top 10% for cosine similarity, corresponding to ≥ 0.96 similarity (see Supplementary Notes 4 for 15%, 20%, and 50% thresholds). Several task pairs display exceptionally high alignment, indicating that they capture shared underlying physical mechanisms or chemical features. These findings confirm that ACS can effectively harness inductive transfer by preserving meaningful commonalities among related tasks, while still allowing for task-specific specialization.

To illustrate these high-similarity relationships in more detail, consider autoignition temperature (AIT) and normal boiling point (\({T}_{b}\)). This pair exhibits a striking correlation of 0.996, consistent with previous quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models32. This strong correlation reflects how both properties hinge on how readily a compound transitions to the vapor phase before ignition. Given that \({T}_{b}\) is the temperature at which vapor pressure (\({P}_{v}\)) equals atmospheric pressure, we find that their ACS backbones are highly correlated (~0.986). The lower and upper flammability limits (LFL and UFL) also exhibit a correlation in terms of backbone parameters, producing a cosine similarity of 0.988. It is unsurprising that the flash point (FP) correlates at 0.974 with \({T}_{b}\), given that both properties depend strongly on volatility as demonstrated by previous QSPR studies33,34. In the same high-similarity tier, pairs such as UFL and melting point (\({T}_{m}\)) (~0.971) or AIT and lower heating value (LHV) (~0.969) illustrate how shared structural factors—such as chain length, functional groups, and intermolecular interactions—underlie ignition and phase-transition behaviors32.

Furthermore, we find LHV aligning with vapor pressure (\({P}_{v}\)) (~0.972), as well as viscosity (\(\mu\)) correlating at 0.991 with \({T}_{b}\). Both reflect how molecular weight and polarity simultaneously elevate boiling point, heat of combustion, and viscosity35,36. Meanwhile, moderate similarities arise among properties such as cetane number (CN) and surface tension (ST) (~0.836), or liquid heat capacity (\({C}_{p}\)) and \({T}_{b}\) (~0.802). Here, chain length and intermolecular forces still play a role, albeit in different physical systems (spray ignition behavior versus thermophysical measurements). Finally, correlations drop further when bridging distinct phases or conditions, for example, liquid thermal conductivity (κ) and \({T}_{b}\) (~0.531), or liquid density (\(\rho\)) and \({T}_{m}\) (~0.389). This reduction in correlation arises because the physics governing liquid-phase transport at moderate temperatures differ substantially from those governing boiling or solid-phase transitions.

One way to visualize correlations between latent space representations is through universal manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), a dimensionality reduction technique that preserves the local and global structure of high-dimensional data. Figure 6 displays UMAP projections for two of the aforementioned highly correlated task pairs, with colors indicating molecular families. While UMAP plots may differ in orientation due to the method’s invariance to rotation and reflection, the underlying structure remains consistent. For instance, the heart-shaped clustering in the AIT projection closely resembles that of \({T}_{b}\), albeit rotated by 180 degrees (Fig. 6a, b). A similar correspondence is observed for the flammability limits (LFL, UFL), where both projections show nearly identical clustering arrangements across chemical families (Fig. 6c, d).

These visual similarities are further supported by analyzing the placement of specific chemical families. In both LFL and UFL projections, n-Alcohols cluster tightly in the same region of the second quadrant, indicating that the two task-specific backbones project these molecules in a consistent manner. Likewise, the AIT and \({T}_{b}\) backbones position n-Alcohols along a prominent vertical pattern, which remains recognizable despite a 180-degree rotation between the two projections. When accounting for this rotational invariance, the embeddings of unsaturated aliphatic esters also align closely between AIT and \({T}_{b}\), occupying similar regions relative to other chemical families. These consistent, family-specific projections across related tasks suggest that task-specialized backbones tend to embed chemically similar molecules into structurally analogous regions of latent space—even in the absence of explicit chemical family supervision.

Moreover, the epoch of the last validation loss reduction supports the notion that similar tasks tend to receive positive parameter updates during consistent training intervals. Specifically, AIT and \({T}_{b}\) converged at epochs 341 and 333, corresponding to 47.0% and 46.0% of the total 725 training epochs, respectively. Likewise, LFL and UFL reached their final improvements at epochs 479 and 529—66.0% and 73.0% of training. These tightly grouped convergence points indicate that, despite differences in task label counts and complexity, related tasks tend to converge within similar portions of training, reflecting shared inductive learning dynamics.

Computational cost of training and inference

MTL can offer substantial computational gains whenever multiple downstream tasks share core representational requirements, thanks to parameter sharing in a unified model. This advantage often grows with both the number of tasks and model complexity. In our practical SAF property-prediction scenario, for example, MTL trained 11.5 times faster than the STL baseline while requiring only 6% of the trainable parameters, as shown in Table 2. These figures reflect our specific choice of model architecture, in which approximately 43% of the total parameters lie in the GNN backbone, and each prediction head only accounts for a small fraction of the parameters. Sharing this complex GNN backbone among tasks drastically reduces the overall training cost in MTL; however, a smaller backbone architecture would likely diminish this difference in speed relative to STL.

Despite more frequent checkpointing in ACS, we observed no significant increase in training time compared to MTL-GLC (as shown in Table 2). This result underscores the computational efficiency of ACS’s approach to mitigating negative transfer, even when running multiple training instances. The computational cost of checkpointing results in ~ 17% longer training time for ACS and MTL-GLC compared to MTL, highlighting the utility of low-overhead checkpointing techniques. Notably, molecular property prediction for material design applications typically requires simultaneous estimation of multiple performance indicators (e.g., stability and toxicity)5,6,37, making approaches like ACS especially well-suited for real-world design problems. By leveraging shared representations, such multi-property prediction methods streamline chemical space exploration and accelerate the discovery of viable molecular candidates.

Model architecture

Our framework comprises a shared GNN backbone and separate MLP heads—one head per prediction task. The GNN backbone consists of edge-conditioned convolutional layers38, each followed by a non-linear activation. Edge-conditioned layers incorporate bond information into the node update step, enabling the model to learn both atomic and bond-level features simultaneously.

Downstream of the backbone, each task is associated with a dedicated six-layer MLP that uses a cascading neuron configuration (i.e., hidden-layer sizes decrease progressively with depth). These MLP heads allow for task-specific learning while leveraging the shared latent representation generated by the GNN backbone. An ablation study utilizing a common MLP (matching the total parameter count of the task-specific MLPs) for all targets shows that task-specific MLPs achieve 38.7% higher performance than the common MLP.

Molecular graph construction

We use the PyTorch Geometric library39 to convert molecular SMILES strings into graph-based encodings. Each molecule is represented as a graph whose nodes correspond to atoms and whose edges represent chemical bonds. Node (atomic) features include atomic number, chirality, formal charge, hybridization, aromaticity, and ring membership, among others. Edge (bond) features capture attributes such as bond type and stereochemistry. Table 3 summarizes the complete set of features used for both nodes and edges.

Node features are stored in a feature matrix of size (\(N\times {d}_{{node}}\)), where \(N\) is the number of atoms and \({d}_{{node}}\) is the dimensionality of node features. Similarly, edge features are stored in an edge feature matrix of size (\(E\times {d}_{{edge}}\)), where \(E\) is the number of bonds. By passing these representations through the edge-conditioned convolutional layers, the model learns to aggregate information across nodes and edges in a task-agnostic latent space. Finally, each molecule’s latent representation is funneled into the task-specific MLP heads for final property prediction.

Adaptive checkpointing

Adaptive checkpointing continuously monitors the validation loss for each task and creates a checkpoint whenever a task’s validation loss decreases relative to its previous checkpoint. At these points, the current parameters of the shared backbone and the task-specific head are saved, ensuring that each task retains its best-known parameter state. By isolating these checkpoints, ACS mitigates negative transfer from other tasks in subsequent training steps. Table 4 presents pseudocode summarizing the training procedure.

At the end of the training, each task has an associated pair of backbone and head parameters corresponding to the best observed validation loss for that task. This strategy promotes effective inductive transfer while guarding against NT, ultimately enhancing performance across diverse and potentially imbalanced tasks.

Loss masking for missing values

We implemented a masking scheme (as shown in Fig. 7) within the loss function to maximize the use of training data. This approach selectively incorporates only valid data points, ignoring missing target values, while computing the error between predictions and targets. The final loss is normalized over the total number of target elements, ensuring robustness across varying dataset sizes. Unlike complete-case analysis, this method retains all available data without discarding samples, leading to more effective dataset utilization. Additionally, it mitigates the risk of poor generalizability associated with imputing missing values.

Uncertainty-informed loss function

For the SAF property prediction application, each training sample includes an associated uncertainty value \({\sigma }_{i}\), either sourced directly from experimental records or estimated based on the measurement procedure. To incorporate these uncertainties into model training, we scale the squared error term for each sample by \(\alpha /\left(\alpha + {\sigma }_{i}\,\right)\), where \(\alpha\) is a small-valued user-defined parameter. An \(\alpha\) of 0.1 was found suitable for our SAF dataset. The resulting uncertainty-aware mean squared error \(({{MSE}}_{{UA}})\) for n samples is given by Eq. 2:

$${{MSE}}_{{UA}}=\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{i-1}^{n}\,{\frac{\alpha }{\alpha + {\sigma }_{i}}{{\cdot }}\, \left({Y}_{i}-{\hat{{{Y}}}}_{i}\right)}^{2}$$

(2)

This formulation penalizes the model less for errors on samples with high uncertainty, preventing noisy measurements from disproportionately influencing parameter updates. An ablation study revealed that incorporating uncertainty in this manner boosted the model’s 5-fold cross-validation performance by approximately 1.6%.

Datasets curation and pre-processing

Benchmark datasets

To illustrate the advantages of ACS and delineate its domain of applicability, we selected a subset of MoleculeNet benchmarks21 —datasets that feature multiple downstream tasks and are tractable for parametric evaluations. The three benchmark datasets which satisfy these requirements—ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21—are described in the subsequent sections.

Each dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets (8:1:1) using Murcko scaffolds22, following standard practice23,24,25,40,41. This scaffold-based strategy ensures structural diversity across the splits, yielding a more robust test of model generalization.

To assess how effectively ACS mitigates negative transfer under varying conditions, we systematically adjusted task imbalance, as defined by Eq. (1), covering a broad range of imbalance scenarios. Concretely, we artificially introduced missing values into the CT_TOX column to achieve the desired level of imbalance, while retaining only a fraction of the overall samples to emulate a smaller dataset. By controlling this factor—ranging from heavily imbalanced, low-data scenarios to relatively balanced, data-rich conditions—we could pinpoint when ACS delivers the greatest benefit and when it remains competitive with conventional MTL and STL.

ClinTox

The ClinTox dataset consists of small molecules labeled according to their outcomes in clinical trials, specifically distinguishing compounds that were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from those that failed due to toxicity issues. It comprises two binary classification tasks: FDA approval status and clinical trial failure due to toxicity. ClinTox presents a relatively small number of labeled molecules (1478) and is fully labeled without missing entries.

SIDER

The SIDER dataset contains marketed drugs annotated with adverse drug reaction information. In its MoleculeNet version, it is formulated as 27 independent binary classification tasks, each indicating whether a compound is associated with a specific side-effect category. The dataset includes 1427 molecules and is fully populated without missing labels.

Tox21

Tox21 is a benchmark dataset derived from the Tox21 initiative, providing chemical compounds evaluated across 12 biological assays related to nuclear receptor signaling and stress response pathways. Each task is a binary classification problem reflecting whether a compound is active or inactive in a given assay. The dataset includes 7,831 molecules, with an overall missing-label rate of approximately 17%.

SAF properties dataset

To validate the practical utility of ACS, we applied it to a real-world scenario involving the prediction of SAF properties. In particular, we curated a dataset of 1379 molecules commonly found in various SAF blends, compiling only experimentally measured or rigorously derived physical and chemical property values. Any records generated by predictive models were excluded to ensure data reliability. As part of a comprehensive screening, we set an upper uncertainty limit of 5% on experimental uncertainty and discarded any entries exceeding this threshold.

The set of SAF properties spans a wide range of physicochemical characteristics relevant to performance, operability, and drop-in compatibility with aviation systems. For example, the LHV strongly influences aircraft payload capacity and travel range, making it critical for flight efficiency. Similarly, the CN is an important certification requirement for assessing a fuel’s resistance to lean blow-out during engine operation42. A detailed description of the prediction tasks and property definitions within the SAF dataset is provided in the Supplementary Information. Due to the high rate of missing labels in the SAF dataset, the 8:1:1 split (train, validation, test) used for the benchmark datasets was not feasible. Instead, we employed a 5-fold CV approach, which provided more robust estimates of model performance while accommodating the inherent sparsity of the SAF data. The coefficient of determination, \({R}^{2}\), was used as a global performance metric to accommodate the variety in physical units across SAF properties.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42004-025-01592-1/MediaObjects/42004_2025_1592_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-07-08 17:06:11.961711

The BBBA makes significant changes to the tax credits available under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), including

termination of 7 clean energy tax credits in 2025 or 2026

On July 7, 2025, the President issued a related Executive Order (the “BOC Order”) regarding the rapid termination of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar. This client update will focus on the effect of the BBBA and the BOC Order on clean energy tax incentives. For our coverage of the general business tax provisions of the BBBA, click here.

1. Revision to the ITC and PTC

A. Rapid Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Wind and Solar

The eligibility of wind and solar projects for the ITC and PTC is being phased out rapidly. To be eligible for either credit, the wind or solar facility must either

begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA), or

be placed in service prior to January 1, 2028.

B. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Existing IRS guidance provides liberal rules for determining when construction begins for purposes of ITC and PTC phaseouts. Under the existing IRS guidance, a taxpayer can begin construction (“BOC”) by commencing physical work on the project (including certain off-site work on a component of the project) or incurring 5% of the cost of equipment for the project. Under a safe harbor in the existing IRS guidance, a project that begins construction in 2026 can be placed in service as late as December 31, 2030, or in some circumstances even later. However, unlike the beginning of construction principles applicable under the FEOC rules (discussed below), the applicable IRS guidance is not statutorily frozen as of January 1, 2025.

The BOC Order directs that “[w]ithin 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

It seems likely that the new IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order will be more restrictive than existing IRS guidance. The scope and effective date of the new guidance is unknown.

C. Accelerated Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Other Technologies

For technologies other than wind and solar, the BBBA accelerates the phaseout of the ITC and PTC by eliminating the prong of the phaseout that was based upon the year that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production fall to 25% of 2022 levels. As a result, such projects that begin construction before 2034 will generally be entitled to the full ITC or PTC rate, but those rates will drop to 75% for construction begun in 2034, 50% for construction begun in 2035, and 0% thereafter. The scope of the BOC Order is limited to the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar, so it is not clear to what extent any IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order might apply to other technologies or for other purposes of the ITC or PTC (including, for example, the domestic content or energy community adders).

D. Increased Domestic Content Requirement to Qualify for ITC Adder

Under prior law, the level of domestic content required to qualify for the domestic content adder for the ITC was permanently set at 40% (or 20% for offshore wind), while the percentage required to qualify for the PTC version of the adder increased over time. Under the BBBA, property that began construction before June 16, 2025 will continue to require 40% domestic content; however, projects beginning construction in 2025 after June 16, in 2026, or in a later year must consist of 45%, 50%, or 55% U.S. components, respectively, to qualify for the domestic content adder. These required percentages are lower (20%, 27.5%, and 35%) for offshore wind facilities beginning construction before 2027, then 55% thereafter.

E. PTC Adder for Nuclear Energy Communities

The BBBA expands the energy community credit adder to apply to certain advanced nuclear facilities that claim the PTC, but not to any such facilities that claim the ITC. An “advanced nuclear facility” is defined as any nuclear facility for which either the reactor design was approved after December 31, 1993, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and such a design or a substantially similar one was not approved before such date, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has authorized construction and issued a site-specific construction permit or combined license. To qualify for the energy community bonus credit on this basis, the advanced nuclear facility must be located in a metropolitan statistical area which has (or at any time after December 31, 2009, had) 0.17% or greater direct employment related to the advancement of nuclear power.

F. Leased Systems Formerly Eligible for Section 25D Credit for Solar Water Heating or Wind

The BBBA disallows the ITC and PTC for solar heating property and wind property that qualifies for the homeowner’s credit under section 25D, as in effect prior to its repeal by the BBBA. This disallowance is limited to property that is leased to the homeowner. An earlier version of the BBBA would have extended this disallowance to leased rooftop solar systems, but that provision was not included in the bill as enacted.

G. ITC for Fuel Cells

The BBBA creates a 30% ITC specifically for qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after 2025. This credit is not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, but it also does not benefit from other ITC adders. Fuel cells had previously struggled to qualify for the ITC after revisions in the IRA required property for which the credit is claimed to have an anticipated greenhouse gas emissions rate of no greater than zero. Under the BBBA, fuel cells qualify for the full 30% ITC regardless of technology, fuel type, or greenhouse gas emission profile.

2. Transferability (Sale) of Credits

Section 6418, allowing transfers (sales) of tax credits, has been revised to disallow the transfer of most clean energy tax credits to any entity that is a specified foreign entity (see the discussion of the FEOC rules below). This is an improvement over earlier versions of the bill that would have more broadly phased out the ability to transfer credits.

3. Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

A. Phaseout of Credit for Applicable Critical Minerals

Under prior law, the section 45X manufacturing credit for applicable critical minerals had no expiration date. The BBBA adds a phaseout that starts one year later than the pre-existing phaseout for other section 45X eligible components. The full credit rate is available for applicable critical minerals sold before 2031. Applicable critical minerals sold in 2031, 2032, or 2033 will be eligible for 75%, 50%, or 25% respectively of the currently allowable credit. Applicable critical minerals sold after 2033 will not qualify for a credit.

B. New Applicable Critical Mineral Category: Metallurgical Coal

The BBBA creates a separate category of applicable critical minerals for metallurgical coal, defined as coal suitable for use in the production of steel within the meaning of guidance published by the Department of Energy. Metallurgical coal produced before January 1, 2030, will qualify for a credit of 2.5% of the relevant production costs.

C. Changes to Rules Regarding Other Eligible Components

The credit for production of wind energy components will not apply to components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The phase-out for other eligible components is unchanged.

An additional requirement was added for a component to qualify for the $10 credit for battery modules. The module must be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and battery harnesses, or other essential energy collection equipment.”

D. Reduced Scope of Integrated Component Rule

The BBBA modifies the rule that deems one or more eligible components to be sold to an unrelated person (as required to qualify for the credit) if such eligible components are integrated, incorporated, or assembled into another eligible component that is produced and sold to an unrelated person. Under the BBBA, the integration, incorporation, or assembly into the second eligible component must occur in the same manufacturing facility, at least 65% of the direct materials costs for the second eligible component must be for components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and the credit is unavailable if the second component is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a third component. This rule applies to components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

4. Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

The credit for carbon capture and sequestration was largely untouched by the BBBA and, in one respect, was significantly enhanced: the credit amount per ton of captured carbon oxide that is used in enhanced oil or gas recovery or for other commercial purposes, such as food and beverage, was increased from the current rate of $60 per ton to $85 per ton, the rate that was previously available only for carbon oxide disposed of by sequestration. This increase in the credit amount is equally available to carbon oxide captured from industrial emissions or direct air capture. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025; carbon capture projects already placed in service would not be able to claim the higher credit amounts for these uses. The requirement that construction of carbon capture projects begin before January 1, 2033, is unchanged. The FEOC rules also apply to the Section 45Q credit as covered below.

5. Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The BBBA extends the availability of the Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z to fuel sold through December 31, 2029. However, qualifying fuels produced after December 31, 2025, must be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Under prior law, there had been a question as to whether certain production processes could be considered to have a negative emissions rate for most fuels by resulting in an enhanced credit amount. The BBBA explicitly rules out application of a negative emissions rate by providing that, for purposes of determining the emissions factor, qualifying fuels may not be treated as having an emissions rate of less than zero. However, the BBBA offers a significant exception to this prohibition in allowing biofuels derived from animal manure (which is the fuel category most commonly assigned a negative emissions rate) to have a negative emissions rate. In a blow to the sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) industry, the BBBA reduces the per gallon credit for SAF from $1.75 to the amount available to other transportation fuels of $1.00, effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025. As with other credits, these changes are in addition to the limitations under the FEOC rules covered below.

6. Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

The BBBA accelerates the date by which clean hydrogen production projects must begin construction to December 31, 2027. This is considered a win for the sector after earlier versions of the BBBA would have required a 2025 beginning of construction date. The sector also benefits from the continued availability of the investment tax credit for hydrogen storage, compression and liquefaction equipment under section 48E and, as discussed above, the investment tax credit for hydrogen fuel cell property.

7. Termination of Other Clean Energy Credits

The BBBA significantly accelerates the end date for various tax credits relating to the acquisition of clean energy-related property. These credits, and the new applicable end dates, are as follows:

Section 25E Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 45W Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit—property must be placed in service by December 31, 2025;

Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit—expenditures must be incurred by December 31, 2025;

Section 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit—property must be placed in service by June 30, 2026;

Section 45L New Energy Efficient Home Credit—home must be purchased by June 30, 2026; and

Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction—property must begin construction by June 30, 2026.

8. Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC)

With the exception of the Section 45V credit for hydrogen production, all IRA tax credits that survive beyond 2026 are subject to disallowance under new FEOC rules if the taxpayer, facility, or product has impermissible connections to China or other disfavored countries or entities. The FEOC rules may disallow the relevant tax credit to a “specified foreign entity,” a “foreign-influenced entity,” or an entity that receives “material assistance” from a “prohibited foreign entity.” Each of those terms has a complex definition, as described below. The particular rules that apply, and the effective date of those rules, varies from credit to credit, as set forth in the table below.

A. Prohibited Foreign Entities, Specified Foreign Entities, and Foreign-Influenced Entities

1. Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE)

A “prohibited foreign entity” (“PFE”) is defined as either a “specified foreign entity” (“SFE”) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (“FIE”).

2. Specified Foreign Entities (SFE)

An SFE is defined as a “foreign-controlled entity” (“FCE”) or an entity designated as a bad actor under certain existing statutes, including designation as a “foreign entity of concern,” a “designated foreign terrorist organization,” or a “Chinese military company operating in the United States.” An FCE is defined as any of (i) the government of a covered nation (including any level of government below the national level and any agency or instrumentality thereof), (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs. A “covered nation” is any of China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

3. Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIE)

An entity is an FIE if it satisfies either

a direct control test for the current tax year, or

with respect to the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit, an “effective control” test for the preceding tax year.

Under the direct control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if (i) a single SFE has the direct authority to appoint a board member, executive level officer, or person with similar powers or responsibilities, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the debt of the entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs. Special rules apply for determining whether a publicly traded entity is an FIE.

Under the effective control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if it makes a payment to an SFE pursuant to an agreement that entitles the SFE or a related party to exercise effective control over (i) a facility with respect to which the ITC or PTC may be available or (ii) the production of an “eligible component” under the section 45X manufacturing credit. The statute sets forth thirteen different powers, any one of which alone will constitute “effective control.” These powers generally relate to power over operations or output of a facility, including exclusive control over a critical system within the facility. Six of those specified powers are operative immediately; seven of those specified powers are only relevant to the extent provided in regulations to be issued in the future. The BOC Order directs that “within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

B. Material Assistance Rules for ITC, PTC, and Section 45X Manufacturing Credit

1. General Rules

A taxpayer is not entitled to claim the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit with respect to property with respect to which it receives “material assistance” from a PFE. Whether “material assistance” has been received is determined by comparing the “material assistance cost ratio” for such property to a “threshold percentage.”

The material assistance cost ratio (“Cost Ratio”) of a qualified facility (under the ITC or PTC) or energy storage technology (under the ITC) is the ratio of (i) the total costs attributable to manufactured products (as defined for purposes of the domestic content adder) incorporated upon completion of construction excluding costs of products that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total costs attributable to manufactured products incorporated upon completion of construction. The Cost Ratio for a facility that produces eligible components under the section 45X manufacturing credit is the ratio of (i) the total direct costs that are paid or incurred for the production of an eligible component excluding costs paid or incurred for production of such eligible component that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total direct costs paid or incurred for the production of the eligible component.

Threshold percentages are established by statute and vary by the type of property with respect to which a credit is being claimed and the year in which such property begins construction or is sold. Generally, the threshold percentages range from 40% to 95% and increase over time.

The BBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables no later than December 31, 2026, which will identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or total direct material costs of any eligible component which are attributable to a PFE and provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer’s material assistance from a PFE. As noted above, the BOC Order directs Treasury to provide guidance regarding FEOC matters within 45 days of the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA. Until such safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on tables issued in guidance on the domestic content adder (Notice 2025-08) and certifications provided by suppliers under penalty of perjury stating that property or direct material costs were not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

For purposes of the ITC and PTC, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, for use in a facility that begins construction before August 1, 2025 and is placed in service before January 1, 2030 (or January 1, 2028 for wind and solar facilities), will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

For purposes of the section 45X manufacturing credit, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025 and used in a product sold before January 1, 2027 will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

2. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Within the definitions of a PFE and “material assistance,” the BBBA directly incorporates IRS Notice 2013-29 and subsequent related guidance addressing the beginning of construction of a project or facility for tax purposes, as in effect on January 1, 2025. The narrow context (PFE and material assistance) in which the BBBA adopts the BOC principles in effect on January 1, 2025, suggests that this “freeze” of BOC guidance as of January 1, 2025, does not apply in any other context. That appears to be the theory underlying the President’s direction to Treasury in the BOC Order to provide “new and revised” guidance regarding the meaning of “beginning of construction” for purposes of the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar.

3. Penalties and Statute of Limitations

The FEOC rules impose new or harsher penalties relating to the material assistance rule and a longer statute of limitations for IRS examination of material assistance issues.

A taxpayer that claims a credit which is later disallowed due to an IRS adjustment to the Cost Ratio of the underlying property may be liable for a substantial understatement penalty on understatements of tax greater than 1% of the true tax liability, as opposed to the normal 10%.

A supplier who makes a certification under the material assistance rules that it knows or reasonably should have known is false will generally be required to pay a penalty of 10% of the resulting underpayment of tax by its customer.

The period during which the IRS may assess additional tax for an error relating to material assistance from a PFE is extended to six years.

4. ITC Recapture Rule for FEOC Effective Control Payments

A taxpayer will be subject to recapture of 100% of the ITC claimed with respect to a property if within 10 years after the property is placed in service it makes a payment that would be deemed to provide an SFE with “effective control” over the taxpayer as described above. This rule applies to property placed in service in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

5. Summary of Application of FEOC Rules to Surviving Tax Credits

The table below summarizes the applicability of the FEOC rules disallowing tax credits to specified foreign entities, foreign-influenced entities and taxpayers who receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

Credit Restrictions on SFEs Restrictions on FIEs Restrictions on Property with Material Assistance from a PFE Section 45Q—Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 45U—Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 45V—Clean Hydrogen Production Credit None None None Section 45X—Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

“Eligible components” do not include any property which includes material assistance from a PFE for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Section 45Y—Clean Electricity Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities do not include any facility the construction of which includes material assistance from a PFE, and which begins construction after December 31, 2025. Section 45Z—Clean Fuel Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 48E—Clean Electricity Investment Credit

No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology do not include property the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025, if such construction includes material assistance from a PFE.

In addition to the time pressure to implement begun construction strategies and understand the implications of the FEOC rules, the BBBA creates a number of significant changes to existing tax credits, as well as adding new uncertainties for credit qualification, which may affect tax equity and transferability strategies. We at Baker Botts would be pleased to assist you in these and other clean energy tax incentive matters.

1“ITC” refers to the clean electricity investment credit under section 48E. “PTC” refers to the clean electricity production credit under section 45Y. Apart from some changes affecting geothermal heat pump property, the BBBA did not impose new restrictions or limitations on the energy credit under section 48 or the renewable electricity production credit under section 45, both of which are generally available only if construction of the relevant property began before 2025.",https://bbt-prod-cd.azurewebsites.net/assets/src/images/logo-og.gif,N,,2025-07-08 18:06:36.147089

Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 globally. In Porto Alegre, Brazil, traffic-related fatalities have surged, with 84 people losing their lives in 2024, the highest rate in seven years.

In light of this issue, Fundação Thiago de Moraes Gonzaga, Translab and iRAP, with support from FedEx Brazil, launched the “Safe Pathways to Schools” project. This initiative focuses on improving road safety for students by engaging the school community, assessing school road infrastructure with Star Rating for Schools (SR4S), implementing tactical urbanism and advocating for permanent improvements and reduced speeds.

The school zone selected for the project is E.M.E.E.F Prof. Elyseu Paglioli, located in the Cristal neighborhood of Porto Alegre. This school supports children and adolescents with disabilities, many of whom have mobility challenges. The area buzzes with foot traffic, surrounded by two other schools, a daycare, a health center, homes, and shops, all adding to the presence of vulnerable road users.

In addition to enhancing child road safety, the project incorporates green elements into its tactical urbanism approach, potentially providing vital environmental and social benefits such as water purification, recreational spaces, and climate resilience, especially relevant after Porto Alegre’s historic flood in May 2024. FedEx Brazil volunteers will also play a key role in supporting the implementation of these interventions.

The country’s challenge is not a lack of technology, capital, or ambition. It’s a gap in policy architecture. Without bankable demand, Australia’s most promising clean commodity projects – green iron, sustainable aviation fuel, and clean ammonia – remain stuck at the starting line.

To meet that challenge, we propose a new demand-side policy model: the Clean Commodities Trading Initiative (CCTI) – a flagship example of green energy statecraft. At its heart is a new tool for national transformation: Clean Commodity Credits that reward innovation and emissions savings.

A market-friendly mechanism to kickstart large-scale clean production.

Green energy statecraft is a strategic approach to governance that uses the clean energy transition to simultaneously advance a nation’s economic, environmental, social, and geostrategic goals. Unlike conventional industry policy, which focuses on domestic market corrections, statecraft treats clean energy as key to national security and prosperity – used to build alliances, secure supply chains, boost productivity, and shape global rules.

The European Union, China, Japan, and South Korea are all pursuing variations of green energy statecraft. Australia must do the same – on its own terms, with tools suited to its advantages, institutions, and budget.

The CCTI is the tool for our times.

The CCTI is a market-friendly mechanism to kickstart large-scale clean production. Its core function is simple: government acts as an early buyer of clean commodities – not to stockpile goods, but to create the conditions for investment. Clean production projects face long lead times and high capital costs. But their biggest barrier is price uncertainty. Firms can’t justify investment if they don’t know whether the market will pay a green premium to offset higher costs. The CCTI removes that uncertainty. It contracts with producers to buy a baseline volume at agreed floor prices. These offtake agreements give developers and financiers the confidence to proceed.

But the real innovation lies in what happens next.

Upon purchasing clean commodities such as green iron, the CCTI would decouple the physical products from their clean attributes by creating Clean Commodity Credits, or Innovation Credits, since the clean attributes reflect not just lower emissions but innovation in production. This dual-market approach allows the physical commodities to be sold in conventional markets while the credits are banked or traded later.

A clean commodity contains two price components: the base cost of the commodity; and the cost of producing it with low emissions. This second factor – the “green premium” – raises prices above conventional alternatives. Clean Commodity Credits solve that problem. They let clean commodities enter traditional markets without the higher price tag. Meanwhile, the CCTI can offset its support costs by monetising the credits in flexible ways. As we argue in our new paper, it could:

Bank credits for future sale as regulatory markets mature

Sell credits into voluntary markets to recover costs

Create bundled products combining physical commodities with clean attributes

This flexibility allows the CCTI to adapt as markets evolve, maximising taxpayer value while supporting market development.

In effect, these credits create bankable demand for green innovation. They send a clear price signal – not just for carbon, but for the kinds of technologies, processes, and business models that will define the clean economy. They give governments a strategic mechanism to stimulate private investment and build advantage in future-facing sectors.

If Australia continues to rely on patchwork subsidies and fragmented supply-side measures, it will fall behind.

Traditional carbon markets, while important, work by penalising emissions. But in heavy industry, where low-carbon alternatives are still emerging, penalties alone often aren’t enough to drive change. Establishing a market for these credits flips the model. Instead of punishing laggards, it rewards leaders. Governments can set clean production targets – say, 30 per cent green steel by 2030 – and let firms meet them by innovating or buying credits from early movers. It creates a race to the top, not just a drag on the bottom line.

This model rewards firms that act now with firm demand at a price that justifies production – not in 2030 when carbon prices bite or regulation finally arrives. And it allows government to recover its support as credit markets develop. Once established, the same principle can apply to any product the government deems strategic, regardless of its carbon value. Thus Innovation Credits may be the better name.

Japan and South Korea, two of Australia’s key trading partners, seek long-term access to clean industrial inputs they cannot produce domestically. Australia, with its renewable energy resources and export capacity, is a natural partner. By embedding Clean Commodity or Innovation Credits into trade relationships – through joint offtake agreements, shared credit markets, or co-investment in CCTI-backed facilities – Australia can deepen economic ties and build geopolitical resilience. This is green energy statecraft in action: aligning clean industry development with alliance-building and regional stability.

The energy transition is a global race. Other countries are moving decisively. If Australia continues to rely on patchwork subsidies and fragmented supply-side measures, it will fall behind. The CCTI offers a smarter, faster, and more strategic path forward. It reflects the kind of governance Australia now needs: bold, integrated, efficient, and effective.

Green energy statecraft isn’t just theory. It’s practice. And with the right tools, Australia can lead.",https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/Green%20Australia%20comp.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 15:06:51.552709

Carbon capture and clean fuels The bill tightens conditions for Section 45Q tax credits for carbon capture.","The signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB Act) by President Donald Trump on 4 July marks a pivotal shift in the United States’ climate and energy trajectory.

The sweeping legislation dismantles much of the clean energy incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while expanding support for fossil fuel activities.

The act radically alters tax credit timelines and access, setting off a rush among developers to start construction before new deadlines in 2025 and 2026.

As the US exits international climate commitments and rolls back green energy support, local governments, clean tech firms and sustainability advocates face heightened uncertainty.

Stepping back from clean energy commitments

Under the new legislation, technology-neutral tax credits for power and storage projects are set to decline steeply.

Solar and wind projects that begin construction by 31 December 2025 can avoid new restrictions, such as those targeting Chinese equipment under the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules.

Projects that start by 4 July 2026 are exempt from a hard deadline to be in service by the end of 2027, but any that fail to start by then must be operational by 2027 to qualify for tax credits.

The tax credit phase-outs are stark: after 2027, wind and solar projects lose access to both the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) unless they meet stringent conditions.

According to Princeton University, this rollback could reduce new wind and solar capacity by 70 GW by 2030, raising household energy costs by US$165 per year and slashing emissions reductions from a target of 40% to just 3%.

Charging infrastructure at risk

The EV sector is hit particularly hard.

The Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit (Section 45W), which provided US$7,500 to US$40,000 per vehicle, is repealed for vehicles acquired after 30 September 2025.

This change affects electrification efforts across municipal fleets, including school buses, public works vehicles and police cars.

Similarly, the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit, supporting EV and hydrogen charging stations, is phased out for installations not in service by 30 June 2026.

This undermines efforts to build out the charging networks necessary to support growing electric mobility.

On the consumer side, incentives like the Section 30D Clean Vehicle Tax Credit and Section 25E Used Clean Vehicle Credit will also expire in September 2025.

Princeton analysis estimates this could result in eight million fewer EVs sold this decade.

Hydrogen and fuel cells

Hydrogen sees its own deadline advance.

Projects must now be under construction by the end of 2027 to qualify for the Section 45V hydrogen production credit of up to US$3/kg – five years earlier than under the IRA.

Fuel cell projects, however, gain an exemption from emissions tests and labour requirements to qualify for a 30% ITC, but only if construction begins after 2025.

Unfortunately, those starting in 2025 fall into a legislative gap, qualifying for neither legacy nor new credits.

Energy storage and geothermal

Battery storage and geothermal projects retain tax credit access at full value through 2033, phasing down in 2034 and 2035.

However, like solar and wind, these technologies face compliance with FEOC rules from January 2026.

Given China’s dominance in battery supply chains, navigating these restrictions will be challenging.

Geothermal may fare better due to a more domestic supply base, making it a more viable option for municipalities looking to deploy low-carbon heating and cooling systems.

Legal complexity

FEOC provisions bar projects and companies from claiming tax credits if they rely heavily on Chinese equipment, financing or technology agreements that amount to “effective control” by foreign entities of concern (including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea).

While the rules officially take effect in 2026, their lack of clarity is already causing anxiety among developers.

Taxpayers and local governments alike must now trace supply chains more rigorously than ever, or risk losing tax credit eligibility.

Carbon capture and clean fuels

The bill tightens conditions for Section 45Q tax credits for carbon capture.

Projects must now meet narrower definitions and avoid ties to foreign entities.

Credit values remain at US$85 per tonne for permanent sequestration and US$60 for reuse, but scope is limited.

Section 45Z clean fuel tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable fuels are extended through 2029, though SAF credits drop to US$1/gal from 2026.

Fuel feedstocks must come exclusively from North America, and complex accounting rules block credits for fuels already benefiting from other tax incentives.

Residential and community impact

The OBBB Act repeals several residential clean energy incentives, including:

Section 25D rooftop solar credits, ending 31 December 2025

Section 25C home energy efficiency credits, ending 31 December 2025

Section 179D commercial efficiency deductions, ending 30 June 2026

Section 45L new energy-efficient home credits, also ending 30 June 2026.

Without these, local homeowners and businesses lose incentives to invest in decarbonisation.

Videos by TravelAwaits

In just about every sector, there’s a promising new green initiative. From resorts with coveted carbon-neutral statuses to airlines allowing passengers to donate more to carbon-emission-relieving projects to locally sourced menus at restaurants to underwater sculpture parks that regrow coral reefs, travelers today have more options than ever before when it comes to sustainability.

The creative ideas are there—and they’re abundant, scientifically sound, and constantly being refined and optimized.

That being said, travel infrastructure isn’t always up-to-snuff. Sustainability projects, as much as I love them and as much as other travelers are demanding them, must be operationally feasible.

As of 2025, many hospitality groups and travel companies are playing catch-up to make their practices, operations, and products more sustainable.

But some are actually ahead of the curve, providing a clear framework for ongoing sustainability measures that other groups can adopt.

Enter Pittsburgh Airport, one of the US’s most quietly sustainable travel hubs. A few years back, it opted to go green with on-site clean energy generation. Now, it’s taking things even further with plans to launch a sustainable aviation fuel refinery on-site.

Pittsburgh Airport goes green in 2021

Back in 2021, Pittsburgh Airport announced plans to create an on-site microgrid that would provide all the energy necessary to run the airport. Since it went live, the microgrid has used a solar panel facility and natural gas-fired generators that fully power the nearly 9,000-acre Pittsburgh Airport property.

Thanks to a private and publicly funded partnership between IMG Energy Solutions, Peoples Gas, and the Allegheny County Airport Authority, Pittsburgh Airport has run almost entirely on sustainable forms of energy. That means it uses the traditional grid as a backup.

For fans of sustainability, that’s a huge coup. But even if you couldn’t care less about green initiatives in the travel world, it’s still a commendable act.

Remember earlier this year when Heathrow Airport was thrown into chaos due to a power grid problem in London? What about a similar blackout in Portugal and Spain? Airports with sustainable, on-site power grids don’t need to worry about blackouts from the traditional grid.

Plans for an on-site refinery are taking shape

Pittsburgh Airport’s impressive microgrid has since influenced new projects for major hubs like JFK and Houston International Airport. But that project took off in 2021, meaning Pittsburgh Airport staff have had plenty of time to start innovating in other directions.

Their latest idea? Take that microgrid innovation and apply it toward on-site aviation fuel refineries. With a sterling reputation for improving green aviation operations, Pittsburgh Airport has been able to attract investors and partners.

Specifically, with the clean fuel-based company Avina, which will turn alcohol into aviation fuel using a Houston-based firm called KBR.

This type of fuel is known as sustainable aviation fuel (aka SAF). It’s a biofuel that has a much lower carbon footprint and can be mixed with traditional jet fuel. But it’s not totally carbon neutral; most sources say that it could be as much as 80% more efficient.

(If you want to learn more about SAF, you can explore this handy summary from the International Air Transport Association.)

The on-site refinery should produce around 120 million gallons of sustainable fuel each year, around 70 million of which would be used by the airport, according to airport CEO Christina Cassotis. The rest would be sold and shipped off-site.

Currently, Cassotis and company are working to generate more funds from another investment round before finalizing plans for the SAF refinery. Additionally, Pittsburgh Airport will be opening a new central terminal this autumn.

GHG Reduction Targets: ESMA commits to reducing its gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 15.4% by 2027 and 31.4% by 2030, using 2023 as the base year.

Operational Focus: Key emission sources—business travel, energy consumption, and food—will be addressed through targeted internal policies and decarbonization levers.

Annual Monitoring: Progress will be disclosed annually via ESMA’s Annual Report and Environmental Statement, with future revisions adjusting to external changes and data improvements.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has released its first Climate Transition Plan, marking a strategic shift to align its internal operations with the EU’s long-term climate goals and the Paris Agreement. With this initiative, ESMA targets climate neutrality by 2050 and sets interim GHG reduction goals of 15.4% by 2027 and 31.4% by 2030 compared to its 2023 emissions baseline.

“In 2023, ESMA base year emissions amounted to 457.1 tCO2e, mainly resulting from staff business travel, energy and food consumption,” the agency noted in the report.

The plan outlines a series of internal actions, including the introduction of an annual GHG emissions budget for air travel, optimising energy usage by closing underutilised office floors, and promoting lower-carbon food options in staff canteens and catering services.

RELATED ARTICLE: ESMA Introduces Measures to Enhance Corporate Sustainability Reporting

“Our plan is a demonstration of commitment,” said Natasha Cazenave, ESMA’s Executive Director. “As market participants step up to implement their transition strategies, we must hold ourselves to the same standards.”

Approximately 72% of ESMA’s 2027 reduction target could be achieved through actions under its direct control—such as switching long-haul flights from business to premium economy, implementing energy-saving measures, and changing catering orders to reduce their carbon footprint.

To maintain progress toward its 2030 target, ESMA acknowledges that greater reliance will be needed on external stakeholders. These include landlords for decarbonising the energy supply, catering providers for adjusting meal offerings, and broader changes in aviation industry practices.

Financial analysis within the plan suggests possible annual savings between €85,000 and €120,000 by 2030, stemming from lower travel costs, energy efficiency, and reduced office rental space.

While ESMA may consider carbon credits or Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) certificates in the future, it emphasizes that gross GHG emission reductions are the priority in the short-to-medium term.

“The need for a revision of this TP will be considered on a regular basis,” the plan notes. “Such revisions may lead to adjustments to ambition and actions planned, especially where external factors have caused delay or where mitigation outcomes were overestimated.”

Implementation and oversight will fall under the purview of ESMA’s Executive Director and Management Board, supported by the Eco-management Steering Committee. Data quality management and performance indicators will guide ongoing assessments.

Cazenave added, “Balancing our climate objectives with our ability to deliver on our mission will require careful judgement. But we are confident that, with the engagement of our staff and suppliers, we can make meaningful progress.”

This plan supports ESMA’s broader mission under the European Green Deal and aligns with sustainability directives such as the CSRD and CSDDD, offering a model for other EU bodies in operational climate governance.

The scale of this shift is staggering. According to the latest Global Project Tracker from the Mission Possible Partnership, sunbelt countries now account for 30% of the world’s planned clean industrial projects, with the MENAT region alone representing 20% of the global ammonia pipeline.

From Saudi Arabia to Oman, governments are investing billions in green hydrogen infrastructure, clean fuel export hubs, and ammonia synthesis facilities, aiming to leverage their natural advantage of abundant solar energy into global economic strength in a net-zero world.

The implications for aviation and other hard-to-abate sectors are huge. Green ammonia is rapidly becoming a keystone of the global clean fuel economy. It can be used directly as a maritime fuel, converted back to hydrogen for industrial or power use, or serve as a building block for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In this sense, the Middle East’s rise as a clean ammonia powerhouse could help fuel the decarbonisation of flight far beyond its own borders.

Cost advantage meets market demand

The economics are aligning in the region’s favour. BloombergNEF projects that countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Brazil will see green ammonia production costs drop below those of grey ammonia by 2035, driven by falling renewable energy and electrolyser prices.

The Middle East’s renewable electricity is already among the cheapest in the world, and its large-scale infrastructure capacity gives it a head start on global competition. These advantages are bolstered by increasing international interest in offtake agreements, particularly from Europe and Asia, where domestic hydrogen production is either too expensive or lacks sufficient renewable capacity.

Yet this story of opportunity also comes with real-world constraints. Despite the promising pipeline, over $775 billion worth of announced projects in sunbelt EMDEs (Emerging Markets and Developing Economies), progress remains sluggish. Over the past six months, only one clean industrial project in the entire Sunbelt region has reached a final investment decision. Many others are stalled in pre-investment limbo, awaiting the certainty that only long-term offtake agreements, policy frameworks, and investment guarantees can provide.

Turning policy into progress

This is where government policy will play a decisive role. If the Middle East wants to transition from potential to production, it will need to offer more than natural advantage. It must build the policy certainty and financial instruments that will convert announcements into real plants and long-term partnerships. That means national mandates for clean fuels, clearer export regulations, carbon pricing mechanisms, and public funding for early-stage projects.

Equally important is the question of domestic demand. While much of the region’s clean fuel vision is export-oriented, supplying European, Korean, and Japanese markets, building a local clean fuel economy would offer resilience and scale. Integrating green hydrogen and SAF into national aviation, energy, and heavy industry sectors would not only decarbonise domestic operations but also create the steady baseline demand needed to attract investment at scale.

The global payoff could be transformative. With sufficient investment and infrastructure, clean ammonia produced in the Gulf could be shipped to Rotterdam, reconverted into hydrogen, and used to power European industry or aircraft. This could reduce Europe’s reliance on fossil-based imports and position the Middle East as a clean energy trade partner, rather than just a supplier of fossil fuels. Such trade corridors, or green energy highways, could become the backbone of the future global energy economy.

Ultimately, the clean industrial revolution will not be won by technology alone, but by a combination of geography, policy, and leadership. The Middle East has the first two. Now it must deliver the third. With the world watching and the climate clock ticking, the region has a unique opportunity to define its post-oil future.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/07/08/rajiv-bajaj-i4QIqfcTkN8-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 11:07:42.863443

1. Bio Jet Fuel Plant: A dedicated facility at the Boaventura Complex will produce 19,000 barrels per day (bpd) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), directly addressing the aviation sector's decarbonization needs.

2. Bio-Refining Synergies: The Reduc refinery's tests with renewable diesel blends (e.g., Diesel R7) and its new thermal power plant (replacing outdated equipment) reduce emissions while improving operational efficiency.

3. Circular Economy Projects: A re-refining initiative to convert used oil into lubricants (6.3 thousand bpd capacity) exemplifies Petrobras' move toward waste-to-value models, aligning with global sustainability trends.

These projects are not just incremental upgrades—they're a repositioning of Petrobras as a provider of both traditional and renewable energy solutions, leveraging Brazil's abundant agricultural feedstock for biofuels.

Valuation: A Stock Trading at a Discount to Its Transition Potential

While Petrobras' stock (PBR) has long been overshadowed by geopolitical risks and legacy liabilities, its current valuation metrics suggest a compelling entry point.

Forward P/E: Petrobras trades at 4.98x, significantly below Exxon (XOM, 15.2x) and Chevron (CVX, 14.8x). This reflects undervaluation relative to its earnings growth potential from refining upgrades and biofuel synergies.

EV/EBITDA: At 4.05x, Petrobras is cheaper than the global oil majors' average of ~8x, underscoring its operational leverage in Brazil's energy ecosystem.

Free Cash Flow (FCF): With an FCF yield of 27%, Petrobras generates capital far exceeding its valuation, a rare trait in an industry facing capital discipline pressures.

Analysts are bullish: A consensus ""Strong Buy"" rating with a 40% upside to $17.97 highlights the gap between current pricing and future earnings potential.

The Risks: Navigating Debt and Dividend Sustainability

No investment is without risks. Petrobras' 274% payout ratio (dividends exceeding earnings) raises concerns about dividend sustainability if oil prices fall or projects underperform. Additionally, its debt-to-equity ratio (0.93)—though manageable—requires scrutiny.

However, Petrobras' $85 billion debt cap and focus on free cash flow reinvestment mitigate these risks. The company's ability to secure low-cost financing in Brazil and its dominant market position further insulate it from immediate liquidity threats.

Why Investors Should Look Past Near-Term Concerns

The energy transition isn't a binary choice between oil and renewables—it's a gradual shift where refiners like Petrobras play a critical role. By investing in biofuels and efficiency, Petrobras is future-proofing its refining assets against obsolescence.

Key catalysts for upside include:

1. Regulatory Tailwinds: Brazil's push for renewable energy mandates and carbon pricing will boost demand for Petrobras' biofuel projects.

2. Cost Discipline: The company's focus on CAPEX alignment with cash flow and debt reduction targets ($65 billion by 2029) reduces execution risks.

3. Geopolitical Leverage: As global oil markets tighten, Petrobras' control of Brazil's pre-salt reserves and refining capacity provides a moat against competitors.

Investment Thesis and Recommendation

Petrobras' $6 billion Rio de Janeiro expansion is more than a refinery upgrade—it's a strategic reallocation of capital toward low-carbon growth. With valuation multiples at historic lows and a dividend yield of 13.9%, the stock offers a rare blend of income and capital appreciation potential.

Buy the dip: Investors should consider initiating a position in PBR at current levels, with a target price of $18 (40% upside) and a stop-loss below $10 to account for oil price volatility.

While risks like high payout ratios and geopolitical uncertainty linger, Petrobras' alignment with energy transition trends and its undervalued metrics make it a compelling long-term bet.

Monte Shaw, Executive Director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA), said the bill comes at a crucial time.
Grant Kimberley, Executive Director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board (IBB), said the renewed support is especially critical for small, independent producers.
“This is a vital lifeline to biodiesel plants across Iowa.
He also praised the bill for prioritizing North American feedstocks and eliminating penalties tied to indirect land use change—two changes that could significantly benefit soybean farmers and biodiesel plants alike.","A newly passed federal bill is being hailed as a major victory for Iowa’s biodiesel producers, who have faced a tough year marked by financial strain, low Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) blending levels, and uncertainty around clean fuel tax credits, reports Energy.Agwired.com.

The legislation—referred to by industry leaders as the “Big Beautiful Bill”—extends key incentives and restores critical tax credits aimed at reviving the domestic biodiesel industry. It has brought much-needed optimism to producers across the state, many of whom had idled plants or reduced operations due to market instability in 2025.

Monte Shaw, Executive Director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA), said the bill comes at a crucial time. “Countries around the world and many of our states are demanding ultra-low carbon fuels,” he said. “This bill helps open the door for the investments needed to produce those fuels here at home, using North American feedstocks.”

The legislation extends the §45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit through 2029, allows for the transfer of the credit, and reinstates the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit through 2026—raising its value to 20 cents per gallon.

Grant Kimberley, Executive Director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board (IBB), said the renewed support is especially critical for small, independent producers. “This is a vital lifeline to biodiesel plants across Iowa. We’re grateful to Senator Chuck Grassley for championing this provision,” he said.

He also praised the bill for prioritizing North American feedstocks and eliminating penalties tied to indirect land use change—two changes that could significantly benefit soybean farmers and biodiesel plants alike. “For producers who’ve been idled or operating below capacity since the start of the year, this sends a strong, hopeful signal about the road ahead,” Kimberley added.

However, industry leaders expressed concern over the bill’s changes to incentives for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The credit for SAF production was reduced from $1.75 to $1.00 per gallon, and technical adjustments now make it harder for producers using ethanol as a feedstock to qualify for the credit. SAF is seen as a key future market, potentially reaching 100 billion gallons annually by 2050.

Given that many of the 45Z tax credit changes don’t take effect until 2026, IBB is urging the U.S. Treasury to quickly issue clear rules and guidance for how the credit will be implemented in both 2025 and beyond.

The bill is expected to restore momentum in Iowa’s biofuel sector, offering new hope to producers and farmers alike after a year of deep uncertainty.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biodiesel-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 11:08:04.094829

Michael Newton, Executive Vice-President and Co-founder of Natural State Renewables, highlighted that the project deliberately avoids the use of food crops, aligning with the company’s commitment to sustainability and regional economic development.

Clay Marbry, Senior Vice-President for Project Development and Co-founder, added that the facility will use biomass-fuelled boilers to generate power on-site.

This new platform directly connects airlines seeking SAF with producers offering supply, streamlining negotiations and accelerating the adoption of SAF across the aviation industry.

The SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical challenges in the SAF market: Efficiency: By providing a centralised, no-fee platform, the Matchmaker simplifies and speeds up the procurement process, reducing costs and administrative burdens for airlines. This efficiency is expected to stimulate growth in the voluntary SAF market.

Secondly, the platform allows SAF producers to post available or planned fuel volumes, while airlines can register their demand. This direct matching mechanism facilitates better alignment of supply and demand, with final trade negotiations conducted offline.

Also, the comprehensive data on SAF offerings—including volume, feedstock, production technology, emissions reductions, and compliance with international standards such as CORSIA and the EU Renewable Energy Directive—ensures transparency and informed decision-making.

IATA’s senior vice president, Sustainability and Chief Economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, emphasised the platform’s strategic role in achieving aviation’s net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050. She stated, “To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

Hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub—a centralised digital space for aviation energy management—the SAF Matchmaker supports both spot purchases and long-term offtake agreements. Initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers, the platform is expected to expand access to other buyers, such as non-aviation corporations, further broadening the market.

This innovation marks a significant step toward decarbonising air travel by facilitating easier access to sustainable fuels, which can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel. By enhancing market transparency and connectivity, the SAF Matchmaker is poised to accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources and support global climate goals.

With a Middle East crisis once again roiling global oil markets, a new report shows that American-made ethanol keeps gasoline prices down—saving drivers well over $50 billion each year, or 39 cents per gallon.

“As our nation again prepares to celebrate its freedom on July Fourth, this report demonstrates the enormous value of American-made ethanol in promoting energy independence,” said Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “The United States is producing record volumes of crude oil and reducing its dependence on foreign sources. Still, as recent events have shown, the global nature of petroleum markets means that disruptions occurring halfway around the world can impact fuel prices here at home. Blending low-cost ethanol into gasoline is a proven strategy for reducing fuel prices and strengthening the U.S. market’s resilience against global supply chain disruptions.”

In the report, George Hoekstra of Hoekstra Trading LLC, an expert in petroleum refinery process research and technology management, analyzed the economics of substituting ethanol for refinery-derived gasoline, considering the effects on both octane value and energy content. Ethanol is a high-octane, low-cost component of the fuel supply. The report estimates the cost of refinery-derived octane to be 4.5 times higher than that of ethanol-derived octane.

Hoekstra concludes, “The energy equivalent substitution to a level of 10 percent ethanol implies that ethanol is adding a net of 39 cents/gal worth of octane to the U.S. E10 gasoline pool. To say this another way, if ethanol was removed from the U.S. gasoline pool, replacing its current octane contribution with refinery octane would increase refining cost and the wholesale cost of gasoline by 39 cents per gallon or $54 billion/year.”

E10, a blend containing 10 percent ethanol, is the predominant form of finished gasoline sold in the United States. Hoekstra also estimated that the cost savings per gallon of finished gasoline increase as ethanol content increases. The study found that using blends like E15, which are becoming more widely available in the U.S. market, results in even larger savings.

The study, which was commissioned by RFA, did not consider the other ways in which ethanol can contribute to lower gasoline prices, notably the aggregate effect of boosting U.S. fuel supplies by approximately 1 million barrels a day.

Amid this turbulence, OMV Group has emerged as a model of strategic adaptability, leveraging its diversified portfolio of low-carbon projects and disciplined capital allocation to insulate itself from market volatility. By prioritizing sustainable transformation—through renewables, carbon-efficient projects, and geothermal innovation—OMV is positioning itself not just to weather current challenges but to lead in Europe's energy transition.

Low-Carbon Projects as Anchors of Stability

At the core of OMV's resilience is its commitment to low-carbon initiatives, which are engineered to offset revenue pressures from traditional hydrocarbon markets. Key projects include:

Neptun Deep Gas Project: A EUR 4 billion venture in Romania's Black Sea, this project aims to deliver 8 billion cubic meters of gas annually by 2027. By reducing reliance on Russian gas imports, Neptun Deep bolsters energy security while stabilizing cash flows through long-term gas sales agreements.

Geothermal Energy: OMV is pioneering deep geothermal systems in Austria and Germany, targeting climate-neutral heating for 200,000 households by 2027. These projects, supported by favorable regulatory environments, offer predictable revenue streams and align with EU decarbonization mandates.

Renewable Fuels: Investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) refineries—such as the EUR 750 million Petrobrazi plant in Romania—are scaling up to meet 250,000 tons/year of production by 2027. Contracts with airlines and corporate clients underpin demand, shielding profits from crude price swings.

Cash Flow Fortitude and Capital Discipline

OMV's financial strategy ensures that its transformation is both ambitious and sustainable. A key pillar is its focus on maintaining strong cash flow:

Operating Cash Flow Targets: OMV aims to achieve EUR 7.5 billion in annual operating cash flow by 2030, up from EUR 7 billion previously. This is underpinned by Brent oil prices of EUR 80/bbl and gas prices of EUR 25–30/MWh, which the company forecasts will hold through 2030.

CAPEX Allocation: 40–50% of its EUR 3.8 billion annual organic CAPEX is directed toward low-carbon projects, ensuring that sustainability goals do not divert funds from core operations.

Dividend Policy: A 5–10% annual increase in base dividends through 2030, alongside special dividends when leverage stays below 30%, rewards shareholders while preserving financial flexibility.

Operational Agility in a Volatile Landscape

OMV's adaptability shines in its response to market headwinds:

- Diversified Supply Chains: Gas sourcing from Norway, Italy, and the U.S. mitigates geopolitical risks, while polyolefins sales in high-margin specialty chemicals offset broader market overcapacity.

- Efficiency Programs: A EUR 500 million efficiency drive by 2027 aims to counter inflation and operational costs, reinforcing margins.

- Regulatory Readiness: Methane emissions have been slashed by over 70% since 2019, outpacing EU targets, and Scope 1/2 emissions are set to fall 30% by 2030.

Risks and Mitigation

While OMV's strategy is robust, challenges remain:

- Permitting Delays: Geothermal projects in Germany face regulatory hurdles, but OMV is engaging proactively with policymakers.

- Commodity Volatility: A prolonged gas price slump could strain margins, though Neptun Deep's long-term contracts provide a buffer.

Investment Outlook: A Steady Hand in Turbulent Waters

OMV's blend of cash flow discipline, low-carbon diversification, and operational focus makes it a compelling investment for long-term energy investors. With a leverage ratio of just 12% (Q1 2025) and a track record of shareholder returns averaging 10% annually, the stock offers stability amid market chaos.

Recommendation: Buy or hold OMV for investors seeking exposure to Europe's energy transition. The stock's valuation—currently trading at 5.2x 2025E EV/EBITDA—appears reasonable given its growth trajectory. Monitor execution of Neptun Deep and the Q2 2025 results (due July 31) for confirmation of its financial resilience.

In a sector rife with uncertainty, OMV's transformation is no gamble—it's a calculated bet on the future of energy, backed by the strength of its balance sheet and innovation pipeline.",,N,,2025-07-08 07:07:14.035942

Jet card “owners” (NetJets’ name for its card customers) have 24 months to use their flight hours.","Flexjet, a long-established force in the fractional jet ownership market (since 1995), and also one of the leading providers of jet cards, defines its jet card customers as “UHNW [ultra-high net worth] individuals, families, and companies”. According to Andrew Collins, the CEO of Flexjet, “a significant proportion have self-made wealth, distinguishing them as high-achieving entrepreneurs, investors and business leaders in sectors such as finance, real estate and technology”.

Collins explains that “one key demographic shift we are seeing is clients getting younger, with a growing proportion now falling in the 45-54 age bracket. Our average age for a new client was 58 in 2024, four years younger than it was in 2019”.

It’s easy to see why jet card programmes are gaining traction when you consider the alternatives, some of which require a CFO, a legal team and a meditation app. For example, outright ownership of a jet is the ultimate status symbol — until you’re managing hangar leases, crew contracts, juggling maintenance schedules plus the emotional burden of insuring a flying palazzo. It can cost tens of millions upfront and millions more per year in upkeep, and your jet will sit idle most of the time. It’s a bit like buying a château in Bordeaux just because you like the house wine.

Fractional ownership companies offer a “lite” version of this. About £375,000 typically buys 50 hours a year — but with some companies you’ll still pay monthly fees, compete for availability, and occasionally (with some programmes) share the ride, sometimes with someone else’s labradoodle.

Then there’s jet charter, which gives you on-demand convenience, but the price can yo-yo, especially in and around the glitzier fashion shows and swanky sports fixtures (hourly charter jet rates can oscillate between £3,700 and £11,000 for even the smallest jets during the Monaco Grand Prix).

These options all have their place for the right individual or corporate entity, but jet cards fill an important niche, with their blend of luxury, stable pricing (one of the main pulls) and availability at short notice. One call, or a few taps on an app (which most jet card outfits now provide) and your jet will soon be spooling up its engines on the tarmac while the galley is being topped up with Pierre Hermé macarons.

But before you reach for your Meisterstück to sign up there are a few endearing quirks to watch out for. Some jet cards charge by estimated flight time, others from “wheels up to wheels down”, meaning any scenic detour or weather delay becomes your financial responsibility. Then there are “repositioning fees” (aka ferry fees) — charges for when a private jet must fly empty to or from another airport to pick you up or after dropping you off. Some jet card providers absorb these, others trim them off your tab.

And what about that upfront retainer? With some cards your deposit sits safely in an escrow account, but with others it’s helping to fund the provider’s day-to-day operations. Meanwhile, lower-tier cards can be rigid, with fewer route possibilities, less perks, and aircraft that may lack the wow factor promised in the brochure.

Another aspect to look out for is that some card operators have their own dedicated fleet of aircraft (the best option for a consistent service experience), whereas others don’t own a single plane and rely on a pool of spare capacity sourced from an array of jet charter operators. Verifying what the set-up is should be high on your checklist before you take the plunge.

Finally (and this is something that many people forget to ask) check how much baggage allowance is included — bear in mind that smaller jets have very limited stowage space.

That said, jet card memberships are just the ticket for high-flyers who crave the perks of private aviation without too much palaver. They’re also useful for helping jet-set rookies dip their toes into the world of private aviation without getting out of their depth. According to Flexjet’s Collins, “we see our jet card as the perfect introductory programme for those looking to experience Flexjet, before considering the longer-term commitment of fractional ownership, which is generally for five years or more”. Many of Flexjet’s jet card holders do go on to become fractional owners, having experienced the Flexjet experience via its jet card programme, and as their flying needs and service expectations increase.

Which provider might be right for you? It comes down to the intricacies of quality, service, convenience and of course budget. There are about 45 jet card companies worldwide. Here are four of those with the upper hand.

Flexjet’s jet card — elevated simplicity powered by the Praetor 600

Flexjet’s European jet card is positioned as a stepping stone into private aviation. It’s a highly refined product tailored for individuals who want seamless access to a top-tier fleet, consistent service and a taste of what Flexjet’s fractional ownership model has to offer.

At the heart of Flexjet’s European jet card offering is the Embraer Praetor 600, an aircraft Flexjet knows intimately. “Flexjet was the launch operator,” Collins says. “It hits a sweet spot in terms of its performance, spacious cabin and category-leading range, which allows nonstop flights to New York or Dubai from northern Europe.”

With space for up to nine passengers and a dedicated cabin server, the Praetor 600 is designed for transcontinental travel, with a range of 4,018 nautical miles and endurance of up to eight hours. Cruising at 466 knots (roughly 536mph) it can soar at altitudes up to 13,716m (about 45,000ft) where the air is usually less turbulent than the layer of airspace wherein mainstream airline traffic operates. It also comes with a generous 4.39 cubic metres of baggage capacity — oodles of space for your Louis Vuitton Pyramide Bistens.

Flexjet’s card provides 25 hours of prepaid flying time, with guaranteed availability within 48 hours — or 120 hours during 25 peak travel days, plus 10 blackout days, with fixed hourly pricing set at €14,900 (£12,550 approx).

A huge plus is that cardholders benefit from access to Flexjet’s own fleet, ensuring service standards remain consistently high, and the company’s operation is underpinned by significant long-term investment. This year, it announced a $7 billion deal with Embraer, placing orders for 182 business jets with options for 30 more — an industry-shaping commitment that will help to keep its fleet among the most modern and efficient flying today.

Sustainability is another priority. Flexjet partners with the aviation consultancy 4AIR to deliver meaningful environmental action, including 300 per cent carbon offsetting on every flight. This goes beyond CO₂ to account for contrails and other emissions. Clients can also choose to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and contribute to next-gen flight research.

“This jet card,” Collins says, “is aimed at those who are looking for an exceptional service experience at the very top of private aviation with the simplicity of a jet card format.”

Jettly’s no-fuss formula for private jet travel

Jettly’s jet card programme offers clients flexible, transparent and cost-effective access to a global network of over 23,000 private aircraft, all with fixed hourly rates and no hidden fees.

“Our focus,” explains Justin Crabbe, the CEO of Jettly, ”is on delivering seamless, personalised private jet experiences without the complexities of ownership”.

The company’s “pay-as-you-fly” card starts at $50,000 (about £37,000) for 25 hours, with no minimum usage requirement and no long-term commitment. The service draws high-net-worth individuals, business executives and corporations. But Crabbe observes that “we’re seeing emerging interest from younger, tech-savvy entrepreneurs and a growing number of leisure travellers looking for safe, flexible alternatives to commercial flights”.

Jettly says it’s investing heavily in technology to enhance the customer experience, including AI-powered flight booking, digital membership management, and the integration of blockchain and NFT technology. “Our goal,” Crabbe says, “is to simplify private aviation while providing more transparency and flexibility for our clients.”

Still, sourcing aircraft from a global pool can raise concerns about consistency — something Crabbe is quick to address. “We rigorously vet and partner with top-tier operators globally. Every aircraft meets our safety, maintenance and service standards,” he says. “Our dedicated concierge team works closely with clients and operators to tailor each flight to their preferences.”

Unlike some rivals, Jettly promises “no blackout dates”, Crabbe confirms. “We offer guaranteed availability with as little as ten hours’ notice.”

Sustainability is also on the radar. Jettly provides optional carbon offsetting and is “exploring partnerships with sustainable aviation fuel providers”.

Asked how he thought the private aviation market would evolve over the next 5-10 years, Crabbe says he anticipates continued growth, driven by evolving traveller expectations, technological advancements, and increased focus on sustainability. “Blockchain and digital platforms will likely reshape ownership and access models, while sustainable aviation fuel and hybrid-electric aircraft will become more prevalent.”

NetJets — the discreet card behind 500,000 flights a year

Backed by Berkshire Hathaway, NetJets runs one of the busiest private aviation operations in the world, with over half a million flights annually and a fleet that includes aircraft from Bombardier, Cessna and Embraer. Customers include over 40 of the Fortune 100 companies (over 50 professional golfers choose NetJets year after year).

The company itself has a vast footprint, with a global team of over 9,000 employees with on-site support at its most popular global destinations. Cardholders get access to a 24/7 service team, and at many major hubs its “NetJets Service Representatives” assist with arrivals and departures.

The price of a NetJets Card begins at $200,000 to $300,000 (£148,000 to £221,000) (depending on which aircraft type you sign up for), with “no hidden expenses and ferry fees”. Every NetJets Card (beginning with its offering that unlocks 290 days of annual access) is prepaid in 25-hour increments. Jet card “owners” (NetJets’ name for its card customers) have 24 months to use their flight hours.

Inside the cabin, there’s consistency across the fleet. The interiors lean towards a minimalist, functional style — pale leather seats, dark woods and neutral textiles. Materials are chosen for durability and sustainability, and the company was one of the first to pioneer a sustainability initiative in the private jet sector — “Blue Skies”, which has been running since 2008. All cardholders are automatically enrolled and contribute to carbon offset projects tied to the number of hours they fly.

For those who value privacy, tail numbers (registration numbers visible just underneath the tail of every aircraft) are never publicly linked to clients, and boarding is typically via private lounges — so customers can rest assured they won’t be tracked (and their whereabouts shared on social media) by celeb stalkers.

Additionally, NetJets invests in numerous art, food and wine, music, yachting and premier sports events (including golf, equestrian sports, tennis and motorsports). And from complimentary upgrades to once-in-a-lifetime experiences, customers gain access to exclusive benefits through more than 50 premier partnerships with other luxury brands (the company’s present and past collaborations include such brands as Mercedes-AMG, luxury yacht brokers Northrop & Johnson, and Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts).

VistaJet — the wild card

Then there’s VistaJet. VistaJet defies categorisation, but it is a heavyweight contender. It’s a jet membership programme, yet it sidesteps the “card” badge — and it’s not a charter operator either.

“VistaJet is not a jet card offering. We have a solution for every private aviation client through our VistaJet and XO brands,” insists Thomas Flohr, the founder and chairman of Vista Global Holding. The Swiss billionaire set up the Vista brand in 2004 (a year after he bought his first Learjet) to offer “more than transportation … a way of life, exquisitely tailored to those who fly not just often, but well”.

The Vista group includes aircraft management, leasing and flight operations solutions, making it a one-stop shop for every kind of private aviation client. It owns its entire fleet of 270 aircraft, so every seat, surface and smile in the sky is under their Vista brand — no charter roulette here.

The core proposition, VistaJet, focuses on guaranteed availability and a polished experience, with fine bed linen, cashmere blankets, and Christofle silverware and porcelain on board. Its “cabin hosts” are trained by the British Butler Institute and MedAire (aviation specialists providing life-saving training, medical kits, and expert advice from aviation medical doctors and security experts).

VistaJet’s “50-hour-per-year Program Membership” offers a fixed hourly rate locked in for three years. So whether you’re flying at Christmas, Easter, or during peak summer, the price stays blissfully the same. Hourly rates for different aircraft types vary. For example, the Challenger 350 (an eight-seater aircraft with 7 hours’ flight endurance) starts at about $15,000 (£11,000) per hour, while Global 7500 options (with 14 seats and a 17-hour non-stop flight capability) are about $25,000 (£18,445) per hour.

Every booking is supported by Vista’s global team of 4,000, offering service 24/7 across all time zones. You can also switch between aircraft types, because some days you need an Embraer Phenom 300 (with 6 seats), while at other times you might be travelling with a larger entourage, so one of VistaJet’s Embraer Lineage 1000E jets with 18 seats might be a better play.

VistaJet’s service is augmented by brand sibling XO, which is your on-demand option for private aviation via smartphone, a kind of skyborne “Uber”. In short, VistaJet is white-glove precision, while XO is sleek spontaneity.

At the heart of Vista is a fleet that isn’t bound to any single location — what Flohr calls a “floating fleet concept”. This ensures that, wherever you are in the world, a beautifully appointed aircraft is just 24 hours away. “We guarantee an aircraft available to fly our Members anytime and anywhere,” Flohr adds, “with the highest level of service, and a consistent experience on every flight.”

Even pets and children receive VIP treatment. From the VistaPet service (which includes VistaPet Pochette — a travel bag on board every flight containing “bio-organic animal treats, water-free shampoos, soothing wipes and toys to keep companions entertained throughout the flight”) to “Adventures in the Sky” experiences for younger flyers, every detail is considered. “We want you to feel a sense of familiarity. It should feel easy, almost like home,” Flohr says.

Sustainability, too, isn’t an afterthought. Vista has contracted 4.2 million US gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and offset over 2.2 million tonnes of CO₂ on behalf of clients.

CORSIA, launched in 2016, is a market-based mechanism aimed at capping and gradually reducing carbon emissions from international flights. Vietnam’s participation begins during the scheme’s final voluntary phase and reflects a significant step toward its broader decarbonization goals. The country aims to cap emissions at 85% of 2019 levels between 2024 and 2035, with a long-term target of achieving net-zero emissions in aviation by 2035.

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, the government has taken several preparatory steps to meet CORSIA requirements. These include drafting regulations on aviation fuel standards and emissions tracking, implementing Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) mechanisms for international flights, and submitting historical emission data from 2019 to 2024 to ICAO.

While ICAO has commended Vietnam for demonstrating strong readiness among developing countries, industry experts warn of substantial financial implications for domestic carriers. Estimates suggest Vietnamese airlines could spend between USD 5.6 million and USD 37.5 million annually on carbon credits, depending on market fluctuations. Over the voluntary phase, total offset costs could reach between USD 13 million and USD 92 million, based on carbon credit prices ranging from USD 6 to USD 40 per metric ton of CO₂-equivalent.

Airlines Respond with Sustainability Investments

Vietnam’s major carriers have already begun preparing for the transition. Vietnam Airlines, buoyed by a strong post-pandemic recovery and successful debt restructuring, reported a record net profit of VND 7.95 trillion (approx. USD 304 million) in 2024. The airline has reaffirmed its commitment to reducing emissions through fleet modernization and greater adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

In 2024, Vietnam Airlines operated its first SAF-blended international flight on the Singapore–Hanoi route, followed by six SAF-powered domestic flights to commemorate World Environment Day.

Low-cost carrier Vietjet Air is also aligning its operations with CORSIA’s goals. In June 2025, the airline finalized a purchase agreement with Airbus for 100 A321neo aircraft. The new jets promise at least 20% improved fuel efficiency and can operate on up to 50% SAF, positioning Vietjet for a more sustainable future.

As Vietnam prepares for full integration into CORSIA, the government continues to explore ways to balance environmental responsibility with economic sustainability, particularly for its aviation industry, which plays a critical role in national connectivity and tourism.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/18-3.png,N,,2025-07-08 01:58:48.982431

Representing ACI APAC & MID, Mr. Mohan Sai Gurugubelli, Manager-Sustainability and Environment, presented regional strategies on climate adaptation and decarbonization, highlighting the urgency of airport resilience and the industry’s net-zero commitment.

A Call for Climate Adaptation and Resilience

In an effort to help airports prepare for the impacts of climate change, ACI APAC & MID presented a paper on “Climate Adaptation Guidance and Tools for Airports.” The paper unveiled a major 18-month initiative that will deliver tools and guidance materials to help airports put adaptation measures in place.

The initiative has already garnered strong momentum, with 60 airport operators representing 224 airports committed to the study. A dedicated Task Force, including members such as Bahrain International Airport, Darwin International Airport, Dubai International Airport, Hong Kong International Airport, Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport, has been formed to steer the project. The paper also urged States to recognise the growing climate risks and encourage their airports to participate in the study to enhance the long-term operational resilience.

Showcasing Efforts Towards Net Zero

In another paper titled “Airports Efforts for Net Zero Carbon Emission Goal,” Mr. Mohan Sai outlined the region’s progress on decarbonization. The paper highlighted three core ACI initiatives driving this change: the globally recognised Airport Carbon Accreditation programme, the Net Zero Roadmap programme; and the Green Airports Recognition programme.

According to a statement issued by CARB on June 27, OAL has now approved the LCFS regulations, allowing the amendments to take effect on July 1.
“Implementing the July 1 effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph.","The California Air Resources Board on June 27 announced amendments to the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulations will take effect beginning on July 1. The amended regulations were approved by the agency in November 2024, but implementation was delayed due to regulatory clarity issues.

CARB on Nov. 8 approved updates to its LCFS that aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045. The updates also include a variety of technical changes to the LCFS program, including those requiring fuel producers to track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin; requiring independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks; prohibiting palm-derived fuels from receiving credits; placing a cap on the use of soybean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil in the production of LCFS-compliant biodiesel diesel fuels; and updates that phase out avoided methane crediting associated with the use of biomethane as a combustion fuel but extend the use of biomethane for renewable hydrogen.

Under California law, the State’s Office of Administrative Law must review rulemakings proposed by state agencies to ensure compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, a state law that governs the rulemaking process. One component of that law deals with clarity, requiring regulations to be easily understood the people directly affected by them.

CARB submitted its final regulatory package on the approved LCFS amendments to OAL on Jan. 3. OAL on Feb. 18 notified CARB of its intention to disapprove the LCFS amendments citing “clarity” issues.

CARB on Feb. 25 received a Decision of Disapproval of Regulatory Action from OAL, which details the reasons for the disapproval. That document indicates that OAL has identified 26 proposed regulatory provisions where additional modifications may be necessary to ensure the regulatory provisions can be “easily understood by those persons directly affected by them.”

Under state law, CARB had 120 days to rewrite and resubmit the amendments to OAL.

According to a statement issued by CARB on June 27, OAL has now approved the LCFS regulations, allowing the amendments to take effect on July 1.

“Implementing the July 1 effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph. “But often lost in the noise around this program are our primary reasons for approving it: better health for Californians, our economy and the environment, as well as achieving required state and federal air quality standards.”

Fuel security risk: 80 per cent of Australia’s liquid fuel is imported, costing $50.7 billion in 2023, which the report said exposes the nation to supply chain shocks.
Policy potential: By introducing targeted policies, such as mandates, national procurement programs and low carbon fuel certification, Australia can provide the demand certainty and price signals needed to scale a local clean fuel industry.
To close the gap between potential and reality, the report outlines an actionable framework to help scale Australia’s LCLF industry.
“Clean fuel plants could revitalise manufacturing hubs and create skilled careers in some areas hit hardest by the decline of fossil fuels,” he said.","A domestic low carbon liquid fuel (LCLF) industry could contribute up to $36 billion to the economy and reduce emissions by 230Mt by 2050 – but only if it acts promptly, according to a new report published by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).

The report, Refined Ambitions: Exploring Australia’s Low Carbon Liquid Fuel Potential, found that LCLFs are crucial to Australia’s net-zero future, particularly for sectors such as aviation, mining, heavy freight and defence, where electrification is challenging.

It was commissioned by the CEFC and developed by Deloitte, in consultation with industry participants, investors, researchers and government stakeholders.

CEFC CEO, Ian Learmonth, said LCLFs are a present-day necessity for sectors that can’t electrify.

“If we get the settings right, Australia can lead in clean fuels innovation and production – not just supply the feedstocks.”

Learmonth said Australia has all the ingredients to be a clean fuel superpower – abundant feedstocks, world-class research, and growing demand.

“Policy accelerators, including mandates, certification schemes and offsets, are key components to assist the industry reach scale. The first movers will reap the rewards of this global market.”

The report’s key findings include:

$36 billion market opportunity by 2050: A domestic LCLF sector could contribute significantly to Australia’s economic growth and clean energy exports.

230Mt CO₂-e savings: Cumulative abatement over the next 25 years, equivalent to nearly half of Australia’s annual emissions.

Fuel security risk: 80 per cent of Australia’s liquid fuel is imported, costing $50.7 billion in 2023, which the report said exposes the nation to supply chain shocks.

Untapped potential: Australia exports $3.9 billion in LCLF feedstocks such as canola and tallow, but lacks local refining capacity to realise full value, according to the report.

Persistent demand: Even with rapid electrification, large quantities of liquid fuel could still be needed by 2050.

The report said that without domestic LCLF production, Australia remains vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions and misses a significant economic opportunity, particularly for regional areas.

It points to earlier CSIRO modelling that indicates that Australian feedstock could produce billions of litres of LCLFs annually by 2050, utilising existing land and practices without impacting food production.

The CEFC said its report aligns with the Federal Government’s Future Made in Australia agenda, showing how clean fuel production can bolster sovereign capability, create regional jobs and meet climate targets.

CEFC Executive Director, Rupert Maloney, said, “We export the raw materials but miss the opportunity to build the industry here at home. This is about regional development, national resilience, and emissions reduction, all at once.”

Despite the growing momentum and a pipeline of more than two billion litres in proposed projects, the report found that Australia’s LCLF industry faces significant structural, financial, and regulatory challenges.

It found that the cost of production remains higher than that of conventional fuels, while the lack of national mandates has limited investor confidence and demand certainty.

Additionally, the report found that emerging fuel technologies require further R&D and de-risking before they can be commercially deployed at scale. The report identified key hurdles:

Cost gap: LCLFs remain more expensive than fossil fuels without policy support.

Policy potential: By introducing targeted policies, such as mandates, national procurement programs and low carbon fuel certification, Australia can provide the demand certainty and price signals needed to scale a local clean fuel industry.

Investment risk: Next generation fuel technologies need R&D support and commercial de-risking.

To close the gap between potential and reality, the report outlines an actionable framework to help scale Australia’s LCLF industry.

The roadmap focuses on enabling market demand, lowering investment risk, supporting innovation, and coordinating the value chain, drawing on proven models from clean energy and international biofuel markets.

With the correct settings in place, the CEFC said that Australia can unlock a globally competitive and sovereign clean fuels sector. To take advantage of this opportunity, the report details seven key steps:

Improve market access – e.g., trade relationships

De-risk investments – e.g., concessional finance to de-risk private capital

Reduce transaction challenges – e.g., standardised contract terms

Consider credible demand signals – e.g., sustainable aviation fuel and freight fuel blending mandates

More transparent data on demand, supply and feedstocks

Leverage innovation to reduce costs and support for advanced fuel technologies – e.g., hydrogen-based e-fuels

Better coordination and alignment across the value chain – e.g., from feedstock supplier to fuel producer to end user

Maloney said with the right market signals and collaboration, Australia can build a globally competitive clean fuels industry and lead the region in climate-era innovation.

“Clean fuel plants could revitalise manufacturing hubs and create skilled careers in some areas hit hardest by the decline of fossil fuels,” he said. “But we need investment commitments this decade to avoid missing the window.”",https://www.energymagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AdobeStock_1551469663-Large.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 21:02:42.928038

Among the advocacy groups quick to praise the bill were Airports Council International -- North America, Airlines for America and the Modern Skies Coalition -- a group of 50-plus stakeholders that formed for the purpose of supporting an ATC overhaul.
The largest ATC components in the budget bill are $4.75 billion for ATC telecommunications infrastructure and $3 billion for radar systems replacement.
Aviation stakeholders have been calling for faster and more effective action in upgrading the ATC system for decades as the multibillion-dollar NextGen program that began in 2007 under-delivered and was implemented haltingly.
Farmers got an additional boost, receiving higher tax credits for the production of sustainable aviation fuel from corn ethanol and soybean oil.","Aviation industry stakeholders are praising the budget and policy bill signed by President Trump on July 4, primarily due to the $12.5 billion it provides for an overhaul of air traffic control (ATC) systems.

However, those same stakeholders are already noting that substantially more funding will be needed in the coming years to complete the ambitious ATC transformation, especially within the four-year timeline that Transportation Department Secretary Sean Duffy has laid out.

Among the advocacy groups quick to praise the bill were Airports Council International -- North America, Airlines for America and the Modern Skies Coalition -- a group of 50-plus stakeholders that formed for the purpose of supporting an ATC overhaul.

""This is a meaningful first step toward replacing outdated technology and aging facilities with the tools needed to keep our skies safe and efficient for decades to come,"" the Modern Skies Coalition said.

The group, which has estimated that completing the ATC overhaul will cost at least $31 billion, also said that it ""remains committed to working with lawmakers, regulators and industry partners to ensure that the system is fully staffed and that this investment translates into real progress, guaranteeing the United States will continue to have the safest aviation system in the world.""

The largest ATC components in the budget bill are $4.75 billion for ATC telecommunications infrastructure and $3 billion for radar systems replacement. Another $1.9 billion would go toward constructing a new air route traffic control center to handle midflight air traffic, above 20,000 feet.

Airlines for America CEO Nick Calio was effusive in his praise of the White House.

""Few people have had the gumption to take on the vast undertaking of modernizing our nation's complex ATC system, but President Trump and Secretary Duffy addressed the dire need quickly and are acting with urgency,"" Calio said.

But he, too, stressed that more money will be needed.

""We look forward to working with the administration as we continue to advocate for additional funding for staffing and technology to make President Trump's vision of a new golden age of air travel a reality.""

Aviation stakeholders have been calling for faster and more effective action in upgrading the ATC system for decades as the multibillion-dollar NextGen program that began in 2007 under-delivered and was implemented haltingly. But their calls gained more traction and vocal support from Trump and Duffy following the January collision of an Army helicopter with an American Airlines regional jet near Washington D.C. ATC failures this spring that led to ATC outages and flight delays at Newark Airport were also a rallying cry.

The budget bill also won praise from airports for the more than $6.1 billion it includes for hiring and for bonuses for Customs and Border Protection personnel.

""Funding 5,000 additional CBP officers will improve the processing experience for passengers and cargo moving through our airports, seaports, and land ports,"" Airports Council International -- North America said.

The bill also has other impacts on aviation. Notably, it extends by two years, until 2029, a tax credit for of up to $1.75 for producers of sustainable aviation fuel.

The credit survived despite the Trump administration's hostility to climate-change initiatives, due in large part to support from farmers.

Once complete, the infrastructure will help meet future e-fuel demand from Australia – a market which Chief Executive Officer Gunnar Holen expects to be large.
“At the same time, they are a clean and carbon-neutral fuel, with proven efficacy in both rail and aviation.” How are e-fuels developed?
“In rail, particulates, like soot, can be more damaging for the environment than carbon dioxide, so this is a key benefit,” Holen said.

The plant, due to be built in 2030, is one of several Nordic Electrofuel is developing in the region, with a similar facility in Oman also in the works.

Once complete, the infrastructure will help meet future e-fuel demand from Australia – a market which Chief Executive Officer Gunnar Holen expects to be large.

“E-fuels are great for any country looking to decarbonise their transport networks,” he said.

“Unlike electric and hydrogen-powered trains, which cost millions, e-fuels can be used with existing diesel locomotives and don’t require new infrastructure.

“At the same time, they are a clean and carbon-neutral fuel, with proven efficacy in both rail and aviation.”

How are e-fuels developed?

E-fuels are synthetic fuels based on renewable energy.

“You start with traditional hydrogen production, then mix with captured carbon dioxide to create a gas,” Holen said.

“You then undertake Fischer-Tropsch and come out with fuels, which can be optimised for their various end uses. For example, e-kerosene for aviation.

“We also derive valuable byproduct from the oxygen, which we can sell for industrial purposes.”

While the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process can be carbon-intensive, it has the potential to be carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative, depending on the source of its feedstock and energy inputs.

The carbon intensity is influenced by the source of the carbon and hydrogen used in the process.

The finished product, the e-fuel, is also carbon neutral and void of particulates.

“In rail, particulates, like soot, can be more damaging for the environment than carbon dioxide, so this is a key benefit,” Holen said.

Advantages

As well as being cheaper, e-fuels offer various advantages over clean transport alternatives.

While hydrogen trains are an attractive prospect to operators with larger budgets, Holen warns they are challenging to distribute and carry unique safety risks.

“There is a risk of explosion and, because of that, public caution around them,” he said.

“They also lack the necessary infrastructure. Back in the day, pure hydrogen-powered vehicles were promising in Norway. But the infrastructure hasn’t developed at all, and we only have a handful of filling stations.”

Electrification of the rail network is an equally popular clean transport option, but one which requires a supportive grid.

“If you have the time and the budget, great. Because there will be no emissions from an electrified train network. But for many, quicker, cheaper and more viable solutions are needed.”

Global developments

For these reasons, e-fuels have already become popular in Europe, with Germany representing its largest market, and Finland and Sweden set to become close contenders.

Holen said that as more plants open, e-fuels will become more cost-efficient and widespread around the world.

“We are currently developing several new plants here in Norway, including one we are looking to build equity for, in Herøya , 160 km South of Oslo. We also have plans to make a large fuel plant there.

“We are also extensively engaged in the middle East, working with the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu in Saudi, as well as Canada and Sweden.”

While Nordic Electrofuels primarily deals with the European market, Holen believes APAC demand could soon catch up.

“In Europe, e-fuels are primarily used for fuel in aviation, given EU mandates around SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] and ESAF. It’s a strong market for us.

“But with our upcoming developments in Saudi and Oman, we will be able to cater more readily to the likes of Australia.”

Further insight

Sharing more on his expansion plans and weighing up the pros and cons of e-fuels in rail, Gunnar Holen will present at the upcoming Rail Decarbonisation and Resilience Conference, hosted by Informa Connect.

This year’s event will be held on July 22-23, 2025 at the Swissotel Sydney.

Key topics will include climate-adaptive design, asset resilience, emergency response, and cyber resilience, alongside solutions in clean traction power, alternate fuels, and energy-efficient operations.",https://www.railexpress.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gunnar-Holen-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:12:16.742426
