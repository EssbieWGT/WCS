They reported stronger earnings and are shifting their strategy to buy more carbon credits. The move comes as the company, the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the region, boosts coal production and grows its renewable energy portfolio.

Investors, regulators, and climate observers are watching closely to see how Sasol balances its reliance on fossil fuels with its stated commitment to reaching net-zero emissions.

Earnings Power: Fueling a Dual Strategy

In its latest earnings report, Sasol posted a year-on-year improvement supported by stable product prices and efficiency gains. The company’s operating profit rose due to stronger chemical sales.

However, this was partly offset by higher costs in its coal division. Earnings were strong, giving Sasol the money to invest in fossil fuels and low-carbon projects.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, the company earned 10.60 rand per share. This is a turnaround from a loss of 69.94 rand per share. Asset write-downs fell sharply to 20.7 billion rand, down from 74.9 billion rand last year.

Sasol gained from a 4.3 billion rand settlement with Transnet over oil transport fees. Capital expenditure dropped 16% to 25.4 billion rand. This helped improve the company’s financial profile.

Management highlighted that a resilient balance sheet is critical as the company continues its transition journey.

Sasol has steady cash flows. This helps support its short-term coal operations. It also funds longer-term projects like renewable energy growth and carbon reduction efforts.

Sasol’s renewed profit helped lift investor sentiment. Following the earnings, the company’s shares climbed 7% in pre-market trading. Its stock on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: SOL) surged by 44% over the last quarter.

Analysts predict that earnings per share will increase by 20% year-on-year. This shows rising confidence in the company’s ability to balance profit and sustainability.

Rising Carbon Credit Purchases: Flexibility or Delay?

One of the biggest headlines is Sasol’s decision to boost its purchase of carbon credits.

In the fiscal year that ended in June 2025, Sasol’s carbon credit purchases increased to R723 million, a 25% increase year-on-year.

This amount was nearly triple the value of the credits it bought in 2023.

Since 2019, Sasol has acquired more than 11 million South African carbon credits, which has reduced its carbon tax liability by more than R650 million.

Most of these credits come from international renewable energy and reforestation projects, while some are linked to African-based carbon offset programs. Sasol plans to grow its carbon credit portfolio, showing its commitment to climate responsibility.

Some offset projects supported by Sasol include:

Wonderbag: In 2021, Sasol announced it would use carbon credits generated by the Wonderbag project, which provides non-electric heat-retention cookers to reduce household emissions.

Bethlehem Hydro: In 2020, Sasol purchased over 100,000 credits from Bethlehem Hydro, a 7MW hydropower plant that was the first Independent Power Producer in South Africa.

Nitrous oxide abatement: As far back as 2007, Sasol received credits for a nitrous oxide abatement project at its nitric acid plants in Sasolburg and Secunda.

However, it recognizes that cutting emissions from its own operations is tough in the near term. The company plans to steadily increase reliance, but acknowledges that credits are a temporary solution.

The use of credits has generated debate. Supporters say it gives companies flexibility to meet interim targets while low-carbon technologies scale.

Critics argue it can delay direct emissions cuts. Sasol’s growing use of offsets shows the urgent climate pressures and the challenges of moving away from coal.

RELATED: How Kinetic Coalition Leverages Energy Transition Credits to Close Coal Plants Early

Coal’s Grip: South Africa’s Energy Dilemma

Sasol is one of South Africa’s top coal users. It relies on coal for power and to make synthetic fuels and chemicals. Its Secunda plant is one of the single largest point sources of carbon dioxide globally, emitting more than 56 million tons of CO₂ equivalent each year.

The world’s biggest producer of fuels and chemicals from coal emits around 63 million tons of CO₂ equivalent each year. This makes it one of Africa’s largest industrial polluters.

The company believes coal is still essential for South Africa’s energy and industry right now. This is especially true due to the country’s electricity shortages and its dependence on Eskom, the state utility. Sasol knows that relying on this can lead to risks such as regulatory pressure, investor scrutiny, and possible costs from future carbon pricing.

Counting Carbon: Sasol’s Net-Zero Targets and Progress

Despite its coal footprint, Sasol has stepped up efforts to diversify its energy mix. The company is putting money into renewable energy projects. This includes solar and wind farms. These efforts will help provide cleaner electricity for its operations.

Moreover, partnerships with independent power producers are helping Sasol shift portions of its energy use away from coal-generated power.

In addition, Sasol is advancing work in green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Its Fischer-Tropsch technology, long used for coal-to-liquids production, is being adapted for cleaner feedstocks, such as natural gas and green hydrogen. The company announced pilot projects to produce low-carbon chemicals for local and global markets.

Sasol aims to cut its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% by 2030. This goal uses a 2017 baseline, which is about 72 million tons of CO₂e. Progress: current emissions are down about 13% from baseline.

It aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. However, it admits that success relies on policy support, technological progress, and available funding.

In summary, Sasol’s key emission reduction initiatives are:

Green hydrogen projects – Developing hydrogen production in South Africa through partnerships to support cleaner fuels and power.

Renewable energy procurement – Securing up to 1,200 MW of renewable electricity (wind and solar) to replace coal-based power at operations.

Energy efficiency improvements – Implementing process optimization and equipment upgrades to reduce energy use across its facilities.

Coal-to-gas transition – Shifting part of its feedstock mix from coal toward natural gas, which has a lower carbon footprint.

Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) – Exploring technologies to capture CO₂ from operations for use in chemicals or fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development – Advancing projects to produce low-carbon jet fuel from sustainable feedstocks.

Offsets and carbon credits – Expanding purchases of carbon credits to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions.

Markets in Motion: Offsets, Renewables, and Risks

Sasol’s strategy reflects broader challenges facing energy and industrial companies worldwide. Carbon credits are gaining popularity. The voluntary carbon market was worth over $2 billion in 2024. It’s expected to grow to nearly $50 billion by 2030, under the best-case scenario.

However, the credibility of offsets is under scrutiny, and investors are demanding more transparency on how credits are used.

At the same time, global coal demand remains strong, particularly in emerging markets. South Africa’s energy system still relies heavily on coal, which generates about 80% of the country’s electricity. This makes decarbonization complex, as companies like Sasol must balance energy security with climate commitments.

Meanwhile, renewable energy costs continue to fall. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of new power generation in most regions. For Sasol, scaling renewables not only helps reduce emissions but also lowers long-term energy costs.

Balancing Growth, Risk, and Climate Goals

Sasol’s higher earnings give it the financial strength to follow its dual-track strategy. This means it can keep expanding coal operations and invest in low-carbon solutions. The company’s growing purchase of carbon credits shows its urgent need to meet climate goals. It also reflects the challenge of cutting emissions from coal-heavy operations.

Sasol’s future will depend on whether it can scale up renewable energy, develop viable low-carbon technologies, and manage the risks tied to its coal reliance. Its net-zero commitment remains a long-term goal. Yet, the company’s latest moves suggest it is trying to walk a fine line between financial performance and climate responsibility.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2423893263.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 09:56:46.804333

Those firms, like most in the field, are pure electric. But Canadian start-up Horizon is taking a different approach, which it hopes could secure a sizeable chunk of the market.

“We saw a decent gap in the marketplace opening up for a longer-range, all-weather, faster machine that could carry more and had several other layers of safety and redundancy on board,” said CEO and co-founder Brandon Robinson to Professional Engineering. “We thought it was smart to have a power source on board that is 30 to 40 times as dense as even the best aerospace-grade batteries.”

For the Cavorite X7, that power source will be jet fuel or potentially sustainable aviation fuel in future. With 800km (500 miles) forecast range and a maximum speed of 450km/h (280mph), the six-passenger, one-pilot aircraft could fly much further than pure electric eVTOLs and much faster than helicopters.

The hybrid approach is not the only unusual feature of the X7 – unlike other flying taxis it has fixed wings, lined with battery-powered ducted fans. These will be uncovered for electrically powered ascent and descent before the aircraft switches to a fossil-fuelled rear propeller for horizontal flight, and the ducted fans are covered by sliding panels.

Stressing a “very operational and engineering-focused background”, Robinson said the company was wary of the challenges and strict manufacturing tolerances involved with tilt rotors, tilt wing mechanisms and open rotors.

“We wanted the simplest possible way to transition from hover to forward flight,” he said. The approach avoids significant aerodynamics challenges from variable pitch articulating mechanisms, he added, with a half-scale prototype already demonstrating successful transitions between hovering and horizontal flight.

The X7’s performance advantages could draw attention in the next eVTOL hype cycle – but it remains to be seen if they will be significant enough for customers to overlook ongoing fossil fuel consumption.",,N,,2025-08-26 09:56:56.812750

About Universal Fuel Technologies","LOS ALTOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As the global aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions while demand for air travel continues to grow, Universal Fuel Technologies’ (Unifuel) Ethanol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced via the company’s Flexiforming technology has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse, which supports the technical evaluation of new aviation fuels, for qualification. This acceptance positions Unifuel among an exclusive group of companies advancing toward ASTM qualification, the essential gateway for new fuels to enter commercial aviation markets.

""The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse is an important validation of our Flexiforming technology and significantly derisks our road to approval for commercial use,"" said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. ""This advancement indicates that our SAF can meet the toughest performance standards without sacrificing scalability or quality, and has technical credibility in the eyes of industry experts.""

The ASTM D4054 evaluation process is the aviation industry’s framework for ensuring that new fuels can safely power aircraft engines. It includes multiple tiers of testing, data collection, and technical review by experts from leading aerospace companies. Acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse requires demonstrating, by independent testing, that a fuel is not only technically credible and can be produced at a meaningful scale, but also that it has met strict quality and safety criteria.

""We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,"" said Dr. Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director. ""This marks a significant milestone for Universal Fuel Technologies towards their goal of commercial acceptance.”

The acceptance follows a successful five-month pilot project where the company produced nearly 100 liters of sample material for four different SAF pathways under stable process conditions. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol, and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), into SAF. The samples then underwent comprehensive testing by Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, the world-leading authority on SAF research.

""The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse confirms that Flexiforming can produce high-quality synthetic aviation turbine fuel with a clear route to ASTM qualification,"" said Denis Pchelintsev, Co-Founder of Universal Fuel Technologies. ""We're positioned to support the aviation industry's urgent need for cost-effective synthetic aviation turbine fuel that doesn't compromise on performance or safety.""

Following Unifuel’s D4054 Clearinghouse acceptance, the company will proceed with producing larger fuel samples for detailed Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing required for ASTM qualification. The initial qualification could come as soon as the end of 2026 as a blend component with fossil jet. From there, further testing is planned, with the goal of leading to a 100% drop-in fully synthetic jet fuel in the future.

Unifuel's advancement through the qualification process is supported by Flexiforming's unique capabilities, which upgrade various renewable feedstocks—including ethanol, methanol, renewable naphthas, and liquefied petroleum gas—into high-quality SAF. In ethanol-to-jet applications, Flexiforming uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other processes, cutting production costs by up to 50%. The technology is also valuable as a complementary process, upgrading low-value naphtha byproduct from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, creating new revenue opportunities for renewable fuel producers.

This accomplishment is rare, especially in China, where manufacturing is a central component of the economy. As of now, only approximately 6,000 factories in the country have received this distinction, with a mere 1,300 awarded in 2025.

This not only highlights Avery Dennison's commitment to sustainability but also sets a precedent for procurement practices in reducing environmental impact within the industry.

Enhancements in sustainable operations

The “green factory” accreditation attests to Avery Dennison’s progressive improvements in its operational processes.

Observers may first notice advanced automated logistics and precise coating and die-cutting lines, but the true essence of this recognition lies in foundational enhancements such as energy efficiency and closed-loop systems for wastewater and emissions management.

Moreover, the company has implemented systematic strategies for material reuse, serving as “proof that sustainability and industrial performance can go hand in hand,” according to Mike Colarossi, Head of Enterprise Sustainability at Avery Dennison.

Such advancements represent a model for procurement leaders aiming to integrate sustainability alongside performance.

Sustainability targets and procurement implications

The Guangzhou feat is a part of Avery Dennison's broader pursuit of sustainability objectives, aligning with seven of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

These ambitious targets include ensuring all core product categories meet the ‘Sustainable ADvantage standard’, with Avery Dennison’s Solutions Group and Materials Group already significantly compliant by 2024.

The goals also stress a 70% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 levels and a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions against 2018 levels.

Concretely, the company has already decreased Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 54%, with long-term plans for net-zero emissions by 2050.

For procurement professionals, this highlights the importance of sustainable supply chain management and emission reduction strategies as integral procurement parameters.

Innovative RFID label

Avery Dennison has introduced a ground-breaking radio-frequency identification (RFID) label, which has received the APR Design for Recyclability recognition.

This accolade underscores the compatibility of the RFID technology with North America’s PET recycling stream.

At the heart of this transformation lies a technology poised to redefine propulsion: hydrogen-electric fuel cells. With the aircraft fuel cell market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.07% from 2025 to 2030 (reaching $3.3 billion by 2030), the sector is attracting strategic capital from investors seeking to capitalize on decarbonization. While the headline CAGR may fall short of the oft-cited 28.4% figure, the underlying drivers—hydrogen innovation, regulatory tailwinds, and eVTOL demand—suggest a far more dynamic opportunity, particularly in the fastest-growing subsegments.

The Triple Catalyst: Innovation, Regulation, and Urban Mobility

The propulsion fuel cell market is being propelled by three interlocking forces:

Hydrogen-Electric Innovation:

Hydrogen fuel cells offer a gravimetric energy density of ~1,500 Wh/kg, far outpacing lithium-ion batteries (300–400 Wh/kg). This makes them ideal for eVTOLs and regional aircraft, where range and payload capacity are critical. Breakthroughs in low-temperature proton exchange membrane (LTPEM) and high-temperature PEM (HTPEM) technologies are reducing costs and improving efficiency. For instance, ZeroAvia's ZA600 propulsion system, now in FAA certification, promises 40% lower operating costs than turbine engines.

Regulatory Tailwinds:

The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates 2% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, scaling to 63% by 2050. While SAF is a near-term solution, hydrogen-electric systems are the long-term answer. The FAA and EASA are fast-tracking certification pathways, with EASA's 2030 target for electric VTOL certification and the FAA's 2024 Hydrogen-Fueled Aircraft Safety Roadmap. These frameworks reduce uncertainty for investors, enabling firms to scale R&D with confidence.

eVTOL and Urban Mobility Demand:

The eVTOL market is forecasted to grow at 54.9% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, with hydrogen-electric propulsion expected to dominate the fastest-growing segment (66% CAGR). Urban air mobility (UAM) and cargo eVTOLs require zero-emission, long-range solutions—hydrogen's refueling speed and energy density make it the clear winner. Companies like Airbus and H2MOF are pioneering hydrogen storage systems that could enable 24–36 hour endurance for drones and helicopters.

Strategic Capital Allocation: Prioritizing R&D-Backed Firms

Investors should focus on firms with robust R&D pipelines and partnerships with aerospace giants. Three stand out:

ZeroAvia (ZAVIY):

The UK-based firm has secured provisional type certification for its 600 kW hydrogen-electric engine and is in conditional talks with major airlines. Its ZA2000 project for larger aircraft, using liquid hydrogen, positions it as a leader in scaling propulsion systems.

Airbus (AIR.PA):

The aerospace giant is leveraging its scale to integrate hydrogen into its A320neo and A350 XWB variants. Its NEWBORN project (a €44.8M EU initiative) aims to develop scalable fuel cell systems for regional and long-haul aircraft. Airbus's 2030 target to launch a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft underscores its commitment.

Plug Power (PLUG):

While best known for industrial hydrogen solutions, Plug's collaboration with eVTOL startups and its modular fuel cell stacks position it to supply propulsion systems for urban mobility. Its recent partnership with Gloyer-Taylor Laboratories to develop lightweight LH2 tanks could be a game-changer.

The Investment Case: Balancing Risk and Reward

The propulsion fuel cell market is still nascent, with challenges including hydrogen infrastructure gaps and supply chain bottlenecks. However, the alignment of regulatory, technological, and market forces creates a compelling risk-reward profile. For instance, H2MOF's metal-organic framework (MOF) storage technology could reduce hydrogen delivery costs by 50–80%, addressing a key barrier to adoption.

Investors should adopt a phased approach:

- Short-term (2025–2027): Allocate capital to firms with FAA/EASA certification milestones (e.g., ZeroAvia).

- Mid-term (2028–2030): Target companies scaling hydrogen storage and infrastructure (e.g., Plug Power).

- Long-term (2030+): Position in firms developing hybrid systems and long-haul hydrogen aircraft (e.g., Airbus).

Conclusion: A Net-Zero Imperative

The transition to hydrogen-electric propulsion is not just an environmental imperative—it's a $40.7 billion market by 2030. For investors, the key is to back firms that combine technical innovation with regulatory agility. ZeroAvia, Airbus, and Plug Power exemplify this, but the sector's breadth also includes niche players like H2MOF and PowerCell Group (which is developing 300 kW ITPEM stacks).

As the FAA and EASA finalize certification standards, the next 12–18 months will be pivotal. Those who act now—allocating capital to R&D-backed innovators—will be well-positioned to ride the hydrogen-electric wave shaping the future of flight.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-26 05:56:08.925139

This article focuses on some of the key points to note in respect of hydrogen developments from the following publications:

Hydrogen update to the market: July 2025

Consultation for Hydrogen blending into the GB gas transmission network

1. Hydrogen Update to the Market: July 2025

On 23rd July 2025, DESNZ published its Hydrogen Update to the Market policy document (the “Update”) which summarises key policy progress in the first six months of 2025 to deliver the low carbon hydrogen economy and also looks forward to upcoming hydrogen policy milestones and opportunities for the sector. This follows previous updates to the market (as separately detailed at: Hy time for hydrogen - key takeaways from the UK's hydrogen strategy; Hydrogen transport and storage: Update on proposed business models and UK Hydrogen Strategy : UK hydrogen sector updates: hydrogen production - kicking off the next allocation round) and sets out the Government’s latest position. As part of this, the government intends to publish an updated UK Hydrogen Strategy in Autumn 2025 setting out its vision, objectives and approach to delivering hydrogen projects over the next decade.

Hydrogen Production

Hydrogen Production Business Model

The Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (‘HAR’) are the main mechanism for supporting low-carbon hydrogen production, with HAR1 completed, HAR2 shortlist announced (comprising 27 projects), and HAR3 and HAR4 planned for 2026 and 2028, respectively. Details of the shortlisted HAR2 projects are available here.

The Government is removing Climate Change Levy costs from electricity used in electrolysis to lower production costs for low carbon hydrogen. Consultation responses on the appropriate legislative approach to take in respect of the removal are being considered by the Government and a Government response will be provided in due course.

The Government is also due to respond later this year on its views for having the Gas Shipper Obligation (“GSO”) as the long-term funding mechanism for initial hydrogen production projects funded through the HPBM. This was subject to earlier consultation the details of which can be found here.

Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (“LCHS”)

The Hydrogen Production Business Model incentivises investment in low-carbon hydrogen, with projects required to meet the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (i.e a GHG emissions intensity of 20g CO2e/MJLHV of produced hydrogen or less) and subject to strict methodology for calculating these emissions.

Updates to the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard are expected in 2025 and the Government is exploring updates to the low carbon certification scheme as well as the LCHA in 2025. Future versions may consider updates in respect of transport and storage emissions, international alignment and the introduction of production pathways.

In summary, DESNZ’s key future milestones in respect of hydrogen production and the HAR process are as follows:

publish the next version of the LCHS this year;

provide an update on the low carbon hydrogen certification scheme this year.

seek feedback on the proposed design and delivery of HAR3 through a market engagement exercise, with the aim of publishing later this year;

publish a review of the Hydrogen Allocation Rounds beyond HAR4 later this year;

complete HAR2 in early 2026;

launch HAR3 in 2026;

launch HAR4 in 2028;

Hydrogen Transport and Storage Networks:

Hydrogen Transport and Storage Business Models

The Government is also developing business models for hydrogen transport and storage, based on a Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model, alongside a government subsidy mechanism. It is aiming to launch the first allocation rounds in 2026. With respect to hydrogen storage, DESNZ’s minded to business model remains as a revenue cap and floor mechanism to be awarded via a subsidy competition. Strategic planning for hydrogen infrastructure is being integrated with the wider energy system, with the National Energy System Operator taking a leading role from 2026.

Further, the Government is assessing hydrogen’s role in heating and consulting on its potential contribution to heat decarbonisation, and ongoing consultations are evaluating the feasibility and benefits of blending hydrogen into existing gas networks.

The Update reiterated Government’s commitment of over £500 million, as set out in the Spending Review 2025, for the development of the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, where it expects the first network will be operational from 2031.

Uses of Hydrogen

Hydrogen to Power Business Model

Hydrogen is positioned as a key technology for low-carbon, dispatchable power generation and long-duration energy storage, with a new Hydrogen to Power Business Model launching in 2026. The Dispatchable Power Agreement mechanism that was used on CCUS projects has been confirmed as the chosen business model for this. Later this year, the Government is launching a market engagement exercise which will provide additional information on the business model. This will include the Government’s minded to positions on the eligibility and assessment criteria and suggested next steps for distributing support via the business model.

Hydrogen in Transport

In terms of transport, hydrogen is expected to play a complementary role to electrification, especially in heavy goods vehicles, maritime, aviation, and off-road machinery. Several demonstration projects and regulatory changes are underway to support hydrogen adoption in these sectors.

Off-road machinery: A statutory instrument allowing hydrogen powered off-road machinery and agricultural vehicles on the road came into force on 29 April 2025. Government is expected to publish an off-road machinery decarbonisation strategy following the Non-road mobile machinery: decarbonisation options call for evidence, however the timeframe for delivery of the strategy is unclear.

Maritime: The Maritime Decarbonisation Strategy, which amongst other things, sets out a commitment to regulate greenhouse gas emission intensity of maritime fuels and energy sources, was published in April 2025. Additionally, the government expects to introduce domestic fuel regulations in respect of zero and near-zero greenhouse gas emission fuels, further to a consultation in 2026.

Aviation: The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Mandate – the key policy encouraging the supply of sustainable aviation fuels to decarbonise aviation fuel - was launched in January 2025. Provided it meets eligibility criteria, hydrogen is eligible for support under the Mandate. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which introduces the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Revenue Certainty Mechanism, is expected to become law by the end of 2026. The third competition window for the Advanced Fuels Fund closed at the end of March this year, with the winners announced on 22nd July 2025. The competition winners can be viewed here.

Regulatory Framework

To be able to support the first small-scale hydrogen pipeline projects and to be flexible enough to support the hydrogen economy as it matures, a consultation on the proposed economic framework for 100% hydrogen pipelines has been launched. Please see here for further commentary on this.

2. Consultation on Hydrogen Blending into the GB Gas Transmission Network

Hydrogen Blending and the Purpose of the Consultation

The Government is again consulting on hydrogen blending (i.e blending low carbon hydrogen with other gases into the existing gas network). The aim is to assess the case for hydrogen blending including the required commercial, market, technical, safety, and billing arrangements required to accommodate such blending. Please see here for the consultation.

A previous consultation in 2023 assessed the strategic and economic value of blending up to 20% hydrogen by volume into the existing GB gas distribution networks, as well as avenues for implementing blending (the “2023 Consultation”). Following this consultation, previous government published their strategic policy decision in support of blending up to 20% hydrogen by volume into the GB gas distribution networks in specific circumstances.

The Consultation also seeks to understand the impact on existing end users directly connected to the transmission network and developments across Europe in respect of the EU Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package. It is expected that, if a positive future decision enabling transmission-level hydrogen blending is made, the earliest that blending at a commercial scale could be made would not be until 2028.

To support the Consultation, safety and feasibility tests and demonstrations of different levels of blending (up to 5%, 10%, and 20%) within the GB gas transmission network have been carried out by National Gas Transmission (NGT). DESNZ’s minded to position is to further consider whether blending of up to 2% hydrogen by volume should be supported and enabled.

Strategic role of hydrogen blending

At distribution level, blending could function as an offtaker of last resort/minority offtaker and could mitigate both the risks of hydrogen producers not being able to sell sufficient volumes of hydrogen and cross-chain volume risks in respect of hydrogen transport and storage (T&S) infrastructure development. Where large-scale hydrogen T&S infrastructure is not available, blending could assist electrolytic hydrogen producers, particularly those producers located behind electricity network constraints, with supporting the wider electricity system and allowing blending to play a role as strategic enabler.

For Carbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS)-enabled and other non-electrolytic hydrogen projects, their strategic value could lie in producing hydrogen at scale, such as industrial clusters. DESNZ’s position is that CCUS-enabled and other non-electrolytic who intend to use blending as a majority offtaker from the outset will not be able to benefit from hydrogen production revenue support.

At transmission level, the strategic roles for blending could be similar to those identified at distribution level, for example, offtaker of last resort and strategic enabler, as noted above.

EU Interactions

The impact of transmission-level hydrogen blending on cross-border trade with the EU via interconnectors requires separate consideration. The EU Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package (comprising Directive (EU) 2024/1788 and Regulation (EU) 2024/1789)(the “Package”), which does not apply to the UK, was adopted in May 2024. The Regulation became applicable on 5 February 2025 and Member States are required to transpose the provisions of the Directive into national legislation by 5 August 2026. Whilst the Package sets the basis for enabling harmonisation of hydrogen blending across Member States to enable up to 2% hydrogen blends across EU gas transmission networks, it does not specifically require individual Member States to blend hydrogen into their own transmission networks. Government is undertaking engagement exercises with neighbouring Member States to better understand the impact of the Package in respect of hydrogen blending and risks concerning security of supply.

Hydrogen Deblending

Deblending hydrogen could assist NTS end users who are unable to, or are likely to have significant safety and technical issues, receive variable hydrogen blends. A limitation to hydrogen deblending is that it is considered to be a relatively unproven technology at large scale, particularly within distribution and transmission networks.

The Consultation sets out two possible future scenarios:

Deblending at UK gas interconnector entry points – government does not currently view this as a feasible option due to costs and technical challenges of large scale blending, however further engagement with neighbouring EU Member States and the Commission is to be expected.

Deblending at local end user level – further work is required to be undertaken by NGT to understand the feasibility of isolating blending gas within the NTS to protect sensitive end users, and what measures, if any, could assist with managing blend variability to manage those impacts to end users.

Implementation options

Government’s position is that transmission blending, if enabled, should be implemented using existing gas market arrangements where appropriate, including for example, gas billing arrangements.

Considerations in respect of the HPBM

Government envisages that, if enabled and if supported by government, the most appropriate mechanism for transmission blending would be through the HPBM. Blending is currently considered a ‘Non-Qualifying Offtaker’ under the LCHA. Designing and integrating subsidy support for both distribution and transmission blending within the HPBM, would require to be reflected in the LCHA. Further consideration will need to be given to those HAR1 projects that have already entered into a LCHA. Sales of hydrogen to RTIs is not currently permitted under the LCHA, government will need to consider how commercial arrangements for blending will work for example, the use of gas shippers (who would at present be considered an RTI) for purchasing hydrogen for blending. If blending is enabled by government, consideration will be made in respect of eligible offtaker’s for future HARs and CCUS allocation rounds of the HPBM.

Market and trading arrangements

DESNZ’s minded to position in respect of market and trading arrangements for transmission-led blending is analogous to the network-led hybrid approach that the 2023 Consultation considered. This would allow both the gas transmission system operator and gas shippers to purchase low carbon hydrogen and shippers can sell hydrogen produced for blending.

Low carbon hydrogen certificates

In respect of low carbon hydrogen certificates for transmission blending, government have confirmed that further to the 2023 Low Carbon Hydrogen Certification Scheme Government Response, they require further consideration of how certificates could work for blending.

Implications, next steps and conclusions

The Update sets out a clearer roadmap of the key milestones DESNZ are working towards and for DESNZ’s ongoing commitments to advancing the UK hydrogen industry. The forthcoming UK Hydrogen Strategy in Autumn will be welcomed by industry and is expected to provide even greater clarity and direction, reinforcing the UK’s position as a leader in the global hydrogen market.",https://cms-lawnow.com/var/dpcontent/storage/images/1/5/1/5/22295151-1-eng-GB/8789dad98b10-Hydrogen-renewable-energy-production-hydrogen-gas-for-clean-electricity-solar-and-windturbine-facility.-3d-rendering.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 05:56:12.833376

“Airlines can make decisions on their fueling later because we connect digitally from an airline’s systems to the fueling systems, so we can see, ‘I’ve made a change.
Mattos says i6 is now examining how its technology could be further applied to provide efficiencies in maintenance, too.
For instance, he points out that airlines use fueling in ground testing, and fuel records and aircraft technical records interact when pilots determine how much fuel they want for a flight.
Mattos says i6 is currently conducting a network trial with Aer Lingus and, as Delta’s international digital fueling partner, the company hopes to grow its work with the airline to additional locations such as the Caribbean.","An aviation industry software company focused on digitizing aircraft fueling operations is expanding its work with airlines to connect that data to electronic tech logs. The aim is to provide real-time visibility into ground operations and improve aircraft turnaround times.

Formed in 2015, i6 has built a digital platform that connects all parts of the fuel management cycle, allowing airlines to digitally track fuel inventory, manage contracts with fuel suppliers, enable communication between pilots and fueling teams, calculate optimal fuel amounts, and collect and analyze data about fueling operations.

“Fuel is a large proportion of every airline’s bottom line—something in the region of 35%—so everybody’s keen to know how much they’ve got and where it is,” i6 CEO Alex Mattos says. “What we’re trying to do is connect the refinery to the wingtip, all the way through the chain, to make sure everybody knows where it all is.”

Mattos says one of the key benefits of i6’s software is enabling paperless fueling operations, which provides real-time visibility that can help airlines make decisions about fuel supply, catch errors and connect systems to allow better agility. “Airlines can make decisions on their fueling later because we connect digitally from an airline’s systems to the fueling systems, so we can see, ‘I’ve made a change.

The weather’s bad, or there’s more cargo, or this is a holiday plane so everyone’s got all their luggage,’ and we can change our fuel loads much quicker,” he says.

Carriers such as British Airways, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic are already using i6 software to manage fueling operations digitally, and Mattos says the technology has helped to improve turnaround times, minimize fuel costs, reduce paperwork errors and provide greater visibility.

Mattos says i6 is now examining how its technology could be further applied to provide efficiencies in maintenance, too. “Fuel is part of maintenance records,” he says. For instance, he points out that airlines use fueling in ground testing, and fuel records and aircraft technical records interact when pilots determine how much fuel they want for a flight.

I6’s software already integrates with electronic flight bags to exchange data about flight schedules and fuel loads, and Mattos says carriers such as Virgin are now working with the company to integrate their engineering technical logs with the software so maintenance staff can pull up digital records about fuel, such as provider, amount, type, density, temperature and more.

He adds that the software’s digital footprint may also prove appealing as more airlines convert to sustainable aviation fuel, since it can track quality control, blending ratios and other crucial fueling factors.

I6 is also expanding its airline customers and its partnerships to more locations. Mattos says i6 is currently conducting a network trial with Aer Lingus and, as Delta’s international digital fueling partner, the company hopes to grow its work with the airline to additional locations such as the Caribbean. He also notes that as British Airways expands its presence in the U.S., the carrier is “very interested in how we can take what we have done at Heathrow and their European network and support them in the U.S. in the same way we work with a number of other airlines.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-08-26 09:57:31.297243

Used cooking oil collected from eateries at Changi Airport is powering some heavy vehicles, such as those used to remove debris from runways, as part of a renewable diesel trial, Changi Airport Group (CAG) said on Aug 19.

The seven vehicles have performed well since the trial at the airport started in May, said CAG.

The six-month trial is part of a push by the airport operator to find cleaner alternatives for its existing fleet of 60 vehicles deployed airside, where loading and unloading of aircraft, as well as take-offs and landings, take place.

The renewable diesel is being used to fuel heavy vehicles and specialised equipment that do not yet have viable electric variants.

CAG said electric variants are more readily available for light vehicles, such as forklifts and tractors.

Most heavy vehicles used in the aviation industry are still diesel-powered, such as airport runway sweepers.

These specialised vehicles are used to remove debris, including foreign objects, from runways and taxiways, and are crucial for maintaining runway safety.

Another example is runway rubber removal vehicles, which remove rubber deposits left by aircraft tyres, which can affect braking and safety.

The used cooking oil collected from Changi Airport eateries contributes to the feedstock – or raw material – to produce the renewable diesel used in the trial, CAG said.

The feedstock is converted into high-quality renewable diesel fuel that has a similar chemical composition to fossil diesel, it said.

This is done at a refinery in Tuas run by Neste Singapore, a renewable energy company.

Renewable diesel can be adopted as an easy replacement for fossil diesel as it can be used in existing diesel engines without modification.

Minimal adjustments are required for renewable diesel to use existing transportation, storage and distribution infrastructure.

The six-month trial will use approximately 14,000 litres of renewable diesel, said Mr Steven Bartholomeusz, Neste’s Asia-Pacific head of public and regulatory affairs.

CAG began its trial in May with a 50 per cent renewable diesel blend. This was upped to 100 per cent in August.

At 100 per cent renewable diesel, up to 90 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions will be produced over the fuel’s life cycle, when compared with fossil diesel, CAG said.

Renewable diesel can also be blended with fossil diesel in any proportion, helping companies to match the use of clean energy to their decarbonisation goals.

Mr Gerald Ng, CAG’s vice-president for regulatory affairs and sustainability, said the vehicles in the trial have performed well on the 50 per cent renewable diesel blend, and “without any impact to vehicle operations and efficiency”.

Renewable diesel trials have taken place at Changi Airport since 2024, when the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced a year-long trial of the fuel, also for heavy and specialised airside vehicles.

These trials are the result of the sustainable air hub blueprint launched in 2024, which aims to help reduce domestic aviation emissions by 20 per cent (from 2019 levels) by 2030 and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

Other initiatives from the blueprint include a passenger levy on flights departing from Singapore from 2026 to fund the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as well as increased deployment of solar panels at the airport.",https://www.britcham.org.sg/sites/default/files/2025-08/f92c1588acd29bcd3ed9e4f207590ba36430d104670b5e1681597f3f37b897a8.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 09:57:36.478506

This event is notable as it represents the first time Airbus in Canada has directly provided official sustainability documentation for SAF to a customer, setting a new precedent in Airbus’ operations.

The flight underscores Airbus’ ability to issue Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) directly to operators and supports the aviation industry’s broader commitment to decarbonisation. With a 50% SAF blend certified through the mass balance method, this ferry flight—operated by Air France’s 46th A220-300, named “VAISON-LA-ROMAINE”—resulted in a reduction of over 25 tonnes of lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of aviation decarbonisation. Combining both is a natural step, and Air France-KLM is proud to take part in this Airbus milestone with the delivery of one of our A220s. As one of the largest SAF purchasers globally, receiving SAF directly at delivery increases transparency and supports industry advancement,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM.

Since the announcement of SAF availability at Airbus’ Mirabel site—allowing its use in A220 production, test flights, and customer acceptance flights—Airbus has reinforced its commitment to incorporating SAF not only in internal operations but also in customer ferry flights across its global network of final assembly lines and delivery centers.

“In 2025 alone, we anticipate a reduction of around 400 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions at our Mirabel facility, thanks to the integration of 170,000 litres of neat SAF,” said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada. “This ferry flight, using PoS credits for 50% SAF, is a major milestone ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year. Globally, 78% of Airbus aircraft delivered in the first half of 2025 included SAF, reflecting our customers’ strong commitment to decarbonisation.”

All Airbus aircraft, including the A220, are currently certified to fly with up to 50% SAF, with a target of achieving 100% SAF compatibility by 2030. According to PoS issued under the CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme, approved by ICAO, the SAF supplied at Mirabel offers an 85% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to fossil-based jet fuel—a crucial development in achieving net-zero emissions in aviation by 2050.

The SAF used in Mirabel is managed through the mass balance approach, a chain-of-custody model that tracks the volume of certified material entering and exiting the system, minus any processing losses. The SAF is blended with Jet A-1 fuel following industry standards and is fully auditable.

Air France’s A220-300 aircraft, part of a firm order of 60, have been operating on medium-haul routes since October 2021.

This marked a significant step forward: Airbus in Canada directly issued official sustainability credentials for SAF to a customer for the first time.

This landmark flight not only confirms Airbus' capability to provide Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) directly to customers and operators but also supports the industry's commitment to decarbonisation. With PoS credits for a 50% SAF blend applied through the mass balance process, this ferry flight conducted by Air France's 46th A220-300 named “VAISON-LA-ROMAINE”, represented more than 25 tonnes reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels.

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game-changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability, Air France-KLM.

Since the announcement of the first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) delivery at Airbus site in Canada, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights, this achievement solidifies Airbus' commitment to using SAF for internal operations as well as customer ferry flights across all its commercial aircraft assembly sites and delivery centers worldwide.

""In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,"" said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada.""And we're pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year. On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.""

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030. According to the PoS under CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme approved by ICAO, the SAF received at Airbus in Mirabel is certified for 85% reduction in GHG emissions on its lifecycle compared to fossil fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the aerospace industry’s progress towards decarbonization by 2050.

SAF management in Mirabel is done using mass balance, a chain of custody model in which a company accounts for volumes of certified products by looking at the volumes entering the operation and the equivalent volume of products leaving the operations as a measurement, minus any processing losses. As such, the SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel (Jet A-1) as per established industry standards and auditable bookkeeping.

Air France’s first A220-300s, part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft, have been flying on its medium-haul network since October 2021. The A220 delivers up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft. For more information on the A220 Programme, visit our A220 dedicated page.

About sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

SAF is a blended drop in fuel, certified against aviation fuel technical standards. It is a blend of a synthetic component made from renewable feedstocks and conventional fossil fuel. This blend, up to 50%, has the same characteristics as aviation fuels and are certified as such (e.g. Jet A/A1 (ASTM), Number 3 Jet Fuel (China), TS1 (Russia)).

As it is a drop in fuel, it does not require any change to the engines nor to the aircraft and its uptake and combustion has no impact on the safety of operations nor on maintenance tasks.

To be certified as ""sustainable"", the synthetic blend component must comply with sustainability standards, including minimum Green House Gas (GHG) savings. Hence, the GHG savings on a Life Cycle Assessment basis is only accounted for the synthetic blend component - and not for the conventional fossil fuel. Sustainability criteria is defined by regulations like ICAO CORSIA, EU RED, and UK SAF Mandate. To know more about Airbus’ efforts to support SAF adoption, visit our SAF page.

Industry case studies highlight innovation, policy, and partnerships for decarbonizing India’s hard-to-abate sectors

The session convened policymakers, industry leaders, technocrats, green technology innovators, academicians, think tanks, investors, and solution providers to deliberate on practical strategies for accelerating low-carbon pathways across India’s most emission-intensive sectors. Curated under the aegis of TERI’s Industry Charter for Near Zero Emission Ambition by 2050, the roundtable showcased a selection of industry case studies and innovative solutions, underscoring the importance of collaborative action and knowledge-sharing in enabling climate-resilient growth.

Opening the session, Mr Arupendra Nath Mullick, Associate Director, TERI-Council for Business Sustainability, highlighted, “The heavy industries shall be providing the materials to support a modern economy. Together with champions of the Indian industry, we acknowledge that businesses play a vital role by understanding the opportunities of low-carbon economy and challenges on one hand, and by mobilizing resources and offering know-how and solutions, on the other.”

The discussion was moderated by Mr RR Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, who emphasized a phased yet ambitious approach to transition. “India is responding to both global impulses and its domestic commitments under the NDC. While immediate actions are important, achieving net zero will require a comprehensive sectoral framework. Both supply- and demand-side measures, across energy efficiency, industrial transitions, technology and finance, and demand management, will be central to this journey. While India has already released its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) covering key sectors, the detailed sectoral roadmaps are still under preparation. These will be vital in guiding how we achieve our long-term climate objectives,” Mr Rashmi averred.

The panel featured perspectives from industry implementers and solution innovators, sharing on-the-ground experiences and breakthrough practices.

Mr Sanjay Kumar Singh, Director- Strategy & External Relations, Jindal Steel Ltd., reflected on the complexities of greening India’s steel sector, particularly given the mix of large integrated producers and medium-sized secondary steel producers. Mr Singh stated, “Most major steel producers have set decarbonization targets between 2047 and 2050. But greening the sector does not automatically mean zero emissions. For instance, blast furnaces will continue to rely on coke, which emits carbon dioxide. The real challenge lies in how much of these emissions can be captured. Moreover, nearly 40% of India’s steel is produced by small and medium enterprises, who face greater hurdles in adopting new technologies. Transition costs, technology access, and skill development remain pressing issues. While large players are beginning to adopt new processes, the broader question is: how do we ensure the entire steel sector becomes truly green, and who bears the responsibility for that transition?”

Mr Sangeet Jain, Board member and VP ESG strategy & Alliances, LanzaTech Pvt Ltd., highlighted the circular solutions for hard-to-abate sectors through carbon recycling technologies. “With the power of biology, we are now able to recycle carbon in new and impactful ways. Our technology converts waste gases from industries like steel and ferroalloys into ethanol and other chemicals and has already been deployed at multiple commercial scales worldwide. In India, projects such as our collaboration in Panipat demonstrate the potential of these solutions, including pathways to produce sustainable aviation fuel. These ‘carbon-smart’ chemicals are already being used in products like polyester, showing how recycled carbon can create tangible consumer goods. The challenge before us is to scale and deploy more such units, enabling low-carbon fuels and chemicals to become mainstream in India’s industrial ecosystem,” added Mr Jain.

Mr Yogesh Patgunan, Circular Economy Strategist, Sperry Green Technology Pvt Ltd noted, “Hard-to-abate plastics like PP, ABS, and HIPS are critical to industries but pose serious sustainability challenges. Through our Circular Production Program, we are demonstrating how waste audits, reverse logistics, advanced recycling, and digital traceability can turn these complex waste streams into high-quality, traceable, and profitable circular solutions for businesses.”

The session reaffirmed that decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors is not merely a technological challenge but a collective endeavour–requiring policy vision, financial innovation, and strong industry commitment. As Knowledge Partner, TERI reiterated that platforms such as the Industry Charter for Near Zero Emission Ambition by 2050 will continue to act as catalysts for collaboration–bringing together stakeholders to pilot solutions, share knowledge, and scale transformative action.

Sydney Airport chief executive Scott Charlton said Sustainable Aviation Fuel made from canola had the potential to be the next great Made in Australia story.
All of the pieces are in place for Sydney and NSW to lead the way,” he said.
“Right now, most of our canola harvest is shipped offshore – and much of it ends up as biofuel overseas.
“Sydney Airport accounts for almost 40 per cent of Australia’s aviation fuel uplift, so having a SAF refinery next door at Kurnell makes sense in terms of helping meet the industry’s net zero commitments,” he said.","The farmer from Blackville on the Liverpool Plains is backing a campaign for Australia to have its own Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) refinery at Kurnell near Sydney airport.

“Anything that increases the market for our crops is a very good thing,” Mr Nankivell said.

He is a third generation farmer on 7,500 acres where he grows canola, cotton and wheat with his parents Paul and Rosemary. He believes diversified markets will be the key to seeing the children he shares with wife Nellie, Jack, 1, and Olivia, 2, carrying on the family farm.

“Farms are getting bigger and it is getting harder to compete so something like this would be great for us,” Mr Nankivell said.

Australia is the fourth largest canola producer in the world and exports 70 per cent of the crop, much of which is processed into biofuels. Currently 90 per cent of all liquid fuel in the country is imported.

Sydney Airport chief executive Scott Charlton said Sustainable Aviation Fuel made from canola had the potential to be the next great Made in Australia story.

“New South Wales produces nearly a third of Australia’s canola, we’ve got the feedstock, and we’ve got the bulk of the nation’s aviation industry right here in Sydney. All of the pieces are in place for Sydney and NSW to lead the way,” he said.

“Right now, most of our canola harvest is shipped offshore – and much of it ends up as biofuel overseas. Let’s keep it here, create high-value local jobs, and build the economic benefits at home.”

Mr Charlton said a refinery should be built at Kurnell to supply the airport. “Sydney Airport accounts for almost 40 per cent of Australia’s aviation fuel uplift, so having a SAF refinery next door at Kurnell makes sense in terms of helping meet the industry’s net zero commitments,” he said.

CommBank Agriculture Economist Dennis Voznesenski said NSW accounts for almost a third of Australian canola production and is well placed to be a centre of what could be a promising SAF industry.

“NSW has large local feedstock availability which positions it well to be a supplier of feedstock to an Australian SAF industry,” he said. That in turn would create more jobs.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/32848b9b27421f5dc0f87754c4ddc71f,N,,2025-08-25 20:56:29.170134

Our farmers are already growing the crops that power the world’s biofuel industry — but the jobs and economic benefits are being realised overseas.
Australia imports 90 per cent of its liquid fuels and holds just 17 days of aviation fuel in reserve.
In a world where supply chains are increasingly uncertain, building a domestic SAF industry could make us more resilient and self-reliant.
That’s the vision we’ll be putting forward at this year’s Bush Summit: a future where our skies are powered by the hard work, ingenuity, and resources of regional Australia.","In the years ahead, Australian farms — like the canola fields of regional NSW — could produce the fuel that powers our aircraft, creating jobs, boosting the economy, and keeping more of the value here at home.

That’s the opportunity we have with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Globally, aviation has committed to net zero by 2050, and SAF can help us get there. It has the potential to cut emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel and unlike

other future technologies, can be used in today’s aircraft and pumped through existing fuel infrastructure.

The potential feedstocks are everything from used cooking oil to household rubbish. But the real opportunity for regional NSW lies in canola.

NSW produces almost a third of the national canola crop — and Australia is the fourth-largest producer in the world. More than 70 per cent of that crop is exported, with the vast majority of exports going to Europe, where up to 80 per cent is used to make biofuels like SAF.

Our farmers are already growing the crops that power the world’s biofuel industry — but the jobs and economic benefits are being realised overseas.

We can change that. With the right policy settings, we could establish a SAF refinery at Kurnell, connected directly into Sydney Airport through existing pipelines. This would be a nation-building project: creating new markets for farmers, high-value jobs, and a new home-grown industry.

So how do we do it? The first step is to scale up both demand and supply, which will need industry working with government to establish supportive policies. Managing transport and logistics costs will be critical, so production facilities should be located as close as to the point of consumption as possible. That’s exactly why NSW, as a leading canola producer, alongside Kurnell’s fuel infrastructure and Sydney as Australia’s global aviation hub, makes so much sense as the home of a domestic SAF industry.

The economics are strong. A Qantas report found a domestic SAF industry could contribute $13 billion to GDP, support nearly 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain, and create another 5,000 jobs to build and run the facilities.

It’s also about fuel security. Australia imports 90 per cent of its liquid fuels and holds just 17 days of aviation fuel in reserve. In a world where supply chains are increasingly uncertain, building a domestic SAF industry could make us more resilient and self-reliant.

At Sydney Airport, we’ve already shown it works. Earlier this year, with Qantas, we imported nearly two million litres of SAF — the largest commercial shipment in Australian history — and delivered it to aircraft through existing infrastructure.

What’s needed now is partnership between industry and government. With the right policy support, Australia can build a world-leading SAF industry.

That’s the vision we’ll be putting forward at this year’s Bush Summit: a future where our skies are powered by the hard work, ingenuity, and resources of regional Australia.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ffddead0b36df33daa99980c696d7a1b,N,,2025-08-25 19:56:20.200063

Investment Conclusion Neste’s role as a renewable fuels leader and its appealing price tag could catch the eye of patient, income-oriented investors.","Overview

Neste Oyj (OTC: NTOIF) is a Finnish energy company, and it's built a global reputation as a heavy hitter in renewable fuels. The company operates across four key areas: Renewable Products (think renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and feedstock for bioplastics), Oil Products (classic gasoline, diesel, aviation and marine fuels, plus specialty products like bitumen), Marketing & Services (serving everything from retail and commercial transport to municipal heating and EV charging), and an 'Other' bucket offering engineering solutions and licensing for refinery technologies.

Recent Performance

Neste’s shares have slipped 19.48% over the past year, while the S&P 500 climbed 13.63%. That underperformance tells you a lot about recent hurdles: operational snags in renewables, plant stoppages, slimmer margins due to oversupply, and regulatory uncertainty—all while big US tech firms kept the wider market rally ticking along.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Neste’s revenue has grown at about 9% a year over the past eight years, thanks to steady expansion in its renewable operations. Looking ahead, analysts expect just a 1% annual growth rate for the next three years, with net income dipping by about 1% as margin challenges linger. Growth levers still exist: there’s fresh capacity ramping up in Singapore and the US, Porvoo refinery’s shift to renewables, rising appetite for renewable aviation fuel as low-carbon rules tighten, and an ongoing push into renewable chemicals and circular solutions.

Quality & Moat

Returns on equity have been healthy, holding around 17% in 2023, and free cash flow remains robust (2.97 per share operating cash flow in 2023) – all of which covers ongoing investments and a solid dividend. Neste’s position as a leader in renewable diesel tech, plus its global feedstock network, gives it a real competitive edge. The balance sheet is pretty solid too: a current ratio near 2.1× and moderate debt (debt/EBITDA around 6×). That said, with tighter margins, interest coverage has come under a bit of strain.

Valuation

At $17.15, Neste shares trade at a forward P/E of about 19.1×, cheaper than the overall market’s 25.6×. Its enterprise value/sales sits at roughly 1.4×—well below the sector’s average of 4.4×. Add in a punchy 5.3% dividend yield (above most energy peers), and there’s an attractive story here for income hunters.

Market Sentiment

The mood has shifted: RBC now rates Neste a 'Sector Perform', having trimmed its price target due to operational hiccups and uncertainty around sustainable aviation fuel. It’s now one of Europe’s most shorted stocks—plenty of investors are betting on it to fall. Institutional ownership is moderate at about 26.6%, and both retail and long-only funds have pulled back recently amid those margin wobbles.

Key Risks

Regulatory Uncertainty: Changes in US and EU fuel mandates or tax incentives—think RFS and LCFS—could throw off demand or squeeze margins for renewable fuels.

Feedstock Volatility: Prices for feedstock—like vegetable oils and waste fats—swing with crop cycles and trade tariffs, which can eat into margins.

Project Execution: Delays or overruns at major plants (Porvoo, Rotterdam, Singapore) could dent returns and cut into cash flow.

Operational Disruptions: Plant incidents, such as a fire at Rotterdam, have the potential to suddenly pinch volumes and pressure earnings.

Leverage: With debt/EBITDA near 6×, financial risk ramps up if margins don’t recover. Interest coverage has also seen a squeeze.

Market Volatility: Stock beta is around 1.08 and short interest is elevated, meaning the shares can swing harder—especially if sentiment sours.

Bull Case

Leading Renewable Platform: Neste has a strong first-mover advantage and scale in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, typically enjoying better margins than rivals.

Attractive Valuation: Forward P/E and EV/Sales are both at a hefty discount to the industry, plus there’s a high dividend yield to sweeten the deal.

Policy Tailwinds: Tougher low-carbon fuel mandates in North America and Europe look set to drive future growth.

Cash Flow Generation: Strong free cash flow supports the current dividend, potential buybacks, and paying down debt.

Strategic Refinery Transformation: Turning the Porvoo refinery into a renewables hub would lock in a reliable feedstock supply and cement margins for the long haul.

Bear Case

Margin Compression: Ongoing oversupply in renewable diesel and lower RIN prices could keep margins under pressure.

Slowing Growth: Forecasts call for nearly flat revenue growth as the core Oil Products unit matures.

Operational Risks: Start-up snags and unexpected outages at new plants could push out profitability gains.

Regulatory Shifts: If tax credits like the BTC are cut or expire, returns could take a material hit.

High Short Interest: With many investors betting against the stock, poor results could lead to more selling pressure.

On Our Radar

2025 Q3 Earnings: Set for around October 30th 2025—keep an eye on what management says about margins and volume momentum in renewables.

Porvoo Investment Decision: The next steps in the Porvoo refinery revamp are due by the end of 2025, including capital spending plans.

EPA RFS Rulemaking: The US EPA will finalize the 2026 Renewable Fuel Standard volumes in November 2025, which could shape demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

Capital Markets Day: Expected in November 2025—management should lay out their medium-term strategy and project updates.

Investment Conclusion

Neste’s role as a renewable fuels leader and its appealing price tag could catch the eye of patient, income-oriented investors. But with ongoing margin swings, operational execution risks, and regulatory uncertainty, it’s not a slam-dunk for everyone. Long-term investors might see today’s valuation as a golden entry point, while risk-averse buyers may prefer to wait for steadier earnings and firmer policy support before jumping in.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-08-25 15:56:24.632287

According to Airbus, using a 50% SAF blend on the ferry flight resulted in a reduction of more than 25 tonnes of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard jet fuel.
Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM, said: “Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation.
Since 2022, Volotea has operated the Hamburg–Toulouse shuttle for Airbus staff using a 34% SAF blend.","Today, on August 25, Airbus delivered an A220-300 to Air France from Mirabel, Canada, to Paris using a 50% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The jet completed the transatlantic flight with a mix of conventional jet fuel and SAF. It joins the fleet of 45 A220s the airline currently operates.

Airbus confirmed this was the first time its Canadian site issued official sustainability credentials directly to a customer. The European planemaker has already designed its aircraft to operate with up to 50% SAF, and by 2030 aims for all models to be capable of flying on 100% SAF.

Airbus Delivers A220 To Air France Using 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aircraft delivered is the 46th A220 to enter Air France’s fleet and has been named Vaison-la-Romaine. According to Airbus, using a 50% SAF blend on the ferry flight resulted in a reduction of more than 25 tonnes of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard jet fuel. SAF is considered one of the key ways the industry can reduce emissions and, according to the Air Transport Action Group’s “Scenario 3,"" could account for more than half of aviation’s total carbon dioxide reduction by 2050.

Currently, according to the European manufacturer, all Airbus aircraft are currently certified to operate with up to a 50% blend of SAF and conventional kerosene, and it has set a target for every model, including its helicopters, to be fully compatible with 100% SAF by 2030. Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM, said:

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical, and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game-changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress.”

Airbus Delivered 78% Of Its Aircraft With SAF Blend In The First Half Of 2025

Airbus has offered aircraft deliveries with SAF onboard since 2016, and as of this year, all five of its delivery centers in Toulouse, Hamburg, Mobile, Tianjin, and Mirabel can provide the option to customers. Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada, said that on a global scale, “78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year.” In fact, last year, 75% of the 766 aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend.

In addition, the planemaker has been using sustainable fuel in its own operations for nearly a decade and has committed to increasing the share of SAF used internally to at least 30% by 2030. At Mirabel, which develops and produces the A220, the company expects to integrate around 170,000 liters of pure SAF into activities this year, which is projected to cut carbon emissions by about 400 metric tonnes in 2025.

Airbus has also expanded SAF use across its transport and testing functions. Since 2019, its Beluga fleet has used SAF to carry aircraft parts between production sites, including Hamburg, Broughton, Bremen, Toulouse, and St Nazaire. In 2022, the company started using SAF on test flights.

Airbus Has Also Partnered With Other Carriers To Trial SAF On Commercial Routes

The manufacturer has also worked to embed SAF into its employee travel. Since 2022, Volotea has operated the Hamburg–Toulouse shuttle for Airbus staff using a 34% SAF blend. In addition, Air France-KLM and Airbus introduced a SAF fares agreement in 2024, under which Airbus purchases SAF options for business travel between Paris and five European cities: Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, and Toulouse.

Furthermore, Airbus has supported airline partners in trialing SAF on regular routes. Between November 2024 and January 2025, it partnered with easyJet on the Toulouse–Bristol service, financing 106 tonnes of SAF to cover the equivalent of a three-month schedule at a 30% blend.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/adobe-express-file-2025-08-25t190738-669.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 15:56:28.950411

This approach aims to create a robust domestic sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem.","The United Kingdom has taken a bold step towards reducing aviation’s carbon footprint by introducing a mandatory sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate. Starting Wednesday, airlines departing from UK airports must incorporate at least 2% lower-carbon jet fuel, marking a significant milestone in environmental policy.

The Department for Transport’s ambitious plan outlines a progressive implementation strategy. Beginning with a 2% requirement in 2025, the mandate will incrementally increase to 10% by 2030 and reach 22% by 2040. Exploring the evolving landscape of aerospace innovation reveals how technological advancements are driving environmental transformations.

Sustainable aviation fuel represents a groundbreaking approach to reducing carbon emissions. Produced from agricultural waste and used cooking oil, SAF generates approximately 70% less carbon compared to conventional jet fuel. Remarkably, it can be blended with traditional kerosene up to 50% without requiring aircraft engine modifications.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane emphasized the broader implications, stating, “From this moment on, aviation will be a greener, more sustainable form of travel.” The mandate is expected to create thousands of jobs and support the UK’s economic growth while addressing climate concerns.

The compliance mechanism offers flexibility for fuel suppliers. They can either directly provide the required SAF, purchase certificates from overperforming companies, or pay a government penalty of £4.70 per litre for non-compliance. Understanding the intricacies of modern aircraft technologies highlights the complex engineering challenges in sustainable aviation.

Tim Alderslade from Airlines UK supported the initiative, describing the mandate as a “powerful and practical tool for driving down aviation carbon emissions.” The industry recognizes the critical need to transition towards a net-zero future.

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive to produce than conventional jet fuel, but experts anticipate the price gap will narrow as production scales up. Examining the future of global transportation demonstrates how technological innovation can address environmental challenges.

The government has pledged to introduce revenue certainty mechanisms to attract investment in new UK sustainable fuel production plants. This approach aims to create a robust domestic sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem.

Environmental groups have cautiously welcomed the move, seeing it as a significant step towards reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. The mandate represents a critical intervention in the fight against climate change, positioning the UK as a potential global leader in aviation sustainability.",https://19e62ff8.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 17:56:28.368550

HONG KONG, HONG KONG, August 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- BRK Technology Co., Limited today announces the launch of its 2025 partner pilot programme to evaluate algae-based, drop-in renewable fuels across aviation, marine and heavy transportation sectors. The initiative represents a structured effort to produce operational data for industries under increasing pressure to reduce lifecycle emissions while maintaining performance and cost stability.

The programme will focus on sustainable aviation fuel feedstock analysis, marine engine blend assessments and controlled tests for construction, mining and logistics fleets. Each pilot will be designed around measurable baselines and independent lifecycle evaluation to compare greenhouse-gas intensity with petroleum-derived fuels used over the preceding 12-month period. According to Mr. Jin Wong, Chief Executive Officer at BRK Technology, “the objective is to generate practical evidence that algae-based fuels can function as true drop-in renewable options, delivering reduced emissions intensity without major infrastructure change.”

Wong states that the pilot structure reflects growing market demand for credible field validation. Aviation studies will examine certification pathways and refining feasibility, marine pilots will address stability and handling in harbour and auxiliary engines, and heavy machinery trials will assess reliability under load. Results are intended to inform regulators, operators and investors as sustainable fuel pathways scale towards commercialisation.

Mr. Wong explains that “partnership pilots are the link between laboratory innovation and operational deployment. Industrial operators need clear performance data that supports compliance and investment planning. Our approach in 2025 is to provide evidence through controlled and transparent projects.”

The company’s research continues to focus on engineered microalgae strains with higher lipid content and environmental resilience, alongside process optimisation for cultivation, extraction and refining.

Regulatory engagement also continues, with the company preparing for a potential stock exchange listing. BRK Technology confirms that it is working with advisers and regulators, with further announcements expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. Proceeds from a potential listing are expected to support expanded R&D, scaled production and further pilot collaborations.

The timing aligns with policy incentives such as the European Union’s Fit for 55 package and the United States Inflation Reduction Act, which support wider adoption of sustainable aviation fuel. BRK Technology notes that algae-based fuels, produced on non-arable land with closed-loop carbon cycle potential, are well placed for integration into compliance-driven markets.

Applications for the pilot programme will be prioritised for partners able to define clear baselines and measurable outcomes. Priority areas include:

• Certification-aligned aviation feedstock and refining assessments.

• Bench and controlled field tests for heavy machinery under sustained industrial loads.

• Marine blend and stability evaluations for harbour craft and auxiliary engines.

• Lifecycle assessment protocols aligned with reporting requirements for regulators and investors.

Wong adds that “progress in algae-based biofuels requires open collaboration with engine manufacturers, regulators and operators. Our 2025 programme is structured to accelerate this process while providing transparency and maintaining technical rigour.”

Industry observers highlight that global sustainable aviation fuel capacity remains below 1% of total jet fuel consumption as of mid-2025, despite rising demand from airlines committed to carbon-neutral pathways. Algae-based approaches are viewed as promising due to scalability and independence from food-based feedstocks. Heavy industries including mining, logistics and construction are also seeking renewable fuels that can be used in existing fleets without capital-intensive retrofits.

Mr. Wong concludes that “our role is to provide analysis, evidence and pathways for deployment. The 2025 pilot programme is designed to test algae-based solutions under operational conditions and contribute to the sector-wide evidence base required for broader decarbonisation.”

The subject? A now-retired Airbus A310, tail number B-2301, which holds the distinction of being the first Airbus aircraft delivered to China.

More than just a relic, this aircraft marks the beginning of a now four-decade-long cooperation between Airbus and China’s civil aviation sector. Originally delivered on June 25, 1985, the aircraft symbolized a turning point in China’s aviation history, arriving at a time when the country’s commercial fleet barely exceeded 200 planes.

It was handed over to the Shanghai branch of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the predecessor to China Eastern Airlines, and quickly became a familiar presence on routes connecting Beijing, Guangzhou, Tokyo, Osaka, and Hong Kong. Now, Airbus is restoring this historically significant aircraft in celebration of 40 years of continuous partnership with China.

Inside the Airbus-China Partnership

According to Xinhua News Agency, the A310’s arrival in 1985 was more than a commercial move—it was a strategic gesture. Christian Scherer, CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, reflected on its significance: “This A310 did start what became a phenomenal success story, friendship, and basis of trust… even beyond that between Europe and China.”

At the time, China was ramping up its reform and opening-up policy, and modern aircraft like the A310 offered exactly what the country needed: more capacity, quieter engines, and better efficiency. Its arrival paved the way for a long line of Airbus models, including the A300, A320, A340, A350, and A380, now operating in China’s vast aviation network.

Today, China boasts a commercial fleet of more than 4,300 aircraft, with over 2,200 manufactured by Airbus, making it the company’s largest single-country market.

From Museum Display to Immersive Exhibition

Since its retirement in 2006, the A310 B-2301 has been displayed at the Civil Aviation Museum in Beijing, donated by Airbus to the China Civil Aviation Science Popularization Foundation. Although the aircraft hasn’t flown in nearly 20 years, it has remained a symbol of Sino-European cooperation in aviation.

Now, Airbus plans to fully restore the aircraft’s original interior and cockpit, turning it into an interactive exhibit by 2027. The project aims to offer visitors a chance to experience the aircraft as it once was—boarding the cabin, exploring the flight deck, and learning how this widebody jet helped shape China’s aviation infrastructure.

Wang Yanan, a professor at Beihang University, calls it more than a restoration: “It’s a science and culture communicator. It tells the story behind aircraft design, manufacturing, and operation.”

Airbus Deepens Its Roots in China

This restoration isn’t a nostalgic one-off. It’s part of a broader, ongoing effort by Airbus to embed its operations into China’s aerospace sector. Over the past two decades, Airbus has expanded its presence in the country through a network of industrial and R&D facilities. These include:

A320-family final assembly line and widebody completion and delivery center in Tianjin

Engineering and customer support centers in Beijing

Aircraft life-cycle services center in Chengdu

Composites manufacturing hub in Harbin

Innovation center in Shenzhen

R&D center in Suzhou

In total, Airbus employs more than 2,300 staff in China and continues to invest in new ventures—including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development and digital aviation services.

A Future Built on Mutual Innovation

The future of this partnership looks as ambitious as its past. According to Airbus’ Global Market Forecast 2025, annual air travel per person in China is expected to triple from 0.6 in 2024 to 1.8 by 2044. In that same window, the country will likely require 9,570 new aircraft, or nearly a quarter of global demand.",https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/the-first-commercially-delivered-airbus-a310-exhibited-at-civil-aviation-museum-in-beijing.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 14:56:34.188303

Currently, the state’s six ethanol plants consume approximately 210 million bushels annually, representing 40 to 60 percent of North Dakota’s corn output.
Each bushel produces about 3 gallons of ethanol, 15 pounds of livestock feed, and up to 1 pound of corn oil (USDA NASS, 2024; North Dakota Ethanol Council, 2024).

Special to the Farmer

There may not be a more debated topic among North Dakota’s ag community than carbon dioxide and its various uses. But when it comes down to what is best for the state’s corn farmers, Jeff Zueger says there is no debate about new legislation coming out of Washington, D.C.

Zueger, CEO of Harvestone Low Carbon Energy Partners, which operates the Blue Flint ethanol plant in Underwood and Dakota Spirit plant in Spiritwood, and a director on the North Dakota Ethanol Producers Association (NDEPA) board, discussed the impact of the recent tax bill on AM 1090 The Flag.

The legislation, commonly called One Big Beautiful Bill, passed recently and Zueger says it offers benefits for North Dakota’s corn growers and ethanol producers, along with strengthening the state’s role in renewable energy.

North Dakota’s corn production has expanded significantly over the past 20 years. According to the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), in 2004, the state harvested 1.05 million acres of corn, yielding 113 million bushels at an average of 108 bushels per acre. By 2023, production soared to 543.4 million bushels from 3.8 million acres, with an average yield of 143 bushels per acre.

And the state’s ethanol industry has been eager to swallow it up. Currently, the state’s six ethanol plants consume approximately 210 million bushels annually, representing 40 to 60 percent of North Dakota’s corn output. Each bushel produces about 3 gallons of ethanol, 15 pounds of livestock feed, and up to 1 pound of corn oil (USDA NASS, 2024; North Dakota Ethanol Council, 2024).

Zueger detailed how the bill will help all these numbers stay strong. “Sure, so for us, there were a couple of really important pieces in the bill, primarily around carbon capture and storage and how we treat U.S. feedstocks, corn in particular, in the ethanol production industry. So we ended up coming out of the final bill with quite a few wins for our industry that we got to walk through,” he said.

The legislation builds on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Inflation Reduction Act, enhancing tax credits that support sustainable practices. Key components of the bill include the 45Q and 45Z tax credits. Zueger explained, “So 45Q is a tax credit that is tied to sequestration of CO2. So permanently storing carbon dioxide, and or beneficial use of carbon dioxide. So converting carbon dioxide into fuels, converting carbon dioxide into fertilizer. So 45Q previous to the One Big Beautiful Bill had tax credit levels that were lower than they are today.”

The bill increases these credits to $60 per ton for beneficial uses, such as enhanced oil recovery, and $85 per ton for sequestration, incentivizing investments in carbon capture technology.

The 45Z clean fuel production credit, extended through 2029, removes penalties like indirect land use charges that previously disadvantaged U.S. corn.

“And under the One Big Beautiful Bill,” Zueger noted, “it was extended to 2029, which was really good for our industry. And then also get away again, with direct land use. So 45Z clean fuel production credit takes into account farm practices all the way to tailpipe emissions for renewable fuel.”

These changes directly benefit North Dakota’s corn growers. By eliminating indirect land use penalties, which many say unfairly linked U.S. corn production to global deforestation, the bill ensures fair competition with countries like Brazil.

“The other piece that One Big Beautiful Bill did was kind of protect the U.S. feedstocks for things like sustainable aviation fuel and renewable base fuel,” said Zueger. “Up until that bill passed, Brazil was going to eat our lunch as it relates to providing ethanol for feedstock for staff.”

The bill mandates that renewable fuel feedstocks come from the U.S., Canada, or Mexico, figuring to support local farmers and rural economies in towns like Underwood and Spiritwood.

Zueger says the legislation also positions North Dakota to tap into the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market, saying that if you consider it as a 100 million gallon a year aviation fuel market that could be 50% renewable based, that allows for price strength for farmers wanting to sell their corn.

Despite these opportunities, some landowners remain wary of carbon capture due to concerns about CO2 pipeline safety.

Zueger addressed the issue.

“Well, I think it’s why we’d say that as perhaps you don’t understand the safety elements associated with long-term permanent storage of CO2. So, I think there’s some real benefits with demonstrating carbon capture and storage as it relates to long-term enhanced oil recovery.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2327/2024/06/21021310/US-CONGRESS-PHOTO-PEXELS.png,N,,2025-08-25 11:56:39.090116

Headline Takeaway: Veralto (VLTO) is showing a recent price rise of 1.88%, but technical signals suggest weak momentum and the need for caution.

News Highlights

Recent global news appears to have little direct impact on Veralto, but broader economic trends remain in focus. Notably:

Fuel Ethanol Market Growth: A report released on May 29 highlights the rising commercial viability of sustainable aviation fuel via new ethanol technologies. Veralto could benefit if its ethanol production aligns with this trend.

UN Condemns Medical Supply Looting in Gaza: While unrelated to Veralto’s core operations, this incident underscores global instability, which could affect energy markets and ethanol demand in the long run.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Veralto currently holds an average rating score of 4.00 and a weighted rating score of 4.75, based on the recent activity of three analyst firms. These scores reflect a modestly optimistic outlook, though with differences in analyst expectations (e.g., “Strong Buy” and “Neutral” ratings both present). This divergence means investors should watch for further clarity before committing to long-term positions.

The current stock price trend is positive (1.88% rise), and it appears to align with the market’s weighted expectations, suggesting some degree of consensus despite the mixed ratings.

Key Fundamental Factor Values:

ROA (Return on Assets): 3.10% (Internal diagnostic score: 4.63)

ROE (Return on Equity): 8.34% (Internal diagnostic score: 4.63)

EV/EBIT: 80.64 (Internal diagnostic score: 0.00)

Net Income to Revenue: 41.30% (Internal diagnostic score: 4.63)

CFOA (Cash Flow from Operating Activities): 4.73 (Internal diagnostic score: 4.63)

Money-Flow Trends

Veralto’s fund-flow patterns over the last period reveal a mixed picture. While small investors are showing a positive trend (50.06% inflow ratio), larger institutional investors are more cautious, with medium and extra-large money flows trending negatively. The overall inflow ratio stands at 48.48%, and block trading activity (48.28% inflow ratio) also shows a negative bias.

With an internal fund-flow score of 7.62, the stock is still considered in a “good” category, but investors should watch for shifts in large capital flows which can quickly change the momentum.

Key Technical Signals

Veralto’s technical outlook remains unclear and volatile, with internal diagnostic scores from recent indicators showing a range of signals:

Bearish Engulfing: Score 7.31 (internal diagnostic score) – A strong bearish candle pattern observed on 2025-08-11.

WR Overbought: Score 6.41 – Seen on multiple dates (2025-08-13, 2025-08-12, 2025-08-08), indicating potential overbought conditions.

RSI Overbought: Score 1.00 – A strong negative signal seen on 2025-08-13.

MACD Death Cross: Score 6.18 – Observed on 2025-08-18, suggesting bearish momentum.

WR Oversold: Score 3.96 – A positive signal on 2025-08-18.

The key insights from the technical analysis suggest mixed momentum, with long and short signals in balance and the overall trend being weak and unclear.

The EU’s sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) blending mandate creates an opportunity for Finland to become a significant producer of synthetic fuels in the future.

Finnish company Liquid Sun is launching a globally unique pilot project to produce renewable, eSAF from biogenic CO₂ emissions. Originating from research at Tampere University, Liquid Sun has developed an innovation based on low-temperature electrolysis (LTE) technology that converts CO₂ emissions and renewable H2 into eSAF. For this pilot, Liquid Sun has partnered with Finnair, ABB, Fortum, and Finavia. In Finland, biogenic CO₂ emissions are generated, for example, by the forest industry and biogas plants.

The pilot electro-fuel production unit, to be located in Espoo, will be fully operational in autumn 2025. This is the first pre-commercial production pilot of its kind, aiming to establish a functioning ecosystem and value chain for synthetic fuel production in Finland. In this collaborative project, the companies will jointly develop eSAF production, conduct validation, and build capabilities for globally scalable processes to secure the future supply of domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the rapidly emerging sustainable aviation fuel market. To achieve this goal, it is critical that the project brings together industrial partners across the eSAF value chain with a shared ambition to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels,” said Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun.

At the beginning of 2025, the EU aviation blending mandate entered into force, requiring the gradual increase of renewable fuel use in aviation through 2050. From 2030, the mandate will expand to include fully synthetic fuels made from CO₂. By 2050, the blending requirement will rise to 70%, of which half must be eSAF. The mandate applies to airports with at least 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tons of cargo annually. In Finland, this includes Helsinki-Vantaa and Rovaniemi airports.

“As the owner of Finland’s airports, we at Finavia want to do everything we can across the aviation value chain to support more sustainable air travel. This means bold climate collaboration with our stakeholders and actively understanding and testing new technologies across our airport operations,” said Henri Hansson, SVP, Airport Infrastructure, Sustainability, Safety, Security & Compliance at Finavia.

Due to this regulatory framework, Finland has a unique opportunity to become a leading producer of renewable aviation fuels. The Finnish forest industry alone generates 20 million tons of biogenic CO₂ annually, with additional emissions from biogas plants. These diverse sources enable decentralized eSAF production, which in turn strengthens energy security and balances electricity grid load nationwide.

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, and its energy transition will require new innovation and collaboration across the value chain. We want to contribute to developing Finland’s capability in synthetic aviation fuel production while advancing the industry’s carbon neutrality goals,” said Riku Aho, Vice President Energy Transition, at Finnair.

“Fortum’s target is to help societies to reach carbon neutrality and our customers to decarbonize their processes. For aviation fuel production, we are pleased to offer renewable energy and, in the future, H2 from the pilot plant we are currently building,” said Satu Sipola, Vice President, H2 and Project Execution at Fortum.

“The goal of ABB Oy’s H2 Springboard program is to promote the development of Finland’s H2 economy ecosystem and to accelerate the scaling of H2 technology solutions. The Liquid Sun project is an excellent example of broad ecosystem collaboration for developing pioneering solutions,” said Simo Säynevirta, Head of H2 Springboard ecosystem at ABB.

There is a technological race underway to deliver cost-efficient and scalable solutions, and Finland’s conditions and capabilities are highly favorable. ""We believe rapid piloting and validation is the right approach when building an entirely new industry for synthetic fuels. If successful, this project can give Finland a significant competitive advantage,” said Pasi Keinänen, Liquid Sun.

Although shipping accounts for only about 3% of global carbon emissions, the sector carries nearly 90% of global trade, making it central to global decarbonization efforts. Taiwan’s three leading carriers— Evergreen Marine, Yang Ming Marine, and Wan Hai Lines—are stepping up efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in response to international carbon pricing regulations.

According to RECCESSARY carbon market analyst Sherry Hu, Taiwan’s shipping industry faces two major challenges in its green transition: Cost pressures and fuel supply. Companies that fail to adopt cleaner fuels early may struggle with rising costs in the long term.

ETS surcharges and 2027 carbon pricing raise pressure on shipping

Energy efficiency and carbon reduction have become global priorities, not only for ESG compliance but also to avoid rising regulatory costs. Both the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the European Union have introduced measures targeting shipping emissions.

As of 2024, major carriers have begun collecting surcharges under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The IMO is also preparing its own carbon pricing mechanism that could reach up to USD 380 per metric ton, with enforcement expected by 2027 and mandatory payments starting in 2028.

With more than 50,000 cargo ships operating worldwide, the shipping industry is heading into a high-cost era. Shipowners must gradually phase out older vessels and energy-intensive equipment, while replacing high-polluting heavy fuel oil with alternatives such as methanol, low-sulfur fuels, or liquefied natural gas. Hu emphasized that striking a balance between operating costs and decarbonization investment will be critical to the success of this transition.

A study by Taiwan’s Ministry of Transportation highlights three main pathways for reducing shipping emissions: developing dual-fuel ships powered by cleaner energy, lowering energy consumption through slow steaming or efficiency improvements, and offsetting emissions through carbon credits or carbon taxes.

Strategy 1: Replacing aging ships with LNG and methanol dual-fuel vessels

Wai Hai’s 2023 Sustainability Report shows that the company has phased out older vessels and added 23 high-efficiency ships, cutting its annual carbon emissions by 17% in 2023 compared with 2022, and by 48% from its 2008 baseline. In April, the company announced plans to purchase four 16,000 TEU methanol dual-fuel container ships and to add 34 more newly built vessels over the next five years.

Yang Ming’s 2023 Sustainability Report stated that the company has signed a contract with HD Hyundai Heavy Industries to build five 15,500 TEU LNG dual-fuel container ships, scheduled to enter service from 2026. The company also completed procurement last year for seven 15,500 TEU LNG dual-fuel vessels and six 8,000 TEU methanol dual-fuel container ships, a move aimed at phasing out aging vessels in its fleet that are over 20 years old.

Yang Ming announced on July 24 that it will order three additional 8,000 TEU methanol dual-fuel-ready containerships from Nihon Shipyard Co., Ltd. and Imabari Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. Combined with the three vessels of the model purchased this March, Yang Ming will have a total of six methanol dual-fuel-ready container ships scheduled for delivery between 2028 and 2030.

According to Evergreen’s 2023 Sustainability Report, the company invested in 24 16,000 TEU methanol vessels and six 2,400 TEU dual-fuel container ships in 2023. This February, Evergreen further expanded its fleet by purchasing eleven ultra-large 24,000 TEU LNG dual-fuel container ships, bringing its total investment to more than TWD 100 billion.

Strategy 2: Accelerating adoption of alternative fuels amid competition with aviation

Beyond investing in next-generation vessels, alternative fuels have become a priority. Yang Ming reported conducting its first biofuels trial in South Korea in 2024, using B30 fuel blended with locally sourced waste cooking oil. The fuel meets ISO 8217 standards and carries ISCC sustainability certification, aligning with the EU’s Green Fuel for Maritime initiative. According to the company, the biofuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 25% compared with conventional marine fuels.

Wan Hai announced on Oct. 7, 2024 that it has started using biofuels across its global fleet. The first vessel to adopt the fuel was the WAN HAI 510, which operates on the Far East-India route. The biofuel is produced by blending methyl esters derived from recycled cooking oil with conventional low-sulfur fuel oil, enabling a reduction of about 20% in carbon emissions compared with standard low-sulfur fuel.

Since the beginning of this year, Evergreen has begun using biofuels certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) system to reduce emissions. The company said that it has conducted tests of blended marine biofuels across different vessel types, flag states, and engine models since 2023.

To prepare for the delivery of new dual-fuel vessels, Evergreen has already signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with five green methanol suppliers and is in talks with four more, with the aim of securing fuel supply at ports across Europe, the U.S., and Asia in line with future operational routes.

However, the biofuel market is already highly competitive. The aviation sector is struggling with shortages of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), along with high costs and technical hurdles. Hu warned that if significant demand from the shipping industry emerges after the IMO’s carbon pricing mechanism takes effect in 2027, it could intensify competition with aviation for limited resources.

Hu added that most new production capacity is being directed toward aviation, meaning the share available for shipping could be limited in the short term. She suggested that if the IMO allocates carbon pricing revenues to support the expansion of biofuel and other low-carbon fuel capacity and supply chains, it could help ease scarcity and cost pressures over the longer term.

In the short term, the risk of passing carbon costs onto customers will be difficult to avoid. Hu noted that in the medium to long term, if the IMO’s Net-Zero Fund channels substantial investment into low-carbon fuel supply and port infrastructure, it could gradually reduce the cost of fuel substitution while enhancing emissions reductions.

A further uncertainty lies in whether both the EU ETS and the IMO will impose carbon charges on overlapping routes during the initial phase. This would be particularly sensitive for European services, but carriers that proactively adjust route planning and fuel strategies may be able to mitigate the risk of double charges.

Note: TEU stands for Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit, the standard measurement for a 20-foot shipping container. One TEU refers to the length of a single 20-foot container and is commonly used to describe the capacity of container ships and terminals.

The USTR’s office opened the public comment period for the NML last week. According to the USTR website, the NML “highlights online and physical markets that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy.”

ITIF contended that Temu, Shein and AliExpress meet that description. The non-profit said that it ordered 51 products from the three marketplaces and found 24 of those products to be “likely counterfeits.” The products examined ranged across consumer categories, including apparel, luxury goods and toys. Of the 24 products thought to be counterfeits, 14 came from AliExpress, one came from Shein and nine came from Temu.

Eli Clemens, an ITIF policy analyst and the author of the report, said the companies need to be more closely watched to protect American consumers.

“The proliferation of counterfeits on Temu, AliExpress, and Shein is more than a series of isolated mistakes. It reflects a fundamental failure by these platforms to prioritize anti-counterfeiting efforts, leading to poor outcomes for brands and consumers alike,” Clemens said in a statement. “Counterfeit products are not only bad for the economy, but they also pose potential safety risks to consumers.”

According to ITIF, the suspected counterfeits used intellectual property from brands like Ralph Lauren, New Balance, Carolina Herrera, Brooks and Nike, among others.

The full report from the ITIF stated that the organization believes Temu, Shein and AliExpress have varying problems when it comes to enforcement of intellectual property rights.

While just one Shein product was a suspected counterfeit, the trade organization still took issue with the company’s approach toward intellectual property.

“IP infringement on Shein remains a live issue in the form of unauthorized reproduction of creative works by independent designers,” the trade organization wrote in the report. “These cases often avoid brand names and logos entirely, making them harder to detect with automated tools and more burdensome for individual rights holders to challenge.”

Shein has faced multiple lawsuits alleging that it has ripped off artists’ and companies’ proprietary designs.

As far as AliExpress is concerned, the ITIF contended that counterfeits on the marketplace are more blatant.

“AliExpress appears to host vendors that misuse brand trademarks across multiple product types, particularly in low-cost categories such as accessories, toys and shoes. Likely counterfeits purchased on AliExpress often appear crude, with unauthorized use of brand names and logos applied to goods that the legitimate rights holder does not produce, or products with inferior quality than would be expected from the original manufacturer,” the ITIF said.

Temu, meanwhile, allegedly offers what the ITIF called “highly deceptive” counterfeits.

“These goods often bear barcodes, certification marks, or manufacturer references that appear authentic. This makes Temu counterfeits more difficult for consumers to spot while browsing, and more difficult to determine are counterfeit upon receipt of the goods. Taken as a whole, potential counterfeit vendors on Temu appear to have a strategy aimed at selling counterfeit goods as legitimate-looking products to maintain customer trust while still profiting from infringing sales,” the ITIF wrote.

The 2024 NML, released in January ahead of the new administration, included Pinduoduo, which is also owned by Temu’s parent company, PDD Holdings. Temu did not see any mention on the list. Former USTR Katherine Tai indicated upon release of the 2024 report that the government has continued to track the growth of China-headquartered marketplaces. Douyin Mall, owned by TikTok parent ByteDance made the list, alongside Taobao, DHGate and others.

U.S. politicians have long harbored concerns about Shein and Temu’s purported links to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in part because both are China-founded businesses. Shein is currently headquartered in Singapore, though reportedly, the company is actively considering a move back to China to align with its aspirations for an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong. Temu is currently headquartered in Boston, though its parent company PDD Holdings is based in Dublin.

AliExpress, owned by Alibaba Group, remains the only company of the three headquartered in China. The company saw inclusion on the 2021 and 2022 NMLs. ITIF said it remains unclear what prompted the company’s removal from the list in 2023.

Shein, Temu and AliExpress did not immediately return Sourcing Journal’s request for comment on the ITIF’s assertions.

In addition to calling on the USTR to add the three companies to the 2025 NML, the ITIF has recommended some policy actions. It has stated it believes that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) should leverage artificial intelligence for identifying counterfeit products. The ITIF said it believes the automated nature of AI systems could help scale up enforcement, while also preempting some counterfeits from being sold.

Additionally, it suggested that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) establish a “Foreign Counterfeit Complaint Center” (FC3), which would draw inspiration from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center. The FC3 would give consumers a way to report potential counterfeits to the government while simultaneously offering a way for the agency to track patterns and compile evidence against companies and marketplaces as necessary.

Part of the reason for these additional recommendations, the ITIF said, is that CBP failed to stop potential counterfeits from entering the U.S. The ITIF noted that the agency detained four suspected counterfeit products from AliExpress but ultimately released them. The non-profit said more oversight could help other counterfeits from entering the country in the future.

“Addressing the counterfeit trade requires sustained U.S. action to recalibrate platform and vendor behavior through regulatory, trade, and technological measures,” Clemens said in a statement. “Holding foreign e-commerce platforms to the same standards as domestic ones is essential to protecting consumers, fostering innovation and safeguarding the integrity of global markets.”

“Partnering with Xiamen Airlines enables us to scale the production of SAF from waste feedstocks more rapidly,” EcoCeres CEO Matti Lievonen was quoted as saying.

EcoCeres has raised concerns about the European Union (EU)’s treatment of biodiesel imports from China.

In January, the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) published proposals that it said would improve the EU’s system for quality verification, including annual on-site audits.

The EBB – which represents 34 companies that produce 75% of Europe’s biodiesel output – also called on the EU to impose effective sanctions against fraudulent imports, including retroactive invalidations of certificates, to compel all players in the sector to exercise due diligence, Biofuels Digest wrote on 6 August report, citing a South China Morning Post report.

For biofuels imported into the EU, the EBB recommended mandatory content tests to determine sustainability, with results logged in an EU database.

EcoCeres CEO Matti Lievonen said the content tests for imports could be discriminatory to product from outside the EU.

“There should not be a battle between EU and non-EU producers,” he said.

“The focus of any reform should be on ensuring a level playing field.”

Describing the current system as redundant, he said a streamlined, centralised framework could maintain consistency and reduce potential future supply disruptions.

Lindberg said what concerns him is that the U.S. has a $50 billion trade deficit.
The U.S. had a $60 billion trade deficit in June 2025, which is down from $71.7 billion in May 2025.
The biggest issue that keeps coming up among ag groups is the $300 billion trade deficit with China, according to 2024 numbers.
That’s a 5.7% increase over 2023, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.","American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall was clear in his message to President Donald Trump when the two met several weeks ago. Duvall told him that farmers like him do not support tariffs.

“We don’t support your tariffs, but we sure hope that your efforts and your direction that you’re taking trade in is successful,” Duvall recalled saying while talking to crowds at Farmfest on Wednesday, Aug. 6.

Trump assured him that these deals would bring people to the table to level the playing field.

Duvall also had the opportunity to speak with United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who told him there would be no trade agreement without agriculture having a big stake in it.

But until those deals are made with key trade partners like Canada, Mexico and China, Duvall also knew it was clear that things are going to be difficult with the large incoming crop to deal with at a time when crop prices were slipping lower.

“You go into the banker and talk about next year’s crop, and it’s going to be a difficult situation unless we have ... a bright outlook on the future when it comes to trade,” he said.

Luke Lindberg, on his second day on the job as under secretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, echoed what Duvall said, that agriculture must be in any trade deal. He saw the recent negotiations that have resulted in some trade deals as a glimpse into the “golden age of agriculture” from a trade perspective.

“Never before have we had more movement on the trade front to open up new markets and provide new opportunities for our farmers and ranchers than what President Trump has been able to do in his first seven months in office,” Lindberg said.

Lindberg mentioned a trade deal with Japan that is meant to bring $4.5 billion in new ag sales. According to the White House, Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

While Lindberg shared his excitement about trade deals as a milestone, the delivery and payment for agricultural products was the finish line they needed to reach.

“The actual victory comes when we get sales done,” he said.

Lindberg said what concerns him is that the U.S. has a $50 billion trade deficit. The U.S. had a $60 billion trade deficit in June 2025, which is down from $71.7 billion in May 2025. So far, the big change is not in exports, but in fewer imports, according to data from the USDA.

Chad Willis, also on the trade panel with Duvall at Farmfest, is a Willmar, Minnesota, farmer and past president of the U.S. Grains Council.

He was asked by moderator Don Wick, of the Red River Farm Network, what the U.S. role is in building trade relationships. Willis explained that the U.S. must continue to fund overseas trade missions in order to hold up those relationships built over decades. He referenced funds that help the U.S. promote ethanol overseas.

“So that’s why I’m glad to see this extra money now for promotion in the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ as they call it, ’cause it’ll help organizations such as U.S. Grains and Soybeans, Meat Federation, to do more overseas. Trade is all about relationships,” he said.

Willis referenced a supplemental agricultural trade program in the reconciliation bill that passed in July . This makes available $285 million “to encourage the accessibility, development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial export markets for United States agricultural commodities” starting in 2027 and each fiscal year after.

The biggest issue that keeps coming up among ag groups is the $300 billion trade deficit with China, according to 2024 numbers. That’s a 5.7% increase over 2023, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

Randy Spronk, past chair of the U.S. Meat Export Federation, spoke about hurdles to overcome in this area, including a current 57% tariff on pork products imported into China. That was previously a 172% tariff.

“The rest of the world is about 12%,” he said.

Tariffs are a major determining factor in whether China buys U.S. products, yet Spronk added that he believes the U.S. product remains the best value when it goes to China.

He mentioned that the “variety meats” from pork and beef products, such as organs and other subprime edibles, are sought after in China, while less sought after in the U.S. Getting those products to China adds the highest value to each animal. But removing the tariffs will open the doors back to trading with China, according to Spronk.

China was the second largest importer of U.S. pork and pork variety meat last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation; nearly 70% of that volume is variety meat.

Darin Johnson, president of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, is hopeful for other soybean markets to open up, like India, but he’s not convinced that anything at the moment can replace the loss felt by China choosing South America for its soybean needs.

“In the end, it is, China is a tough, that’s a tough number to replace,” he said.

That number is 115 million metric tons that China purchases in a year. They were buying 58% of the total U.S. exports of soybeans. The U.S. exports about 50% of its soybeans.

“That’s equivalent to all the other countries' imports,” Johnson continued. “So it’s, it’s really quite a staggering number when you think about it that way.”

The next highest is the European Union, at 14 million metric tons, about 100 million tons less than China.

The importance of adding value to a lower-priced commodity was emphasized by Willis. He mentioned turning corn to ethanol as one of those areas and added that Canada is the No. 1 ethanol export market. Mexico could be a large opportunity, he said.

Feeding the grains to cattle that can be shipped to other countries was another way Spronk saw to add value.

“Gotta add value to that kernel, especially at these prices that we’re experiencing right now,” he said.

In the absence of a trade deal with China, Johnson responded to an audience question that farmers are going to have a very difficult time continuing without government assistance.

“Cause right now we’re operating really probably anywhere, depending on your farm, probably a dollar to potentially $2 for soybeans under the cost of production,” he said.

Johnson gave credit to the farmers in the room as a group of people who are willing to give up their retirement or equity in order to stay on the farm and give the next generation a chance at survival.

“I mean, it makes my hair stand up on my arms thinking about it,” he said.

He was aware that there were some farmers in the building who had been continuing the farm for six or seven generations.

“We are going to need some assistance if these negotiations do take some time, which, understandably, we want to make sure that we get it right, too.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/ff644b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2592x1728+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2Fad%2Fec14014748abae6b2e4ff0bfca45%2F9773181468948-unloading-soybeans-into-semi-6894.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 11:57:13.362568

In some sectors, such as life sciences and therapeutics, venture capital had flowed freely, analysts said, thanks to low interest rates, demand for digital technologies and an increased appetite for risk.

“You saw a lot of those types of investments happening in the Baltimore region as well that ended up yielding some great outcomes,” said Kory Bailey, GBC’s chief ecosystem officer. “In years after that …investors were being a little more cautious.”

Funding each of the past three years in the region has been steady yet well below 2021’s high of $1 billion for 87 startups. Last year, it totaled nearly $665 million. Meanwhile, the number of new businesses getting that capital has decreased each year, from 89 in 2022 to 60 last year.

Building a startup ecosystem where the region can compete with other cities will hinge on attracting more private investment and focusing on strengths such as national security and global economic competitiveness, more likely to win federal support under the Trump administration, Bailey said. The region is well-positioned to do so, he said, thanks to anchor health care systems and defense facilities, along with access to airports and the Port of Baltimore.

But “if we want to accelerate that growth and be on pace with other regions that have really leaned into their sector strengths, we’ve got to be more intentional about how we elevate the innovations and leaders that are happening now,” Bailey said.

By tracking startups, the business group expects to focus on and drive investment to companies in the hottest sectors, hitting milestones for job creation, investment and revenue. That can be difficult, as many entrepreneurs launch or fizzle out with little fanfare or public reporting. GBC hasn’t been able to track startup failures, Bailey said, “Startups inherently all don’t win.”

Ongoing reductions in federal spending in research and education is “concerning,” he said. But he is hopeful opportunities for growth will expand through the private sector, philanthropy or other entities committed to the region’s prosperity.

In its latest report in March, UpSurge tracked 486 operating technology startups, about the same as in a 2024 report. Most offer health care services or products and often form through the transfer of technology from incubators at places such as Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, Baltimore and Blackbird Labs.

Besides Baltimore city’s 336 tech startups, clusters have emerged in Howard County, with 68, Baltimore County, with 55 and Anne Arundel County, with 43. After health care, key industries include information technology, such as cybersecurity and AI applications, followed by finance, manufacturing, media, education, energy and advertising. GBC wants to expand the database to non-tech service startups.

‘Taking that leap’

Baltimore-based Elos Thermal, started by two 2019 graduates of Archbishop Curley High School, is one of those that’s taking off.

Thunlwyn Garcia and Anthony Dragisics played soccer at two different Division 1 colleges and commiserated about competing in adverse weather. Garcia, who studied entrepreneurship at Mount St. Mary’s College, approached Dragisics, then a Villanova University business major, with an idea for insoles that could regulate temperature while offering pain relief.

With money borrowed from parents, they used 3D printers in their dorms to make prototypes. In their senior year, they secured a patent, convincing them to push ahead full-time after graduating in 2023.

“It was a big decision for sure, taking that leap,” said Dragisics, 24, an Ellicott City native. “We felt confident this had a place in the market.”

From Spark Coworking Baltimore at Market Place downtown, where the partners said they’ve learned from more experienced entrepreneurs, they plan to launch Elos insoles nationally in October through Amazon and specialty retail shops. They’ve so far sold about 500 units to skiers, hikers, runners and other athletes in a limited launch in February on Elos’ website. Production is now handled in Asia.

“Finding good partners has been the most challenging,” Dragisics said. “We underestimated how long it takes to form good relationships and partnerships.”

Building a startup

Shaw, of BrightWave, said his algae-growing products have global appeal, but he found expertise to start the business much closer to home. The co-founders became interested in algae because of its growing popularity as a biofuel.

In 2019, the new company rented space near algae specialists at the Institute for Marine and Environmental Technologies, part of the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science, working with scientists on research and development and building prototypes.

They sought advice from the state Department of Commerce, which led them to Early Charm, a Pigtown-based company that creates, owns and operates businesses that commercialize new technologies. Early Charm provided more business leads.

They assumed they’d have to go overseas for manufacturing, but found Early Charm’s subsidiary, Sanosona, could take on production and assembly. BrightWave also found local plastics, packaging and other suppliers.

Initially, “it was almost a foregone conclusion that if we want to do this right and keep our manufacturing costs down, it was going to have to be offshore, and it turned out to be the complete opposite,” Shaw said.

One of the biggest challenges was attracting institutional investors. Deals with private investors came close but fell through. After months of dead ends, the founders ended up funding their startup.

“Hard tech is a tough sell for investors,” Shaw said. “Investors wanted to see monthly baked-in revenue. That wasn’t our model.”

While uncertainty over grant funding is concerning for firms similar to BrightWave, Shaw says his firm, expecting $3 million in revenue this year from the U.K. deal, is set up to weather the storm. It has avoided relying on grants and seeks both public and private sector customers, many from overseas.

Carton, who says his new tech consulting firm will pursue a people-first approach, expects challenges ahead for startups that lose federal funding or work with clients affected by cuts. But starting out has become easier, in some ways, he said, with services and information more available online. That can reduce the time and expense of registering a business, finding contractors or traveling to in-person meetings, lowering barriers to entry.

In the past, he co-founded a web development firm in 1996 that became digital agency Carton Donofrio Partners, which employed 100 people at its peak but no longer exists. He later helped start ad agency idfive, a marketing and communications agency in Baltimore’s Mount Vernon neighborhood.

“The appeal is setting your own path,” Carton said. “These days, it sort of feels like, yeah, it’s risky, but so is anything. Being employed anywhere these days is not a guarantee.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qc2hkiIIK.hRxuPI75s8xg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/baltimore_sun_tribune_local_552/446587f2f877ad114f44ee41c4e421c6,N,,2025-08-25 11:57:20.224046

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken action on a backlog of 175 Small Refinery Exemption (SRE) petitions covering compliance years 2016 through 2024. After reviewing each case with the U.S. Department of Energy, EPA granted 63 full exemptions, 77 partial exemptions, denied 28 petitions, and found 7 ineligible.

EPA reaffirmed its policy, first set in the 2020 Renewable Volume Obligation rule, to grant partial relief—typically a 50% exemption—when a small refinery shows partial hardship. This approach aims to recognize that not all small refineries face the same level of challenge while keeping national renewable fuel goals on course.

“The EPA inherited a messy situation and we appreciate the agency’s commitment to ending the years-long SRE litigation and restoring stability to the RFS. NOPA is confident the agency understands that strong RVOs will have profoundly positive impacts on U.S. farmers and rural America. We urge the EPA to build on this progress and quickly finalize the RVOs in a way that delivers these positive impacts, by finalizing a re-allocation policy that fully accounts for gallons lost due to SREs in 2023-2025 and any projected SREs for future years, expanding volumes for the biomass-based diesel category to at least 5.25 billion gallons and ensuring domestic feedstocks and fuels are prioritized. These measures are essential to ensuring the program strengthens domestic markets and keeps investment and jobs in rural America,” said Devin Mogler, President and CEO, National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA)

EPA also clarified how Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) will be handled when exemptions are granted for past years. RINs may only be used in the year they are generated or the following year. Because of that two-year window, 2022 and earlier RINs cannot be used to meet open 2024 or future obligations. EPA says this limit should prevent older RINs from affecting current or future biofuel demand.

Looking ahead, EPA plans to send a supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget to address reallocation of exempted volumes for 2023 and later years. The agency does not plan to reallocate volumes from 2016–2022 due to the RIN timing limits. EPA will also explain how it plans to project SREs in setting percentage standards for 2026 and 2027, helping to keep intended renewable fuel volumes in place.

Industry reactions were mixed but focused on maintaining market stability. Groups representing oilseed processors and biofuel producers urged EPA to fully reallocate gallons lost to 2023–2024 exemptions and to finalize strong volume targets. Others warned that refunding retired RINs must not weaken demand for biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, or farm-based feedstocks.

For farmers and rural communities, the key takeaway is that EPA’s approach seeks to balance hardship relief with steady growth in homegrown fuels.",,N,,2025-08-25 11:57:30.747758

AeroSHARK Certification for A330

Lufthansa Technik is seeking certification through a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), which enables a series of modifications to the A330-200s and A330-300s fuselage and nacelles. AeroSHARK is a fuel-saving technology that works by reducing drag. It was developed by Lufthansa Technik and BASF, and the process involves applying a sharkskin film called riblet film. Riblets are microscopic grooves that help guide air or water efficiently over a surface. On an aircraft, they help direct airflow along the fuselage, reducing drag and improving aerodynamic performance.

The company already holds certifications for AeroSHARK modification on the Boeing 777-300ER, 777-200ER, and Boeing 777F. The Airbus A330 is the next candidate to receive AeroSHARK after the Boeing 777. The A330 is one of the most widely used wide-body aircraft globally, second only to the Boeing 777 in fleet size and popularity among long-haul operators. The A330’s strong standing in the market opens new opportunities for AeroSHARK.

The certification process is expected to be completed in 2026. Aircraft modifications require official approval from aviation authorities. The process involves detailed analyses and test campaigns that ensure compliance and aviation safety standards are met. All aircraft models requiring modification must undergo their own STC.

AeroSHARK Benefits

Lufthansa Technik and BASF Coatings have successfully adapted the principle of drag reduction through riblets to withstand the harsh conditions of daily airline operations, which makes AeroSHARK the first and only certified riblet film solution available for commercial aviation. AeroSHARK achieves a reduction of about one percent in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

According to Lufthansa Technik, the riblet technology is more effective in reducing aerodynamic drag when the aircraft is in a cruise flight. This makes long-haul aircraft great candidates for these types of modification due to their long distances.

Lufthansa Technik stated that large-scale AeroSHARK modifications have been successfully applied to 28 Boeing 777 aircraft of several airlines and one Lufthansa Boeing 747, which was used as a testbed. The company added that AeroSHARK-modified aircraft have accumulated over 232,000 successful flight hours, saving more than 13,000 metric tons of jet fuel and reducing CO2 emissions by over 42,000 metric tons.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/250117_LH-Super-Star-012-2117.jpg_main-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1708&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-25 11:57:38.945653

For investors, this represents a high-growth opportunity at the intersection of energy transition and critical infrastructure.

Market Drivers: Regulatory Push and Corporate Sustainability Imperatives

The adoption of HVO as a drop-in replacement for diesel in data center backup generators is accelerating due to its ability to reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 90%. This aligns with the net-zero targets of hyperscale operators and the tightening emissions standards in key APAC markets.

Japan's Green Growth Strategy is incentivizing biofuel integration in energy systems, with Tokyo and Osaka becoming hubs for HVO-powered hybrid power systems.

India's National Biofuel Policy offers streamlined approvals and tax incentives, enabling data centers in Mumbai and Chennai to transition to HVO and hydrogen fuel cells.

Singapore's Green Growth Strategy has positioned the city-state as a pioneer, with ST Telemedia Global Data Centres (STT GDC) leading the charge by deploying 50,000 liters of HVO across its facilities.

These policies are not just environmental mandates but also economic enablers. Governments are offering preferential financing and subsidies for biofuel blending, offsetting HVO's current 10–30% price premium over diesel. For instance, Australia's push for decarbonization has spurred partnerships between data centers and biofuel producers like Neste and TotalEnergies, who are scaling production in response to demand.

Infrastructure Expansion: Scaling Biofuel Production for Digital Resilience

The scalability of HVO infrastructure is being validated by strategic investments and partnerships. In 2025, Neste, Repsol, and Shell have expanded their HVO production capacities in Singapore, Japan, and India, leveraging APAC's regulatory frameworks to meet the surging demand for backup power solutions.

Singapore's STT GDC has partnered with global biofuel producers to integrate HVO with on-site solar and battery storage, creating hybrid systems that reduce generator runtime and emissions.

India's GDS Services is transitioning its diesel generators to HVO and hydrogen, aiming for 100% renewable energy in its data centers.

Japan's energy firms are piloting HVO with microgrid systems, demonstrating its viability in grid-unstable regions.

These projects highlight HVO's role in addressing two critical challenges: energy security and carbon neutrality. As data centers face increasing uptime demands and grid instability in developing markets, HVO's long storage life and compatibility with hybrid systems make it a scalable solution.

Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

While feedstock supply constraints and infrastructure compatibility issues persist, technological advancements and policy support are mitigating these risks. For example, innovations in feedstock sourcing—such as using used cooking oil and tall oil—are reducing dependency on edible vegetable oils. Additionally, partnerships between data center operators and biofuel producers are streamlining supply chains and validating cost efficiencies.

Investment Opportunities: Biofuel Producers and Digital Infrastructure Players

The APAC HVO market offers dual investment avenues:

1. Biofuel Producers: Companies like Neste (NESTE.HEL), TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA), and Repsol (REP.MC) are expanding their HVO production in APAC, positioning themselves as key beneficiaries of the 10.17% CAGR.

2. Data Center Operators: Firms such as STT GDC and GDS Services are integrating HVO into their backup systems, enhancing their ESG profiles and operational resilience.

For investors, the focus should be on firms with strong partnerships in APAC and a clear roadmap for scaling biofuel infrastructure. Additionally, ETFs tracking renewable energy or green infrastructure in the region could provide diversified exposure.

Conclusion: A Cornerstone of the Green Digital Economy

The Asia-Pacific HVO for Data Center Backup Market is not just a niche segment but a cornerstone of the region's green digital infrastructure. With regulatory frameworks, corporate commitments, and technological integration aligning to drive adoption, HVO is poised to become the standard for backup power in a decarbonized future. For investors, this represents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on a market that is both scalable and mission-critical.

As the APAC data center market grows to meet AI-driven demand and global sustainability goals, HVO's role in ensuring reliable, low-carbon operations will only intensify.

KUCHING, Aug 25: Sarawak takes a unique approach to waste, materials or substances deemed no longer valid, by embracing the philosophy of ‘don’t waste the waste; monetise the waste’.

Speaking during the launching ceremony of the Centre for Technology Excellence Sarawak (CENTEXS) Lawas, streamed live with the Sarawak Public Communication Unit (UKAS) today, Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg used the example of oil palm kernel waste, which could be processed into livestock feed.

By doing so, he said, the kernel waste, together with Napier grass, would allow the State government to reduce its dependence on imported livestock feed.

This would produce more nutritious livestock feed, leading to healthier animals with greater weight gain, and since heavier animals have higher market value, this could bring greater profits to farmers.

At the same time, Abang Johari also said that biomass from palm oil waste could be made into biofuel, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“But to do so, we must have enough raw materials. That is why I have asked the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) to draft a law to mandate the collection of agricultural waste in the State.

“This is so that, in terms of volume, we can produce materials from waste to generate energy. Don’t waste the waste—monetise the waste,” he said.

Deputy Premier Datuk Amar Awang Tengah Ali Hasan; Sarawak Minister for Education, Innovation, and Talent Development Dato Sri Roland Sagah Wee Inn; Sarawak Deputy Minister for Food Industry, Commodities, and Regional Development Datuk Dr Abdul Rahman Ismail; and CENTEXS chairman Tan Sri Mohamad Morshidi Abdul Ghani were also present. — DayakDaily",https://i0.wp.com/dayakdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/premier-centexs-lawas-01.jpg?fit=800%2C533&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-25 06:56:24.451740

Suppliers remarked consistently in earnings reports on the lagging recovery of transient business travel from large corporates.
Accor CEO Sebastien Bazin predicted international business travel would remain 20 percent reduced forever—he later publicly acknowledged that prediction was shortsighted.
(The omicron variant swept across the globe in January and February put an additional damper on optimism for robust winter business travel.)","Restarting business travel post-pandemic wasn’t a straightforward exercise in 2022. Pent up leisure travel had rocketed out of the gate spiking prices for airfares and hotels. According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. domestic airfares hit their post-pandemic height in 2022 at about $415 on average for Q2, Q3 and Q4 after falling to pandemic-era lows of under $300. Hotels were way up as well. Average daily rates were more than $148, up more than 13 percent over previous record highs in 2019 and up more than 43 percent from pandemic lows.

Rising prices also were attached to labor shortages across airlines, hotels, travel management companies, restaurants and more. Associated with that were rising wages that pushed costs and pricing up. Inflation—especially with food and fuel—was reducing margins. Travel customers of all stripes bore the brunt of some of those costs.

For managed travel, in particular, dissatisfaction with travel management company partners was on the rise. TMCs had been gutted in terms of travel agent staffing, and it was not easy to win those employees back. Many had retired or moved to other industries. Adding to the difficulty in revving up agency engines was the fact that travel remained very complex in 2022, with one TMC industry leader estimating that 40 percent of itineraries required agent service in some respect as compared to 10 percent prior to the pandemic. Frustration levels were high on both sides, with agencies eking out margin on depressed volume with increased servicing requirements.

Indeed, corporates that had survived (and sometimes thrived) with drastically reduced business travel seemed hesitant to head full force back into the expense of travel. Suppliers remarked consistently in earnings reports on the lagging recovery of transient business travel from large corporates. Accor CEO Sebastien Bazin predicted international business travel would remain 20 percent reduced forever—he later publicly acknowledged that prediction was shortsighted. (The omicron variant swept across the globe in January and February put an additional damper on optimism for robust winter business travel.) But there were a couple of rising stars in that commentary as well, becoming especially apparent by the second quarter:

Groups & meetings—Companies couldn’t get enough of getting their people together in 2022. They concentrated on smaller events after Zoom fatigue and other impacts of an extended period of remote work had turned into feelings of worker isolation, collaboration gaps and, in many cases, loss of loyalty to the organization.

In addition to reimplementing traditional meetings, companies had become well aware of the “Great Resignation,” which had been building since March 2021 and was in full force in late 2021 and going into 2022. Businesses were working hard to reinforce their cultures even as many workers continued to demand the convenience of remote work from day to day. Getting teams and some larger corporate groups together at offsites created opportunities to reinforce corporate bonds through shared experiences. Meeting space and other offsite event spaces were in high demand, but companies still felt the sting of meetings cancellations from Covid. The result was drastically shortened planning times combined with market compression. That, of course, led to higher prices.

It should also be noted that while the idea of ‘hybrid’ events remained top of mind for companies and travel managers, the shine was coming off the concept as companies realized how expensive hybrid events could be. Planners reported it was like organizing two separate events. Technologies like Hopin—which had reached Unicorn status in the depths of the travel downturn—began losing value and laying off workers as an industry thirsty for in-person human interaction pushed for real face-time.

Small & Midsize Enterprise Business Travel—While large enterprises overall were holding back on traveling at 2019 volumes, the small and midsize business sector was leaning into full travel mode. Hotels and airlines alike reported the return of the SME sector to business travel en masse and many travel suppliers shifted their business travel focus to that sector, which in large part was—and still is—unmanaged. Travel management companies—including the megas—began making concerted moves to attract and serve that market as well. Loyalty programs were at the center of those efforts as travel suppliers looked to woo travelers themselves. Give it another year, and you’ll see new SME-focused business programs roll out from a number of major suppliers.

American Express Global Business Travel completed its acquisition of Egencia in November 2021 and through 2022 began reformulating its strategy around shifting the growing SME segment to managed channels. CTM continued its SME acquisitions in 2022, buying 1000 Mile, as specialist in the market, after taking over U.S. midmarket specialist Travel & Transport in 2021. Both Travel Perk and Navan (then still known as TripActions), whose business models had already attracted primarily SME customers, were making major acquisitions. After acquiring Reed & Mackay in 2021, Navan went on a European tour picking up TMCs in Sweden and Germany in 2022 and launched its ToGo platform with Lufthansa. The TMC attracted a $300 million investment and filed initial paperwork to public, but held back on the latter. TravelPerk, after acquiring NexTravel and Click Travel in 2021, raised another $115 million and increased its valuation to $1 billion.

Sustainability

In the industry push to return to full travel volumes, the simultaneous rise of sustainability efforts in organizations across the gamut made for an odd bedfellow. Travel suppliers—particularly airlines—were at the center of the sustainability dialog and it’s hard to overstate the unprecedented number of announcements coming from the travel industry in 2022 about their sustainability efforts.

Hertz was among the most dramatic, investing in a huge purchase of electric vehicles and pledging to support the development of a cross-continent charging grid. The car rental company announced at the tail end of 2021 that it had made a deal to buy 100,000 Telsas to add to its fleet. It would take that delivery over time, and by 2024 EVs would make up 20 percent of its fleet. The company said it would make a huge investment in the U.S. charging grid as well. Within a couple of years, however, the deals would languish and Hertz would announce fleet sell-offs for its EVs.

Airlines were pledging to buy sustainable aviation fuel at outstanding rates; they were investing in refineries and working up schemes to ensure corporate clients were able to buy into shared purchases. On the other hand, companies like Shell, Accenture and Amex GBT were looking for ways to certify and track those SAF purchases to ensure that purchases were credited to the buying companies, but also by design aggregating corporate customer demand and allowing airlines to access that demand in one place.

Indeed, TMCs made themselves central to the sustainability efforts of their clients. In a depressed travel volume environment, focusing on carbon emissions data, reporting and consultation was one way TMCs could produce another revenue stream, but also clients were clamoring for the data. The European Union spent 2022 passing the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which eventually would require businesses of a certain size to offer a numeric value for carbon emissions, specifically for business travel. As a result, the industry reacted with a flurry of partnerships with the likes of Thrust Carbon, Chooose and Squake for carbon calculation capabilities. How that number might then inform programs that would reduce carbon emissions would be the next step—some companies made huge strides toward mitigating carbon emissions associated with travel. To date, those reductions have been tied to reduced travel and/or changing travel modalities from air to rail, particularly in Europe.

In the U.S., at least, the Biden Administration had baked sustainability initiatives and incentives into both its Inflation Reduction Act and its infrastructure bill that laid down foundational plans for an EV charging grid, enhanced rail services and other large-scale projects as well as incentives for states, businesses and individuals to make their own investments to reduce climate change. Politically and practically, such moves became untenable in the U.S. when Donald Trump was elected back into office and stopped many of the initiatives that Biden put in motion—at which points corporations themselves became quieter about what green initiatives they might be funding or participating in. The EU, for its part, also pushed back the dates for companies to begin reporting their carbon emissions.

Technology & Distribution

New Distribution Capability announcements continued to trickle down the pike in 2022, but none were as breathtaking as American Airlines’ December announcement that it would remove 40 percent of its inventory from EDIFACT channels by April 1, 2023, and that agencies would be required either to connect with the airline directly or consume, display and enable purchasing via New Distribution Capability content by that date or risk losing access to the content.

The response to the announcement varied from agency to agency. For many, however, it meant taking their focus off improving call center technologies and agent servicing levels and shifting those resources to solving for a looming NDC cutover on April 1. The move engendered resentment from agencies, and when American made good on its promise come April, the industry response was negative overall.

Despite understanding American’s desire to reduce distribution costs and increase control over retailing—and admitting that the hardline stance would force the industry to advance—agencies were critical of the carrier’s lack of specific guidance on its requirements for agencies to retain their “preferred” status and what that status delivered. While many agencies were able to offer booking for NDC content, most were unable to service that content on the launch date. Buyers responded by pushing travelers to other airlines, a move that ultimately would punish the carrier significantly in terms of earnings. American in 2023 would make more changes to its approach to corporate clients—many of which would not go well.

Also, in November 2022, openAI would launch ChatGPT. BTN did not report on it at the time, but its availability and the launch of additional large language model artificial intelligence would change the trajectory of business travel’s future.

Amid this uncertainty, Lufthansa Group has emerged as a standout player, leveraging strategic operational reforms, fleet modernization, and a keen understanding of macroeconomic tailwinds to position itself for long-term resilience. For investors, the airline's 2023 recovery and 2024–2025 strategic initiatives present a compelling case for a recovery play in a sector poised for renewed growth.

Operational Turnaround: A Foundation for Sustainable Growth

Lufthansa's 2023 performance underscored its ability to adapt to post-pandemic dynamics. The airline expanded capacity by 16% year-on-year, reaching 84% of 2019 levels, while achieving a 15% revenue increase to €35.4 billion. Adjusted EBIT surged 76% to €2.68 billion, driven by robust MRO segment growth and improved unit revenues. This turnaround was not merely a function of demand recovery but a result of disciplined cost management and operational efficiency.

The airline's 2024–2025 strategies further reinforce this momentum. A focus on reducing fixed costs, streamlining fleet complexity, and enhancing customer-centric services has created a more agile business model. For instance, Lufthansa's shift to a point-to-point model via Lufthansa City Airlines at Frankfurt and Munich hubs has improved route profitability while catering to leisure travelers—a segment showing sustained demand.

Fleet Modernization: Fuel Efficiency and Environmental Leadership

A cornerstone of Lufthansa's strategy is its systematic fleet renewal. Since 2022, the airline has integrated fuel-efficient aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 into its long-haul operations, replacing older models. These aircraft reduce fuel consumption by up to 25% compared to their predecessors, directly lowering operating costs and carbon emissions. By 2025, the A350 and 787 are expected to account for 30% of the long-haul fleet, a move that aligns with both economic and environmental priorities.

Lufthansa's commitment to sustainability extends beyond hardware. The airline has set science-based targets to reduce net carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 (vs. 2019 levels) and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Initiatives like the “R strategies” (reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, replace) and the introduction of Green Fares—allowing passengers to offset emissions via sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchases—position Lufthansa as a leader in the industry's decarbonization efforts.

Macroeconomic Tailwinds: Fuel Prices, Demand, and Regulatory Shifts

The European aviation sector is benefiting from favorable macroeconomic conditions. Jet fuel prices, a critical cost driver, have declined by 13% in 2025 compared to 2024, averaging $86 per barrel. This reduction, coupled with improved load factors (projected at 84% in 2025), has bolstered profit margins. For Lufthansa, fuel now accounts for 25.8% of operating costs, down from 26.4% in 2024—a modest but meaningful improvement.

Regulatory trends, however, present both challenges and opportunities. The EU's mandate for 2% SAF blending by 2025 has increased compliance costs, with suppliers charging “compliance fees” to cover potential expenses. While this adds short-term pressure, Lufthansa's early investments in SAF partnerships and its MRO segment's expertise in sustainable technologies position it to navigate these hurdles. The airline's ability to balance regulatory compliance with cost efficiency will be critical in maintaining its competitive edge.

Strategic Positioning in a Fragmented Market

Lufthansa's multi-airline model—comprising Lufthansa Airlines, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings—allows it to target diverse market segments. Premium carriers like Lufthansa and SWISS focus on high-frequency, high-yield routes, while Eurowings' low-cost model addresses price-sensitive travelers. This diversification mitigates risks from sector-specific downturns and enhances overall resilience.

Moreover, Lufthansa's joint ventures with United Airlines, Air Canada, and ANA have expanded its global reach, particularly in Asia—a region expected to drive 40% of global air travel growth by 2030. These partnerships not only enhance connectivity but also provide access to high-growth markets, reinforcing Lufthansa's long-term value proposition.

Investment Thesis: A Recovery Play with Long-Term Potential

For investors, Lufthansa represents a unique opportunity at the intersection of cyclical recovery and structural transformation. The airline's 2023 financials—€1.67 billion net income and a 7.6% EBIT margin—demonstrate its ability to generate returns even in a volatile environment. Its 2025 Q1 results further validate this trend, with adjusted EBIT improving to -€722 million (from -€849 million in 2024) and net debt declining to €5.3 billion.

While challenges remain—such as supply chain bottlenecks and the high cost of SAF—Lufthansa's proactive strategies, including fleet modernization and digital innovation, provide a buffer against headwinds. The airline's focus on customer experience (e.g., Lufthansa Group Travel ID for personalized services) and operational efficiency (e.g., automation of flight irregularity management) also enhance its ability to retain market share.

Conclusion: A Resilient Aviation Leader

Lufthansa's strategic resilience lies in its ability to adapt to macroeconomic shifts while maintaining a long-term vision for sustainability and profitability. As European aviation recovers and demand for air travel continues to grow, the airline's operational discipline, technological investments, and regulatory foresight position it as a prime candidate for sustained outperformance. For investors seeking exposure to a sector poised for growth, Lufthansa offers a compelling case—a recovery play with the potential to deliver both near-term returns and long-term value.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-25 06:56:32.005231

Syngas-based FT CANS technology can play a key role in realising this ambition.","Relying on a single feedstock for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is not a realistic option. The amount of SAF needed for the aviation sector to meet the growing number of mandates and targets globally will require contributions from all feedstocks and multiple process routes. To date, the focus has been on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from used cooking oil. However, the availability of this feedstock is limited, with around 80% of that used in the EU being imported.

Although regions such as the US, Europe, and the UK have led the way with mandates and incentives for SAF production, attracting feedstocks from around the world, this reliance on imports poses a significant threat to meeting SAF targets, especially as other regions inevitably set their own goals. Relying too heavily on HEFA and imported feedstocks is not a long-term solution.

Diversification of feedstocks is vital for resilience

Feedstock diversification is essential for building resilience within the biofuels industry. Relying on a single type of feedstock may leave fuel suppliers vulnerable to market volatility and supply chain disruptions in an emerging market. Fuel suppliers, who are the obligated parties under mandates in the EU and UK, are expected to meet SAF targets in multiple regions, including the USA, Japan and a growing list of others. By incorporating a variety of feedstocks, both fuel suppliers and countries can take greater control of their own supply and ensure access to SAF from domestic feedstocks.

Unlocking SAF at scale through feedstock diversity

The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, based on a syngas platform, is an ASTM-approved route for producing synthetic SAF blendstocks. Syngas is a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) and the FT process builds the hydrocarbon chains needed for SAF. Syngas can be produced from a huge range of feedstocks, such as municipal solid waste (MSW), waste biomass, and captured carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (when combined with H2). Companies such as Johnson Matthey (JM) are leading the way in delivering syngas technology and the leveraging the versatility provided by the FT route to enable scalable SAF production.

FT CANS: A step-change in Fischer Tropsch technology

The FT CANS, the technology developed by Johnson Matthey and bp, marks a significant advancement in FT technology. The combination of reactor design and innovative catalyst offers several technical benefits that enhance the efficiency and scalability of the FT process:

The FT CANS technology utilises a modular reactor design that reduces the amount of catalyst required, lowering capital costs by approximately 50% compared with traditional fixed-bed FT systems. The modularity also allows for easy scalability, enabling plant sizes to match available feedstock quantities. Our largest announced project to date is expected to deliver a capacity of 13,000 barrels per day when operational.

Heat management is critical in the highly exothermic FT process. The FT CANS reactor features a unique configuration that improves heat transfer and control. As a result, the system boasts high conversion rates, with CO conversion efficiencies exceeding 90%. This is achieved via an innovative radial flow design that maximises contact between syngas and catalyst, facilitating efficient mass transfer and boosting productivity and selectivity towards desired hydrocarbon products.

Conclusion

Processing eligible feedstocks for SAF production not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also yields economic benefits. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the use of SAF can reduce net carbon emissions by over 80% across its life cycle compared with fossil-derived jet fuel.

Adopting a diverse range of feedstocks for fuel production offers a long-term solution for creating synthetic fuels and meeting the increasing SAF targets worldwide.

Overall, harnessing feedstock diversity is a critical enabler for producing synthetic fuels at scale. Syngas-based FT CANS technology can play a key role in realising this ambition. As the industry evolves, collaboration between governments, industry stakeholders, and research institutions will be vital to unlock the full potential of feedstock diversity for SAF.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/syjnmhg5/paul-ticehurst.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134005831265130000,N,,2025-08-25 06:56:35.627287

Keunggulan lain terletak pada titik beku (freezing point) yang lebih rendah dari spesifikasi internasional. Menurut Taufik, standar internasional menetapkan titik beku avtur di minus 47 derajat celsius, sedangkan PertaminaSAF bisa lebih rendah dari angka tersebut.

“PertaminaSAF tidak akan membeku di kondisi ekstrem, sehingga aman digunakan selama penerbangan,” katanya.

Ke depan, produksi bioavtur ini juga akan diuji di Kilang Dumai dan Kilang Balongan. Taufik optimistis PertaminaSAF akan digunakan secara luas di dunia penerbangan, baik domestik maupun internasional.

Pengembangan PertaminaSAF merupakan hasil sinergi tiga perusahaan di bawah Pertamina. KPI berperan sebagai produsen, Pertamina Patra Niaga menyiapkan stok minyak jelantah sekaligus memasarkan produk, sementara Pelita Air Services menjadi pengguna langsung bahan bakar tersebut.

“This multinational is enticed by the constantly growing flights of ultra fast fashion players.","Lufthansa Cargo, the European leader in air freight and the freight division of Lufthansa Group, has committed to ensuring the international delivery of ultra fast fashion brand Shein’s items, by progressively using sustainable aviation fuel.

This agreement illustrates the paradox between political regulation and economic interests. It has already drawn criticism from the Fédération Française du Prêt à Porter Féminin (FFPAPF).

A memorandum of understanding (MoU), signed on August 19, 2025, indicates that within the next six months, the two partners must define and implement concrete actions.

Supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a fuel produced from renewable raw materials (used oils, agricultural residues, waste, biomass, or even e-fuels based on green hydrogen and captured CO₂).

Strengthening the traceability of operational and environmental data. The stated objective is to provide transparency on the environmental and logistical impact of air transport for Shein’s items.

Political will and economic stakes

This agreement, as the press release states, “establishes Lufthansa Cargo as a central player in the logistics of Shein’s items”. However, on January 29, 2025, the German government officially announced a comprehensive action plan to regulate online commerce, aligning with the action taken by the European Commission.

The paradox lies in the gap between the stated political objective of regulating ultra fast fashion players and the economic realities of large groups that rely on these same platforms to develop their business.

Beyond freight transport, the group carried over 130 million passengers in 2024 (source: Lufthansa Group’s 2024 annual report).

Greenwashing according to the Fédération Française du Prêt à Porter Féminin

“We are witnessing the worst kind of hypocrisy: how does transporting polyester and disposable products with kerosene that consumes less CO₂ make them more ecological?” Yann Rivoallan, an outspoken critic of ultra fast fashion and president of the FFPAPF, told FashionUnited. “It is, pardon my French, ‘putting lipstick on a pig’”.

“This multinational is enticed by the constantly growing flights of ultra fast fashion players. To give themselves a clear conscience or to meet certain standards, they dare to use the weapon of greenwashing.

There are three main ways of meeting the EU RFNBO targets: e-fuel use in the transport sector, green hydrogen use in fuel-cell vehicles and green hydrogen use in the refining process.
The European Commission launched its European Hydrogen Bank in 2023 to support domestic production of green hydrogen.
By producing their own green hydrogen, refiners can guarantee offtake and overcome a significant challenge facing many other project developers.
This is critical to low-carbon hydrogen demand growth, but it depends on the provision of national subsidies for green hydrogen development.","Low-carbon hydrogen has gained momentum over the past decade, driven by climate targets and supportive policy frameworks. Project development is stalling, however, as buyers baulk at stubbornly high costs and expensive long-term supply agreements.

Somewhat ironically, European oil refining could hold the key to unlocking demand growth. Even as growth in electric vehicles across the continent continues to erode road-transport fuel demand, European Union (EU) regulations are forcing the bloc’s beleaguered refiners to decarbonise faster than anywhere else.

Low-carbon hydrogen also offers help to the hard-to-decarbonise marine and aviation sectors. Electrolytic green hydrogen’s ability to deliver almost carbon-free hydrogen through renewables means that EU regulations – and subsidies – broadly favour it over blue hydrogen, which uses carbon capture and storage to cut emissions from fossil-fuel feedstocks.

Consequently, European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation. Numerous green hydrogen projects have already targeted the sector. Of the 6 Mtpa of low-carbon hydrogen capacity that has taken a final investment decision (FID), European refineries have already committed more than US$5 billion of capital.

The investment case for these projects has been boosted significantly by the latest revision of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), which is helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally. Other EU policies to speed up the decarbonisation of the maritime and aviation sectors pave the way for sustained future demand growth.

Current policy will only take the sector so far, however. The cost of green hydrogen production must continue to fall, while regulation will need to go even further to fully kick-start demand. If these hurdles can be overcome, European refiners could play a critical role in scaling up the green hydrogen industry.

This comes at a cost, however. European refiners have been part of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for more than a decade and are charged for the CO2 they emit beyond a certain free allowance. This allowance will gradually be eliminated over time, raising the cost for refiners. Producing green hydrogen on site using renewable-powered electrolysis would eliminate many of those CO2 emissions and, hence, emission-related carbon costs.

The rising burden of emissions costs has promoted energy-efficiency initiatives and made the idea of producing on-site green hydrogen more appealing. However, high European electricity costs have stymied this to some extent. So, to promote the broader adoption of green hydrogen, governments must consider bold policy initiatives and incentives , such as investment subsidies and favourable financing.

The EU policy solution

The EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED) aims to drive reductions in the energy sector’s carbon emissions by increasing the contribution of renewable sources. The latest iteration, RED III, provides essential support for green hydrogen adoption , as it seeks to promote ‘renewable fuels of non-biological origin’ (RFNBOs) ‒ that is, liquid or gaseous fuels that derive no energy content from biomass. Green hydrogen is deemed an RFNBO if it meets strict EU sustainability and traceability criteria.

There are three main ways of meeting the EU RFNBO targets: e-fuel use in the transport sector, green hydrogen use in fuel-cell vehicles and green hydrogen use in the refining process. The EU uses “multipliers” in its RED III accounting methodology. The actual RFNBO content is accounted for at higher levels, promoting use in those sectors with the highest multipliers, such as e-fuels for aviation and maritime, followed by refining. Because of the high cost of e-fuels and limited uptake of fuel-cell vehicles, the refining route is currently the most suitable and achievable means of compliance.

We forecast European refiners will require around 0.5 million tonnes per year (Mtpa) of green hydrogen to comply with regulations. This would replace about 30% of Europe’s current refinery-based, CO2-emitting, purposely produced hydrogen – at a substantial investment of more than US$15 billion for the green hydrogen production capacity.

On paper, RED III bodes well for green hydrogen’s near-term growth in the European refining sector, at least once adopted into national legislation by the 27 EU member states. But much more is still required. RED III requires that RFNBOs account for only a minimum of 1% of the energy used by the transport sector by 2030. This share, low by any measure, is in large part an acknowledgement of the challenges involved in expanding RFNBO supply.

Locking in significant longer-term growth will require further action in three key areas: costs, technology and the wider regulatory environment.

Tackling costs to secure offtakers

The major hurdle for European refiners is the cost of producing green hydrogen , which remains significantly higher than for traditional hydrogen production units. Renewable electricity sourcing is the overwhelming driver of these high costs, though the levelised cost of renewable electricity in Europe is forecast to decline one-fifth by the end of this decade. Automated manufacturing, standardisation and efficiency improvements will also help drive cost reductions for electrolyser stacks.

Accessing low-cost renewables and operating electrolysers at high utilisation levels are essential, with the latest market signals offering encouraging signs. The European Commission launched its European Hydrogen Bank in 2023 to support domestic production of green hydrogen. The most recent auction results reveal how costs have changed since the pilot auction was awarded in 2024.

The average levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) across all bids from the second-round auction, which closed in February 2025, fell 18% to US$8.35/kgH2, with average bids in Germany falling more than 55%. The results also provide offtake prices that each end-use sector is willing to pay. Here, refineries were among the highest, at a weighted average of US$9.23/kgH2, demonstrating a willingness to pay a premium to meet regulatory mandates. Wood Mackenzie’s asset-level modelling of projects targeting the refining sector in Europe produces an LCOH of US$7.04 to US$8.30/kg – reinforcing the progress in this sector.

Cost reductions also hinge on ongoing project deployment, which should enable improvements in project delivery and operation. Critically, many European refiners are now looking to produce green hydrogen on site to decarbonise their refinery operations and supply fuels compliant with RED III. By producing their own green hydrogen, refiners can guarantee offtake and overcome a significant challenge facing many other project developers.

Technology risks and competing technologies

Developers continue to wrestle with contingency costs for these first-of-a-kind projects, with lenders, in turn, applying a risk premium. Reducing premiums relies on successful technology deployment and the developers’ ability to demonstrate timely commissioning and operational reliability. Accelerating the deployment of such capital-intensive technology is difficult, illustrating why government support is so essential early on.

Chinese-made electrolysers are competing with Western technology. Yet, to date, post-FID European projects have opted for Western electrolysers. Others, however, are weighing up the benefits of the upfront capital cost savings offered by Chinese alkaline electrolysers. Electrolyser manufacturers face stiff competition, which promises lower project costs, but it’s piling the financial pressure on many of them, with some already failing.

Green hydrogen is not the only route open to refiners, though, and alternative paths to decarbonisation are gaining traction. Carbon capture and storage will be more suitable for some. This can help to manage emissions across the broader refinery complex. It can also support a switch to blue hydrogen, although for European refiners, this will not directly contribute to their RED III targets.

Policy and regulatory uncertainty

The EU’s RED III legislation is an important part of the push to grow the green hydrogen economy in Europe, with both Repsol and TotalEnergies confirming in recent earnings calls that green hydrogen is the most competitive route to regulatory compliance. Member states have been slow to convert the ambition of RED III into national law, however, which has slowed green hydrogen project development across most of the EU. As of August 2025, national legislative adoption was as follows:

Figure 3: EU countries are dragging their heels on adopting RED III

The potential for green hydrogen to help cut emissions from refining while complying with RED III obligations is the strongest investment case at present, but green hydrogen can also deliver lower-carbon fuels to other transport sectors. Marine and aviation are already starting to make progress.

Decarbonising the maritime sector

The marine sector flies the flag for green hydrogen project development , though policy support, as ever, is required. Europe’s FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the imposition of carbon costs on shippers have helped to drive interest, with the added benefit of the multiplier for RFNBO-compliant hydrogen and its derivatives in the marine sector to meet RED III transport targets. Europe has also carved out €800 million from its latest Hydrogen Bank auction to support maritime supply projects.

The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework, published in April 2025, broadens interest globally. It introduces global greenhouse gas fuel intensity targets and a credit-trading system, with a fund potentially unlocking more than 80 Mtpa of hydrogen-derived fuels in the long term. However, under the current IMO pricing mechanism, it will take time for hydrogen-based fuels to be competitive with incumbent fuels, and further penalties or rewards will be required to displace fuel oil more quickly.

Project developers

Faced with high costs and uncertain market conditions, several major low-carbon hydrogen developers have scaled back their ambitions for the industry. This reflects a broader trend of project developers becoming more selective, prioritising capital efficiency and risk mitigation over expansive hydrogen portfolios.

At the same time, Shell, BP and TotalEnergies have all reaffirmed their commitment to decarbonising their European refining operations with green hydrogen. Companies must continue to pursue cost reductions, maximise capture of available government incentives and capitalise on future demand growth opportunities in fuel supply to the marine and aviation sectors.

Governments

The EU’s RED III regulation supporting green hydrogen use in the refining sector has led the way in terms of public-sector incentives. This is critical to low-carbon hydrogen demand growth, but it depends on the provision of national subsidies for green hydrogen development. To secure future growth, the EU must double down on its efforts to drive the sector and push member states to codify support into domestic laws and regulations . Pressure on national government budgets from rising defence spending and higher welfare and health costs risks a curtailment of subsidies to the low-carbon economy. Reaffirming commitment to these sectors will spur continued investment.

Markets

Europe has been the standard bearer to date, but other markets will need to lock in green hydrogen demand growth to help decarbonise liquid transport fuels. Wider refinery adoption needs three things to happen: lower renewable power prices, the imposition of a cost on carbon emissions and credits for the lower carbon intensity of greener products. To date, few markets outside Europe fit the bill.

Adoption in China is largely driven by government mandate and often lacks full green credentials. Low industrial power prices and competitive domestic electrolyser costs, however, are also helping to close the gap on hydrogen from reformed imported natural gas.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SEE-5-e1753113319320.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 06:56:56.979720

Tanner was interviewed by the Time On The Wing podcast just before his promotion and explained why he believes that not only does the ultra-low-cost-carrier (ULCC) model not apply to Flair but it doesn’t work in the North American market.

Flair was founded in 2005 and has been rapidly growing thanks to affordable airfares and reliable service. Tanner previously served as the vice president of revenue management and network planning and before that he was the director of network planning and scheduling.

More Than The Bare Essentials

Tanner specifically pointed our how Flair’s aircraft have the same number of seats as WestJet and its baggage policies are akin to that of Porter Airlines during his interview on the podcast that was produced with Visual Approach Analytics. WestJet has even launched a new airfare category dubbed “Ultra Basic” to compete with Flair’s prices.

One factor that Tanner hits on repeatedly in his explanation of the Flair model is the competition in Canada, and North America, that is much fiercer than what European ULCC’s like Ryanair face. That competition drives the quality of service up and makes the experience better for customers than the bare-bones flying style of Spirit, Frontier, Allegiant, Avelo, and others.

Flair no longer brand’s itself as a ULCC but it remains the low-cost leader for Canadian flyers. As Tanner remarked in one Linkedin post:

“As Canada’s only affordable airline left, Flair Airlines plays an essential role in keeping air travel affordable. We are excited to work with stakeholders across the industry to lower prices for our shared customers.”

Flair Airlines Pushing FWD

The services and amenities are certainly more spartan than Air Canada but for many travelers the price point is the only point of concern. Frugal Canadian flyers don’t need to worry about service disruptions thanks to the carrier’s excellent performance and policies. Flair is the only airline with an On-Time Guarantee (OTG) that compensates passengers if they arrive late by more than 60 minutes.

In April of 2025, Flair also launched the FWD platform as a comprehensive customer service portal with services like “Immfly” in-seat ordering for food and drinks and “iCoupon” meal credit redemption. Tanner also stated in his recent interview that the buy-onboard, duty-free shopping experience is comparable to waht Air Canada offers.

Growth is happening at the airline thanks to its popularity with suctomers. Other newly appointed leadership at Flair includes Caitlin Peddle as Chief People Officer (CPO) and Juliana Ramirez as Chief Digital Officer (CDO). All of the new executives are internal promotions, chosen for their record of contribution to the Flair’s success.

Speaking with Davide Bassano, Head of Sustainability at Gruppo SAVE Group, one thing is immediately clear: they are treating the climate crisis not just as a technical challenge, but as an operational, environmental and human one.

Ambitious energy goals: agrivoltaics and hydrogen integration

The group has committed to achieving net zero by 2030 – a highly ambitious timeline – and it’s backing that pledge with action. “We fixed the target to be net zero within 2030, so it’s a very short time,” said Davide. “In the next master plan, we’ve already planned to dismiss any fossil fuel and to provide all energy demands of the airport with renewable power sources.”

One of the most innovative parts of this plan is a 68 MW agrivoltaic system – solar panels installed above land still usable for agriculture. “It seems quite smart, actually, because we don’t deplete any environmental value of the ground and at the same time we match the energy demands of the airport,” he explained. The project is currently undergoing environmental ministry approval.

The airport is also integrating hydrogen production on-site. Using surplus renewable energy, SAVE plans to power airport vehicles and local public transport. “Our idea is to make any connection with the airport provided by the local transportation company green,” said Davide.

Hydrogen drones and the future of airside logistics

SAVE Group is exploring the use of hydrogen-powered drones to deliver urgent medical supplies from Padua Airport to regional hospitals. These drones offer longer range and lighter weight than their battery-powered counterparts, and the hydrogen will be produced using solar-powered electrolysis.

But the main challenge isn’t the drone, the vertiport, or the electrolyser – it’s the regulatory framework. “We are dealing with urban traffic over the city centre and there are a lot of rules still missing,” said Davide. The goal is to conduct the first prototype flights in late 2026.

Biodiversity: where falcons and flamingos coexist with aircraft

Two new falcons have recently joined the staff at Venice Airport for deterrent action and removal of flocks of birds. So why do they use real birds instead of technology?

“It seems from the medieval age, but in fact they are very effective,” said Davide. “The use of falcon is very selective… they recognise the species, they act, and the result is the storm of birds around understand immediately that it is a forbidden area. There are other methods like the small guns, sirens or acoustic devices, but they are very disturbing for the rest of the biodiversity.”

What’s even more surprising is that some protected bird species are choosing the airport grounds as a rest and breeding area to get away from the urban activity of the city. “Once they have learned not to interfere with the airport operations they have their own area, and they rest, they reproduce… and it doesn’t seem to affect the safety of the operation. It reverts the paradox that the airport is a noisy, polluted area,” said Davide.

Climate adaptation: it’s about infrastructure – and people

One of the most forward-thinking elements of SAVE’s strategy is its recognition that climate change impacts human performance, not just infrastructure. In a 2024 assessment, they evaluated how extreme heat affects airport workers, particularly those on the apron. Airport workers were included as an “asset” in the assessment.

“If you need to work for eight hours in a terminal with 45 degrees, it’s quite heavy for our staff,” said Davide. The airport has introduced hydration stations, rest areas, and is researching protective uniforms, such as glasses and new types of hats.

We realised it’s important to also consider the human capital, the worker, and if their performance decreases because of climate change

They have also begun integrating occupational health and safety into their climate risk assessments. “We realised it’s important to also consider the human capital, the worker, and if their performance decreases because of climate change,” Davide said, noting that 40% of their operations rely on short turnaround times from local carriers.

AI and Scope 3: 30% energy savings already

To reduce Scope 3 emissions, Venice Airport is using an AI-powered terminal climate control system that anticipates passenger flows and adjusts temperatures accordingly. “We try to set the proper temperature using the forecast of people in the area,” said Davide. Since its implementation in late 2023, the system has saved almost 30% in energy. It’s now being rolled out at Verona Airport too.

Circular economy: incentivising better waste sorting

SAVE is promoting a circular economy through both infrastructure and behavioural nudges. A new pneumatic waste collection and sorting system has been deployed across its airports, and they have also started charging tenants based on the volume and type of waste they generate. “We count the number of the bins, and we invoice the service,” said Davide. “When you touch the pockets, you get immediate results!”

A holistic sustainability ethos

From smart infrastructure to sustainable transport, from protecting biodiversity to supporting the wellbeing of apron workers, Venice Airport’s strategy goes well beyond carbon calculations.

For sustainability professionals in airports worldwide, Gruppo Save’s approach is a powerful reminder: the future of aviation isn’t just electric or hydrogen – it’s integrated, humane and boldly inventive.

À ce jour, seuls 74 des 636 aéroports engagés dans le programme ont atteint ce niveau d’accréditation à l’échelle mondiale. Nous publions ci-dessous le communiqué (Photo : rb/www.imazpress.com)

L’aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros est le sixième en France et le deuxième dans la zone Afrique.

L’aéroport s’était engagé dans le programme ACA en 2018, obtenu l’accréditation de niveau 2 en 2019 et l’accréditation de niveau 3 l’année suivante. En 2023, la Société Aéroportuaire avait déjà réduit de moitié ses émissions (en tonnes équivalent carbone) par rapport à 2014, dans le périmètre de ses activités et de sa consommation d’électricité.

L’accréditation de niveau 4+ consacre le franchissement d’une nouvelle étape. L’aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros s’engage désormais dans une stratégie de décarbonation à long terme, conforme à l’Accord de Paris, en impliquant les partenaires de la plateforme sur la même voie. Un périmètre beaucoup plus large d’émissions est pris en compte, incluant la moitié de la consommation de carburants des avions desservant l'aéroport. La réduction des émissions générées par le trafic aérien exigera donc des efforts considérables.

L’ACA 4+ distingue les aéroports de niveau 4 qui, de plus, compensent leurs émissions résiduelles des scopes 1 et 2 en achetant des crédits carbones. L’Aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros a fait ce choix : pour compenser ses émissions, évaluées à 2.830 tonnes d’équivalent CO2 en 2024, il soutient un projet de réduction de consommation de bois de cuisson à Madagascar et un projet de reboisement pérenne en Ouganda. Plus de 50.000 euros ont été investis en 2025 dans ces deux opérations.

L’accréditation ACA 4+ n’est qu’une étape supplémentaire sur la voie de la décarbonation du transport aérien, à laquelle contribue l’Aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros. Elle consacre des efforts engagés depuis plus de dix ans par la Société Aéroportuaire pour réduire son empreinte environnementale, maîtriser ses consommations énergétiques et se doter de centrales photovoltaïques qui répondent aujourd’hui à près de 30 % de ses besoins.

La décarbonation de l’aviation est un défi forcément collectif, qui concerne en premier lieu les compagnies aériennes et les avionneurs. Les appareils devront être en mesure d’incorporer une part croissante de carburant durable (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF) dans le kérosène afin de tenir les objectifs fixés par l’Union européenne. L’aéroport La Réunion Roland Garros se prépare pour sa part à adapter ses installations de stockage de carburant de manière à pouvoir distribuer du SAF aux compagnies aériennes dès 2030.",https://imazpress.com/thumbs/1200x630/source/0942162001710496855.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 03:56:52.778195

Cette entente illustre le paradoxe entre régulation politique et intérêts économiques et suscite déjà les critiques de la Fédération Française du Prêt à Porter Féminin (FFFPAPF).

Un protocole d’accord (MoU - Memorandum of Understanding), signé le 19 août 2025, indique que, dans les six prochains mois, les deux partenaires doivent définir et mettre en œuvre des actions concrètes :

Approvisionnement en SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), carburant produit à partir de matières premières renouvelables (huiles usagées, résidus agricoles, déchets, biomasse, voire e-fuels à base d’hydrogène vert et de CO₂ capté).

Prise en compte officielle des volumes de carburant d’aviation durable consommés, certifiés par des « Proof of Sustainability ». Ces certificats sont basés sur des normes permettant de tracer et de documenter la réduction des émissions obtenues par rapport au kérosène conventionnel.

Renforcement de la traçabilité des données opérationnelles et environnementales, l’objectif annoncé étant de faire la transparence sur l’impact environnemental et logistique du transport aérien des articles Shein.

Quand volonté politique et enjeux économiques ne vont pas de pair

Cet accord, comme l’indique le communiqué, « inscrit Lufthansa Cargo comme acteur central dans la logistique des articles Shein ». Or, le 29 janvier 2025, le gouvernement allemand a officialisé un plan d’action complet pour encadrer le commerce en ligne et s’inscrit dans l’action menée par la Commission européenne.

Le paradoxe ? L’écart entre l’objectif politique affirmé de réguler les acteurs de l’ultra fashion et les réalités économiques des grands groupes qui s’appuient sur ces mêmes plateformes pour développer leur activité.

Du greenwashing selon la Fédération Française du Prêt à Porter Féminin

« On assiste au pire de l’hypocrisie : en quoi transporter des produits en polyester et jetables avec un kérosène moins consommateur de CO2 les rendrait -il plus écologiques ?, confie Yann Rivoallan, ardent détracteur de l’ultra fast fashion et président de la FFPAPF, au micro de FashionUnited. C’est, pardonnez-moi l’expression, « peinture sur merde » ».

« Cette multinationale est alléchée par les vols en croissance constante des acteurs de l’ultra fast fashion et, pour se donner bonne conscience ou rentrer dans certaines normes, elle ose utiliser l’arme du greenwashing.

Our recent additions such as Da Nang and Chiang Mai, along with increased frequencies to key Australasia cities reflect our proactive approach to capturing leisure, business, and diaspora-driven travel.

Nepal remains a strategically important market for Malaysia Airlines, and we are committed to supporting its growing demand for regional and long-haul connectivity

On the product front, we continue to invest in fleet modernisation, enhanced in-flight services, and a revamped digital experience. The launch of MHconnect, offering complimentary Wi-Fi across all cabins from 2025, and our push towards AI-driven personalisation are examples of how we’re evolving with customer expectations. What truly sets us apart, however, is our unwavering commitment to Malaysian Hospitality—our brand promise that embodies warmth, professionalism, and attentiveness at every touchpoint of the journey.

By staying agile, delivering customer-centric value, and forging strong partnerships across the region, Malaysia Airlines is well-positioned to compete and grow sustainably within Southeast Asia’s fast-evolving aviation landscape.

Given the rapid rise of low-cost carriers in the region, how does Malaysia Airlines balance its premium-service heritage with more budget-oriented offerings?

Malaysia Airlines recognises the diverse needs of travellers in this region, and our approach is to offer choice and flexibility while staying true to our premium service heritage. We’ve introduced a range of fare families, from Value and Basic options designed for simpler travel needs, to Flex and Business Class for those seeking added comfort, baggage allowance, lounge access, and schedule flexibility. This allows us to compete effectively across different segments without diluting the core of what makes us unique—Malaysian Hospitality and full-service reliability.

Additionally, as a member of the oneworld alliance, we offer customers access to a global network of over 900 destinations, frequent flyer benefits, and smoother connections—particularly for long-haul and corporate travellers seeking a premium, consistent experience across partner airlines. Within the Malaysia Aviation Group, our sister airline Firefly helps us serve niche and regional markets, enabling greater connectivity while maintaining distinct customer propositions.

Ultimately, our goal is to deliver value across all fare tiers by offering smart pricing options, service excellence, and seamless global connectivity.

How do you assess the current state and growth potential of Nepal’s aviation market?

Nepal’s aviation market holds significant growth potential, driven by a combination of rising outbound travel demand, growing tourism interest, and infrastructure developments. Over the past few years, we’ve observed a steady increase in Nepalese travellers flying internationally for education, employment, and leisure—particularly to Southeast Asia and beyond. At Malaysia Airlines, we view Nepal as both a valuable standalone market and a strategic gateway for regional connectivity. Our network is well positioned to support this, linking Kathmandu to key ASEAN and Australasian destinations via our hub in Kuala Lumpur.

We currently operate 10 weekly flights between Kathmandu and Kuala Lumpur, providing seamless onward connectivity to over 50 international destinations across Asia, Australasia, and the Middle East. As demand continues to evolve, we remain committed to supporting the Nepal market with reliable, full-service operations and are actively exploring opportunities to strengthen collaboration with local stakeholders.

To what extent is the Nepal route strategically important to Malaysia Airlines in terms of passenger traffic, cargo, or network connectivity?

Nepal represents a strategically important market for Malaysia Airlines and plays a vital role in strengthening our presence across the South Asia region. The Kathmandu-Kuala Lumpur route serves a diverse mix of passenger segments—including labour and VFR (visiting friends and relatives), leisure travellers and students pursuing education in Malaysia, Australia, and other ASEAN destinations.

Passenger traffic on this route has seen consistent growth, supported by our current schedule of 10 weekly flights, which provide seamless connectivity to over 50 destinations via our Kuala Lumpur hub. These include key cities across Southeast Asia, Australasia, the Middle East, and beyond. From a cargo perspective, Kathmandu also contributes meaningfully to our belly-hold freight operations, particularly for personal shipments, e-commerce, and essential goods. As cargo demand evolves, we continue to assess opportunities to grow our capabilities in tandem with passenger services.

Overall, Nepal complements our broader network strategy by enhancing our role as a connectivity bridge between South Asia and the wider Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing our commitment to serving this important market with reliability, value, and Malaysian Hospitality.

The opening of Gautam Buddha International Airport and Pokhara International Airport marks an important milestone in Nepal’s aviation landscape, and we recognize the long-term potential these airports represent

Nepal is both a major labour-sending country and an increasingly popular tourist destination. What tailored products or services could Malaysia Airlines introduce to serve these two distinct segments more effectively?

At Malaysia Airlines, we recognise the distinct travel needs of both the labour and leisure segments in Nepal, and we have developed offerings that aim to provide flexibility, affordability, and value. For labour travellers, we work closely with key recruitment agents and partners to deliver a strong value proposition tailored to this segment. Our fare structure is designed to give individual travellers the flexibility to choose based on their travel priorities:

Those seeking to minimise overall travel costs can opt for our value fares. Travellers who require additional baggage allowance, greater flexibility in flight changes, and refund options can choose our flex fares. Additionally, we also offer competitive group fares through our dedicated online group booking portal, making it easier for larger groups to plan and travel with ease.

For leisure travellers, we collaborate with trusted tour operators to develop attractive and affordable travel packages that highlight the appeal of both Nepal and Malaysia. We also offer our Bonus Side Trip program, which allows international passengers flying to Malaysia to add a domestic destination within Malaysia at no extra base fare—ideal for tourists who want to explore beyond Kuala Lumpur. By aligning our products and partnerships with the evolving needs of these two key segments, Malaysia Airlines remains committed to strengthening connectivity and enhancing the overall travel experience for passengers to and from Nepal.

Why is Malaysia Airlines not yet operating flights to Nepal’s newly opened international airports Gautam Buddha International Airport and Pokhara International Airport? Do technical, regulatory, or commercial considerations currently limit service there?

At present, Malaysia Airlines is focused on consolidating our operations from Kathmandu, where we operate 10 weekly flights to Kuala Lumpur. This allows us to optimise connectivity for Nepalese travellers across ASEAN and Australasia, while serving the continued growth in both labour and leisure segments.

We deeply appreciate the efforts by the Nepali authorities to expand aviation infrastructure, and we welcome their proactive engagement with international carriers. The opening of Gautam Buddha International Airport and Pokhara International Airport marks an important milestone in Nepal’s aviation landscape, and we recognise the long-term potential these airports represent. We continue to closely monitor the operational readiness and commercial viability of these new airports. As part of our ongoing network strategy review, we remain open to exploring future opportunities for expansion into additional points in Nepal when the timing and market conditions are aligned.

Are there ongoing discussions with Nepali authorities or airport operators about launching services to these new gateways? If so, what are the key challenges and timelines?

While we have not entered into formal discussions at this stage regarding operations to Gautam Buddha International Airport or Pokhara International Airport, we continue to monitor developments at both locations closely. Currently, our priority is to strengthen and optimize our existing 10 weekly services from Kathmandu, while enhancing onward connectivity to ASEAN and Australia via Kuala Lumpur. That said, we value the proactive efforts of Nepali authorities in expanding aviation infrastructure, and we remain open to exploring opportunities at these new airports as and when commercial, operational, and regulatory conditions align.

What digital innovations is Malaysia Airlines adopting to enhance customer experience in an increasingly online booking and travel environment?

Malaysia Airlines is undergoing a focused digital transformation aimed at elevating the end-to-end travel experience and meeting the evolving expectations of today’s connected travellers. We have invested in a mobile-first website and a user-friendly MH mobile app, enabling customers to book, modify, and manage their trips with ease—from seat selection and upgrades to meal preferences and real-time flight alerts. A major innovation being rolled out is our MHconnect in-flight Wi-Fi platform, which began progressive deployment from January 2025. This service offers complimentary Wi-Fi across all cabins, enabling passengers to stay connected, stream entertainment, and access digital content throughout their flight.

In addition, we are enhancing inflight entertainment systems, introducing digitally curated menus, and refining self-service features at airports to reduce wait times and improve convenience.

Looking ahead, we are investing in AI-driven personalisation to tailor offers and communication, biometric boarding and touchless check-in to streamline airport processes, and predictive service tools that will help us anticipate and respond to passenger needs proactively. Ultimately, these digital innovations are part of our vision to become a truly modern, digitally enabled airline—delivering both cutting-edge conveniences, with the hallmark warmth of Malaysian Hospitality.

We value the proactive efforts of Nepali authorities in expanding aviation infrastructure, and we remain open to exploring opportunities at these new airports as and when commercial, operational, and regulatory conditions align

Sustainability is a pressing issue in global aviation. How is Malaysia Airlines aligning its operations and fleet plans with environmental targets and carbon-reduction goals?

Sustainability is at the heart of Malaysia Airlines’ long-term vision. A key pillar of our strategy is fleet modernisation, which enables us to reduce emissions while delivering a better travel experience and stronger operational performance. We are progressively introducing next-generation aircraft such as the Airbus 330neo (A330neo) and Boeing 737-8, both of which offer significantly improved fuel efficiency, lower carbon emissions, and reduced noise footprints. The A330neo, for instance, delivers up to 14 percent greater fuel efficiency than its predecessor and features a refreshed cabin with enhanced comfort and inflight entertainment. The B737-8 enhances economics on short-haul routes while providing a quieter, more comfortable journey for passengers.

Aligned with this vision, we are progressively rolling out MHconnect, our new inflight Wi-Fi platform that offers complimentary unlimited data to all passengers, regardless of cabin class. This initiative is part of our broader commitment to creating a connected, modern travel experience with sustainability at its core.

Our fleet deployment strategy remains agile—ensuring the right aircraft are matched to the right routes to optimise fuel efficiency while staying responsive to shifting market dynamics.

These efforts are underpinned by the Malaysia Aviation Group Sustainability Blueprint, which outlines our pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050, including investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and operational efficiencies. By combining smart technology, modern aircraft, and our signature Malaysian Hospitality, Malaysia Airlines is charting a thoughtful and ambitious path toward a greener and more responsible future.

Tree-planting and other “offsets” that absorb carbon dioxide are offered by some airlines today, but there are worries about how reliable and permanent they are.
But green synthetic jet fuel has a guaranteed market, because of the EU rules, and a high price point that could get the nascent industry going.
Current DAC might cost about $500 per tonne of carbon dioxide, with a possible long-term target of $200.
A Dubai-London economy class return flight, with ticket price currently about $800, would emit about 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide.","Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways and other airlines are at the heart of the Gulf’s economic diversification plans. With few usable land links, the region’s emergence as a tourism and business hub flies on the wings of a jet. But they could hit turbulence: the push to cut the heavy carbon dioxide emissions from flying.

Air travel is perhaps unfairly demonised among activities that emit greenhouse gases. It contributes about 2.5 per cent of global emissions, less than the 8 per cent coming from cement or the 7 per cent from steel making.

But there are good reasons to worry about aviation’s carbon footprint. It generates additional global warming through contrails – the linear high-altitude clouds formed around jet exhausts under certain atmospheric conditions. Its pollution continues to grow fast, unlike some other sectors, possibly almost tripling by 2050. Private jets have come under harsh criticism in Europe because of their high per person emissions and perceived frivolous use by the rich, with calls for a ban.

And, unlike renewable or nuclear electricity generation, or electric road vehicles, low-carbon alternatives to petroleum-powered jets are not viable yet.

The issue will become more acute in the next few years. The huge and growing middle classes of South-East Asia, India and Africa are reaching levels of income where taking flights for pleasure and business becomes normal.

Supersonic flight may be returning to our skies, three decades or so after Concorde stopped operations. New technologies with less sonic boom and better fuel consumption could make it viable again. London to Dubai flights in three hours or so would be attractive to the wealthy and to top businesspeople.

But a modern supersonic flight would still burn two to three times as much fuel per person as a business class seat on a current wide-body jet.

Efficiency has crept up over the years, with today’s flights using half the fuel needed in 1990. These incremental gains can continue for a while. Tree-planting and other “offsets” that absorb carbon dioxide are offered by some airlines today, but there are worries about how reliable and permanent they are.

Yet, to meet international climate goals, all new aircraft delivered from the mid-2030s would need to be zero-carbon. That is only a decade away. How could this be achieved?

Electric aircraft on the drawing board today could manage short haul flights up to 500 kilometres, enough to connect Dubai to all the Gulf capitals other than Kuwait City. Such short routes, though, represent only a small per cent of overall emissions.

Longer distances would require dramatic advances in battery chemistries. More realistically, although there might be some savings from hybrid electric models, medium- and long-haul flights will continue to rely on chemical fuels well beyond 2050.

That means some combination of three things: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from biological materials, synthetic fuels that are practically equivalent to today’s jet fuel, or hydrogen.

SAF is already used today. Emirates has demonstrated A380 flights running entirely on SAF, and the UAE in 2023 announced a target to blend one per cent SAF into jet fuel by 2031. The EU has more aggressive requirements, requiring two per cent from this year, rising to 70 per cent by 2050.

But traditional pathways for making SAF either rely on waste feedstocks that will be in short supply, or on crops such as palm oil that contribute to deforestation.

A variety of chemical processes can turn hydrogen into near-perfect substitutes for kerosene. They are even superior: cleaner and less prone to form contrails. The hydrogen can be derived from water using renewable electricity, and combined with carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere.

Hydrogen could also be used directly as fuel. It emits only water vapour when burnt. Hydrogen contains a tremendous amount of energy for its weight, three times as much as jet kerosene, but it has low density, requiring large tanks. Entirely new aeroplanes and engines would need to be designed, tested and delivered, and a new hydrogen fuelling infrastructure set up. That does not seem likely to happen on the required scale before the 2040s.

But, whether SAF, synthetics or hydrogen, airlines and fuel suppliers are passing the buck to each other. Airlines complain there is not enough sustainable fuel on the market and that it is too expensive; fuel companies say they need long-term commitments to be able to invest in production.

One obvious solution would be to require private planes to move very quickly to zero-carbon flight. Their wealthy users can presumably afford it, and it would kick-start the market for SAF, synthetic fuels or more ambitious designs.

But for mass aviation, more scalable and affordable solutions are needed. This poses one risk and two big opportunities for the Gulf.

The risk lies between moving too quickly or too slowly. Too fast, and Gulf airports would lose custom either to competitors in the bloc or regional rivals such as Turkey. Too slowly, and they may weaken global climate efforts, and provoke a backlash from climate-conscious partner nations. They might, for instance, lose access to European routes, or face boycotts by tourists.

The first opportunity, by contrast, is to produce synthetic fuels. Demand for green hydrogen has grown much slower than Gulf states had hoped. But green synthetic jet fuel has a guaranteed market, because of the EU rules, and a high price point that could get the nascent industry going. The Gulf’s high-quality wind and solar resources, its open land, geographic centrality, and long experience in oil refining and petrochemicals, all make it a leading contender as a synthetic fuel provider.

The other opportunity is more controversial. Why go to the trouble of pulling carbon dioxide from the air just to make fuel? Planes could continue running on conventional petroleum-based jet kerosene, while offsetting its emissions entirely with the direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide. The offending carbon would then be permanently disposed of deep underground or turned into solid minerals.

Current DAC might cost about $500 per tonne of carbon dioxide, with a possible long-term target of $200. A Dubai-London economy class return flight, with ticket price currently about $800, would emit about 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Assuming that half of this could be saved with greater efficiency and SAF, the inclusion of DAC at future costs would bump up the ticket price by about a quarter.

That is expensive, but not insane. The Gulf’s exceptional energy and geological resources could make it a hub not just for luxury holidays, but for DAC too. That is an ideal way for both the oil and airline industries of the Gulf to keep flying high.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/SOKKIPG2XZBR7FD422QVZZTFLU.jpg?smart=true&auth=d54e4c6e6e8250bbb201f1838def28c829f7222b733e23ad27c422748f9876a6&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-08-24 23:56:47.296646

In his remarks, ITB Rector Prof. Dr. Ir. Tatacipta Dirgantara, M.T., emphasized that this event is not only a platform for sportsmanship but also a means of strengthening alumni ties and building synergy with partners.

The event was also attended by the Governor of Jakarta, Pramono Anung Wibowo, who officially flagged off the race and even ran alongside participants. The presence of Indonesia’s Minister of Health, Budi Gunadi Sadikin—who also serves as Chairman of ITB’s Board of Trustees—further underscored the government’s strong support for the event.

What made this event even more special was the full support from BNI through its Wondr platform. BNI President Director Putrama Wahju Setyawan, along with Vice President Director Alexandra Askandar and other board members, were present to show their support. On the occasion, BNI Director of Institutional Relations Eko Setyo Nugroho highlighted that the Wondr program enables alumni and the public to make sustainable donations for ITB’s education and research development. In addition, through a special ITB alumni credit card, every transaction automatically contributes 0.3 percent to the endowment fund. To date, more than 1,200 alumni have participated.

Beyond running, the Community Run was rich in togetherness. Runners teamed up with friends with disabilities to run and walk side by side. This moment reflected the spirit of inclusivity and solidarity, giving the event a meaning that goes beyond sports.

The main ITB Ultra Marathon 2025 will follow a route starting at Graha BNI Jakarta, passing through Bogor, Puncak, Cianjur, Padalarang, and Cimahi, before finishing at ITB’s Ganesha Campus.

It is reported that more than 3 million tonnes of SAF production is either planned or in construction.
“That means correctly placing aviation’s efforts within the context of the global energy transition.
Refineries produce a slew of products so when we talk about SAF production, it is important to remember this is a small share of refined output.
Coordinated strategies are essential for decarbonization because aviation is just one part of the broader energy transition.","Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP of Sustainability and Chief Economist, says the timing means the WSS can substantially influence the agenda for decarbonization. “The WSS is a forum for new ideas and fresh collaboration,” she says. “Thinkers, doers, and regulators will come together and decide how to make progress toward net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and broader sustainability targets.”

The energy transition

The location of the WSS—Hong Kong ( 21-22 October)—is equally significant as Asia-Pacific is aviation’s fastest-growing market and notable for its SAF production opportunities. India, Malaysia, and Vietnam are just a selection of countries in the region that could play crucial roles in SAF production.

China, meanwhile, has a strong record in strategic planning and is invariably successful in implementing those plans, often before deadline. The country aims to be carbon neutral by 2060 with peak emissions occurring before 2030.

A SAF pilot project in China has been extended. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)'s 14th Five-Year Plan calls for over 20,000 tons of SAF consumption in 2025 and a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Research Centre to develop standards and a certification system has been established. It is reported that more than 3 million tonnes of SAF production is either planned or in construction.

China’s ability to be a trend-setter in SAF is important as SAF will do the heavy lifting if aviation is to reach net-zero by 2050. But Thomsen emphasizes that decarbonization is not just an industry issue.

“The WSS will highlight radical collaboration,” she says. “That means correctly placing aviation’s efforts within the context of the global energy transition. This is a huge economic development opportunity, which will build new markets and industries and create jobs.”

Thomsen suggests that if individual industries try to find their own solution each one will fail. “But together it is possible to succeed,” she adds. “Aside from the economic implications, countries that are forward-looking in this area can achieve greater energy independence. Refineries produce a slew of products so when we talk about SAF production, it is important to remember this is a small share of refined output. The majority of renewable refined products will benefit other industries. This means that helping airlines obtain sustainable aviation fuel will give most other industries greater access to renewable fuels.”

Attracting investment

Investment is needed to fund new SAF production facilities and other sustainability initiatives. Certainly, money is available if investors think the returns will be there. The amount of finance available to artificial intelligence development speaks to the deep pockets that investors have if they believe in a project.

But the truth is that oil is bringing in about a 20% return while renewable energy is lagging at 5%. Bridging that gap requires the right policies and incentives from regulators.

The good news is that solar and wind power have already shown the way forward. SAF needs a similar level of investment to these now-established energy markets so regulators should be aware of the constituents of a good policy.

“The blueprint for success is there,” says Thomsen. “And it all fits together because this leads back to the idea of radical collaboration. This is not about giving money to aviation, it is about investing in the energy transition. SAF is just one part of the biofuel complex that will drive advances in renewable power.”

CORSIA

Other elements of the journey to net-zero carbon emissions will be under the spotlight at the WSS, from new technologies to green financing.

One key discussion point will be the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Mandatory reporting starts in 2027 but to date Guyana is the only country offering eligible emission units (EEU) for airlines to purchase.

Airlines are required to buy EEUs to meet the established baseline, but there is no requirement for countries to provide them. States need to authorize the release of credits for the use of airlines in the form of EEUs and ensure that these units are withdrawn from the Paris Agreement platform to avoid double counting.

But Thomsen notes that some countries lack the necessary resources or expertise to navigate the process. “IATA is doing its best to facilitate the process through workshops, and guidelines, and more hands-on assistance,” she says. “But we need to accelerate and increase the pipeline. We need to work out what projects are the closest to obtaining authorization and make that happen.”

IATA has established the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) which operates the SAF Registry and IATA has itself launched the SAF Matchmaker. It is additionally offering EEUs for airlines to purchase on its Aviation Carbon Exchange platform.

“We can’t afford CORSIA, agreed to by all UN member States, to fall apart and have each State adopt its own individual system, because such fragmentation is incompatible with global international civil aviation,” says Thomsen. “CORSIA must be strong to ensure a cohesive policy framework. And it will most likely raise more money for participating countries than any air travel ticket tax they might be contemplating.”

Thomsen concludes that the WSS will highlight two essential features for net-zero success—a global, liquid, and transparent SAF market, and a global, liquid, and transparent carbon credit market. Regulators can make this a viable proposition, just as they can promote the other technologies and levers required to reach net zero air transportation in 2050.

“It is time to break the silos and work across disciplines, ministries, institutions, and industries,” she says. “Anything else won’t work. Coordinated strategies are essential for decarbonization because aviation is just one part of the broader energy transition. Reaching net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 in any industry depends on effective policies and investment.”

Pertamina saat ini sudah menempatkan 35 UCollect Box di sejumlah lokasi strategis, mulai dari SPBU, rumah sakit IHC Pertamina, hingga pusat layanan publik di Jakarta, Tangerang, Bandung, Semarang, Surabaya, Bali, dan Palembang. Daftar lengkap titik pengumpulan bahkan bisa diakses melalui aplikasi MyPertamina.

Selain melibatkan rumah tangga, Pertamina juga menjalin kemitraan dengan sektor komersial seperti hotel, restoran, dan kafe untuk memperluas rantai pasok minyak jelantah. Kolaborasi ini diharapkan mampu meningkatkan produksi SAF secara berkelanjutan. Menurut Fadjar, penggunaan SAF berpotensi mengurangi hingga 84 persen emisi dibandingkan bahan bakar avtur konvensional, sejalan dengan target transisi energi nasional menuju Net Zero Emission 2060.

Di tengah kebutuhan energi nasional yang terus tumbuh, peran Elnusa dalam memastikan kelancaran pasokan energi menjadi semakin strategis.
Elnusa berada di jalur yang tepat untuk menjadi hub digital energi nasional,” ujar Arief Prasetyo Handoyo, Direktur Pengembangan Usaha Elnusa.
Arief menambahkan, langkah pengembangan bisnis ini merupakan bentuk komitmen Elnusa dalam mendukung ketahanan energi nasional.","Jakarta Pusat, Jakarta, ruangenergi.com-PT Elnusa Tbk (ELNUSA), anak usaha PT Pertamina Hulu Energi, sedang berada di persimpangan penting.

Di tengah tekanan laba bersih yang turun 24% pada semester I 2025, perusahaan jasa energi terintegrasi ini justru mengambil langkah agresif: menambah plafon kredit dari PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk (BBNI) dari US$50 juta menjadi US$70 juta atau sekitar Rp1,14 triliun, dengan tenor diperpanjang dari 12 bulan menjadi 24 bulan.

Tambahan fasilitas ini bukan sekadar “oksigen finansial”. Bagi Elnusa, ini adalah amunisi untuk memperkuat tiga lini bisnis utama yang akan menjadi motor pertumbuhan ke depan: jasa hulu migas terintegrasi, distribusi & logistik energi, serta jasa penunjang migas.

1. Jasa Hulu Migas Terintegrasi: Jantung Energi Nasional

Bisnis inti Elnusa tetap bertumpu pada hulu migas. Layanannya mencakup geoscience, reservoir, pengeboran, hingga engineering, procurement, construction, operation & maintenance (EPC-OM).

Dengan keahlian teknis yang sudah terbukti lebih dari lima dekade, Elnusa menjadi mitra andalan Pertamina Group dan operator migas lain di dalam negeri. Ke depan, kebutuhan eksplorasi migas baru—terutama di cekungan frontier seperti Andaman dan Papua—menjadi peluang besar bagi Elnusa untuk mengokohkan peran sebagai pionir jasa hulu terintegrasi.

“Ketahanan energi Indonesia tidak bisa lepas dari hulu migas. Elnusa punya keunggulan di sini, baik teknologi maupun SDM,” kata seorang analis energi dari Jakarta.

2. Distribusi & Logistik Energi: Urat Nadi Pertamina

Selain di hulu, Elnusa juga kuat di hilir energi melalui distribusi dan logistik. Perusahaan mengelola transportasi BBM, depot, hingga penjualan chemical yang digunakan dalam proses produksi energi.

Di tengah kebutuhan energi nasional yang terus tumbuh, peran Elnusa dalam memastikan kelancaran pasokan energi menjadi semakin strategis. Tambahan kredit jumbo dari BNI akan memperkuat lini ini, terutama dalam pengembangan infrastruktur logistik energi yang kian krusial untuk mengurangi ketergantungan impor dan menjaga stabilitas suplai domestik.

3. Jasa Penunjang Migas: Relevan di Era Digitalisasi Energi

Tak kalah penting, Elnusa juga menggarap jasa penunjang migas—mulai dari marine support, fabrikasi, hingga manajemen data. Seiring dengan transformasi digital di sektor energi, jasa pengelolaan data geoscience dan operasional migas menjadi semakin vital.

Digitalisasi ini tidak hanya meningkatkan efisiensi, tetapi juga sejalan dengan agenda ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) yang didorong Elnusa, terutama dalam upaya menekan jejak karbon operasional.

“Era energi ke depan adalah era data. Elnusa berada di jalur yang tepat untuk menjadi hub digital energi nasional,” ujar Arief Prasetyo Handoyo, Direktur Pengembangan Usaha Elnusa.

Strategi Tepat, Kepercayaan Investor Terjaga dan Pengembangan Bisnis

Meskipun laba bersih anjlok di semester I 2025, investor tetap optimistis. Saham ELNUSA menguat 5% ke 525 pada 21 Agustus 2025, dengan kenaikan year-to-date hampir 20%. Katalis positifnya: keberhasilan Elnusa melunasi Sukuk Ijarah Rp715,75 miliar pada 11 Agustus 2025 dengan kas internal—tanpa utang baru.

Langkah itu menjadi sinyal kuat bahwa manajemen keuangan Elnusa tetap konservatif, bahkan saat memperbesar fasilitas kredit.

Di tengah dinamika pasar modal yang penuh gejolak, PT Elnusa Tbk (ELNUSA) justru melaju kencang. Anak usaha PT Pertamina Hulu Energi yang tergabung dalam Subholding Upstream Pertamina ini berhasil membukukan tren kenaikan harga saham dan kapitalisasi pasar yang konsisten selama lima tahun terakhir.

Catatan manis dimulai pada 2021, ketika saham ELNUSA ditutup di Rp276 per lembar — masih di bawah harga IPO 2008 yang sebesar Rp400. Tahun berikutnya, tren positif mulai terasa dengan kenaikan 13% menjadi Rp312. Laju ini berlanjut di 2023, ketika saham naik 24% ke Rp388 dan kapitalisasi pasar meningkat dari Rp2,28 triliun menjadi Rp2,83 triliun.

Puncaknya terjadi pada Juni 2024, harga saham sempat menyentuh Rp545 dengan kapitalisasi Rp3,46 triliun. Momentum itu tidak berhenti. Juli 2025, ELNUSA kembali memecahkan rekor harga tertinggi dalam delapan tahun terakhir di Rp550 per lembar.

Direktur Keuangan Elnusa, Stanley Iriawan, menyebut tren positif ini sebagai cerminan respon pasar yang baik terhadap strategi perusahaan.

“Kinerja saham lima tahun terakhir mencerminkan fundamental yang kuat. Kami menjaga permodalan sehat, mengoptimalkan operasional, dan mengelola risiko secara bertanggung jawab,” ujarnya.

Stanley menambahkan, keberhasilan mempertahankan tren kenaikan adalah buah kerja sama seluruh tim, efisiensi, serta inovasi layanan. Ke depan, Elnusa fokus memperkuat daya saing dan menciptakan nilai tambah berkelanjutan bagi pemegang saham dan seluruh pemangku kepentingan.

Elnusa juga aktif membangun sinergi di lingkungan BUMN untuk memperluas peluang bisnis, memperkuat rantai pasok, serta mengoptimalkan belanja modal demi visi menjadi service company energi yang tangguh, baik untuk Pertamina maupun pihak eksternal.

Dari sisi pendanaan, dukungan perbankan semakin menguat — sinyal bahwa lembaga keuangan percaya pada prospek Elnusa. Transformasi digital juga digenjot untuk meningkatkan efisiensi, akurasi data, dan kualitas layanan.

Dengan DNA resilience dan inovasi selama lebih dari 55 tahun, Elnusa membuktikan diri sebagai pemain jasa energi terintegrasi yang mampu beradaptasi, bertumbuh, dan terus menarik minat investor.

Dalam catatan ruangenergi.com, Arief Prasetyo Handoyo, Direktur Pengembangan Usaha Elnusa, mengatakan saat ini Elnusa sedang mengembangkan teknologi dalam negeri untuk pembersihan dan inspeksi pipa yang dikenal dengan proses pigging. Pigging adalah proses peluncuran benda yang disebut Pipeline Inspector Gauge (PIG) yang berfungsi untuk membersihkan maupun inspeksi di dalam suatu sistem perpipaan.

“Elnusa selalu meningkatkan kualitas baik dari sisi produk maupun jasa pada setiap aktivitas Pigging, salah satunya dengan membuat dan mengembangkan produk pendukung yang digunakan yakni Foam PIG, sebagai material dasar yang digunakan dalam proses pig cleaning atau pembersihan pipa,” kata Arief disela diskusi bersama media, Jumat (14/3/2025) lalu.

Elnusa, lanjut Arief, juga tengah mengembangkan Binary Heat Exchanger for Geothermal dan Inflow Control Device (Downhole Flow Regulator), serta solusi Ecolift Hydraulic Pumping Unit untuk optimalisasi sumur idle. Pengembangan ini merupakan sinergi antar subholding Pertamina bersama PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE). Komitmen terhadap energi berkelanjutan juga ditunjukkan dengan pengembangan Battery Charging Station dalam ekosistem kendaraan listrik (EV Ecosystems) serta implementasi teknologi Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage (CCUS) untuk mendukung transisi energi.

Dalam aspek Pipeline Integrity Management, Elnusa mengembangkan In-Line Inspection Services untuk memastikan keandalan dan keselamatan jaringan pipa. Sementara itu, di bidang Well Production Improvement, Elnusa menghadirkan inovasi seperti Pertasolvent, Hydraulic Dilation Water Pumping, dan Automatic Well Performance Analyzer guna meningkatkan efisiensi serta optimasi produksi sumur migas.

Arief menambahkan, langkah pengembangan bisnis ini merupakan bentuk komitmen Elnusa dalam mendukung ketahanan energi nasional.

“Kami terus mengakselerasi pengembangan bisnis melalui inovasi yang tidak hanya meningkatkan efisiensi operasional, tetapi juga berkontribusi pada ketahanan energi nasional dan keberlanjutan industri. Dengan strategi yang terarah, Elnusa siap menghadapi tantangan industri energi di masa depan,” kata Arief.

Wakil Ketua Energy Institute for Transtition (EITS) Mukhtar Wijaya, menilai kontribusi ELNUSA terhadap keberlanjutan pengembangan energi baru energi terbarukan (EBET) perlu diperbanyak. Perusahaan yang dipimpin oleh Bachtiar Soeria Atmadja itu, sebaiknya hand in hand dengan sesama anak usaha dari PT Pertamina (Persero) untuk memasifkan pemanfaatan energi terbarukan di lingkup badan usaha milik negara tersebut.

“Ke depan potensi bisnis EBET juga digarap dengan masif untuk bisa menambah portofolio perusahaan, plus peluang menambah pendapatan bisnis dari sektor non migas. Jangan sampai peluang bisnis ini diserobot oleh kompetitor bisnis ELNUSA,” jelas Mukhtar kepada ruangenergi.com, Minggu (24/08/2025), di Jakarta.

ELNUSA, lanjut Mukhtar, jangan sekedar mengembangkan Battery Charging Station dalam ekosistem kendaraan listrik (EV Ecosystems) serta implementasi teknologi Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage (CCUS) untuk mendukung transisi energi, namun sebaiknya membentuk anak usaha jasa perawatan solar panel, jasa perawatan sumur geothermal dan transportir untuk Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",https://www.ruangenergi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elnusa-dok-elnusa_169.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 22:57:08.181560

They take turns in showing off their best moves to the delight of the watching crowd, most of whom are recording the spectacle on their phones.

This is not some LSD induced hallucination. It is the Vilnius Pink Soup Fest, which attracted almost 100,000 people to the Lithuanian capital for its annual festival of fuchsia this summer.

The star of the show is šaltibaršciai, a cold bright pink soup made with beetroots, kefir, cucumbers, dill, spring onions and a hard-boiled egg.

The centuries-old dish, similar to a cold borscht, has become an emblem of Lithuanian identity and is incredibly popular in the summer.

Business Bulletin

So popular that Go Vilnius, the city’s tourist board, decided to create a festival around it in 2023, and it has been growing ever since.

Lacking a staple festival like St Patrick’s Day, organisers wanted to create a yearly event that would put their city on the tourism map.

And from the very outset, they decided it must be ‘Instagrammable’.

By that metric, they succeeded. For a weekend in May the entire city is a sea of pink.

Over 100 restaurants, cafes and bars offer special pink cocktails and drinks.

A 50-metre pink waterslide is built down the city’s biggest hill, plopping users into a massive inflatable soup bowl filled with fluffy white foam at the end.

A hot-pink carpet is laid through the ancient streets of the city’s old town, leading to a pink stage in the main square for open-air concerts in the evening.

Wherever you look, there are photo opportunities.

Egle Maciulyte, of the Go Vilnius communications team, is open about the fact that they set out to create something Instagrammable.

After all, why spend a fortune on marketing when your attendees will happily spread the word for you?

Of course, the Instagram factor at events is nothing new.

In the first study of its kind in 2017, researchers at the King’s Business School in the University of San Diego, found that environments that use more interactive props, colour and brightness were much more likely to be photographed and shared.

It also found that spaces that were styled in an “over-the-top” fashion were more likely to be shared online.

Dr Matteo Montecchi, a senior lecturer in marketing at the school, said: “Some studies suggest that up to 40 per cent of millennials choose a travel spot based on its Instagrammability.

“The findings in this research have direct influence on approaches to retail, tourism and beyond.”

While Irish bars and clubs have happily provided colourful swings and other photo opportunities at their venues, it could be argued that Ireland has never fully taken advantage of the marketing potential provided by the Instagram effect.

If marketers want their guests to promote their event on Instagram, or indeed TikTok, they need to bake it into plans from the beginning.

In Dublin, for example, there are several market projects at various stages of planning and construction.

In Smithfield, the Victorian fruit and vegetable market is expected to reopen in 2027 with 80 stalls as part of a €44m project.

And work is also underway to convert St Andrew’s Church on Suffolk Street into an indoor food hall.

While some may baulk at the idea of creating gaudy photo opportunities in buildings of such heritage, Dublin City Council and Fáilte Ireland should be working to create shareable moments in both.

Food tourism generates €2bn for the Irish economy every year — and visitor numbers are down 10 per cent this year.

If we want to continue attracting tourists and also younger people like Generation Z, who experience and share the world through their phones, then shareable moments are a must.

“Build it and they will come,” is no longer sufficient. “Make it shareable and they will come,” seems more true of the world today.

Not a penny spent

Exactly six months ago on 23 February, speaking at Scottish Labour conference, Starmer promised to make £200 million available from the National Wealth Fund for Grangemouth.

Despite the refinery (the only one in Scotland) ceasing production in April and hundreds of jobs being shed at the complex including at the chemicals plant and among contractors based at the site, not one penny of the promised investment has been spent.

Open letter

In response to the government’s inaction, workers at Grangemouth, who are members of Unite, have launched an open letter and are encouraging all affected workers and members of the local community to sign.

Workers turning away from Labour

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: 'It is little wonder workers are turning away from Labour in their droves when they fail to protect British jobs and critical infrastructure.

'Promises made to the workers of Grangemouth have been broken. Unite produced a clear plan for the site to be transformed, to back workers and create the promised green jobs.

'The government failure to act shows there is absolutely no plan for a jobs' transition.'

Detailed plan

Unite has produced a detailed and fully costed plan about how the refinery could be transitioned to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The government is promoting the use of SAF to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Workers feel abandoned

Unite Senior Rep at Grangemouth Chris Hamilton said: 'Workers and members of the community feel abandoned by a government that has promised to help but has so far totally failed to deliver.

'Each month more and more people leave the site through redundancy with empty promises wringing in their ears. This government may have forgot what it promised - but we haven’t. It must follow through with its promises at pace and do all it can to secure a sustainable future for Grangemouth.'

You can earn status with the program by racking up status points, but beyond that, those status points can also unlock extra rewards, including milestone perks.

The idea is that for passing certain thresholds, members can choose which benefits they like most. The idea is that some perks have been decoupled from traditional elite tiers, to provide more flexibility. Let’s go over the details.

Details of Alaska Atmos Rewards milestone perks

We’re increasingly seeing airline loyalty programs introduce milestone perks, whereby members can select benefits when they pass certain thresholds, rather than just receiving benefits when they qualify for elite status (for example, American AAdvantage Loyalty Point Rewards, Delta SkyMiles Choice Benefits, etc.). The logic for this is two-fold:

It’s intended to reward members more often, and keep them engaged in the program, since perks can be picked even outside of the traditional elite thresholds

It’s intended to give members more options to pick the perks that matter most to them, given that we all value rewards differently

With that in mind, Alaska’s Atmos Rewards milestone perks can be picked at 11 different thresholds, ranging from 10,000 status points to 250,000 status points.

Note that all status points racked up by Atmos Rewards members qualify toward the milestone perks program. This includes status points earned with award flights, as well as status points earned with credit cards, including with the Atmos™ Rewards Summit Visa Infinite® Credit Card (review), Atmos™ Rewards Ascent Visa Signature® Credit Card (review), and Atmos™ Rewards Visa Signature® Business Card (review).

Which Atmos Rewards milestone perks are best?

As you can see, there’s a huge variety of rewards to choose from, so which option makes the most sense depends on the type of consumer that you are.

Generally speaking, when available, I tend to think the best options are between the bonus points and upgrade vouchers. The upgrade vouchers do have capacity controls, and getting confirmable space can be challenging, so that’s quite limiting. That’s why I tend to think bonus points are often the best choice, since they give you the most flexibility.

The benefit of bonus points is especially useful if you’re just loyal to Atmos Rewards because you think it’s a great oneworld program, and you don’t actually fly Alaska or Hawaiian metal that much. Just as an example, between 10,000 status points and 100,000 status points, you could rack up a total of 88,250 bonus points with milestone rewards. That’s a pretty significant haul.

I should also mention that Atmos Rewards Unlocked experiences could be a good deal. This is the Atmos Rewards experiences marketplace. I tend to think this is pretty niche, but it’s always worth taking a look, as there’s potentially value to be had.

Bottom line

Alaska Atmos Rewards offers the milestone perks program, whereby members receive rewards at 11 different thresholds, ranging from 10,000 status points to 250,000 status points. These partly overlap with the traditional elite tiers, but the intent is also that you can be rewarded more often, including at other tiers.

There’s huge value to the program, whether you’re looking to earn bonus redeemable points upgrade vouchers, or a variety of other benefits.",https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Alaska-Lounge-Seattle-9-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 18:56:21.109181

Lufthansa Group, Europe's largest airline, has emerged as a case study in strategic reinvention through its “7 to 1: Our Way Forward” initiative. This transformation, now in its critical phase as of August 2025, is not merely about survival—it's a calculated move to redefine profitability, operational agility, and competitive differentiation in a sector where margins are razor-thin and customer expectations are sky-high.

Structural Overhaul: The Bedrock of Long-Term Profitability

At the heart of Lufthansa's reorganization lies a relentless focus on fleet modernization and cost rationalization. The airline has systematically retired older, less efficient aircraft and replaced them with fuel-saving models like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner. These aircraft, which now constitute over 40% of the long-haul fleet, have reduced fuel consumption by 25% per seat compared to their predecessors. This shift has not only cut operational costs but also aligned the company with global sustainability goals, a critical factor for ESG-conscious investors.

The financial impact is stark. In Q2 2025, Lufthansa reported a 27% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBIT to €871 million, driven by a 3% revenue rise and a 38% reduction in the financial impact of operational irregularities. The airline's operating margin of 8.4% now outpaces its pre-pandemic average, a testament to the efficacy of its cost-cutting measures. By reducing fixed costs and shifting to a more variable cost structure, Lufthansa has created a buffer against seasonal demand fluctuations—a rare advantage in an industry prone to cyclical volatility.

Operational Efficiency: A New Benchmark for Reliability

Operational reliability has long been a pain point for legacy carriers, but Lufthansa's turnaround program has turned this weakness into a strength. Network reliability now exceeds 99%, with punctuality rates up 8 percentage points compared to 2024. This improvement is not accidental; it stems from a deliberate reduction in fleet complexity (fewer aircraft types to maintain), optimized crew scheduling, and AI-driven predictive maintenance systems.

The integration of ITA Airways, completed in January 2025, further exemplifies this operational discipline. By harmonizing ITA's route network with Lufthansa's European and transatlantic corridors, the airline has unlocked synergies in cargo operations, loyalty program integration, and joint business partnerships. Early financial benefits from this acquisition are already evident, with ITA contributing €120 million in adjusted EBIT in Q2 2025 alone.

Customer-Centric Innovation: Premium Positioning in a Price-Sensitive Market

While cost discipline and operational efficiency are table stakes, Lufthansa's true differentiator lies in its premium product strategy. The launch of Allegris and Senses seating on long-haul routes has redefined in-flight comfort, with premium cabins now generating 15% of total revenue—a 5% increase from 2024. These offerings, combined with digital innovations like personalized meal pre-ordering and AI-powered customer service chatbots, have elevated the Lufthansa brand to a new tier of customer experience.

The airline's Net Promoter Score (NPS) has climbed to 42, outpacing competitors like Air France-KLM and IAG. This loyalty is being monetized through a revamped frequent flyer program, which now rewards passengers with tailored benefits and exclusive access to premium services. For investors, this signals a shift from transactional relationships to long-term customer value—a critical edge in an industry where switching costs are low.

Sustainability as a Strategic Lever

Lufthansa's commitment to sustainability is no longer a PR exercise but a core component of its competitive strategy. The airline aims to halve net carbon emissions by 2030 and has already invested €1.2 billion in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon offset programs. These efforts are not only aligning the company with EU regulatory frameworks but also attracting a growing cohort of eco-conscious travelers willing to pay a premium for greener options.

The financial markets have taken notice. Lufthansa's stock price surged 9.41% following its Q2 2025 earnings report, outperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Airlines index by 4.2%. With a forward P/E ratio of 7.28 and an EV/EBITDA of 3.89, the stock appears undervalued relative to its peers, particularly given its robust free cash flow generation and debt reduction trajectory.

Investment Implications: A Buy for the Long Haul

For investors, Lufthansa's “7 to 1” initiative represents a rare confluence of strategic clarity, operational execution, and financial discipline. The airline's ability to balance cost-cutting with premium product innovation—while navigating a complex regulatory and geopolitical landscape—positions it as a leader in the post-pandemic aviation renaissance.

Key risks remain, including fuel price volatility and labor disputes, but Lufthansa's hedging strategies and union negotiations have thus far mitigated these threats. The airline's projected capital expenditure of €2.7–3.3 billion between 2025–2028, focused on fleet renewal and digital infrastructure, further underscores its commitment to long-term value creation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-24 16:56:16.121187

Lufthansa Cargo, which already incorporates SAF into its operations, will supply the fuel for SHEIN shipments.
Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment at SHEIN, explains: ""Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide SHEIN with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.
By pooling their data, SHEIN and Lufthansa Cargo hope to identify patterns that could inform broader carbon reduction strategies.
“Signing this memorandum with SHEIN represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence,” says Ashwin Bhat, CEO at Lufthansa Cargo.","SHEIN has partnered with Lufthansa Cargo to make its global deliveries more climate-friendly. The collaboration will explore the use of sustainable aviation fuel and wider strategies to cut emissions from international air freight.

At the heart of the deal is sustainable aviation fuel, also known as SAF. This liquid fuel alternative is produced from renewable feedstocks, including waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-food crops. It can be used as a substitute for conventional jet fuel, resulting in significantly lower lifecycle carbon emissions. Lufthansa Cargo, which already incorporates SAF into its operations, will supply the fuel for SHEIN shipments. Each batch will be supported by Proof of Sustainability certificates, verified by third-party standards, that document the emissions saved compared with fossil-based fuels.

According to the memorandum of understanding, the two companies anticipate rolling out SAF-based offsetting solutions within six months. Both sides stress that sustainable aviation fuel is not a silver bullet. Instead, they view it as one part of a larger carbon reduction plan that also includes new energy sources and operational improvements to make transport more efficient.

Lufthansa Cargo will share its expertise in procuring and deploying SAF, while SHEIN gains insight into how to apply these practices across its own supply chain. Since SHEIN does not operate its own aircraft but relies on third-party carriers to transport goods between suppliers and global markets, the partnership creates new opportunities to reduce emissions across its supply chain.

Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment at SHEIN, explains: ""Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide SHEIN with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of SAF where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network.”

A focus on transparency and data sharing

Another core element of the partnership is data collaboration. The companies will share environmental reporting and performance data to improve traceability in emissions tracking. This will involve analyzing how fuel use aligns with freight volumes and flight routing to identify areas where efficiency gains can be achieved.

By pooling their data, SHEIN and Lufthansa Cargo hope to identify patterns that could inform broader carbon reduction strategies. The memorandum also outlines plans to explore shared methods of assessing sustainability, from fleet efficiency metrics to quality assurance processes. Better traceability tools are expected to help both companies drive measurable improvements in the sustainability of air freight systems.

“Signing this memorandum with SHEIN represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence,” says Ashwin Bhat, CEO at Lufthansa Cargo.

“It demonstrates the importance of concrete measures and reliable implementation in the international air freight business.”

“Together with all stakeholders within the supply chain, we are driving the development of more sustainable global supply chains in line with our purpose: Enabling Global Business.""

Big-picture goals without binding targets

While the agreement outlines ambitious intentions, it falls short of setting binding targets or establishing legal commitments. Instead, it provides a framework for pilot projects and trial initiatives that can later expand into larger programs.

“While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonisation strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency, and exploring other low-carbon solutions,” says Ethan.

Much depends on the feasibility and future availability of sustainable aviation fuel. For now, the strategy focuses on practical steps that can be tested, refined, and scaled over time. Collaboration, data exchange, and a willingness to learn together form the backbone of this partnership, which could serve as a model for how the logistics sector transitions toward lower-carbon air transport.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_76c446b771c048258454e36e75e86f4f~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_754,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/becc64_76c446b771c048258454e36e75e86f4f~mv2.jpeg",N,,2025-08-24 19:56:46.587587

And the second one is the use of sustainable fuel,” he explained.
If you are talking about fuel, you need blending infrastructure in Indonesia, pipelines for sustainable fuel, and so on.
“If you want to create a credible ecosystem for this, you need the industry to develop production of sustainable fuel itself.
His remarks underscore that advancing sustainable aviation in Indonesia will require a coordinated approach—linking infrastructure, supply chains, finance, and regulation.","The Indonesia Green Connect (IGC) 2025 forum, held on 7 August 2025 at Aula Timur ITB and organized by Energy Academy Indonesia (ECADIN) in partnership with the Directorate for Science and Technology Park (DKST) ITB, brought global and national leaders together to discuss pathways toward cleaner, more connected mobility. In the session Acceleration of Clean Mobility, Cyrille Schwob, Head of Research and Technology at Airbus Asia Pacific, delivered a candid assessment of the aviation industry’s decarbonization challenge and the practical steps required to build credibility in sustainable aviation.

Schwob began by underscoring the scale of the problem. “Aviation is no secret, it is a very difficult sector to abate for emissions,” he said. Without intervention, emissions could rise toward two gigatons of CO₂ annually, making aviation an outlier in global climate progress. He explained that the industry’s roadmap rests on five pillars: newer, more efficient aircraft; continuous technological innovation; optimized operations; widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); and market-based measures to offset remaining emissions.

For Indonesia, Schwob highlighted two pillars as especially critical: operations and fuel. “We need to make sure airplanes are used to their full capacity, to optimize the traffic routing of them. And the second one is the use of sustainable fuel,” he explained. Yet these require a supportive ecosystem. “First we need infrastructure. If you are talking about fuel, you need blending infrastructure in Indonesia, pipelines for sustainable fuel, and so on. Same story for traffic management: you need improved infrastructure to enable and to leverage the capability of the aircraft to minimize and optimize their trajectory.”

Building this ecosystem demands more than physical infrastructure. Schwob stressed the interdependence of supply, financing, and policy. “If you want to create a credible ecosystem for this, you need the industry to develop production of sustainable fuel itself. If you want this, you need the banking and the financing to be ready. And if you want this, you need to work on the regulatory framework to make sure that, for one, you have some demand… and then you have like a full loop.”

The most pressing obstacle, however, lies in cost. Schwob was direct about the economic reality: “When you use sustainable-powered aircraft, it is actually way more expensive than fossil fuel-powered aircraft, and this is the main barrier we see today.” He pointed out that between 60–90% of SAF costs come from feedstock, which was originally envisioned as cheap agricultural waste or used cooking oil. But once value is created, those resources become scarce and expensive. “The minute this starts to become expensive, it becomes way more costly to produce it, more expensive for people to use it, and the whole business plan collapses,” he cautioned.

The challenge, Schwob argued, is to manage feedstock allocation and pricing in a way that sustains investment and prevents collapse. “This cannot happen without government regulation and intervention, and without careful thinking on how to optimize the value for everybody,” he concluded, signaling that policy frameworks must evolve alongside technological and market developments.

His remarks underscore that advancing sustainable aviation in Indonesia will require a coordinated approach—linking infrastructure, supply chains, finance, and regulation. This integrated view aligns with the broader mission of ECADIN. At ECADIN, our mission is to create a greener future by accelerating the energy transition and promoting just, sustainable growth. We are proud to contribute through research, innovation, and advocacy, while connecting expertise, knowledge, business actors, and financing solutions. We value diversity and focus on creating an inclusive environment where our team and partners can thrive.",https://www.ecadin.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Schwob_-square.webp,N,,2025-08-24 16:56:24.295283

As investors weigh the risks and opportunities in this sector, understanding the interplay of these forces is critical to navigating the platinum price landscape.

Geopolitical Risks and Corporate Political Connections

Platinum supply chains remain deeply entangled with geopolitical dynamics, particularly in resource-rich regions like South Africa, which produces over 70% of the world's platinum. Political instability, regulatory shifts, and corporate-government partnerships in these regions directly influence supply stability and pricing. For instance, South African mining firms have increasingly aligned with national and international regulatory frameworks to navigate policies on emissions, labor, and environmental standards. This alignment is not just a compliance exercise but a strategic move to secure long-term offtake agreements and attract foreign investment.

The U.S. and its allies are also recalibrating their approach to platinum supply chains. The U.S. government's emphasis on reducing dependency on adversarial supply chains has led to strategic partnerships with countries like Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Japan. Saudi Arabia, for example, aims to become a top-seven global mineral processor by 2030, leveraging low energy costs and underexplored reserves. These partnerships often involve state-backed financing and enforceable offtake commitments, mirroring Japan's JOGMEC model. Such strategies aim to diversify supply and mitigate risks from China's dominance in downstream processing, which controls over 80% of global platinum refining capacity.

However, geopolitical risks persist. Sanctions, export controls, and trade disputes in politically sensitive regions can disrupt platinum flows. For example, companies with ties to sanctioned countries face reputational and operational risks, prompting a shift toward suppliers in politically stable, allied nations—even at higher costs. This trend underscores the growing influence of geopolitical considerations on corporate decision-making in the platinum sector.

Green Energy Demand: The Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Revolution

While geopolitical risks create short-term volatility, the long-term outlook for platinum is bolstered by its critical role in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. Platinum serves as the primary catalyst in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, which power hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and stationary power systems. The platinum catalyst market is projected to grow from $1.2 billion in 2024 to $2.5 billion by 2033, driven by government mandates and technological advancements.

Key policy drivers include the European Union's Green Deal, the U.S. Department of Energy's hydrogen infrastructure investments, and Asia-Pacific nations' aggressive hydrogen economy strategies. South Korea and Japan, for instance, have integrated hydrogen fuel cells into their transportation and energy sectors, with South Korea accounting for a significant share of global FCEV deployments. Meanwhile, China's push for green hydrogen production is expected to require nearly 6 million ounces of platinum by 2050 for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production alone.

Despite its dominance, platinum's high cost—accounting for two-thirds of a fuel cell stack's total cost—remains a barrier. Innovations like nanoparticle dispersion, platinum-alloy hybrids, and graphene-based catalysts are being tested to reduce dependency on pure platinum. However, these alternatives are still in early stages, ensuring platinum's relevance in the near-to-mid term.

Policy Shifts and Market Volatility

The 2025 U.S. policy landscape has introduced significant uncertainty. The administration's pivot toward fossil fuels—including the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the freezing of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding—has dampened near-term demand for platinum-dependent clean energy technologies. Reciprocal tariffs on clean energy components have further raised production costs for hydrogen fuel cells and other platinum-based systems.

Yet, these policy shifts may not be permanent. The hydrogen economy's strategic importance in decarbonization efforts ensures that platinum will remain a focal point for governments and investors alike. For example, the EU's continued investment in hydrogen infrastructure and the Hydrogen Council's projections—estimating hydrogen could account for 20% of global emissions abatement by 2050—highlight the metal's long-term value.

Investment Opportunities and Risks

For investors, the platinum sector presents a paradox: short-term volatility driven by geopolitical and policy risks, but long-term growth potential fueled by the hydrogen transition. Key opportunities include:

1. Mining and Processing Firms with Strategic Alliances: Companies aligned with U.S.-led initiatives, such as those securing offtake agreements with Saudi Arabia or Brazil, are well-positioned to benefit from diversified supply chains.

2. Hydrogen Fuel Cell Manufacturers: Firms like United Catalyst Corporation, which analyze PGM market dynamics and collaborate with policymakers, could see demand surges as hydrogen adoption accelerates.

3. Recycling and Catalyst Innovation: As platinum becomes scarcer, companies developing recycling technologies or hybrid catalysts may unlock new value chains.

However, risks remain. Policy reversals, geopolitical conflicts, and technological breakthroughs that reduce platinum dependency could disrupt the market. Investors should also monitor China's role in processing, as its dominance could influence pricing and supply stability.

Conclusion

The platinum price in 2025 is a barometer of global energy transitions and geopolitical realignments. While short-term volatility is inevitable, the metal's indispensable role in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies ensures its long-term relevance. Investors who balance exposure to geopolitical risks with the growth potential of green energy demand may find platinum a compelling asset in a diversified portfolio. As the world races to decarbonize, platinum's journey from mine to molecule will remain a critical—and potentially lucrative—storyline.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-24 17:56:09.477522

The reusable Boeing-built platform launched late on August 21, 2025, atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center, kicking off its eighth mission in 15 years of operations.

The uncrewed vehicle separated from the rocket’s upper stage as planned and entered low Earth orbit, roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) above the surface. Mission details remain classified, but the US Space Force has confirmed that the spaceplane will test a mix of navigation, communications, and payload-handling technologies.

From rapid turnaround to rapid testing

The launch comes less than six months after the X-37B completed its seventh mission, which ended with a landing at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on March 7, 2025. That mission included a first-of-its-kind aerobraking maneuver that allowed the vehicle to change orbit while saving propellant.

This quick turnaround also highlights the X-37B’s growing role as an operationally ready testbed for new military and commercial space technologies.

Bigger payloads, more experiments

For this eighth flight, Boeing has added a redesigned service module that expands the spaceplane’s payload capacity. The upgrade allows the Space Force and its partners, including the US Air Force Research Laboratory and the Defense Innovation Unit, to run more complex experiments simultaneously.

Among the payloads are two key technologies. The first is a high-bandwidth laser communications system, part of the US Space Force’s push to link satellites and space assets through resilient, high-speed networks.

The second is a quantum inertial sensor, designed to deliver precise navigation data in GPS-denied environments. If proven reliable in orbit, the technology could eventually support missions in contested orbital zones or even deep-space exploration where GPS signals are unavailable.

A platform that keeps evolving

Since its debut, the X-37B has spent over 4,200 cumulative days in space, returning after every flight for inspection, upgrades, and mission planning. That reusability has made it a critical asset for testing and refining technologies faster than traditional satellite platforms allow.

Each successive mission has offered a glimpse into how the US Space Force sees the future of orbital operations: a mix of reusable platforms, rapid iteration, and resilient systems designed to survive and operate in increasingly contested space.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/08/The-Boeing-X-37B-space-plane.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 08:56:08.536173

Khi máy bay điện phổ biến, chúng tôi cũng tham gia"", ông Tô Việt Thắng cho biết.
Các sân bay sử dụng xe điện, năng lượng mặt trời, giảm sử dụng điều hòa để tiết kiệm năng lượng.
Thứ tư, nhiên liệu thay thế hay còn được gọi là nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững, sẽ được sử dụng.
“Yêu cầu tỷ lệ sử dụng nhiên liệu bền vững tăng rất nhanh.","Tại tọa đàm “Giảm phát thải, lọc không khí” diễn ra mới đây, ông Tô Việt Thắng - Phó Tổng giám đốc Vietjet, cho biết, giảm phát thải trong ngành hàng không mang tính toàn cầu.

Ngành hàng không sử dụng nhiên liệu đặc thù Jet A-1, khác với xăng ô tô, xe máy. Ước tính, mỗi tấn Jet A-1 đốt cháy tạo ra 3,16 tấn khí CO2. Do đó, hàng không cũng là một trong những ngành tạo phát thải.

Theo ông Thắng, hàng không Việt Nam đã tham gia lộ trình phát triển bền vững, đạt mục tiêu phát thải ròng bằng 0 vào năm 2050.

Trong khi đó, các tổ chức hàng không trên thế giới đưa ra 4 giải pháp để các hãng bay thực hiện, hướng tới phát triển bền vững.

Thứ nhất, các hãng hàng không phải có chương trình bù trừ carbon. Tức là, doanh nghiệp thải carbon sẽ có cơ chế bù trừ lại hoặc doanh nghiệp đó mua tín chỉ carbon, tham gia các dự án trồng rừng.

Thứ hai, về giải pháp công nghệ, tàu bay được thiết kế nhẹ hơn, động cơ tiêu thụ ít nhiên liệu hơn hoặc sử dụng nhiên liệu thay thế. Về công nghệ, giống như xu hướng ô tô điện, ngành hàng không cũng đã thiết kế và thử nghiệm máy bay điện.

""Đến năm 2030, thế giới có máy bay điện từ 20-30 ghế đưa vào khai thác. Từ năm 2040, máy bay điện sẽ phổ biến hơn. Vietjet cũng đã làm việc với các đối tác nhằm bắt kịp xu hướng. Khi máy bay điện phổ biến, chúng tôi cũng tham gia"", ông Tô Việt Thắng cho biết.

Thứ ba, sử dụng hiệu quả hạ tầng, năng lượng sạch. Các sân bay sử dụng xe điện, năng lượng mặt trời, giảm sử dụng điều hòa để tiết kiệm năng lượng.

Thứ tư, nhiên liệu thay thế hay còn được gọi là nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững, sẽ được sử dụng.

Ông Thắng cho hay nhiên liệu các hãng hàng không đang sử dụng có nguồn gốc từ dầu mỏ. Trái lại, nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững được sản xuất từ chế phẩm sinh học và không có nguồn gốc dầu mỏ, có tên gọi là SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Hiện nay, SAF được ngành hàng không thế giới quan tâm bởi nhiên liệu này có thể giúp giảm 80% lượng phát thải carbon trong suốt vòng đời của nhiên liệu. Vietjet cũng từng thử nghiệm sử dụng SAF cho 2 chuyến bay quốc tế đi Úc và Hàn Quốc vào năm 2024.

Trên thế giới, châu Âu đã ban hành chính sách yêu cầu các hãng hàng không khi bay vào không phận phải sử dụng tỷ lệ % nhiên liệu bền vững nhất định. Cụ thể, năm 2025 là 2%, năm 2030 là 6% và năm 2035 là 20%, tiếp tục nâng dần tỷ lệ và tiến tới đạt 70% vào năm 2050.

“Yêu cầu tỷ lệ sử dụng nhiên liệu bền vững tăng rất nhanh. Tuy nhiên, chi phí sản xuất nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững đang cao gấp 2-3 lần so với nhiên liệu truyền thống, ảnh hưởng đến hiệu quả khai thác của hãng bay. Đây là rào cản lớn đối với mục tiêu phát triển bền vững của ngành hàng không”, đại diện Vietjet nói.

Nguồn cung SAF cũng là bài toán đang đặt ra cho các quốc gia trên thế giới và các hãng hàng không. Do đó, theo ông Thắng, doanh nghiệp đang làm việc với các đối tác để tiến hành nghiên cứu, hướng đến sản xuất nhiên liệu bền vững tại Việt Nam, nhằm giảm chi phí.

Cùng với đó, Vietjet kiến nghị với các cơ quan hữu trách hai vấn đề chính: Một là cần ban hành cơ chế chính sách phù hợp cho nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững, như hỗ trợ chi phí nhập khẩu, hoặc các loại thuế liên quan.

Hai là cần có quỹ đầu tư trong nước để tiến hành nghiên cứu, sản xuất nhiên liệu sạch tại chỗ, cung cấp cho các hãng hàng không, giúp giảm chi phí khai thác.",https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/000003/2025/8/23/lanh-dao-vietjet-khi-may-bay-dien-pho-bien-chung-toi-cung-tham-gia-2029.jpeg?width=0&s=7iBj8mIJc-XfVrIT6z_BWg,N,,2025-08-24 05:56:30.990252

Jakarta (ANTARA) - PT Pertamina (Persero) menilai dukungan pemerintah melalui kebijakan strategis penting untuk menjamin pasokan minyak jelantah (Used Cooking Oil/UCO) sebagai bahan baku avtur ramah lingkungan, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

“Jadi kita tentu ingin bekerja sama dengan dukungan pemerintah bagaimana kebijakannya bahwa standardisasi SAF atau kewajiban penggunaan SAF ini nanti itu disesuaikan dengan kemampuan Indonesia,” kata Direktur Transformasi dan Keberlanjutan Bisnis PT Pertamina (Persero) Agung Wicaksono, di Jakarta, Sabtu.

“Lalu bagaimana kemampuan Pertamina menyuplai ini, termasuk juga UCO-nya, karena ini juga banyak yang diekspor, kan? Jadi kami nanti butuh dukungan kebijakan pemerintah untuk bisa menjamin pasokannya,” katanya lagi.

Adapun SAF dari Pertamina (PertaminaSAF) merupakan avtur yang diolah dari bahan baku minyak jelantah, yang saat ini diproduksi oleh salah satu unit operasi PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI), yakni Kilang Cilacap.

Avtur yang mengandung campuran minyak jelantah itu, kata dia, telah melewati serangkaian pengujian kualitas yang ketat di laboratorium KPI Unit Cilacap dan juga di laboratorium eksternal independen Lemigas.

Produksi Pertamina SAF pun, katanya lagi, dilakukan dengan teknologi co-processing, menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih buatan anak bangsa.

“Ini merupakan produk karya anak bangsa, kita bangga. Produk dari minyak jelantah yang banyak kita temui di masyarakat, kemudian diolah di kilang Pertamina di Cilacap, yang akan menjadi green refinery,” ujar Agung.

Selain itu, Pertamina sendiri juga telah melakukan penerbangan komersial perdana maskapai Pelita Air menggunakan PertaminaSAF dengan rute Jakarta-Denpasar pada Rabu (20/8).

“Saat ini fokusnya di bandara internasional dulu, yaitu Jakarta dan Bali, karena 90 persen penerbangan internasional itu dari dua bandar udara itu,” kata Agung.

Lebih lanjut, mantan Deputi Bidang Pendanaan dan Investasi Otoritas Ibu Kota Nusantara (OIKN) itu mengatakan perusahaan berkomitmen untuk memperluas produksi bahan bakar pesawat terbarukan tersebut, sembari dengan melibatkan peran masyarakat.

“Sudah ada 35 SPBU, tempat pengumpulan minyak jelantah. Jadi masyarakat bisa tuang minyak jelantah dan menjadi rupiah. Ini berarti circular economy,” ujar Agung pula.

John Knight, Director Test & Experimental Engineering, ET&S, afferma: “Con oltre 2000 ore di test alle spalle, il Flying Test Bed è stato per noi un cavallo di battaglia negli ultimi 20 anni, aiutandoci a superare i limiti dell’engine development.
Mentre salutiamo con affetto la nostra Queen of the Skies, continuiamo a innovare nei test con una combinazione di flying test beds, ground testing and advanced digital modelling”.

“Dal 2005, questo velivolo modificato in modo unico, in grado di operare con cinque motori, è stato fondamentale per lo sviluppo di propulsori di nuova generazione come il Trent 1000 e il Pearl 10X.

Ha fatto la storia nel 2021 volando con un Trent 1000 alimentato interamente con 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel e ha svolto un ruolo chiave nella successiva certificazione del suo durability enhancement package, che più che raddoppierà il time on wing.

La sua ultima missione, completata nel luglio 2025, ha supportato l’Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) engine demonstrator, segnando un passo significativo verso la fornitura di motori più efficienti e sostenibili”, afferma Rolls-Royce.

John Knight, Director Test & Experimental Engineering, ET&S, afferma: “Con oltre 2000 ore di test alle spalle, il Flying Test Bed è stato per noi un cavallo di battaglia negli ultimi 20 anni, aiutandoci a superare i limiti dell’engine development. Mentre salutiamo con affetto la nostra Queen of the Skies, continuiamo a innovare nei test con una combinazione di flying test beds, ground testing and advanced digital modelling”.

“Un FTB test con una particolarità ha avuto luogo nel 2021, quando è stato utilizzato per testare un motore Trent 1000 alimentato con 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, mentre gli altri tre motori RB211 operavano con “standard” jet fuel. Il volo di tre ore e 54 minuti dall’aeroporto di Tucson, in Arizona, sorvolando Texas e Nuovo Messico ha confermato l’assenza di problemi tecnici e faceva parte del nostro programma più ampio, ora completato, per verificare che i nostri motori in produzione siano compatibili con 100% SAF.

In particolare, questo test è stato un fattore chiave per il primo first transatlantic flight al mondo di Virgin Atlantic nel 2023 utilizzando 100% SAF con un Trent 1000-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Questo ha reso Rolls-Royce il primo jet engine manufacturer a confermare pubblicamente che tutti i nostri in-production engines for long-haul aircraft and business jets sono compatibili con 100% SAF ed è stato un traguardo importante sia per Rolls-Royce che per l’industria aeronautica in generale. Ha inoltre fornito un’ulteriore dimostrazione del nostro impegno a diventare una net zero company entro il 2050 e a supportare i nostri clienti nel fare lo stesso”, prosegue Rolls-Royce.

All’epoca, Simon Burr, Group Director of Engineering, Technology and Safety, Rolls-Royce plc, ha dichiarato: “Questo è un traguardo importante, non solo per Rolls-Royce, ma anche per l’industria aerospaziale civile in generale. Ci auguriamo che il successo di questi test fornisca un livello di convalida tecnica che supporti coloro che intendono investire nella produzione di velivoli 100% SAF in futuro”.

“Da carbon/titanium fan blades a low-emission combustion systems, l’FTB è stato determinante nella convalida delle UltraFan technologies in condizioni reali.

Nel 2014, un set di composite carbon/titanium (CTi) fan blades, progettate per gli Advance and UltraFan engine designs, ha volato con successo per la prima volta, incorporate nell’FTB, segnando un’altra importante pietra miliare per il programma.

Più di recente, l’FTB ha permesso a Rolls-Royce di completare l’ultima fase di test di volo per il suo Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys). Le informazioni raccolte supportano direttamente lo sviluppo di UltraFan, riducendo i rischi e migliorando la maturità dei futuri combustion systems.

Testando queste tecnologie critiche in volo, l’FTB garantisce che i sistemi siano pronti per la prossima generazione di motori”, continua Rolls-Royce.

“La test configuration più evidente dell’FTB è stata quella del Pearl 10X. Questo motore è il terzo e più potente membro della market-leading Pearl engine family per il business aviation market, ed è stato ottimizzato per equipaggiare esclusivamente il nuovo velivolo di punta di Dassault, il Falcon 10X.

Per completare il suo rigoroso flight test programme, i nostri team hanno dovuto progettare un pilone su misura per consentirgli di essere posizionato sull’ala di destra dell’FTB, insieme a due RB211. Sull’ala sinistra erano presenti un terzo RB211 e un Trent 1000, conferendo all’FTB la sua esclusiva e accattivante configurazione a cinque motori.

Mentre il cockpit ospitava gli engine controls per tutti e cinque i motori, i piloti si concentravano sugli RB211 e sul Trent 1000, mentre un Pearl 10X engine operator sedeva sull’engineering deck accanto al flight test engineer e controllava il motore, mantenendo costantemente una continua headset communication con il cockpit.

Questo testing programme ha dimostrato l’incredibile flessibilità del velivolo, nonché l’ingegnosità del personale e dei nostri partner nell’operare la configurazione”, conclude Rolls-Royce.

Keunggulan lain, titik beku (freezing point) PertaminaSAF melampaui standar internasional. Taufik mengatakan, menurut standar internasional, spesifikasi titik beku avtur pada ketinggian yang jelajah pesawat komersial yakni minus 47 derajat celcius. Sementara di ketinggian yang sama, titik beku PertaminaSAF, bisa lebih rendah dari spesifikasi tersebut.

“PertaminaSAF tidak akan membeku di kondisi ekstrem, sehingga aman digunakan selama penerbangan. Aspek keselamatan yang sesuai bahkan melebihi standar internasional menjadikan produk ini memiliki nilai tambah yang semakin tinggi,” tutur Taufik.

How To Earn Alaska Airlines Status Points Qualifying for milestones requires earning status points.
Advertisement Alaska Airlines Atmos Rewards Milestone Choices You have options at each milestone.
If you’re flying long-distance with Alaska Airlines in first class (paid or booked with points), with Alaska Airlines’ partners, or on military travel, you can access these lounges before departing without paying.
Final Thoughts Alaska Airlines added milestones to its Atmos Rewards program in 2025.","In 2025, Alaska Airlines got into the game of rewarding travelers with perks along their elite status journey. Rather than waiting until you reach the next tier to gain benefits, you can receive additional perks in between.

Dubbed “milestones,” these perks are available starting at 10,000 status points. That’s a relatively achievable threshold, and travelers don’t need to qualify for any levels of elite status before they can get extra benefits.

The best part about milestones is their customization, letting you choose the perk you like — or 2 perks you like, depending on which milestone you’ve reached.

Here’s everything you need to know about this new benefit for Alaska Airlines flyers and the options you can choose from this year.

What Are Alaska Atmos Rewards Milestones?

Alaska Airlines announced milestones along with its other loyalty program changes for 2025. Milestones are perks that you can choose, starting at 10,000 status points and available at 7 different thresholds as you earn more status points throughout the year.

Choosing milestones in your Alaska Airlines Atmos Rewards account is free after you’ve qualified for them. However, you need to make your selection within 120 days.

Hot Tip:

Different perks have different expiration periods. However, if you choose to get elite status for a day, you would have up to a year to use the perk. According to a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, it would be valid for 14 days from activation.

How To Earn Alaska Airlines Status Points

Qualifying for milestones requires earning status points. Luckily, you can earn status points from more than just flying. Ways to collect status points include spending on a credit card, travel, shopping, and more.

These are the same status points that count toward earning Alaska Airlines’ elite status tiers, though you don’t need to reach any level of elite status to qualify for milestones. That’s because you need just 10,000 status points in a year to make your first milestone choice, though you need 20,000 status points to reach the lowest level of elite status: Atmos Silver.

Here are some of the ways to earn status points with Alaska Airlines:

Since Alaska awards status points on flights according to flight distance, fare type, and where you purchased the ticket, you can check your earnings against this chart here.

Alaska Airlines Atmos Rewards Milestone Choices

You have options at each milestone. Some milestones provide just 1 choice, while others provide 2. Once you make a selection, your choice is final, so ensure you’re happy with it before confirming it.

Options include bonus points, complimentary passes for inflight Wi-Fi, gifting elite status to others, and additional perks you may like. Here are the current choices at each milestone threshold:

Which Milestone Perk Should You Choose?

The value you assign to a milestone option is subjective, but it’s worth comparing them to see what you’re getting or giving up by not choosing a different item.

For reference, we value Alaska Airlines points at 1.6 cents each. That makes 750 bonus points worth $12, while 15,000 points are worth $240. The same math applies to a discount on Atmos Rewards Unlocked, for which you can redeem points toward experiences and events. Getting a discount of 10,000 or 25,000 points on these redemptions is worth $160 or $400, respectively.

Inflight Wi-Fi costs $8 on most of Alaska’s flights, while onboard meals cost between $8 and $12.50 if you don’t get a complimentary meal. A single-day visit to an Alaska Lounge costs $65.

Then there are choices that are harder to value. What’s the value you assign to moving into first class on a flight? Is it the cost difference of the ticket against the economy-class pricing, the cost of the food and drinks you consume, or some other number in between? The dollar value attached to upgrade awards may vary from person to person and flight to flight.

That same logic will apply to gifting or sampling elite status for a single trip. For an idea of the value differences, check out our comparison of Alaska Airlines Atmos Platinum and Titanium status.

Then there are the milestones you probably shouldn’t choose. You can get rental car upgrades rather easily by holding the right credit card and matching your status across various programs. And you should consider the lounge membership discount carefully before choosing this option. It’s just a $100 discount on a membership that covers 9 lounges for a cost of $595 — so $495 with the discount.

If you’re flying long-distance with Alaska Airlines in first class (paid or booked with points), with Alaska Airlines’ partners, or on military travel, you can access these lounges before departing without paying. You can also access the lounge if you have elite status with a Oneworld airline and are traveling beyond the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. However, that restriction doesn’t apply to those whose elite status comes from airlines other than Alaska and American Airlines, so British Airways Club members, for example, can access the lounges for free when flying in a premium cabin with a Oneworld airline regardless of destination.

As you consider the value of your options, consider both the tangible and intangible to see what value you’ll get from a benefit. Make sure to choose a perk that you’ll use and that you’ll be happy with. Remember that all choices are final.

Hot Tip:

There are other airport lounges you can visit. Memberships like Priority Pass can give you lounge access regardless of what airline you’re flying with that day. Check out our list of the best credit cards for gaining airport lounge access.

Final Thoughts

Alaska Airlines added milestones to its Atmos Rewards program in 2025. Similar to what we’ve seen with other airline and hotel loyalty programs, guests can earn choice benefits after certain thresholds are met during the year. Some options are clearly better than others, and it’s important that you clearly understand the perk and its value before making a selection, given that all choices are final.",https://upgradedpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Alaska-Airlines-planes-at-Santa-Rosa-STS-airport.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 02:56:16.634393

Produk ini membuktikan bahwa kita memiliki kapabilitas dalam memproduksi produk bahan bakar pesawat masa depan,” ungkap Taufik dalam keterangannya, Sabtu (23/8/2025).

Ia menambahkan, PertaminaSAF merupakan produk berkualitas dan ramah lingkungan yang diproduksi oleh salah satu unit operasi KPI, yakni Kilang Cilacap. Produk ini telah melewati serangkaian pengujian kualitas yang ketat di laboratorium KPI Unit Cilacap dan juga di laboratorium eksternal independen Lemigas.

""Ke depan, PertaminaSAF juga akan diujicobakan untuk diproduksi di Kilang Dumai dan Kilang Balongan,"" kata Taufik.

Produksi Pertamina SAF dilakukan dengan teknologi co-processing, menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih buatan anak bangsa. Hasilnya, PertaminaSAF dinyatakan memenuhi standar internasional ASTM D1655 dan DefStan 91-091.

Menurut Taufik, kualitas PertaminaSAF tidak kalah jika dibandingkan dengan produk serupa yang digunakan di negara lain. PertaminaSAF merupakan upaya konkret dalam percepatan pengurangan emisi karbon sebab kandungan karbon di dalamnya lebih rendah 81 persen dibanding avtur berbahan fosil.

Pemerintahan Presiden Prabowo Subianto punya cita-cita besar untuk membangun ekosistem hilirisasi rumput laut. Industri ini diproyeksikan mampu mendatangkan manfaat ekonomi sangat besar, hingga mencapai ratusan miliar dolar Amerika Serikat (AS).

Wakil Menteri Pendidikan Tinggi, Sains, dan Teknologi (Diktisaintek) Stella Christie mulanya bicara tentang pentingnya riset sebagai motor pertumbuhan ekonomi bangsa. Ia juga menekankan, manfaat riset bukan hanya sekadar omon-omon belaka bagi perkembangan negara, salah satunya dalam hal pengembangan industri rumput laut

""Bukan sekadar omon-omon bahwa Indonesia harus penelitian, tetapi nilai ekonominya bisa terasa, baik dalam jangka pendek, maupun dalam jangka panjang. Seperti rumput laut yang harus dibangun dari sekarang,"" kata Stella, dalam acara Pesta Rakyat Untuk Indonesia 2025 di Gedung Smesco, Jakarta Selatan, Sabtu (23/8/2025).

Indonesia merupakan penghasil rumput laut tropis terbesar di dunia. Stella mengatakan, saat ini pasaran rumput laut di dunia mencapai US$ 12 miliar. Namun demikian, Indonesia belum mendapatkan porsi yang banyak dari pasaran dunia tersebut karena belum mengoptimalkan risetnya.

Stella mengingatkan, ratusan miliar dolar AS itu akan hadir apabila industri tersebut benar-benar dibangun. Rumput laut tidak hanya bisa diekspor dalam bentuk mentahan, tetapi juga bisa diolah menjadi nori, bahkan hingga sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""Targetnya suatu saat, ini panjang waktunya, mungkin 10 tahunan, SAF targetnya itu 4 miliar liter di Indonesia. Artinya 10% dari jet fuel demand di dunia, itu akan ratusan miliar dolar AS pasarannya untuk Indonesia. Membuka lapangan pekerjaan yang sangat besar,"" ujar dia.

Namun Stella mengingatkan kembali, apabila ekosistem tidak segera dibangun, bisa-bisa potensi tersebut lenyap begitu saja. Hal ini mengingat negara penghasil produk olahan rumput laut bukan hanya Indonesia.

""Ratusan miliar dolar AS, kalau dibangun. Kalau tidak dibangun, hilang itu ratusan miliar dolar AS. Hilang lapangan pekerjaan yang bisa kita capai. Riset tidak terlepas dari kalian semua,"" ujarnya.

Stella menekankan bahwa riset tidak terlepas dari kehidupan masyarakat. Ia juga mengajak masyarakat bersama-sama mengubah persepsi bahwa riset itu bukan mahal, lambat, ataupun menghasilkan tulisan yang tidak dibaca, tetapi justru efisien, cepat, dan bermanfaat.

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: Delta's bet on Wheels Up is a high-conviction play on the democratization of private aviation.","The airline industry is undergoing a seismic shift. As traditional carriers grapple with margin pressures and shifting consumer preferences, a new frontier is emerging: private aviation. Delta Air Lines, long a leader in commercial aviation, has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation through its strategic investment in Wheels Up, a private jet provider. This partnership isn't just a diversification play—it's a calculated bet on the future of premium travel, leveraging Delta's operational expertise, 20 million SkyMiles members, and a growing demand for high-net-worth (HNWI) mobility.

The Case for Consolidation and Premiumization

The airline sector in 2025 is defined by two overlapping trends: consolidation and premiumization. Full-service carriers (FSCs) and low-cost carriers (LCCs) are blurring their business models, with FSCs adopting cost-cutting measures and LCCs adding premium features to compete. Meanwhile, the private aviation market is booming, driven by a 12% annual increase in business jet deliveries and a 3% rise in global private jet departures in Q1 2025. This growth is fueled by HNWIs—particularly a younger, tech-savvy cohort—who prioritize flexibility, wellness, and sustainability over traditional luxury.

Delta's partnership with Wheels Up taps into this demand. By integrating Wheels Up into its ecosystem, Delta is not only expanding its revenue streams but also redefining access to private aviation. The collaboration allows SkyMiles members to earn one million miles for using Wheels Up, incentivizing 20 million frequent flyers to explore private travel. This is a masterstroke: Delta's sales teams, which manage 45,000 corporate accounts, now serve as a direct pipeline to Wheels Up's hybrid aviation model.

Wheels Up's Restructuring: A Blueprint for Profitability

Wheels Up's financials tell a story of disciplined restructuring. In Q2 2025, the company reduced its net loss by 15% to $82.3 million and trimmed its Adjusted EBITDA loss by 22%. While revenue dipped 3% to $189.6 million, the company's Adjusted Contribution Margin improved by 12.2%, and it maintained a 98% flight completion rate. These metrics underscore Wheels Up's progress in stabilizing its operations.

The company's cost-cutting measures—targeting $50 million in annual savings—will accelerate profitability by 2026. Simultaneously, Wheels Up is modernizing its fleet, shifting toward premium aircraft like the Phenom 300 and Challenger models. By 2025, these planes will comprise 44% of its fleet, enhancing customer appeal and unit economics. Delta's supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) further aligns the partnership with ESG trends, a critical factor for HNWIs who increasingly demand eco-conscious travel options.

The Hybrid Model: Democratizing Private Aviation

Wheels Up's most compelling innovation is its hybrid aviation experience. Customers can now combine Delta's commercial flights with private jet segments, creating seamless, flexible itineraries. For example, a Delta One passenger flying to Athens can add a private jet leg to Capri or Montenegro—all through a unified platform. This model addresses a key pain point: the high cost and complexity of private travel. By offering a “best of both worlds” solution, Wheels Up is democratizing access to private aviation, targeting not just ultra-HNWIs but also high-income professionals seeking occasional luxury.

The data supports this strategy. The Knight Frank Wealth Report notes that demand for super-midsize and large cabin jets has surged among HNWIs, with 23.3% and 7.4% of sales in 2025, respectively. Delta's integration with Wheels Up positions it to capture this demand, leveraging its global network to offer international private jet access. For instance, the U.S. accounts for 69.1% of global private jet departures, with California and Texas as growth hubs—markets where Delta's brand strength and customer base are unparalleled.

Investment Implications: A High-Conviction Play

For investors, the Delta-Wheels Up partnership represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector poised for long-term growth. Wheels Up's restructuring, combined with Delta's operational rigor and customer access, creates a flywheel effect: improved unit economics, expanded market reach, and enhanced customer retention. The company's liquidity—$262 million in gross bookings and $200 million in available funds—provides a buffer as it scales.

Moreover, the private aviation market is projected to grow to $40 billion by 2025, nearly double its 2021 valuation. Delta's early-mover advantage in integrating private and commercial travel could lock in market share as demand accelerates. The airline's ability to monetize SkyMiles through Wheels Up promotions adds another revenue stream, with potential for cross-subsidization between its commercial and private segments.

Risks and Considerations

No investment is without risk. Wheels Up's path to profitability remains uncertain, and the private aviation market is still niche compared to commercial aviation. Regulatory hurdles, supply chain bottlenecks, and competition from rivals like Flexjet and JetBlue's JetBlue Private Jets could test the partnership's resilience. Additionally, the success of the hybrid model hinges on Delta's ability to convert SkyMiles members into Wheels Up users—a behavioral shift that requires sustained marketing and value delivery.

However, these risks are mitigated by Delta's operational expertise and the structural tailwinds of the private aviation sector. The company's commitment to Wheels Up—evidenced by CEO Ed Bastian's public endorsements—signals a long-term vision, not a short-term experiment.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Future of Travel

Delta's partnership with Wheels Up is more than a strategic pivot—it's a reimagining of premium travel. By combining Delta's scale, loyalty program, and global network with Wheels Up's innovative hybrid model, the duo is addressing the unmet needs of HNWIs and high-income professionals. As the private aviation market matures and becomes more accessible, this partnership is well-positioned to capture a significant share of the $40 billion opportunity.

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: Delta's bet on Wheels Up is a high-conviction play on the democratization of private aviation. With restructuring progress, fleet modernization, and a growing demand for premium mobility, this is a long-term investment in the future of travel. The question isn't whether private aviation will grow—it's who will lead the charge. Delta and Wheels Up are already ahead of the curve.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 18:56:21.155368

This sale comes amidst the company's positive Q2 2025 earnings report, which featured a net income of $2.1 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $17 million. The financial results were driven by successful low-carbon ethanol and carbon capture acquisitions.

Gevo's CEO remains optimistic about the company's future growth prospects, particularly in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and carbon credit sales sectors. The company aims to meet the growing global demand for renewable fuels, a segment that is expected to expand significantly in the coming years.

Separately, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has made significant strides in the renewable energy sector. The company's Panipat refinery in Haryana has won the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) ISCC CORSIA certification, allowing it to produce SAF from used cooking oil [2]. This certification is a significant milestone for the Indian aviation industry, which is committed to reducing emissions by blending SAF with conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF).

The Panipat refinery's SAF production will start at 35,000 tonnes per annum, enough to meet the mandated 1 per cent blending requirement for the country in 2027. The certification process ensures that the fuel meets environmental and social standards, setting a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

As the aviation industry continues to adapt to stricter emission standards, companies like Gevo and IOC are at the forefront of innovation, developing sustainable solutions to meet the evolving energy dynamics.

Thandasherry accepted the dare and built a small solar boat in the following months.
At the outset, Thandesherry worked on a few other smaller solar boat projects, mainly for fishing, “but we could not scale the business in the segment”.
I am building boats which are better and cheaper for my customers.
The CEO claims that a Navalt boat needs only 17 kW of power, while a traditional steel boat requires 45 kW of energy.","Whether it’s the shikaras traversing the calm backwaters of Alleppey (Alappuzha), carrying tourists past the coconut groves and quaint fishing villages, or ferries enabling daily commute between townships, or the fishing rafts braving the rough waters of the Arabian Sea to bring food and livelihood, boats are an inseparable part of hustle and leisure in Kerala.

Even as these vessels are woven into the very fabric of life in this southern state, what is hardly talked about is the spiralling cost of running them.

At a time when exports to the US present fresh challenges, Kerala fishermen are battling the changing dynamics of geopolitics and climate change on one hand and the increasing cost of fuel on the other.

The impact is especially severe on fishing communities, as every segment of boat operators is struggling to improve margins amid the rising fuel prices.

As per Kochi-based ex-naval architect Sandith Thandasherry, ferry operators in Kerala are currently spending as much as INR 10,000 daily on diesel per boat, which is significantly impacting their margins.

“My aim has been to solve this problem,” said Thandasherry, who is building solar and electric boats precisely for this cause — to reduce this yearly operational cost by INR 35 Lakh.

His startup, Navalt, is helping coastal communities earn better livelihoods while driving a major shift in water transportation.

Interestingly, Thandasherry is trying to make waves in the boat manufacturing industry at a time when the decarbonisation push has largely been centred around road mobility, with electric vehicles (EVs) taking the spotlight.

With EV adoption no longer a major headache for roads, the aviation sector is clearly witnessing early efforts around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), although large-scale adoption remains a daring effort due to the complexities of the sector. Water transport, on the other hand, continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

Navalt is trying to control a portion of this damage with its solar-electric boats. So, what has truly driven Thandasherry’s interest in solving this real-world problem that has remained overlooked for decades?

A Dare That Led To Navalt

Growing up in Kerala, Thandasherry’s tryst with building boats and ships began in his schooldays, as his family kept encouraging him to pursue naval architecture and engineering.

After his graduation in naval architecture from IIT Madras in 1999, he worked as a naval architect for seven years. During this time, he was part of various shipbuilding projects across Japan and South Korea.

“But unlike what you may think, building solar boats was never part of the plan,” the founder and chief executive of Navalt told Inc42.

Armed with the experience in building ships and an MBA from INSEAD, Thandasherry started giving wings to his entrepreneurial dreams in 2008 by establishing his first venture, Navgathi Marine Design and Construction — a consulting firm that was focussed on making boats efficient and sustainable.

But, within a year, destiny charted a new course for him. Call it a stroke of luck, Thandasherry met a client who showed him a solar boat, which couldn’t evade the seasoned naval engineer’s sharp technical eyes.

He was quick to identify flaws in the design and other inefficiencies, triggering his client just enough to throw him a challenge to build a better solar boat for him.

Thandasherry accepted the dare and built a small solar boat in the following months. This sparked the idea of building boats powered by solar and electric.

At the outset, Thandesherry worked on a few other smaller solar boat projects, mainly for fishing, “but we could not scale the business in the segment”.

This did not stop him. He knew his way forward and decided to build large solar ferries and passenger boats.

He took almost three years to build the tech from scratch and officially launched the first solar and solar-electric passenger boat in 2017, under the parent company Navalt.

Besides its flagship passenger boat named Aditya, the startup today offers fast boats (named Barracuda) to the defence sector, yachts (Vanora), fishing boats (Srav), and roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) boats (Kraken) for carrying heavy vehicles.

Earlier this year, it started exporting its passenger boats, Apollo, to the Maldives. In India, its boats are operational in Kochi in Kerala, Bathinda in Punjab, and Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, just to name a few states.

What’s Under The Hood

The primary objective for the founder has been to help boat and ferry operators achieve better unit economics.

“If I start selling ‘green’ as the value proposition, nobody cares in India. I am building boats which are better and cheaper for my customers. A greener alternative comes as a bonus,” said Thandasherry.

But it was never about technology alone, as the design aspect has always been deeply ingrained in Navalt’s thesis.

Explaining the way Navalt is married to design with efficiency, the CEO said that a locally built 75-seater steel boat weighs around 75 tonnes, but its Aditya weighs just 17 tonnes, thanks to glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) and aluminium.

Besides, the Kochi-based startup has used the computational fluid dynamics technique in its design to reduce the drag of its vessels. The result — reduced energy requirements.

The CEO claims that a Navalt boat needs only 17 kW of power, while a traditional steel boat requires 45 kW of energy.

The boat manufacturer also boasts that the sun powers 70% of the total energy its boats need in a day, and only 30% requirements are met by lithium-ion battery-powered electricity.

“Overall, this cuts running costs by 35X,” the founder said.

However, the upfront cost of these boats is higher compared to fossil-fuel-driven ferries. For instance, Navalt’s Aditya, a 75-seater passenger boat, costs around INR 3.5 Cr, while its diesel counterpart is priced at INR 1.5 Cr.

“But customers recognise the unit economics benefits in the long haul,” he said.

Inside Navalt’s Boatonomic

Since its inception, Navalt has delivered a total of 35 orders. In the first year of its sales, its top line stood at a mere INR 1.7 Cr.

Its revenue stood at INR 17 Cr in FY24 compared to INR 16 Cr in FY23.

Navalt had an order book of 25 boats worth INR 75 Cr in FY25. It managed to deliver 12 boats during the year, clocking a revenue of INR 25 Cr. Despite occasional financial hiccups, the startup has managed to maintain profitability over the last five years.

The Kerala government is Navalt’s biggest customer in terms of order volume. The company has so far delivered 15 orders to the state government. But, this entails a challenge — state-owned entities and government undertakings are infamous for taking more time to make payments, throwing Navalt in rough waters.

For the ongoing fiscal year, Navalt’s order book stands at 37. This order value translates to INR 90 Cr, up 20% YoY.

To keep its boat afloat (pun intended), Navalt raised its first institutional round last month from Banayan Tree Private Equity. The founder did not disclose the total amount of funding Navalt has raised so far.

Fathoming Navalt’s Knots

According to Thandasherry, selling boats is not all plain sailing. Scaling it is a bigger challenge since geographical expansion is difficult, and so is the transportation of large boats to the hinterlands.

“Boat-making business demands a scale where manufacturers should have at least 20 shipbuilding or assembly yards around the country to serve every location,” the founder said, adding that Navalt may take some time to achieve that kind of scale.

Amid turbulent tides, Navalt is moving ahead with resilience.

Last year, the startup ventured into offering electric propulsion systems to other boat builders in India under the brand name Greenship, expanding its offerings and revenue stream. “In the new business, we are getting volume, and it is easier to scale,” shared Thandasherry.

Navalt’s Greenship propulsion system found its first client in Goa, where it launched the state’s first solar boat, making it the first-ever project where the startup’s propulsion system was plugged into a boat built in a different shipyard.

The startup now has more ambitious plans built on its cleantech moat. Aces up its sleeves are the hydrogen fuel cell technology and a propeller that runs on wind. This gives a third alternative to its customers to save money.

Besides, to address the working capital woes, the solar and electric boat builder wants to shift its dependency from government-led projects to acquiring orders from private players and imports.

“Currently, 70% of our orders come from the government, and the rest are private players. Going forward, we want to reverse this ratio,” the founder said.

All in all, Navalt is also looking at a major market opportunity projected to cross the $8 Bn by 2033. While the scope is huge for the company to scale across India, particularly across the coastal belt, as well as in states that harbour rivers and lakes, its voyage ahead will be worth watching.",https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/08/Navalt-Profile-social.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 18:56:26.884195

The research, led by Professors Hong Yang and Yuanhui Zhang from The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, presents a scalable solution that tackles both food waste and fossil fuel dependence. Their findings, published in Science Advances, mark the first SAF production from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

Zhang noted that while there is already ongoing industry activity around SAF production in North America, it largely relies on feedstocks that compete with the food supply, such as soybean oil.

He highlighted that the United States consumes approximately 40 million tons of jet fuel annually, with SAF currently accounting for only about 1 percent. However, he emphasized that this figure could potentially rise to 10 percent–20 percent if biowaste were more widely utilized.

SAF, unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, is produced from renewable resources including biomass, food waste, sewage sludge, and algae. Zhang’s lab has spent nearly three decades developing biocrude oil using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a process that accelerates the natural formation of crude oil from millions of years to just 30 minutes.

The team sourced food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, selecting salad dressing due to its uniformity, high energy content, and ease of processing. The waste was converted into biocrude using HTL and then refined into SAF through catalytic upgrading using nanocatalysts developed in Yang’s lab.

Yang explained that molybdenum carbide is a favorable catalyst for the process due to its outer shell electrons, which interact with biocrude molecules to effectively remove oxygen. He further underscored that there is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed.

Siying Yu, a graduate student at Illinois and the study’s first author, explained that the catalysts must be fine-tuned by incorporating iron atoms and other elements to generate fuel molecules with molecular weights similar to those found in conventional jet fuel.

The research team at Illinois aims to further improve their catalyst design to process a wider variety of bio feedstocks, including algae, sewage, and fermentation products. The technology may also apply to SAF production from oleochemicals and crop-based materials. The study included contributors from multiple departments and institutions, including Washington State University.",https://cdn.gccbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/23191654/food-waste-into-aviation-fuel.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 17:56:38.693315

BINTULU, Aug 23: Sarawak is drafting a new law to mandate the collection of agricultural waste, including oil palm kernels, to be processed into animal feed and biogas as part of efforts to strengthen the State’s circular economy.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg revealed that the Attorney-General’s Chambers is currently drafting the legal framework, which is expected to be ready by the end of this year, to give Sarawak authority to gather agriculture by-products at scale.

“Our aim is to ensure that oil palm kernel waste can be turned into something valuables such as nutritious animal feed when mixed with napier grass, as well as biomass that generates biogas and even Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF),” he said when officiating the Sarawak Agrofest 2025 at the Bintulu Old Airport today.

Abang Johari stressed that while Sarawak has already overtaken Sabah to become Malaysia’s largest oil palm producer, the State has yet to fully exploit the potential of its kernel industry.

With the right mechanisms and economies of scale, he said, the waste could become a new source of income while reducing the Sarawak’s reliance on imported feed.

“Cattle fed with enriched feed in feedlots grow faster and healthier compared to open grazing. At the same time, biomass from palm kernels can be processed into biogas, and biogas into biofuel, including aviation fuel. This is how we diversify income streams and add value within the circular economy,” he explained.

The Premier also noted that Sarawak has vast land resources for cattle development but faces a shortage of expertise, particularly veterinarians.

To address this, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) Sarawak has established a veterinary discipline, while the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) is working to boost manpower in the sector.

He pointed out that cattle farming in Sarawak must differ from the traditional Australian model of open grazing, with the State instead moving towards feedlot systems that rely on locally produced feed.

“NCR landowners who have developed oil palm plantations can also diversify into feedlot and feedstock industries. But to succeed, there must be legal backing and scale in order for us to collect waste effectively and turn it into valuable products,” he said.

Abang Johari added that Food Industry, Commodity and Regional Development Minister Dato Sri Dr Stephen Rundi Utom has visited Brazil to study the latest technologies in livestock and feed development that could be adopted in Sarawak.

Emphasising the broader vision, the Premier said the State’s strategy is not only about boosting food security but also about positioning Sarawak as a producer of next-generation fuels.

“Airlines worldwide are required to use SAF. From our oil palm industry, we can produce this fuel and earn income, making our economy more sustainable. That is the Sarawak way—creating value from resources through innovation,” he said.

Deputy Premier Datuk Amar Dr Sim Kui Hian and Malaysia Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Dato Sri Tiong King Sing were among the distinguished guests present. — DayakDaily",https://i0.wp.com/dayakdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RS_2404.jpg?fit=800%2C533&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-23 20:56:29.619215

Union Unite stated six months ago – on February 23 – Mr Starmer was speaking at the Scottish Labour conference when he promised to make £200 million available from the National Wealth Fund for Grangemouth.

Unite added, despite the refinery, the last one in Scotland, ceasing production in April and hundreds of jobs being shed at the complex, including at the chemicals plant and among contractors based at the site, not one penny of the promised investment has been spent.

Now, in response to what they see as the UK government’s inaction, workers and Unite at Grangemouth have posted an open letter which they are encouraging all affected workers and members of the local community to sign.

The letter states: “As the number of job losses grows each week – there is still absolutely no evidence of any of the £200 million being spent at Grangemouth. Money that was pledged for the revival of Scotland’s industrial cluster. “It’s as clear as ever the fight for the future of Grangmeouth falls to us, politicians may be forgetting what they said but we haven’t. Sign the petition today and demand that Keir Starmer show us the money.”

Unite stated it has produced a detailed and fully costed plan about how the refinery could be transitioned to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The government is promoting the use of SAF to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Unite senior representative at Grangemouth Chris Hamilton said: “Workers and members of the community feel abandoned by a government that has promised to help but has so far totally failed to deliver.

The incident, while disruptive, offered a stark but instructive glimpse into how energy infrastructure must adapt to climate-driven volatility—and how crisis management strategies can shape investor perceptions in an era of escalating environmental risks.

Operational Resilience: From Emergency Response to Long-Term Adaptation

BP's immediate response to the flooding demonstrated a layered approach to risk mitigation. The refinery's emergency protocols included controlled shutdowns of processing units, emergency flaring to relieve pressure, and the deployment of containment booms to prevent water contamination. Specialized equipment was used to remove water from critical zones, while wastewater management systems—retention ponds, containment berms, and stormwater diversion—prevented discharges into natural waterways. These actions, combined with 24/7 coordination with regulators and local authorities, minimized environmental harm and ensured operational safety.

The refinery's phased restart, prioritizing system stability, underscored BP's commitment to operational continuity. By resuming full capacity within a week, the company mitigated regional fuel supply disruptions and stabilized markets. However, the incident also exposed vulnerabilities. The Whiting Refinery had already faced a six-month shutdown in 2024 due to a hydrogen leak and has incurred regulatory penalties in recent years. These recurring challenges have eroded refining margins and raised questions about the long-term viability of aging infrastructure in a climate of increasing extreme weather events.

Environmental Safeguards and Investor Sentiment

BP's environmental safeguards during the crisis were critical in managing reputational and regulatory risks. Air quality monitoring during flaring ensured emissions remained below harmful thresholds, while transparent communication with the public reinforced trust. Yet, these efforts were not enough to fully restore investor confidence.

BP's shares, trading at 419.5 GBX in August 2025, remained 70% below their estimated intrinsic value of 1,381.44 GBX, reflecting broader concerns about refining reliability and ESG performance. The company's underlying replacement cost (RC) profits had declined by 36% in 2024, and ESG downgrades from MSCI and Sustainalytics had increased financing costs. While BP's refining availability reached 96.4% in Q2 2025, the Whiting incident highlighted the fragility of its refining segment, particularly as diesel and jet fuel inventories remain low, squeezing margins.

Strategic Investments in Climate Resilience

BP's response to the 2025 crisis also revealed its long-term adaptation strategy. The refinery has invested in elevated electrical equipment, reinforced containment areas, and advanced weather monitoring systems with predictive modeling. These measures align with industry trends to harden infrastructure against climate risks. Additionally, BP's transformation of the Gelsenkirchen refinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel signals a pivot toward the energy transition, though such projects require sustained capital and operational discipline.

For investors, the key question is whether these investments will offset recurring operational risks. While BP has cut structural costs by $1.7 billion since 2023, its refining segment remains under pressure. shows BP trailing its peers, amplifying concerns about its ability to compete in a decarbonizing energy landscape.

Investment Implications and the Path Forward

The Whiting Refinery incident underscores a critical truth: in the energy transition era, resilience is not just about avoiding disasters but about demonstrating the capacity to recover swiftly and sustainably. For BP, this means balancing short-term operational reliability with long-term decarbonization goals.

Investors should monitor two key metrics:

1. Refining Availability Trends: Sustained improvements in uptime will signal progress in addressing infrastructure vulnerabilities.

2. Energy Transition Execution: Success in projects like Gelsenkirchen's sustainable aviation fuel conversion will determine BP's ability to align with net-zero targets.

While BP's stock appears undervalued relative to intrinsic value models, its path to recovery hinges on credible climate resilience and ESG improvements. For risk-tolerant investors, the company's strategic investments in infrastructure hardening and low-carbon technologies could offer long-term upside. However, those prioritizing stability may prefer peers with stronger refining margins and ESG ratings.

In the end, the Whiting Refinery's story is a microcosm of the energy sector's broader challenge: navigating the dual pressures of climate adaptation and decarbonization. For BP, the next phase of its journey will test whether its crisis management strategies can evolve into a blueprint for sustainable resilience.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 15:56:15.082938

Passengers may still carry one power bank in their hand luggage, but strict new rules will apply to how it’s stored and used during the flight. The Emirates power bank ban of 2025 follows a growing global concern over lithium battery safety.

The new regulations of the Emirates power bank ban:

Following a comprehensive safety review, Emirates announced the ban to reduce risks linked to lithium-ion batteries. The key restrictions are:

Only one power bank is allowed per passenger, with a capacity under 100 watt-hours (Wh).

Power banks cannot be used to charge personal devices during the flight.

Charging power banks from the aircraft’s outlets is prohibited.

The capacity rating must be visible on the device.

Power banks must be stored in the seat pocket or under the seat, not in overhead bins.

Power banks remain banned from checked baggage (existing rule).

Why Is Emirates Banning In-Flight Power Bank Use?

The use of lithium-ion battery power banks has surged in recent years, but so have incidents of overheating and fires. The main risk comes from thermal runaway — a chain reaction where heat builds uncontrollably inside the battery, potentially causing fire, explosion, or toxic gas release.

While most modern smartphones have safeguards against overcharging, many basic or low-cost power banks lack these protections. By banning in-flight use and restricting charging, Emirates aims to minimise the chance of battery-related incidents in the air.

What This Means for Passengers

Long-haul travellers who rely on power banks mid-flight will need to fully charge devices before boarding or use the aircraft’s built-in USB and AC power points.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg, in officiating the launch of Sarawak Agrofest 2025 here today, announced the establishment of the Sarawak Artificial Intelligence Centre (SAIC).

The centre will spearhead research and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in farming and other sectors.

“Agriculture is no longer just about manual labour or traditional methods. With SAIC, we will harness AI to analyse soil composition, identify optimal fertilisers, and match them with local land conditions to maximise yields,” he said.

Citing a successful transformation in Kuala Rajang, Abang Johari noted that 800 hectares of idle land, left barren for over 50 years, were revived for paddy cultivation.

With the aid of technology, these lands now produce up to eight metric tonnes per hectare annually.

“With land and technology, we no longer need to rely on imports. This transformation proves that AI can unlock our soil’s hidden potential and make Sarawak a significant rice producer,” he said.

To further support productivity, the Premier revealed that the Sarawak government is investing RM1 billion in irrigation systems and boosting mechanisation in farming.

In Gedong, for example, mechanised practices raised yields from just 1.2 metric tonnes per season to eight tonnes annually, boosting household incomes by eightfold in 24 months.

Abang Johari also outlined Sarawak’s shift toward a circular agro-economy, where palm kernel biomass is being converted into animal feed, biofuel, and even sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

With Sarawak recently overtaking Sabah as Malaysia’s largest palm oil producer, he said these innovations will reduce imports and open new revenue streams.

Looking ahead, Abang Johari shared several broader economic visions, including renaming Universiti Putra Malaysia Sarawak (UPMS) to boost research; launching Sarawak’s own airline to expand export potential; and introducing free university education from 2026, as part of the government’s commitment to reinvest Sarawak’s wealth into human capital development.

“This is not a ‘Mat Jenin’ dream. With clear policies, methods, and political stability under Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), we are determined to transform agriculture into a lucrative profession powered by knowledge and innovation,” he said.

Abang Johari also highlighted that Sarawak’s annual revenue has grown from RM6 billion to RM14 billion, enabling reinvestment into education and rural development.

“This is the future of Sarawak: strong ideas, stability, and sustainable growth that benefit our people,” he added.

Held under the theme ‘Industrialising Agro Sector Through Smart Technology’, Sarawak Agrofest 2025 runs from Aug 22 to 31 at Lasar Kenyalang here.

KUCHING, Aug 23: Sarawak is opening its doors to skilled professionals from across Malaysia and around the world with the introduction of a five-year working visa, says Deputy State Secretary Dato Sri Dr Muhammad Abdullah Zaidel.

Speaking during a panel discussion at the inaugural Business Writing Workshop organised by Pertubuhan Wartawan Bebas Kuching (Pewarta) today, he highlighted the move as part of the State government’s effort to address immediate manpower needs while preparing local talent for the future.

“Sarawak Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg, through his policy, has introduced a five-year working visa for professionals—not for labourers.

“These professionals, including engineers, can apply for a working visa valid for five years without renewal, making it very convenient for them,” he said.

Muhammad Abdullah explained that the visa is part of Sarawak’s strategy to fill talent gaps while building local expertise.

“This is to fill the gap while waiting for our own talent to develop. For fields like engineering, innovation, and scientific research, we are willing to absorb professionals from West Malaysia.

“The economy is to be shared throughout the country. Sarawak prospers, the country prospers,” he added.

He also praised the efficiency of the State’s immigration and related agencies in processing applications, particularly for specialists such as doctors and engineers.

The initiative is expected to support major projects in sectors including hydrogen, oil and gas derivatives and methanol production, ensuring that Sarawak continues its trajectory toward economic growth and industrial advancement. – DayakDaily",https://i0.wp.com/dayakdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-23-at-18.26.57.jpeg?fit=1200%2C823&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-23 16:56:13.174692

Pelita Air melakukan penerbangan perdananya Jakarta-Bali menggunakan bahan bakar olahan dari minyak goreng bekas atau yang biasa disebut jelantah (Used Cooking Oil - UCO).

Sekretaris Jenderal Kementerian ESDM Dadan Kusdiana, mewakili Menteri ESDM, mengatakan pemanfaatan ini dilakukan oleh PT Pertamina (Persero) yang dilabeli Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) dan menghasilkan energi bersih, memangkas emisi karbon, serta ramah lingkungan. Kementerian ESDM kata Dadan langkah ini sejalan dengan program prioritas Presiden Prabowo.

""Ini adalah program Pak Presiden, Asta Cita harus terus kita laksanakan. Ketahanan energi, dan untuk yang ini tidak hanya ketahanan energinya, tapi juga swasembadanya. Jadi kemandiriannya juga semakin kuat,"" ujar Dadan dalam keterangan tertulis dikutip Jumat (22/8/2025).

Pertamina menyatakan SAF berbahan baku UCO ini mampu memangkas emisi karbon hingga 84% dibandingkan avtur fosil. Hal ini menjadi salah satu daya tarik utama dari inovasi yang dikembangkan di Kilang RU IV Cilacap, karena menawarkan peluang konkret bagi industri penerbangan untuk menurunkan jejak karbonnya tanpa mengorbankan standar keselamatan dan performa.

Secara teknis, bioavtur yang diproduksi di RU IV Cilacap telah memenuhi standar kualitas nasional melalui Surat Keputusan Direktur Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi Nomor 70 Tahun 2025, serta standar internasional ASTM D1655 dan Defstan 91-091, syarat penting agar bahan bakar tersebut dapat dipakai aman pada pesawat terbang.

Untuk memastikan pasokan bahan baku yang stabil, Pertamina merangkul masyarakat lewat program pengumpulan minyak jelantah. Saat ini 35 titik pengumpulan telah didirikan di lokasi-lokasi strategis, memberi kemudahan bagi warga mengelola limbah rumah tangga sekaligus menerima saldo rupiah sebagai insentif.

Dadan mengatakan transisi energi bersih di Indonesia bukan sekadar wacana, melainkan rangkaian langkah praktis, mulai dari pemanfaatan potensi bioenergi, integrasi teknologi kilang, dan partisipasi masyarakat dalam pasokan.

Namun, masih ada pekerjaan rumah, terutama pada pengembangan bioetanol dan penguatan kerja sama lintas lembaga.

""Pertamina bersama seluruh stakeholders sudah membuktikan kita ini raja untuk biodiesel di dunia. Tidak ada yang mengalahkan untuk yang ini. Tapi kita masih punya tantangan untuk yang bioetanol. Banyak pekerjaan sudah dilakukan, memang kami mengajak bahwa tidak bisa hanya sektor hilir yang bertanggung jawab,"" tuturnya.

Pengembangan SAF ini bukan lompatan tanpa jejak. Sejak 2021, kolaborasi Pertamina dengan Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) telah menghasilkan bahan bakar dengan campuran bioavtur hingga 2,4% (J2,4) melalui mekanisme coprocessing di TDHT 1 RU IV Cilacap.

Uji coba pertama dilakukan pada bulan Oktober 2021 menggunakan pesawat teregistrasi militer Dirgantara Indonesia, CN235-200 FTB, rute Bandung-Jakarta.

Dua tahun kemudian, pada Oktober 2023, pengujian dilanjutkan untuk pesawat komersial dengan uji terbang Boeing 737-800 milik Garuda rute Jakarta-Solo-Jakarta, sebuah rangkaian yang memperkuat bukti kesiapan penggunaan bahan bakar hijau pada armada pesawat.

Direktur Utama KPI, Taufik Aditiyawarman mengatakan penerbangan ini bukan sekadar perjalanan udara biasa, melainkan tanda transisi energi yang semakin nyata di Indonesia.

""Pertamina SAF adalah sebuah langkah besar dalam dunia aviasi di Indonesia. Penerbangan spesial ini sekaligus menjadi bukti kalau KPI bisa menjadi pelopor energi hijau di Indonesia. Produk ini membuktikan bahwa kita memiliki kapabilitas dalam memproduksi produk bahan bakar pesawat masa depan,"" ungkap Taufik.

Ia menambahkan, Pertamina SAF merupakan produk berkualitas dan ramah lingkungan yang diproduksi oleh salah satu unit operasi KPI, yakni Kilang Cilacap. Produk ini telah melewati serangkaian pengujian kualitas yang ketat di laboratorium KPI Unit Cilacap dan juga di laboratorium eksternal independen Lemigas.

""Ke depan, Pertamina SAF juga akan diujicobakan untuk diproduksi di Kilang Dumai dan Kilang Balongan,"" tambah Taufik.

Produksi Pertamina SAF dilakukan dengan teknologi co-processing, menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih buatan anak bangsa. Hasilnya, Pertamina SAF dinyatakan memenuhi standar internasional ASTM D1655 dan DefStan 91-091.

Menurut Taufik, kualitas Pertamina SAF tidak kalah jika dibandingkan dengan produk serupa yang digunakan di negara lain. Pertamina SAF merupakan upaya konkret dalam percepatan pengurangan emisi karbon sebab kandungan karbon di dalamnya lebih rendah 81% dibanding avtur berbahan fosil.

""Pertamina SAF adalah bioavtur sustainable pertama yang memiliki sertifikat internasional sustainability ISCC CORSIA berbahan baku campuran UCO atau minyak jelantah yang diproduksi di Indonesia,"" kata Taufik.

Keunggulan lain, titik beku (freezing point) Pertamina SAF melampaui standar internasional. Taufik mengatakan, menurut standar internasional, spesifikasi titik beku avtur pada ketinggian yang jelajah pesawat komersial yakni minus 47 derajat celcius. Sementara di ketinggian yang sama, titik beku Pertamina SAF, bisa lebih rendah dari spesifikasi tersebut.

""Pertamina SAF tidak akan membeku di kondisi ekstrem, sehingga aman digunakan selama penerbangan. Aspek keselamatan yang sesuai bahkan melebihi standar internasional menjadikan produk ini memiliki nilai tambah yang semakin tinggi,"" tutur Taufik.",https://awsimages.detik.net.id/api/wm/2025/08/22/pertama-di-indonesia-minyak-jelantah-jadi-bahan-bakar-pesawat-1755834927165_169.jpeg?wid=54&w=650&v=1&t=jpeg,N,,2025-08-23 17:56:57.348066

Forests are going from carbon sinks to carbon sources

By absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere for photosynthesis during the day and releasing excess CO2 into the air at night, vegetation (in forests, grasslands, mangroves, peatlands, swamps, etc.) has played a crucial role in keeping the atmospheric CO2 level just right for humans since the last Ice Age.

CO2 makes up only 0.04% of the air around us, but even at such a low concentration it has, for the last 12,000 years, kept the global temperature at an average of about 15oC, which has allowed humans to thrive over most of the world’s land surface. To use the now well-worn metaphor, atmospheric CO2 acts like a blanket around the Earth to stop us freezing to death. Without it, most of the incoming sun’s energy would be radiated back in to space and the average global temperature would be about -21oC – much too cold for humans. But the amount needs to be just right. Too little CO2 in the atmosphere and it gets too cold for humans, too much and it gets too hot for human comfort, health and, eventually, survival. Just for comparison, the global difference between an ice age and a period between ice ages has averaged about 5oC.

Over the last 200 or so years, humans have been pumping more and more CO2 into the atmosphere, principally as a result of burning fossil fuels and releasing the carbon in them that has been buried deep underground for the last 300 million years. Thankfully, vegetation has been doing humans a great service by removing about 30% of that additional fossil fuel-generated CO2. Forests, in particular, have played a highly significant part in this removal process and are often referred to as “net carbon sinks” because they absorb more CO2 from the air during the day than they release into it at night.

Over recent decades, however, the ability of the world’s forests to absorb CO2 has declined and CO2 emissions from them have increased. The inevitable outcome has been a reduction of the net carbon sink created by forests. The histogram below shows that 20 years ago forests had a net effect of removing around 8 Gt CO2/year, but that it has been steadily decreasing since then and in 2023 and 2024 it was about only 2 Gt CO2/year. The result has been an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, increased and accelerated global warming, more extreme weather events, some of which are also more extreme, and increased harm to humans and damage to food and water security, infrastructure and the environment itself.

The principal cause of forests’ declining sink effect during the 21st century has been humans (see histogram below). Half the decline in the size of the sink has been due to the clearing of forests for agriculture, but logging has also been a significant problem. The area of forest cleared for mining, human settlements and infrastructure has overall been very small, but it has had devastating effects on many local ecosystems and communities, particularly Indigenous populations.

The situation changed in 2023 and 2024 when extreme fires all around the world and across many latitudes caused a 75% reduction in forests’ ability to absorb CO2 and a 2-3 fold increase in the CO2 produced by trees.

The good news is that globally forests still act as a net carbon sink, but the bad news is that the effect is weakening and some forests, such as the Bolivian Amazon and the Canadian boreal forests, are now net sources of carbon.

What do we need to do to protect the ability of forests to continue to function as a net carbon sink and protect Earth’s Goldilocks temperature? Same old, same old:

Stop logging native forests and let naturally regenerating secondary forests stand longer. Middle-aged secondary forests and tropical and sub-tropical primary forests are particularly good at absorbing CO2;

Reduce fire risk through prescribed burns, thinning, fire-resilient reforestation, etc.;

Sustainably manage working forests;

Support the Indigenous people who have over time proven themselves good at protecting forests;

Reduce the overconsumption of food, timber, minerals etc. and align supply chains with forest protection; and one other thing … what can it be?

… oh yes, reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

(For completeness, I’ll also mention that when the Earth warms due to more CO2 in the atmosphere, the area covered by ice diminishes and the land and water surface area grows. Ice, being highly reflective, reflects much of the sun’s energy that hits it back into space, but land and sea absorb much more of that incoming energy than ice. So, as the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere rises, not only does Earth get a thicker blanket, it also replaces a mirror with a red brick pavement.)

Extreme weather events, food prices and social upheavals

Since 2022, there have been multiple examples of extreme weather events (higher temperatures, floods, droughts, hail and cyclones, sometimes followed by opportunist pests) affecting an agricultural area and causing a rapid rise in the price of food. Sometimes several crops have been damaged and sometimes one in particular; sometimes the damage has been mainly local, sometimes global, sometimes temporary and sometimes long-term. For instance:

Heat waves in East Asia in 2024 caused increases in the price of Korean cabbage by 70% and Japanese rice by 50%;

Droughts in California and Arizona in 2022 contributed to an 80% rise in US vegetable prices, and in Southern Europe in 2022/23 droughts caused a 50% rise in the price of Spanish olive oil, which constitutes 40% of world supply;

Following a drought in 2023, heat waves in February 2024 in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which together supply nearly 60% of the world’s cocoa, caused cocoa prices to increase globally by 300% by April;

And who could forget that floods in Queensland in 2022 caused the price of lettuce to rise by 300%?

Climate-driven food price spikes can have serious social consequences such as increased food insecurity, particularly in low-income families; less healthy food choices exacerbating health problems such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer, with flow-on consequences for people’s mental health and the health system; and increased inflation leading to higher interest rates that put further pressure on already stressed household budgets. All of these can have electoral consequences and there is evidence of food price inflation contributing to social upheaval and revolutions, for instance in France in 1789, Russia in 1917 and North Africa in 2011 (the ‘Arab Spring’).

The obvious sensible response to these climate-driven food price surges is to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to lower the risk of global warming and extreme weather events. As there is little hope of that happening in the foreseeable future, action is needed to better prepare societies to respond to the increasingly likely failures of essential crop. For instance:

Timely information about the next year’s weather and the possible effects on crops and prices allows producers to change crops and/or planting schedules;

Better understanding of climate change, combined with government incentives, could help farmers make long-term changes to crop selections and agricultural methods;

Depending on local circumstances, implementation or abandonment of irrigation schemes;

Social security programs that strengthen the capacity of vulnerable groups to prepare for, and respond to, climate-driven food price shocks; and

Multidisciplinary research and planning to identify the complex local and global interactions of the environment, farming, food and transport systems, trade, socio-economic factors, prices and political systems.

Sustainable aviation fuel fails to take off

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a kerosene-like fuel that is not produced from fossil fuels. SAF might be produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, used cooking oil, household waste, alcohol or biomass, for example. Although SAF does not come from fossil fuels, when it’s burnt in the plane’s engines it still produces about the same CO2 emissions as standard aviation fuel. SAF can currently constitute up to 50% of a plane’s fuel.

On 21 July, Bloomberg Green Daily published the graph below that compares the International Air Transport Association’s target for the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (as a percentage of all aviation fuels) in 2030 with the actual usage since 2020. The disparity between aspiration and achievement is disappointingly similar to that seen in many other industries.

International Airlines Group, a large European company that owns various airlines including British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia, led the way in 2024 with 1.9% of its fuel use provided by SAF, but even then its emissions from fuel combustion rose by 5% during the year. Generally speaking, European airlines are performing better than those from the US, although that isn’t saying much. SAF made up 0.22% of the fuel used by Qantas.

Globally, the use of SAF is expected to increase from 0.3% to 0.7% this year, but air travel is expected to increase by 6%, so emissions are going to increase again.

That all said, SAF is highly unlikely to be a either a significant or a long-term contributor to solving the aviation industry’s (admittedly hard-to-abate) emissions problem. A new generation of planes that use different sources of energy (e.g., batteries, hydrogen and hybrid) is urgently needed, but that’s a story for another day.

Overall, though, the industry does not seem to be trying very hard to make the transition.

Bye-bye coal

I imagine that this received good coverage in the mainstream media but I missed it, so just in case you did too, here’s your chance to catch up with the fun video of the simultaneous detonation of eight cooling towers in England recently.

Oh, to be in England

With no coal power there,

And whoever wakes in England

Sees, each morning, much cleaner air.
