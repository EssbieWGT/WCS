At a share price of $68.65, Corteva has seen a 30 day share price return of 5.45% and a 90 day share price return of 11.03%. Its 1 year total shareholder return of 21.48% and 5 year total shareholder return of 65.84% indicate momentum has been building around the recent Etlas and Hexagon Bio announcements, despite short term volatility and legal headlines.

If this kind of transition toward bio based fuels has your attention, it could be a good moment to scan other that are reshaping how we think about long term resilience and structural demand.

With the stock at $68.65, a value score of 0, an intrinsic value estimate that sits about 8% above today’s price and a roughly 14% gap to analyst targets, is there still upside here, or is future growth already priced in?

Most Popular Narrative: 11.7% Undervalued

With Corteva last closing at $68.65 versus a narrative fair value of about $77.76, the story centers on measured growth, higher margins and a richer earnings profile over time.

Advancements in Corteva's innovation pipeline, including premium trait launches (Vorceed, PowerCore), expansion of biological products, and gene editing, enable premium pricing, secure market share, and improve product mix, translating into higher gross margins and earnings growth. Accelerated adoption of sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural inputs, supported by favorable policy shifts in gene editing and biofuels, positions Corteva for outsized growth as regulatory and consumer preferences move toward biological and reduced-chemical solutions. This can expand both revenue and addressable market over the long term.

Curious how moderate revenue growth, rising margins and a premium P/E all come together to support that higher fair value line? The key assumptions might surprise you. One element hinges on future earnings power, another on what multiple the market could be willing to pay. Want to see exactly how those moving parts stack up?

Result: Fair Value of $77.76 (UNDERVALUED)

However, slower crop protection demand and tougher environmental or regulatory requirements could squeeze margins and challenge the higher earnings and P/E assumptions behind that 11.7% undervaluation story.

Another View: What Earnings Multiples Are Saying

The fair value narrative points to Corteva trading about 11.7% below a US$77.76 estimate, but the earnings multiple tells a more cautious story. At a P/E of 27.6x, the stock sits above both its fair ratio of 25.3x and the US Chemicals industry at 25.2x, as well as above peers at 15.1x.

That gap means you are paying a richer price for each dollar of earnings today, which can limit room for disappointment if growth or margins fall short. So does the premium reflect solid conviction in the earnings path, or does it leave less margin for error at this price?

On climate risk, Srivastava said infrastructure projects typically span 20 to 25 years, making climate considerations unavoidable.
He said IIFCL is also standardising monitoring, reporting and verification protocols for green finance.","By Kaushal Verma

New Delhi [India], January 10 (ANI): India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) is preparing to dilute up to 25% of its government stake as part of its next phase of evolution, ahead of the proposed Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the Financial year 2027.

Speaking with ANI, Deputy Managing Director Palash Srivastava on Saturday, said that this move is likely part of the government's strategy to raise funds for infrastructure development and to promote private-sector participation.

""There is a lot of preparation to do, and we are on course for this to happen,"" Srivastava told ANI, adding that the timing of the proposed divestment aligns with a period when IIFCL's funding strategy is increasingly integrated with global capital markets.

IIFCL DMD's remarks came in the backdrop of reports that the government is considering selling stakes in IIFCL, its long-term infrastructure lending arm, and that the ministerial panel is expected to finalise the IPO structure, which may combine fresh equity issuance and a partial government stake sale to meet public shareholding norms.

IIFCL is a wholly owned Government of India company that provides long-term financing and advisory services for viable infrastructure projects in India, covering sectors such as energy, transport, water, and digital infrastructure, with the aim of boosting national development.

Talking on how global interest rate cycles affect infrastructure financing, Srivastava said IIFCL is ""very much linked to the global financing system"" and regularly borrows internationally on the strength of its own balance sheet. ""We have found that international market rate cuts also help our rates go down,"" he said.

He said IIFCL's borrowing rates are flexible and benchmark-linked. ""When the benchmark rates are cut, our rates also come down,"" Srivastava said, noting that this improves margins on infrastructure projects and makes IIFCL's participation in direct lending and takeout finance more competitive.

Highlighting the importance of floating-rate structures, he said, ""The floating rate regime is helping us tide over,"" adding that close to 55 per cent of IIFCL's portfolio is currently on a floating-rate basis. He said institutions funded through amortising and floating-rate loans or bonds benefit more from rate cuts, while those relying largely on fixed-rate bonds may see less impact.

On India's green transition, he said development finance institutions are ""actually the main influencers"" in making infrastructure projects green. He said the transition covers multiple dimensions, starting with renewables, where India has already made significant progress.

""About 500 gigawatt of solar and wind capacity is already in place,"" he said, adding that further expansion will not only help meet national targets but also promote manufacturing through green energy.

Srivastava said DFIs are also enabling the transition of hard-to-abate sectors. Referring to sustainable aviation fuel, he said, ""We have actually financed the sustainable aviation fuel export from India into the UK,"" demonstrating how financial institutions can provide enabling finance and effective support mechanisms for green transition.

On MSMEs, Srivastava said green transition must also extend to small enterprises. ""Our MSMEs also have to turn green,"" he said, adding that IIFCL is working with NITI Aayog on a programme to aggregate MSMEs in industrial clusters or estates. ""Aggregation is going to help,"" he said, noting that green energy can be supplied through rooftop solar or open access, while overcoming RESCOs' reluctance to take individual MSME credit exposure.

He said DFIs are also contributing through blended finance and guarantee mechanisms. ""There are certain conversations about green guarantees and green insurance,"" he said, describing them as part of the broader toolkit to help the Indian industry transition to green.

On geopolitical risks, Srivastava said geopolitics is ""a very important contributor"" to long-term infrastructure outcomes, especially in maritime infrastructure. ""Geopolitics affects trade first and foremost,"" he said, adding that trade dynamics shape the infrastructure ecosystem supporting export and import activity.

He said recent disturbances have shown how trade corridors and connectivity plans can be disrupted, underscoring the need for resilience in long-term infrastructure planning.

Turning to global supply chains, Srivastava said diversification trends have accelerated in recent years. ""Most economies don't want to put all their manufacturing in one country,"" he said, adding that manufacturing and secondary economic activities are increasingly shifting from the Global North to the Global South.

He said this presents opportunities for India, particularly in electronics manufacturing. ""We have been in conversations with bilateral partners like JBIC,"" Srivastava said, noting that long-term blended finance can help develop clusters, create value chains and strengthen shipping and logistics linkages.

Srivastava also said IIFCL has been in touch with the Sagarmala Development Finance Corporation and may partner with it under the proposed Maritime Development Fund.

Further on technology, he said artificial intelligence should be seen as ""a smart support system"" rather than a replacement for human judgment. ""I don't see it as anything more than an iteration over the decision support systems we already have,"" he said.

He said IIFCL has begun planning a transition to AI and machine learning to flag regulatory, compliance, international mandate-specific, and technology risks when a case is uploaded. ""This will enable an appraiser to get a broad brush reference immediately,"" he said.

Srivastava also discussed blockchain and smart contracts, noting that IIFCL would like to move toward smart financing. ""This will enable just-in-time financing to flow to projects and bring down the overall cost of financing,"" he said.

On global slowdown concerns, Srivastava said the key challenge to infrastructure growth is perception. ""The risk perception definitely affects investments,"" he said, stressing that policy continuity, consistent stress asset resolution and predictability in awards are critical to sustaining private sector capital expenditure.

On infrastructure demand, he said India's requirements remain structurally strong. ""As a country of 1.45 billion people, we definitely have a lot of infrastructure to build,"" Srivastava said, adding that domestic infrastructure demand is not materially affected by international impulses.

On climate risk, Srivastava said infrastructure projects typically span 20 to 25 years, making climate considerations unavoidable. ""These days, we are designing for climate events,"" he said, citing floods, droughts, cyclones and high-speed winds.

He said design parameters increasingly account for 1.5-degree and 2-degree temperature-rise scenarios, even though this entails additional costs. ""Together with CDRI, we have evolved a framework whereby financing for disaster-resilient infrastructure could be taken up,"" he said.

On funding strategy, he said external commercial borrowings are becoming a structural necessity. ""If I am trying to borrow money for 15 years or 20 years, I am not getting it in the commercial market in India,"" he said.

He added that IIFCL recently raised a 15-year amortising overseas loan at a very competitive cost using structured finance and hedging. ""Hedging is not such an issue,"" he said, noting that international banks can provide all-in hedging solutions.

On currency markets, Srivastava said improved rupee-dollar hedging frameworks could support deeper and more stable derivative markets. ""If DFIs collaborate, we could create economies of scale and get better hedging solutions,"" he said.

Highlighting internal developments, he said IIFCL has constituted 11 task forces to reinvent the institution. ""We are looking at a batch of new product offerings,"" he said, including bridge finance to address the 6 to 18 month delay in financial closure and subordinated debt products to support state governments in projects such as hybrid annuity models.

He said IIFCL is also standardising monitoring, reporting and verification protocols for green finance. ""We want a common MRV protocol,"" he said, so that international green capital does not impose additional conditionalities on Indian institutions.

Srivastava added that IIFCL is strengthening engagement with India-based multilaterals such as the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the Global Bioenergy Alliance as it prepares for the next phase of growth. (ANI)

Fossil-based jet fuel is a critical commodity of concern for militaries worldwide, yet strategic thinkers, engineers, and leaders in the Royal Air Force (RAF) are exploring alternatives.

Military preparedness does not only require the newest technology; it needs the most advanced sources of energy. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) presents a critical new security asset for defence policies that can reduce dependency on non-renewable sources and fragile fuel supply chains. It also highlights a change in Western strategic thinking, forecasting how multi-polar dynamics are set to evolve globally.

This article is the opinion of the author and not necessarily that of the UK Defence Journal. If you would like to submit your own article on this topic or any other, please see our submission guidelines.

Western air forces face fundamental risks in access to global fossil fuel supply chains, whether from uncertainty in the Middle East, the Caribbean, or unfair trade practices from state-run companies in China or Russia. The RAF is dependent on imported oil, creating higher costs, vulnerable reliance on exporting countries, and inflexibility in military readiness and operational capacity. Using SAF as an alternative fuel actually reduces regular jet fuel use by 50%, with a healthy by-product of reducing carbon emissions by over 80%. SAF works by refining and distilling combustible hydrocarbons derived from fats, oils, wood waste, alcohols, and other organic materials into a fuel that is chemically similar to traditional jet fuel.

The distillation process removes impurities such as sulphur and aromatics, resulting in a cleaner-burning fuel that produces fewer particulates, burns more efficiently, and improves engine performance and longevity. SAF undoubtedly diversifies supply chains, and military demand incentivises chemical engineers to develop new fuels using on-shored production facilities.

The RAF has been flying jets with sustainable aviation fuels since 2021, but recently, Chinese manufacturers have taken the lead in exporting SAF to Europe. Chinese companies are expected to meet state-mandated export quotas, increasing manipulated market competition and raising concerns about the fuel as a strategic security asset. China holds the second-largest aviation market, positioning it to easily overpower Western markets through more streamlined manufacturing and state-run initiatives.

SAF has been costlier than traditional fossil fuels, especially in western markets where production efficiency lacks optimisation, feedstock supplies need expansion, and price differentials remain high. Markets have also lacked crucial intermediaries between innovation and military use. Logistics, aggregation, and cross-border distribution form the connective layer between SAF innovation and military adoption, where firms such as BGN Group operate.

BGN Group, a Swiss-based commodity trader, has secured a series of strategic SAF deals in recent years, designed to decouple aviation fuel supply chains from traditional, often volatile, oil-producing regions. By investing heavily in both infrastructure and supply logistics, the firm sets an example for the private sector to insulate sensitive and overly reliant industries from geopolitical vulnerabilities. These efforts are particularly critical for high-stakes operators like the RAF, where fuel and energy security becomes an issue of national security.

Growth in Western aviation markets has, likewise, been driven by friendshoring and inter-military cooperation. In the United States, for example, alternative fuels are being used to enhance mission flexibility and operational effectiveness, allowing military operations to utilize local or regionally produced fuels even when far from larger bases. SAF technology and information are shared between the US and European states through NATO cooperation, procurement, and shared production contracts. In 2022, the RAF flew a 100% sustainable flight using genetically modified bacteria as a fuel source and flew a drone using a synthetic fuel in collaboration with the US Navy.

In admiration of the success, Defence Procurement Minister Jeremy Quin said, “This is an exciting moment for the RAF and British industry as they continue to develop pioneering solutions to help address climate change. These new approaches will maintain our world-class fighting forces whilst reducing our carbon footprint.” While the US Navy noted that “finding innovative solutions to operational challenges, and the ability to manufacture this fuel without large infrastructure requirements would be ground-breaking for deployed forces.”

Defence industries in both Brussels and Washington are aligning as SAF development improves defensive capabilities and meets carbon emission reduction goals. The Department of Defense has steadily increased funding into the hundreds of millions of dollars for individual grants, research, and SAF procurement pilots. Similarly, offtake agreements across the public and private sectors in Europe and the US are stabilising demand expectations and encouraging long-term market trust and sustainability. In late 2025, three Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) were signed between Houston-based XCF Global (SAFX) and Impact Jets, BGN Group, and FlyORO, each aiming to scale SAF manufacturing, marketing, and supply chain solutions. BGN explicitly builds out supply chains and expands SAF distribution capacity while operating within the Western regulatory environment.

As they note in the MoU, the demand for SAF is expected to grow to 165 billion gallons annually by 2050, requiring the construction of up to 7000 new facilities worldwide. Western-based SAF development will ultimately advance military capacities for the US Air Force and RAF, reinforcing interoperability planning for the alliance and NATO logistics. Early movers in distillation and supply-chain integration will be best positioned to provide essential components and fuels at scale, ensuring allied forces retain operational flexibility in contested environments.

Team Washington refocused its national security strategy in 2025; however, the new emphasis on ‘America First’ military preparedness still shows strong compatibility with Brussels’ interest in climate sustainability, especially in the area of SAF. Western markets remain poised to scale transformative fuel solutions like SAF, innovating in collaboration through mutual understandings, military cooperation, and directed investments. Industrial alignment and technological transfer is increasing as well, with logistics networks from companies like BGN further supporting British and American strategic interests by participating in IATA trade rules, Western aviation standards, and international rule-of-law norms.

SAF acts as a transition technology, advancing sustainability and military competitiveness. It bridges innovative creators with real defensive needs from Western militaries, practically fulfilling security needs in unforeseen ways. Essentially, the expansion of sources for fuel improves strategic autonomy, reduces exposure to hostile supply chains, and ensures stability for future technological development. In the recent past, impetus for change was largely driven by ESG initiatives and climate narratives; now, however, it is clear that SAF is needed for competitive advantage. Competition with Chinese or Russian manufacturing is important globally, but Western militaries should be aware of supply chain dangers as China aims to dominate the market. SAF technology offers a solution to new thinking about energy independence and resilience, especially when advanced through open-market aligned firms. With the proper investment and government direction, SAF will serve to prepare militaries in new, more cost-effective ways while improving geopolitical autonomy in an increasingly multi-polar world.",https://ukdj.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2024/01/83EAG-20240111-RUSHES-VOYAGER-TYPHOON-TAKEOFFS-002.00_02_37_05.Still018-copy.jpg.iCfh04veMWATAA.0i83YNt8pv.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 06:56:12.161269

Shell plc is no longer just an oil company. It is positioning itself as a full-stack energy and chemicals platform that sells molecules, electrons, and infrastructure across the entire value chain. From liquefied natural gas (LNG) and advanced petrochemicals to EV charging networks and renewable power trading, Shell plc is trying to turn a legacy hydrocarbon engine into a diversified energy machine that can survive — and profit — in a decarbonizing world.

This evolution matters because the traditional playbook for integrated oil and gas companies is under existential pressure. Investors want cash returns, regulators want emissions cuts, and customers want energy that is cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable. Shell plc’s core product today is not a single asset or technology, but an ecosystem: a global portfolio of upstream production, LNG, refining, petrochemicals, power trading, and customer-facing businesses, all wrapped in a narrative of ""orderly transition"" rather than abrupt disruption.

Inside the Flagship: Shell plc

When analysts talk about Shell plc as a product, they are increasingly talking about a portfolio architecture rather than a single headline asset. The company has been reshaping that architecture around several flagship pillars.

1. LNG and gas-centric energy

Shell is one of the world’s largest LNG players, and this is arguably its most defensible and differentiated product line. Through projects in Qatar, Australia, the U.S., and West Africa, Shell plc markets LNG as a transition fuel that can backstop intermittent renewables and displace coal. Its LNG trading, shipping, and regasification infrastructure create a global platform that smaller rivals struggle to match.

Beyond production, Shell’s integrated gas unit acts like a high-frequency logistics and arbitrage machine: buying, routing, blending, and selling cargoes into price-sensitive markets in Europe and Asia. That flexibility became a critical product feature when Russian pipeline gas to Europe collapsed; Shell plc’s LNG portfolio effectively became part of Europe’s energy security toolkit.

2. Integrated refining, chemicals, and low-carbon fuels

Shell has been pruning its older, less efficient refineries and retooling some into so-called ""energy and chemicals parks."" These assets are designed to shift from classic fuels into higher-margin and lower-carbon products: biofuels, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), lubricants, and performance chemicals.

At facilities like Shell’s Energy and Chemicals Park in Rotterdam and its operations in Singapore, the company is investing in renewable diesel, advanced biofuels made from waste feedstocks, and technologies to cut emissions intensity via electrification and carbon capture. The pitch is simple: if Shell can turn refineries into multi-output, lower-carbon product hubs, it can keep the infrastructure advantages of being a supermajor while aligning with net-zero policies.

3. Power, renewables, and EV charging

Shell plc’s growth-facing product set sits in its power and renewables portfolio and its global mobility business. Under the Shell Recharge brand, the company operates thousands of EV charge points across Europe, North America, and Asia, often integrated into its existing retail service stations. This allows Shell to use legacy real estate as a bridge from liquid fuels to electrons.

Beyond charging, Shell has been building a position in power generation and trading: offshore and onshore wind, solar farms, grid-scale batteries, and virtual power plants aggregating distributed energy resources. The company is less a pure-play green generator and more a power-market operator, using its trading DNA to balance intermittency and optimize pricing. For large corporates, Shell plc increasingly sells power purchase agreements (PPAs) and bundled decarbonization solutions rather than just diesel or gas.

4. Customer solutions and digitalization

On the customer side, Shell plc is wrapping all of this into more integrated offerings: fleet solutions that combine fuel cards, EV charging, telematics, and route optimization; B2B decarbonization packages blending biofuels, offsets, and consultancy; and digital apps that link retail fuels, charging, and loyalty programs.

The unifying theme is that Shell is trying to move from commodity seller to service provider. While molecules and megawatt-hours are still the revenue engine, the differentiation increasingly comes from integration, optionality, and data.

Market Rivals: Royal Dutch Shell A (alt) -> Shell plc vs. The Competition

Shell plc does not operate in a vacuum. Its closest peers are other European integrated energy majors that are undergoing their own transitions: BP plc and TotalEnergies SE are the most direct competitors, with ExxonMobil and Chevron acting as U.S.-centric hydrocarbon counterpoints.

BP: The ""Reinvented"" Energy Company

Compared directly to BP’s integrated energy portfolio, Shell plc looks more conservative but also more balanced. BP spent the early 2020s branding itself around aggressive renewables growth, from offshore wind auctions to large solar pipelines. It positioned EV charging under the BP Pulse brand and chased early-mover status in green power retail in markets like the UK and Germany.

However, BP backtracked on some of its most ambitious targets under investor pressure to prioritize returns from oil and gas. Shell plc, by contrast, set less extreme renewables volume targets but focused heavily on LNG and cash generation, using those flows to fund both shareholder returns and selective low-carbon bets.

In practical product terms:

Renewables and power: BP has been more aggressive in headline gigawatt-scale wind and solar projects. Shell plc leans more on LNG and power trading, plus targeted renewables plays where it can monetize volatility.

EV charging: BP Pulse vs. Shell Recharge is a tightly contested race. Shell’s advantage is its vast retail footprint and its ability to bundle charging with convenience retail and fleet services.

Hydrocarbon core: Shell’s LNG portfolio is widely viewed as stronger and more global than BP’s, giving Shell plc a more differentiated gas product.

TotalEnergies: The Multi-Energy Challenger

Compared directly to TotalEnergies’ multi-energy platform, Shell plc faces a rival that has arguably been more coherent in its rebranding from oil major to energy major. TotalEnergies has leaned hard into utility-scale solar and onshore renewables, building pipelines that make it look, in certain markets, as much like a power company as an oil company.

Yet Shell maintains several edges:

LNG scale: While TotalEnergies is a serious LNG player, Shell plc’s LNG trading and shipping network remains the industry benchmark. For customers buying flexible gas supply, that matters.

Retail and mobility: Shell operates one of the world’s largest fuel retail networks, and its pivot to EV charging and convenience retail at scale gives it a consumer presence TotalEnergies is still scaling toward.

Power trading: Shell’s capabilities in energy trading — both physical and financial — give it a formidable position as power markets get more volatile.

ExxonMobil and Chevron: Hydrocarbon Maximalists

Compared directly to ExxonMobil’s upstream-heavy portfolio and Chevron’s hydrocarbon-centered strategy, Shell plc looks more diversified and more aligned with European-style climate regulation. The U.S. majors are focusing on oil, gas, and carbon capture & storage (CCS) with far less emphasis on renewables and EV charging.

This divergence creates a clear competitive contrast:

Shell plc offers institutional investors a way to stay exposed to hydrocarbons, LNG, and cash flows while also owning a real — though still minority — stake in renewables, power, and EV infrastructure.

ExxonMobil and Chevron are effectively pure-play bets on a slower energy transition, while Shell positions itself as a hedge on both speed and direction of change.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Shell plc’s core advantage isn’t that it is the greenest, nor that it is the purest hydrocarbon play. Its edge is that it is building an integrated, transition-ready product stack that can flex depending on how policy, technology, and demand actually evolve.

1. LNG as a strategic backbone

LNG is the closest thing Shell plc has to a flagship product. It underpins the company’s narrative that natural gas will remain essential for power generation, industry, and heating for decades, particularly in Asia and Europe. Shell’s scale in LNG production, shipping, and marketing means it can arbitrage regional price differences and respond quickly when crises hit, as Europe’s gas crunch starkly demonstrated.

Where competitors might own impressive individual LNG assets, Shell plc owns a system. That system-level advantage is difficult and slow to replicate, making LNG a durable differentiator.

2. A portfolio built for optionality

Shell’s strategy emphasizes ""disciplined"" capital allocation into low-carbon businesses rather than all-out land-grabs. This has drawn criticism from climate advocates who want faster decarbonization, but from a product perspective it delivers optionality: if certain technologies — say hydrogen or advanced biofuels — scale successfully and profitably, Shell plc is positioned to ramp up; if they stall, it has not overcommitted.

This optionality-based approach differentiates Shell from BP’s earlier high-ambition renewables push and from Exxon’s low-renewables, CCS-heavy path. Shell plc is essentially selling investors a conviction-lite transition product: meaningful exposure to new energy, but not at the expense of short- and medium-term returns.

3. Customer integration and brand

Few energy companies have the consumer-facing footprint of Shell plc. Millions of daily retail transactions at service stations, a rapidly expanding Shell Recharge EV charging network, and deep relationships with commercial fleets give Shell data, loyalty, and cross-selling opportunities that utilities and pure-play renewables developers lack.

When a logistics company wants to decarbonize, Shell can offer a bundled solution: biofuels and lubricants now, EV and hydrogen options later, digital fleet optimization in the background. That integrated offer is a product in its own right, and it is harder for narrower competitors to match.

4. Trading and risk management as a product layer

As grids fill with variable renewables and as LNG and power markets become more volatile, trading and risk management become central to the value proposition. Here, Shell plc’s decades of experience in commodities trading turn into a software-like moat: complex models, algorithms, and human expertise that help customers manage price swings and supply risks.

Where some competitors sell energy units, Shell increasingly sells energy plus optionality, plus risk hedging — a higher-value bundle that leverages its scale.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

On the financial side, Shell plc — listed in London and other exchanges under ISIN NL0000009827 — remains a bellwether for how markets price the energy transition.

Real-time snapshot

As of the latest market data checked via multiple financial sources (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch) on a recent trading day, Shell plc’s stock was trading in line with other European energy majors, with valuation metrics reflecting a blend of classic oil & gas cash generation and cautious growth expectations in low-carbon segments. When markets are closed, investors focus on the last close price and the trailing performance over the preceding months, which has broadly tracked the swings in oil and gas prices as well as macroeconomic sentiment.

Importantly, the stock remains highly correlated with commodity cycles, but the narrative around it is shifting: investors increasingly scrutinize not just how much capital Shell returns via buybacks and dividends, but also where it allocates growth spend — LNG expansions, refinery-to-chemicals conversions, EV charging rollouts, renewables, and power trading capabilities.

Product portfolio as a valuation driver

The success of Shell plc’s product strategy influences its stock in several ways:

Cash engines: Upstream oil, gas, and LNG remain the core cash machines. Strong performance here funds shareholder distributions and underwrites investments in transition businesses. When these segments deliver high margins, markets are more tolerant of moderate spending on low-carbon projects.

Growth options: EV charging, renewables, and power trading are treated as long-dated growth options. Clear evidence of profitability or scalable competitive advantage in these areas can support a higher valuation multiple versus pure hydrocarbon peers.

Risk profile: A credible transition plan with tangible assets — energy and chemicals parks, LNG expansion, grid-scale renewables, and charging networks — helps reduce regulatory and stranded-asset risk in the eyes of ESG-sensitive investors.

Is it a growth driver?

Right now, Shell plc’s low-carbon and power businesses function more as strategic hedge and optionality than as the primary earnings engine. The growth story is that, over time, a larger share of Shell’s EBITDA will come from power, low-carbon fuels, and customer-centric energy solutions, supported by the LNG backbone.

For investors, Shell plc is effectively a transition hybrid: still heavily dependent on fossil-based revenues, but with a visible — if gradual — reallocation of capital toward products and platforms aligned with a lower-carbon future. How well Shell executes on this product roadmap will determine whether its stock continues to trade primarily as a cyclical oil play or earns a re-rating as a diversified, transition-resilient energy platform.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405014_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 08:56:49.425679

Key challenges and constraints Despite its momentum, the e-commerce air cargo ecosystem faces structural challenges that must be addressed for long-term sustainability.
The future e-commerce air cargo ecosystem will be less about chasing spikes and more about managing predictable, data-driven flows.
As the global supply chain continues to digitalise, the distinction between e-commerce logistics and traditional airfreight will continue to widen.
The continued rise of e-commerce is not simply a trend; it is the foundation of a new air cargo era.","E-commerce has reshaped the world’s air cargo networks at breathtaking speed, and digitalisation, data, and collaboration are key to maximising the benefits.

What began as a small stream of lightweight ‘parcels’ has evolved into one of the industry’s strongest and most resilient growth engines, with volumes acting as a stabilising base amid cyclical downturns.

Even amid global trade uncertainty, capacity fluctuations, and cost pressures, e-commerce operations have continued to grow and evolve, especially in the last 10 years.

While e-commerce growth stabilised following the pandemic-driven surge, e-commerce sales surpassed $6.3trn in 2024 and are forecast to reach $8trn by 2027, according to eMarketer.

Online retail has continued to expand across emerging markets, with Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East showing some of the world’s fastest growth rates.

While maritime and road transport handle the bulk of total e-commerce tonnage, air remains indispensable for cross-border, time-sensitive, and high-value shipments, particularly in the fast-moving sectors of electronics, fashion and healthcare.

Cross-border e-commerce has become a defining force in international logistics. According to IATA, cross-border shipments now represent up to 25% of global air cargo volumes, driven largely by consumer expectations for rapid fulfilment and visibility.

For airports, airlines, cargo ground handlers, and integrators, this segment oﬀers both promise and pressure. Consistent demand is paired with operational complexity that requires agility, digitalisation, and collaboration.

Harnessing technology is key to ensuring the air cargo industry will adapt to sustain and profit from e-commerce over the long term, while embracing flexibility is crucial to effectively deal with challenges.

One such challenge has been the legislative crackdowns on e-commerce this year.

The end of the de minimis exemption in the US saw volumes shift from China-US to China-Europe, demonstrating that the whole industry needs to be alert to how quickly demand and supply chains can shift, although volumes to the US have recovered and not to the detriment of volumes to Europe.

Meanwhile, European Union (EU) member states have agreed to introduce a €3 customs duty per item on e-commerce parcels valued below €150 from July 2026, to bridge the gap until the setting up of the EU Customs Data Hub in 2028. The UK also plans to end the de minimis exemption by March 2029 at the latest.

Rethinking networks and fleets

Airlines have also been forced to rethink the very structure of their cargo networks to support e-commerce developments.

The traditional long-haul, palletised model is evolving toward higher-frequency, regionalised operations, which emphasise speed, predictability, and often smaller shipment sizes.

Airlines are now actively adjusting fleet strategies to align with this demand. Narrowbody and converted freighters, such as 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighters (BCFs) and Airbus A321 passenger to freighter (P2F) conversions, are increasingly deployed to feed major hubs and connect secondary e-commerce gateways.

These aircraft oﬀer the flexibility and cost-eﬃciency needed for dense, high-frequency routes.

Some airlines are taking it further by developing dedicated e-commerce divisions or product verticals. China Airlines, Lufthansa Cargo, and Emirates SkyCargo, among others, have introduced specialised e-commerce solutions that blend air transport with digital order management and last-mile partnerships.

Meanwhile, integrators like FedEx, UPS, and DHL Express continue to expand regional air networks in Asia-Pacific to shorten delivery cycles and support marketplace-driven fulfilment models.

The smaller, high-turnover shipments typical of this trade generate a strong yield per kilogram compared to traditional freight, despite their operational complexity.

From a revenue perspective, e-commerce is reshaping yield management. The smaller, high-turnover shipments typical of this trade generate a strong yield per kilogram compared to traditional freight, despite their operational complexity.

The challenge lies in achieving density and optimising capacity utilisation, especially when balancing postal, express, and general cargo flows on the same aircraft. Air cargo revenue management requires expertise.

Grounding eﬃciency

If airlines are the lift, ground handlers are the pulse of the e-commerce air cargo chain on the ground.

The volume and velocity of e-commerce shipments demand ground operations that incorporate automation, smart data flows, and precision timing.

This is confirmed by Nikolai Schaﬀener, global head of commercial, Swissport International. He says: “Ultimately, the cargo ground handler’s core business is to serve its airline customers. A mindset change is, however, required.

“Swissport encourages the entire community to look beyond the airline customer and provide a larger contribution to the overall air cargo ecosystem. This leads to increased collaboration where there is mutual willingness to do so. It requires entrepreneurial thinking in how the system works.”

The average e-commerce consignment is smaller, less uniform, and less predictable than traditional air cargo. A single flight can carry thousands of individual parcels, each with its own label and data record. For cargo handlers, this translates to higher handling intensity on a piece level and shorter processing windows.

To meet these challenges, major ground handling companies are investing heavily in digital infrastructure and automation.

Schaﬀner confirms: “Our focus is on a digital toolkit that enables transparency and consistency across our global network. We ensure that our Cargo Management System, Cargospot, is installed at each location globally. This enables standardised messaging and communication with our supply chain stakeholders.”

Many airports, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Liege and Leipzig, are developing e-commerce-dedicated terminals, often in partnership with integrators, airlines or large e-commerce platforms.

This includes Swissport with Schaﬀner confirming that “there is huge potential in first- and second-line warehousing”.

He adds: “This has taken place, for example, in our network in Liege and Amsterdam with ‘tailor-made’ handling solutions which are combined under one operational roof.

”Workforce dynamics are also shifting. Automation works hand in hand with manpower to provide the best and most efficient service to our customers.”

Handlers are trying to upskill their workforce to manage data-driven processes, exception handling, and digital traceability through a variety of change management programmes that include third-party workforce models.

These models often provide a great flexibility in the ‘plug and play’ approach, but ultimately, as Schaﬀner states, “the responsibility of delivery towards the customer is not outsourced”.

The future cargo terminal is as much about systems integration as it is about people, forklifts and mobile workstations.

Data handling capability

If e-commerce is the demand engine, data is the fuel. The modern e-commerce shipment travels first through networks of information before it even reaches the aircraft. Transparency, predictability, and digital compliance are non-negotiable.

The industry’s collective digitalisation push is accelerating. IATA’s ONE Record initiative, due to be implemented by 1 January 2026, is a key component to this evolution as it is designed to replace the legacy patchwork of messaging standards with a single, standardised data-sharing model.

With ONE Record, all stakeholders from airlines and handlers to customs and forwarders can access and update the same set of shipment data in real time.

The actual uptake in the industry, however, remains to be seen. It’s not just about the big players; it’s about the larger number of small- and medium-sized organisations at both ends of the supply chain.

This harmonisation is essential for e-commerce, where speed and visibility are critical diﬀerentiators. The goal is to move from a document-driven process to a data-centric supply chain, enabling faster clearance, pre-alerted handling, and predictive exception management.

Complementary eﬀorts such as Cargo iQ performance standards, electronic Air Waybill (e-AWB) adoption, and the expansion of API-based integrations between logistics tech providers are pushing the industry toward true end-to-end transparency, but there is a long way to go.

Airlines and cargo ground handlers are increasingly deploying machine learning models to forecast eCommerce peaks, predict oﬄoad risks, enable network steering, and dynamically allocate resources.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics are also taking hold. Airlines and cargo ground handlers are increasingly deploying machine learning models to forecast eCommerce peaks, predict oﬄoad risks, enable network steering, and dynamically allocate resources.

Customs authorities in several regions, particularly within the EU and Southeast Asia are exploring pre-clearance models using shared data pipelines — allowing shipments to clear before they even land.

The next phase will be interoperability — creating a unified digital language across diﬀerent cargo management systems, marketplaces, and logistics platforms. This is where the real eﬃciency gains will emerge.

Key challenges and constraints

Despite its momentum, the e-commerce air cargo ecosystem faces structural challenges that must be addressed for long-term sustainability.

1. Infrastructure pressure:

Major airport gateways such as Hong Kong, Incheon, Liege, and Amsterdam are seeing record volumes of small parcels, often stretching terminal capacity and sorting capabilities. Without investment in automation and smarter flow management, bottlenecks risk negating air transport’s speed advantage.

2. Data fragmentation:

While digitalisation is advancing, the global picture remains uneven. Many smaller forwarders and handlers still operate on manual or legacy systems. Without the broad adoption of common standards, the full benefits of ONE Record and similar initiatives cannot be realised.

3. Labour and skill shortages:

Handling e-commerce cargo eﬃciently requires both technology and skilled operators. Shortages in ramp and warehouse labour, combined with the need for digitally proficient staﬀ, continue to challenge throughput consistency — particularly in high-volume hubs.

4. Sustainability and public perception:

The e-commerce consumer’s desire for next-day delivery often clashes with growing scrutiny over the carbon footprint of aviation and logistics. Airlines are accelerating the shift toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and fleet renewal, while logistics providers are investing in electric ground vehicles and optimised routing. But achieving measurable progress requires coordinated industry eﬀort and transparent reporting.

Will e-commerce ever plateau?

In the near to medium term, the answer appears to be no. The rate of e-commerce growth may normalise, but it will remain a key driver of air cargo demand.

Delivery expectations are shifting from pure speed to predictability, visibility, and sustainability. Marketplaces and platforms will continue to consolidate their logistics ecosystems, with air cargo serving as the premium layer for time-definite deliveries and high-value goods.

What’s more, new product categories are entering the air e-commerce pipeline. Pharmaceuticals, temperature-sensitive goods, and direct-to-patient healthcare logistics are increasingly adopting the e-commerce model, further integrating traditional special handling cargo with retail distribution dynamics.

As automation and data maturity improve, we may see capacity planning evolve from reactive to predictive. Airlines could dynamically allocate belly space or freighter capacity based on e-commerce demand forecasts linked directly to online sales data.

The future e-commerce air cargo ecosystem will be less about chasing spikes and more about managing predictable, data-driven flows.

Collaborative future

E-commerce has, perhaps unintentionally, become the catalyst for long-needed transformation in the air cargo industry. It has forced stakeholders to confront fragmentation, data silos, and ineﬃciency head-on, therefore driving a collective shift toward integration.

Standardisation is there; it’s been around for a long time through IATA industry standards. But the old-time pain point of adoption is what’s needed to really embed this.

The most successful players will be those who view e-commerce not as a commodity flow but as a collaborative digital ecosystem. Airlines will need to forge freighter partnerships with cargo handlers, postal operators and platforms.

Handlers will need to invest in transparent systems that connect directly to airline and forwarder platforms. Regulators and customs authorities, too, will need to align on data-driven compliance models to enable true global harmonisation.

In this interconnected future, information becomes as valuable as cargo space. Data visibility, operational agility, and sustainable performance will define competitiveness far more than rate per kilo or transit time.

E-commerce has made the sector faster, smarter, and more customer-centric, but also more complex and data-dependent, which is the acceleration that’s been needed for several years to ensure the supply chain truly adopts the digital era.

As the global supply chain continues to digitalise, the distinction between e-commerce logistics and traditional airfreight will continue to widen.

The goal now is to ensure that the entire air cargo ecosystem, from the shipper to the consignee, moves in digital harmony.

The continued rise of e-commerce is not simply a trend; it is the foundation of a new air cargo era. Those who invest early in digital connectivity, harmonisation, and sustainable innovation will not only meet the challenge but define the standard for what comes next.",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/6/2/12262_jameswyattphotoaeroconcept_776922.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 03:57:02.014253

Multiple industry stakeholders and association leaders have gone on record to say that, as far as U.S. ethanol production and opportunity go, Nebraska is second to none.

With 11 (and counting) confirmed plants either sending CO2 through the pipeline or in various stages of work to do so, producers in the Cornhusker State are playing a major role in the latest chapter of the American ethanol success story, says Ben Rhodes, executive director of the Nebraska Ethanol Board. “There has never been a better time than now to be a Nebraska ethanol producer,” Rhodes says.

Don’t be fooled by any perceived bias Rhodes may have for the state he works for. Shortly after the Tallgrass pipeline was officially placed into operation in fall 2025, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw offered his take.

“For the first time since 2000, Iowa is no longer the best place to produce corn ethanol,” Shaw said. “The plants on the Tallgrass pipeline now have a leg up in many ways.”

Plants on the Pipeline

Although it might be hard to determine which ethanol plant agreed in some fashion to participate in the Trailblazer pipeline first, there is no doubt that the first to ship real CO2 was Mid America Agri Products/Wheatland. The western Nebraska plant is the closest to Wyoming where the CO2 will be sequestered.

On Oct. 3, 2025, the plant in Madrid, Nebraska, about an hour southwest of North Platte, became the first customer to ship, according to Steven Davidson, Tallgrass’ vice president of government affairs. The original Trailblazer line flowed in the opposite direction than it does now and has transitioned from moving natural gas to compressed CO2.

For the MAAPW team, the Trailblazer announcement was the culmination of plant founder Robert “Bob” Lundeen’s last great project before his passing. Tina Lundeen Smith, executive vice president of business development at MAAPW, says her father Bob believed ethanol’s future depended on bold investment.

“Thanks to the vision of Nebraskans like Bob Lundeen, the state is now positioned at the forefront of the biofuel industry,” said Alison Nelson, segment president of CO2 business development and origination for Tallgrass at the time of the MAAPW announcement. “We are incredibly proud to work alongside MAAPW and others across Nebraska to make large-scale carbon capture a reality and demonstrate how rural economies can thrive while setting the standard for global energy innovation.”

MAAPW’s announcement was released on a Friday. By Tuesday the following week, Green Plains Inc. announced that it was successful in its startup of carbon capture and storage equipment at its 50 MMgy York, Nebraska, ethanol plant. The company’s 116 MMgy plant in Central City and 121 MMgy plant in Wood River, both in Nebraska, followed closely behind.

Carbon capture and sequestration via pipeline at York has long been part of Green Plains’ carbon strategy, says Chris Osowski, CEO. The three Green Plains Nebraska plants will contribute CO2 from 287 MMgy of ethanol production.

POET will connect its Fairmont, Nebraska, bioprocessing facility to Trailblazer, as well. The world’s largest producer of biofuels announced an agreement with Tallgrass in February 2025. At press time, no official announcement that POET was operating on Trailblazer has been made yet, but the company said in its initial February statement that once the Trailblazer was up and running in 2025, POET would have connectivity in the “near-term.”

ADM has also begun capturing and shipping CO2 on Trailblazer. With its Columbus, Nebraska, ethanol complex, ADM says it has the world’s largest ethanol carbon capture facility in the world. The 100 MMgy wet mill was connected to the Trailblazer by lateral lines using only voluntary easements by landowners, according to ADM. Like Green Plains, ADM’s team said the CCS project linked to the Trailblazer is a key part of its decarbonization strategy.

“This is an exciting project for the industry and for the future of CCS technology,” says Chris Cuddy, president, North America at ADM.

KAAPA Ethanol Holdings, an ethanol producer now owning and operating multiple plants in areas of close proximity to Trailblazer, also sees the pipeline as an important strategy for its future. Although the company had not yet announced its official operational status on the pipeline at press time, it is committed and has already invested in connecting its ethanol plants in Aurora and Ravenna.

In Lexington and Hastings, Nebraska, Chief Ethanol has connected two plants—fermentation CO2 from a combined 125 MMgy of ethanol production—to the Trailblazer pipeline. In October 2025, the company replaced its old scrubber with a new, larger CO2 scrubber to clean up the CO2 that leaves the fermenters prior to capture. The new unit has dramatically decreased the plant’s water use, according to Brent Jessop, manager at Chief Ethanol.

On the border of Nebraska and Iowa, the team at 140 MMgy Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy is working to connect to Trailblazer by mid-2026. Retired former CEO Mike Jerke has been active in his support of Trailblazer, writing letters to the Iowa Governor to effect legislation that would benefit the pipeline.

Commitment to Community

Advocates like Rhodes cite a unique aspect of the Trailblazer pipeline that was crucial to its ultimate success. Through the Trailblazer Community Benefits Agreement, ethanol producers will support direct funding to landowners who have agreed to site the pipeline on their properties in addition to the communities hosting infrastructure. The agreement also created rigorous landowner rights through the entire lifecycle of the pipeline.

Tallgrass formed the benefits agreement with the input and help of several organizations, including: Renewable Fuels Nebraska, Nebraska State Volunteer Firefighters Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Cattlemen, Nebraska Farmers Union, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Sorghum Producers Association, Nebraska State Dairy Association, Nebraska Pork Producers Association and We Support AG. Bold Alliance, an organization formed to build “unlikely alliances to protect the land and water,” was also a big partner helping to form the agreement.

Monetary funding through the agreement also includes $500,000 commitments to nonprofits in the counties associated with the project. Another $400,000 commitment goes to first responders throughout the development of the pipeline, in addition to ongoing funding for essential equipment once the project is operational. If the pipeline is decommissioned, the easements will be returned to landowners who may elect to have the pipeline abandoned in place or removed from their property.

“Tallgrass is the first pipeline company we have encountered that has been willing to engage proactively, acknowledge the need for the landowner benefits that Bold fights to achieve, and genuinely commit itself to addressing those benefits by written agreement,” says Jane Kleeb, founder of Bold Alliance.

Close But Not Connected

Several more ethanol plants throughout Nebraska are close to the Trailblazer line but have not invested or committed to it. Some of those plants already have plans for alternative CO2 capture options.

Bridgeport Ethanol in far southwest Nebraska is working with Carbon America on a sequestration well and underground pipeline project. Through their agreement, Carbon America will finance, build, own and operate the CCS system utilizing CO2 produced from Bridgeport.

Valero Renewable Fuels - Albion, is on the Northern proximity of the Trailblazer line but the company has already committed to the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions option that would capture CO2 from several states before terminating in North Dakota.

Nebraska Corn Processing LLC in Cambridge, Nebraska, near the Kansas border, has no public plans for CO2 capture to date. Trenton Agri Products LLC, another southwestern Nebraska ethanol plant, has previously explored CO2 capture and sequestration options due to its location within a potential geologic formation capable of storing CO2.

Significance of Success

To Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, Trailblazer is a major step forward in proving what’s possible with CCS. It’s potential lies in more than its link to sustainable aviation fuel, he says.

“The most important point is this: Carbon capture isn’t some someday idea,” he says. “It’s happening right now. States that are embracing this technology are building new markets for ethanol, creating jobs, spurring rural economies and supporting farmers.”

States that are “slow-walking,” as Buis says, or blocking progress, run the risk of falling behind.

Rhodes and his team at NEB worked with Tallgrass to enable Trailblazer’s success, through educating audiences around the state about its benefits. The excitement surrounding the reality of the pipeline has prompted high hopes for 2026. It could be another banner year for the state, Rhodes says, as the team continues to work on forward-thinking research projects and developing new opportunities.

Buis says there is much to learn from the work of Rhodes and the success of the Trailblazer in Nebraska. Carbon capture succeeds when stakeholders stay focused, protect local economies and keep rural industries competitive, he says.

“Another lesson is that carbon capture is the future and long-term play,” he says. “The industry has to be proactive, whether its upgrading technology, building partnerships with farmers or preparing to meet standards.”

The Trailblazer ultimately succeeded, Buis says, because state leaders stepped up and saw the value early. Then, they worked to give energy producers and rural communities a fair, predictable permitting process. They focused on science, safety and what the project meant for Nebraska farmers, ethanol plants and long-term economic growth.

“We are at a tipping point and if America fails to lead, countries like Brazil, China and others will gladly step in to meet the demand for low-carbon fuels,” Buis says. “That means jobs, innovation and revenue leaving the Midwest (and the U.S.) and never coming back.”

Although the company’s name rarely appears to the traveling public, its technology forms the essential foundation of modern flight, operating as an invisible yet indispensable force beneath the wings and fuselages of aircraft.

The Industrial Engine Behind Aviation

Unlike consumer-facing brands, Safran functions as a critical infrastructure provider within the aerospace industry. Its extensive portfolio encompasses commercial jet engines, aircraft interiors, avionics, landing systems, military propulsion, and initiatives aimed at sustainable aviation. The company’s influence extends across multiple dimensions: enabling airlines to reduce fuel consumption, assisting air forces in modernizing their fleets, and supporting Europe’s strategic pursuit of aerospace autonomy.

Safran confronts a complex array of challenges, including the urgent need for aviation to decarbonize, reduce operating costs, and reinforce supply chains amid geopolitical uncertainties. Concurrently, defense clients demand enhanced range, stealth capabilities, and independence from foreign technologies. Positioned at the nexus of these pressures, Safran leverages its deep expertise in propulsion and avionics to reshape both the economics and capabilities of flight.

Propulsion at the Core

Central to Safran’s integrated portfolio is its propulsion and systems business, which serves both commercial and military aircraft. This ecosystem is anchored by several key pillars.

At the forefront of Safran’s commercial strategy is its 50/50 joint venture with GE Aerospace, CFM International, which produces the CFM LEAP engine family. These engines power prominent aircraft models such as the Airbus A320neo, Boeing 737 MAX, and COMAC C919. Safran supplies critical components including high-pressure turbines and advanced composite materials. The LEAP engine achieves significant fuel-burn reductions compared to its predecessors, driven by innovations such as advanced composite fan blades and cases that reduce weight and enhance efficiency, 3D-woven composite materials that improve hot-section durability, and a high-bypass architecture that enables quieter and more efficient operation. These technological advances directly contribute to lowering airline fuel costs and carbon dioxide emissions, positioning Safran at the forefront of aviation’s decarbonization efforts.

Looking to the future, Safran is co-developing the CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program, which introduces an open-fan propulsion concept designed to deliver up to 20% additional fuel savings. The RISE engine features an unducted open-fan design that achieves ultra-high bypass ratios, hybrid-electric capabilities that anticipate evolving power grids and airframe technologies, and full compatibility with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from the outset.

Navigating a Competitive Landscape

Safran’s leadership in aerospace innovation faces mounting challenges. The civil engine market is expected to become increasingly competitive, with 2026 potentially marking the beginning of a new “engine war” as rivals accelerate their technological advancements. In response, Safran has undertaken strategic initiatives such as divesting its in-flight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) unit to Kingswood and integrating Skyted’s silent call technology into its passenger connectivity systems. These moves reflect the company’s efforts to sharpen its focus and maintain a competitive edge.

At the same time, competitors are advancing rapidly. Saab is developing software-defined fuselage technology, while Gogo’s Galileo system is poised to enter the inflight connectivity market, intensifying the race for technological supremacy.

As the aviation and defense industries confront increasing demands for efficiency, sustainability, and resilience, Safran S.A. remains a pivotal, though often unseen, force shaping the future of flight.

On Thursday, Washington leaders launched a nonprofit committed to sustainable aviation fuel, which promises to reduce aviation carbon emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The nonprofit, called the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, secured $20 million from state funding and a private donation to de-risk” the production of sustainable aviation fuel, making it easier for companies, universities and institutions to study, develop and, eventually, produce the alternative fuel source.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been in the works for nearly two decades, but the industry has not taken off. SAF is slow and costly to produce and, though the technology is mature, there are few facilities producing the alternative fuel.

SAF accounted for less than 1% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to a December report from the International Air Transport Association.

On Thursday, Washington’s elected officials and aviation leaders gathered at Boeing’s Future of Flight museum in Mukilteo to celebrate the new initiative. Leaders from Boeing, Alaska, Amazon, Washington State University and the state Department of Commerce pledged again and again that Washington would be at the forefront of sustainable aviation, carrying on a legacy of aviation firsts in the state.

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said.

“You have a partner in the state of Washington,” he told the aviation industry. “For this truly historic opportunity, we have to move our state forward.”

SAF is an alternative to petroleum that makes fuel from so-called “feedstocks. There are several ways to make it, but all capture gases from renewable sources, like used cooking oils or animal waste. After a complicated process, SAF is eventually mixed with traditional jet fuel to lower carbon emissions during flight.

The accelerator introduced Thursday is meant to speed up both research and production, which will enable the state to produce SAF on a large scale. It will put Washington at the forefront of what the state expects will be the next economic boom in the aviation industry, the nonprofit’s leaders said.

Washington already passed legislation to accelerate permitting and environmental review for construction of clean energy plants and introduced a tax credit that provides subsidies for SAF.

At the celebratory event Thursday, Boeing announced that, starting this year, all its flights for operations and deliveries from Renton, Everett and Paine Field will fly on up to 30% SAF.

And SkyNRG, a Dutch company building a sustainable fuel production facility in Walla Walla, said Thursday it had completed state and county environmental reviews that will allow it to move forward with construction.

A ‘catalyst’ for the industry

The aviation industry has been chasing SAF for decades. Boeing conducted the world’s first test flight powered by biofuels with Virgin Atlantic in 2008.

Yet SAF production accounted for just 0.6% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to the December report from the International Air Transport Association.

SAF production doubled from 2024 to 2025, IATA found, totaling about 634 million gallons last year. For comparison, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport alone uses about 600 million gallons of jet fuel annually, according to the Port of Seattle.

The alternative fuel is also still pricey, IATA found. In 2025, the extra costs associated with SAF added $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the aviation industry.

On Thursday, Washington’s aviation industry nonetheless projected optimism. The accelerator it introduced is meant to tackle those problems, its supporters repeated over the course of the event.

Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell told the group “it’s probably late to the game to begin solving it at this scale, but it’s not too little. It’s exactly what’s needed.”

The accelerator’s list of partners is extensive: Alaska Airlines, Amazon, Boeing, the Port of Seattle, Snohomish County, the state Department of Commerce and Washington State University.

The group received $10 million in state appropriations last year and another $10 million from a philanthropic gift, said Sen. Marko Liias, a Democrat representing Edmonds. “We are now sitting on $20 million to catalyze this industry,” he said.

It’s not clear how far that funding will go, though.

SkyNRG, the Dutch company, originally estimated it would need $600 million to $800 million to get its facility up and running.

SkyNRG plant moves forward

John Plaza, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, acknowledged at Thursday’s event that the industry has more demand for SAF than supply, but urged attendees to consider how far the initiative has come in the last 20 years.

“Lots of people like to say ‘there’s not enough SAF, we haven’t made enough progress,’” Plaza said. “Today, we’re past the theory. We’re into the implementation.”

SkyNRG set out to develop its Washington site in 2023, calling it Project Wigeon. The facility will sit on a 165-acre site at Wallula Gap and, once up and running, will produce 50 million gallons of SAF a year.

SkyNRG said Thursday the company secured approval from the state Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County to begin construction.

The company will start construction in 2028 and begin producing SAF in 2030.

Plaza declined to share how much private funding the company has for the Walla Walla facility. In 2025, the state Department of Commerce awarded a $1.5 million grant to the Port of Walla Walla to support SkyNRG’s construction of the facility.

Andy Billig, a former Washington state senator and now senior adviser for SkyNRG, said passing those environmental reviews was the hardest part of the process. The technology SkyNRG will use to make SAF is already in use elsewhere, Billig said, so he isn’t worried about putting it into practice.

Corteva and bp have announced the launch of Etlas, a new joint venture focused on producing oilseed crops for biofuel production. Etlas will grow crops such as canola, mustard, and sunflower to create feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

The venture brings together Corteva’s expertise in seed technology and bp’s experience in fuel refining and marketing. The goal is to build a strong and reliable supply of plant-based feedstock to meet the fast-growing global demand for cleaner fuels.

Etlas plans to produce one million metric tonnes of feedstock each year by the mid-2030s. This amount could support the production of more than 800,000 tonnes of biofuel annually. Initial supplies are expected to begin in 2027 and will be used at existing refineries and dedicated biofuel plants.

“By helping found Etlas, Corteva continues to deliver on two critical parts of our mission: to help fuel the world and to support farmers. Agriculture is part of the solution, and we are excited to see Etlas come to life,” said Judd O’Connor, executive vice president of Corteva’s seed business.

Global demand for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel is rising quickly. Industry estimates show that demand for SAF could reach 10 million tonnes by 2030, while renewable diesel demand could grow to 35 million tonnes. Etlas aims to help meet this growing need with a dependable and scalable supply.

The crops used by Etlas will be grown on existing farmland between main food crop seasons. These crops can improve soil health and provide farmers with an extra source of income without requiring additional land.

Etlas will be led by Ignacio Conti as Chief Executive Officer, with Gaurav Sonar serving as Chair of the Board. The company plans to work closely with farmers around the world to expand production and support clean energy goals.

Through Etlas, agriculture will play an important role in supporting cleaner fuel solutions for transportation while offering farmers new opportunities for revenue and sustainability.

“As the aviation industry looks for reliable, sustainable and cost-competitive sources of SAF, it is clear farmers have a critical role to play,” said Etlas CEO, Ignacio Conti. “Etlas brings together global leaders in agriculture innovation and energy production to harness this demand by leveraging technological expertise and trusted relationships with farmers around the world to help scale production and boost supply while offering farmers new revenue streams.”",,N,,2026-01-10 03:58:31.231651

This achievement underscores the robustness of biological gas fermentation compared with more rigid chemical conversion pathways.","LanzaTech Global, Inc. has reported the successful achievement of guaranteed operational performance at a municipal solid waste (MSW)–to–ethanol pilot facility in Japan, marking an important milestone in the commercialization of industrial carbon recycling technologies. The facility, located in Kuji City in Iwate Prefecture, is owned and operated by SEKISUI CHEMICAL CO., LTD., a long-term partner of LanzaTech, and represents a one-tenth commercial-scale demonstration of waste-to-ethanol production.

With an annual production capacity of approximately 400 metric tons of ethanol, the pilot plant began operations following mechanical completion in April 2022 and remained in operation for nearly four years. During this period, the facility consistently demonstrated the ability of LanzaTech’s proprietary gas fermentation technology to process highly heterogeneous and unsorted non-recyclable municipal waste streams. These materials would otherwise be disposed of through landfilling or incineration, both of which carry significant environmental burdens. The successful handling of such variable feedstocks highlights the adaptability of the technology to regional differences in waste composition, a key requirement for enabling a truly global circular carbon economy.

The Kuji waste-to-ethanol project was supported through investment by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, which operates under the oversight of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Additional financial backing was provided by the Ministry of the Environment Japan, reflecting strong governmental support for innovative low-carbon and waste-reduction technologies.

A major highlight of the project was the plant’s ability to meet and exceed its guaranteed performance criteria. After achieving steady-state operations, the facility maintained ethanol yields above the guaranteed threshold for more than 14 consecutive days. This represented the most productive fermentation campaign recorded at the site to date. Importantly, this level of performance was sustained even while operating under particularly challenging conditions, including difficult and variable gas compositions.

The plant processed synthesis gas containing a combined carbon monoxide and hydrogen concentration ranging between 40% and 55%, with hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratios fluctuating from 1.1 to 1.4. Such gas compositions can pose significant challenges for many conventional catalytic conversion technologies. LanzaTech’s process, however, demonstrated exceptional resilience and flexibility, maintaining high ethanol productivity despite these demanding parameters. This achievement underscores the robustness of biological gas fermentation compared with more rigid chemical conversion pathways.

Gasification itself is a well-established method for converting solid waste into syngas, and LanzaTech has previously integrated its fermentation platform with several conventional gasifier systems. The Kuji project also served as a testing ground for collaboration around a novel gasifier design. Despite variability in feed gas quality, the fermentation system remained stable and consistently met performance targets, further validating the reliability of the technology.

Commenting on the achievement, Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaTech, expressed pride in the collaborative success of the project and acknowledged the contributions of Sekisui Chemical, the local authorities in Kuji City and Iwate Prefecture, and the Government of Japan. She emphasized that the results reaffirm the scalability and technical soundness of LanzaTech’s platform and signaled optimism for expanding sustainable fuel and chemical production in Japan and other markets.

Looking ahead, LanzaTech continues to advance waste-to-energy and waste-to-fuels solutions that support circular economy principles. By converting problematic waste streams into valuable ethanol and other chemical feedstocks—potentially including inputs for sustainable aviation fuel—the company aims to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition toward low-carbon industrial systems worldwide.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-10 03:58:35.809948

On Wednesday, the FCC loosened the ban, exempting UAS and critical components on the Pentagon’s Blue List of cleared UAS aircraft.
More than 43 percent of them said their business could shutter if the DJI ban remains, including more than half of agriculture, public safety, and utility operators.
And 97 percent said they use at least one DJI drone.
Overall, about 58 percent of operators said they are “extremely concerned” about the direction of U.S. policies on foreign UAS.","Correction: A previous version of this article mischaracterized the Commercial Drone Alliance’s stance on UAS manufactured in China. This story has been updated to reflect the group’s neutral position.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday partially reversed a sweeping ban on the sale of foreign drones and components. But to the chagrin of American uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) operators, the ban still covers China’s DJI, which produces some of the world’s most widely used drones.

The FCC in December added all UAS and components produced in foreign countries to its covered list at the direction of the White House, which determined they pose “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.”

The ban does not affect equipment previously authorized by the FCC or already in the hands of American consumers. But it effectively prohibits the sale of any new foreign models in the U.S. It also impacts new components such as cameras and batteries, which could make it more difficult to maintain or upgrade approved drones.

On Wednesday, the FCC loosened the ban, exempting UAS and critical components on the Pentagon’s Blue List of cleared UAS aircraft. That means drones produced by Parrot, Aerovironment, Teledyne FLIR, AgEagle Aerial Systems, Wingtra, Auterion, and others on the list will remain available. So too will components produced by Sony, Nvidia, Panasonic, and others.

“UAS and UAS components included on the Blue UAS list have met the highest security standards so they are able to operate in sensitive environments, protect sensitive information, and prevent cyber vulnerabilities,” an FCC notice announcing the move reads. “Given the extensive testing of the Blue listed UAS and UAS critical components, the [Pentagon] has determined that UAS and UAS components included on the Blue UAS list, do not pose unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States.”

The exemption will expire in 2027 and be reassessed to determine if foreign equipment is “hampering the resiliency of our domestic drone industrial base,” the notice adds.

Also exempted are UAS and components that are manufactured in the U.S., so long as domestic components account for 65 percent of the cost of the finished product. That provision will also sunset in 2027. The FCC said the industry should view the 65 percent requirement as a “baseline” that will be raised in the future.

The agency further clarified that the ban does not impact drones made exclusively for use by the U.S. government.

DJI Ban Persists

Federal officials and industry groups such as the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) have long clamored for restrictions on foreign drones, citing them as a national security concern and a hindrance to American UAS manufacturing.

In 2020, for example, DJI’s market share among U.S. hobbyists and public safety operators was estimated as high as 77 and 90 percent, respectively. Officials and industry stakeholders worry about the potential of the manufacturer’s drones to surveil American citizens and infrastructure. The Pentagon went as far as labelling DJI a “Chinese military company”—a designation the company sought but failed to reverse in September.

However, some in the industry felt the FCC’s initial ban went too far.

“We were surprised by the expansion of the FCC’s action to add UAS and UAS critical components produced in any foreign country, rather than just certain foreign adversary produced drones, to the covered list,” the Commercial Drone Alliance, which has adopted a neutral stance toward Chinese UAS, said in a statement Monday. “The scope of this action will create unnecessary challenges for American innovators without thoughtful implementation.”

The majority of American drone operators surveyed by The Pilot Institute, which offers online drone and airplane training, share that sentiment.

In a white paper published Wednesday, the company said it surveyed 8,056 stakeholders, most of whom identified as commercial or professional drone operators. More than 43 percent of them said their business could shutter if the DJI ban remains, including more than half of agriculture, public safety, and utility operators. About 47 percent said they support targeted restrictions on foreign drones—in line with the FCC’s Wednesday update—but only for sensitive government or critical infrastructure uses.

Strikingly, 70 percent of respondents said they operate drone fleets that are fully DJI. Eighty-five percent said DJI drones make up at least three-quarters of their fleet. And 97 percent said they use at least one DJI drone.

By contrast, only 5 percent of respondents said their drones come from Skydio, one of the leading American manufacturers. Nearly 30 percent said there is no FCC-approved alternative to DJI that meets their needs, citing higher costs and lower performance and reliability.

Overall, about 58 percent of operators said they are “extremely concerned” about the direction of U.S. policies on foreign UAS.

“More than 80 percent of the nation’s 1,800-plus state and local law enforcement and emergency response agencies that operate drone programs use DJI technology; these programs will be at immediate risk if they no longer have access to the most cost effective and efficient drone technology available,” DJI wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in December.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/DJI-2-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 00:57:44.896444

The Sustainable Markets Initiative has appointed Paul Griffiths, chief executive of Dubai Airports, as CEO Champion of its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Pathfinder Initiative, the organisation said on Thursday. According to the original source, the initiative, founded by UK's King Charles III in 2020 when he was Prince of Wales, aims to accelerate the production and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is widely seen as the most viable near-term option for cutting aviation emissions.

SAF can reduce flight emissions by up to 80 per cent, but currently accounts for less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel supply. The SAF Pathfinder Initiative focuses on mobilising investment and demand signals to unlock production, advocating for harmonised global policies and incentives, enabling critical infrastructure upgrades, and driving collaboration across the aviation supply chain to address production and cost barriers.

Griffiths appointment comes as pressure mounts on the aviation industry to meet its long-term climate targets, including a sector-wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050. ""Im honoured to take on this role at such a critical time for our industry,"" Griffiths said in a statement. ""Sustainable aviation fuel is one of the most important levers we have to decarbonise flight, and Im committed to accelerating its availability and adoption across the sector.""

Griffiths said the work would align with the oneDXB Sustainability Alliance, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by Dubai Airports, which aims to drive decarbonisation, innovation, and resilience across Dubai International Airport and Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International. Under Griffiths leadership, Dubai Airports has achieved Level 4 ""Transformation"" accreditation from Airports Council International, placing it among the top 5 per cent of airports globally.

The accreditation reflects measures including collaboration with partners, the use of biodiesel-powered ground fleets, and the rollout of green infrastructure projects at Dubai International Airport. Jennifer Jordan-Saifi, chief executive of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, said SAF could play a central role beyond aviation. ""We view Sustainable Aviation Fuel as a powerful catalyst, not only for decarbonising aviation, but also for driving the global expansion of sustainable technologies and investment,"" she said.

GREENVILLE, SC, UNITED STATES, January 9, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — The U.S. Endowment for Forestry and Communities (the Endowment) has announced a new collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology. This partnership aims to address the far-reaching social, economic and environmental impacts of pulp and paper mill closures across the United States, particularly in the rural South, where these mills have long served as economic anchors.

The Endowment and Georgia Tech’s Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL) are developing an integrated decision-making dashboard to help policymakers, community leaders and industry stakeholders quantify the effects of mill closures and identify data-driven pathways to offset them through the sustainable use of forestry residues to produce bioenergy, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Over the past decade, nearly 50 paper mills have shut down nationwide, including major facilities in Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas and Ohio. These closures have resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs and disrupted local supply chains that once connected family forest owners, loggers, sawmills and manufacturers in tightly interdependent networks. As markets for timber and forestry byproducts contract, landowners face reduced incentives for active management – conditions that can increase the risk of wildfire, invasive species and forest conversion to other uses.

“Across the Southeast, the closure of major paper mills has disrupted livelihoods, strained local economies and weakened the markets that keep forests healthy,” said Pete Madden, president and CEO of the U.S. Endowment for Forestry and Communities. “By combining the Endowment’s industry expertise with Georgia Tech’s data modeling capabilities, we’re helping communities understand these impacts and uncover new opportunities for resilient growth.”

The Endowment–Georgia Tech collaboration seeks to turn this challenge into opportunity.

Using key performance indicators such as jobs created or retained, capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX), energy and SAF output potential, and regional economic metrics, the tool will offer a transparent, quantitative framework for decision-makers to assess the trade-offs and benefits of emerging forest-based industries.

“The forest sector is in a period of transition, and data-driven analysis will be key to ensuring that change supports both people and the planet,” said Dimitri Mavris, ASDL director and Regent’s Professor in the Guggenheim School. “Through this partnership, we’re building a model that not only captures economic realities but also points toward responsible, resilient solutions.”

Ultimately, this effort aims to reimagine the role of forestry residues — once viewed as a byproduct — as a foundation for renewable energy innovation. By aligning rural development, responsible forestry and energy security, the project seeks to chart a path where the decline of traditional industries can give rise to new, regenerative ones.

The effort is part of ASDL’s Grand Challenges program, which gives teams of first-year graduate students a broad, open-ended problem to address. Students must become fluent in their challenge area, learn about the techniques and methods available to assist with problem-solving, and determine the data and scope of modeling required to present results and findings. Examples of previous projects include creating a systems approach to planetary defense, a U.S. Coast Guard integrated deepwater system, and a commercial air transportation system-of-systems probabilistic air travel demand tool.

The Endowment project will be conducted over the course of two academic semesters, concluding with a final presentation in Spring 2026 to ASDL’s External Advisory Board and other sponsors and stakeholders.

This improvement was driven by market participants selling UCO feedstocks to domestic sustainable aviation fuel plants. Chinese SAF producers have pivoted to hydrotreated vegetable oil production while awaiting SAF approval, according to market participants.

On Jan. 9, Platts, part of S&P Global Energy, assessed UCO DAP prices at major Chinese ports as follows: Tianjin Port, North China at Yuan 7,000/mt, up 2.19% from the recent low of Yuan 6,850/mt on Dec. 23; Nantong Port, East China at Yuan 7,050/mt, up 2.92% from the same low; and Nansha Port, South China at Yuan 7,050/mt, up 2.32% from Yuan 6,890/mt on Jan. 5.

In September, prices reached yearly highs before declining: Tianjin Port rose to Yuan 7,925/mt on Sept. 23, then fell 7.95% to Yuan 7,295/mt by Dec. 4; Nantong Port peaked at Yuan 7,975/mt on Sept. 18, dropping 8.53% to Yuan 7,295/mt; and Nansha Port climbed to Yuan 7,725/mt on Sept. 17, before falling 6.86% to Yuan 7,195/mt on Dec. 4.

Domestic feedstock availability

A representative from a trading house noted that a significant portion of UCO supplies is currently being directed to SAF plants, as demand from major export markets remains weak.

""We've heard there is some demand for feedstocks from SAF plants, which might help support domestic UCO prices,"" the representative said.

A Chinese UCO producer reported a slight increase in domestic UCO prices, particularly for premium UCO. ""I think there might be some movement in the export market in late January. The market should see some activity before the upcoming Lunar New Year celebration, and I believe there will still be some transactions taking place,"" the producer said.

An East China-based UCO supplier reported that, following recent tenders from SAF plants, premium UCO feedstock prices had increased slightly. European buyers continue to see Chinese UCO as too expensive. Although SAF producers' buying prices have declined compared to last year, pressure from European buyers is even greater. As a result, some sellers now prefer to supply domestic SAF plants, given the subdued demand from export markets such as Europe.

""Despite ongoing plant maintenance, some facilities are still actively procuring feedstocks,"" a UCO collector said, noting that North China UCO prices remain supported even with maintenance activities.

Chinese SAF producers pivot to HVO

According to market participants, despite the imposition of antidumping duties from Europe, HVO production is still profitable due to high market prices -- even after accounting for duties and other costs. Additionally, domestic feedstock prices in China are currently below previous highs, making large-scale HVO production viable for producers.

This explains why, before obtaining SAF whitelist approval, producers are focusing on HVO production. This strategy enables them to maintain their operations and generate profits while awaiting SAF approval.

Rather than waiting, companies are seizing current opportunities in the international HVO market to expand production capacity, boost cash flow, and fortify their supply chains.

In a move that could reshape the aviation industry’s approach to environmental challenges, leaders from Amazon, Boeing, and regional government officials have unveiled the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator. This initiative, launched on January 8, 2026, in Mukilteo, Washington, aims to position the Pacific Northwest as a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The accelerator brings together a coalition of industry heavyweights, academic institutions, and policymakers to accelerate the development, production, and adoption of SAF, which promises to slash lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The launch event, held at the Future of Flight Aviation Center, featured prominent figures including Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, Amazon’s Vice President of Worldwide Sustainability Kara Hurst, and Boeing’s Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Raymond. According to reports from GeekWire, the gathering highlighted the region’s unique assets, such as its abundant agricultural and forestry resources, which could serve as feedstocks for SAF production. Ferguson described it as a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to leverage the area’s innovation ecosystem for climate action.

This partnership isn’t just ceremonial; it’s backed by concrete commitments. The accelerator will focus on scaling SAF supply chains, fostering technological innovations, and addressing regulatory hurdles. Participants include major airlines like Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines, as well as universities such as Washington State University, which will contribute research expertise in biofuel development.

The Coalition’s Ambitious Blueprint

At the heart of the accelerator is a collaborative model designed to bridge gaps between research, production, and commercial deployment. Sources from Alaska Airlines’ news portal detail how the initiative will prioritize rapid scaling of SAF production, targeting feedstocks like agricultural waste, forestry residues, and even municipal solid waste. This approach aligns with broader industry goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as outlined in international aviation agreements.

Boeing, a key player, brings its extensive experience in sustainability efforts. The company’s website notes its long history of pioneering eco-friendly technologies, including the ecoDemonstrator program that has tested over 230 innovations since 2012. Chris Raymond emphasized during the launch that Boeing’s involvement will include sharing insights from its ongoing work on non-CO2 emissions mitigation, such as contrails, which contribute to aviation’s climate impact.

Amazon’s role is equally pivotal, given its massive air cargo operations through Prime Air. With a fleet projected to expand significantly, the company has a vested interest in sustainable fuels to meet its own carbon-neutral goals by 2040. Kara Hurst highlighted how the accelerator could help decarbonize e-commerce logistics, drawing on Amazon’s investments in renewable energy and electric vehicles.

Regional Strengths and Economic Stakes

The Pacific Northwest’s push comes at a critical time for aviation, which accounts for about 2-3% of global CO2 emissions but faces growing scrutiny amid climate concerns. Local leaders point to the region’s natural advantages: vast forests for biomass, innovative tech hubs in Seattle, and a robust aerospace manufacturing base anchored by Boeing. A post on X from Boeing in Washington underscored the economic benefits, noting that aviation drives tourism and jobs, making SAF adoption essential for long-term growth.

Academic partners like Washington State University are set to play a crucial role. As detailed in WSU Insider, the university will lead efforts in feedstock research and conversion technologies, building on its expertise in bioenergy. This collaboration could unlock new methods for producing SAF at scale, potentially reducing costs that currently make it two to eight times more expensive than conventional fuel.

Government support is another linchpin. Gov. Ferguson’s administration has committed to policy frameworks that incentivize SAF, including tax credits and infrastructure investments. Reports from Lynnwood Times indicate that the state revised its climate impact data recently, providing a clearer picture of aviation’s footprint and justifying the accelerator’s urgency.

Overcoming Hurdles in SAF Adoption

Despite the optimism, challenges abound. SAF production globally is still nascent, representing less than 1% of jet fuel demand. The accelerator aims to tackle this by creating a regional supply chain that could serve as a model for others. Insights from recent news on KING 5 highlight how Washington’s bet on cleaner fuels follows updated emissions data, emphasizing the need for immediate action.

Industry insiders note that feedstock availability is a key bottleneck. The Pacific Northwest’s agricultural sector could provide corn stover or wheat straw, but competition with food production and land use concerns must be addressed. Boeing’s sustainability plan, as covered in Sustainability Magazine, includes strategies for sustainable sourcing, which the accelerator will likely adopt.

Moreover, technological innovation is vital. Posts on X from aerospace enthusiasts, such as those discussing blended wing body designs or supersonic sustainable flights, reflect a broader sentiment of excitement around aviation’s green transformation. For instance, historical tweets from Boom Supersonic and United Airlines show ongoing commitments to net-zero technologies, mirroring the accelerator’s goals.

Broader Industry Implications

The Cascadia initiative could influence national and global standards. With Boeing’s coalition work alongside NASA on projects like the X-66A demonstrator, as mentioned in X posts referencing truss-braced wing designs, the accelerator might integrate such aerodynamic advancements with SAF to amplify efficiency gains.

Amazon’s involvement extends beyond aviation; it’s part of the company’s holistic sustainability strategy. A Bloomberg tweet from 2020 projected Amazon’s air fleet growth, underscoring the e-commerce giant’s stake in scalable green solutions. By partnering here, Amazon could pilot SAF in its cargo operations, providing real-world data to refine the technology.

Regional carriers like Alaska Airlines are already committing to SAF blends. Their recent order of 110 Boeing planes, reported in The New York Times, signals expansion plans that hinge on sustainable fuels to meet regulatory pressures and consumer demands for eco-friendly travel.

Stakeholder Perspectives and Future Outlook

Feedback from the launch has been overwhelmingly positive. GeekWire captured quotes from executives calling it a “game-changer” for the region. Alaska Airlines’ involvement, detailed in their announcements, positions them as a testbed for SAF adoption, potentially influencing routes across the West Coast.

Critics, however, caution about the timeline. Scaling SAF to meaningful levels by 2030 requires billions in investment, and geopolitical factors like energy prices could disrupt progress. Yet, the accelerator’s multi-stakeholder approach—encompassing government, industry, and academia—offers a resilient framework.

Looking ahead, the initiative could catalyze job creation in biofuel refineries and research labs. WSU Insider reports estimate thousands of new positions, bolstering the Pacific Northwest’s economy while advancing climate goals.

Innovation at the Intersection of Tech and Aviation

Beyond fuels, the accelerator may spur related technologies. Boeing’s website highlights past milestones, like hydrogen-powered flights in 2008, which could inform future SAF-compatible engines. Integrating these with Amazon’s logistics expertise might lead to hybrid systems optimizing fuel use in cargo fleets.

X posts from figures like Mario Nawfal discuss innovative aircraft designs, such as the “flying pancake” blended wing body, which could enhance SAF efficiency. This sentiment aligns with the accelerator’s innovation focus, potentially attracting startups to the region.

Furthermore, the partnership reflects a shift toward collaborative decarbonization. As Simple Flying notes in their analysis of Boeing versus Airbus in 2026, Boeing’s recovery hinges on sustainability, making initiatives like this crucial for competitive edge.

Policy and Global Context

Washington state’s policies are evolving to support such efforts. Lynnwood Times coverage of Gov. Ferguson’s announcement ties into broader climate legislation, including incentives for clean energy projects.

On a global scale, the accelerator echoes efforts in Europe and Asia, where SAF mandates are gaining traction. By leading in the U.S., the Pacific Northwest could influence federal policies, especially with Boeing’s advocacy in Washington, D.C.

Industry observers on X, including posts from GeekWire, express enthusiasm, with some calling it a “fuel innovation boom.” This public sentiment could drive further investments.

Sustaining Momentum Through Challenges

To succeed, the accelerator must navigate supply chain vulnerabilities. KING 5 reports underscore the need for diversified feedstocks to avoid overreliance on any single source.

The two Nordic firms inked a memorandum of understanding that will see Norsk e-Fuel conduct a feasibility study for the eSAF project to be located next to Outokumpu’s stainless-steel mill in Tornio, Finland.

Outokumpu would supply carbon monoxide side streams from its existing ferrochrome production as a feedstock to be combined with green hydrogen to produce 80,000-100,000 tonnes of eSAF.

The project would be led by Norsk e-Fuel, drawing on its network for project development and financing. They estimate the project will cost €1.2bn-€1.5bn ($1.4bn-1.7bn).

Subject to the feasibility study, the company anticipates taking final investment decision around 2028, with construction planned for 2032.

Lars Bjørn Larsen, CCO at Norsk e-Fuel said, “Outokumpu’s industrial platform and available side streams, combined with our experience in developing power-to-liquid projects, create a strong foundation for competitive eSAF production in Tornio”.

This new plant would look to support the EU’s eSAF quota and advance the decarbonisation of aviation.

The announcement comes within a year of Norsk e-Fuel revealing plans for an 80,000 tonne-per-year hydrogen-based SAF facility in Sweden, and alongside ongoing projects in Finland with which the company “continues to progress as planned”.

The EU has introduced strong mandates on SAF, with at least 2% of fuel supplied at EU airports required to be SAF from 2025, growing to 70% by 2050. There’s also a 1.2% 2030 sub-target for green hydrogen-based synthetic fuels, which could reach 35% by 2050.

However, the targets are increasingly being viewed as unachievable due to high production costs.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/Outokumpu_Visualization_260106.webp",N,,2026-01-09 10:59:20.045715

With major partners including NextEra Energy, UPS, CHS and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and more than 350 projects nationwide, OPAL has positioned itself at the forefront of the renewable energy transition. And just in time, it seems, as pressure to decarbonize increases. The United Nations’ COP30 climate summit, held in Brazil in November and the first post-U.S. withdrawal, stressed “the inherent connection between pursuing efforts to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and pursuing just transition pathways.”

While the conference failed to agree on decarbonization regulations, 23 countries endorsed their commitment to Belém 4X, an initiative to quadruple the use of sustainable fuels by 2035. RNG serves as an easily applicable fuel source for industries looking to decarbonize while maintaining current infrastructure. And to OPAL co-CEO Adam Comora, RNG is the perfect place to invest amid current climate goals.

In With the New

Formed in late 2020 by Comora and co-CEO Jonathan Maurer, OPAL entered the public sector backed by decades of experience. “We got started in the business of capturing biogas and trying to find a productive use for it 25 years ago,” Comora says. “A lot of folks were noticing that methane emissions from decaying organic waste could be used productively and that electricity generation was a good answer because it’s baseload power, 24/7.”

Prior to OPAL’s formation, TruStar Energy, Fortistar Methane Group and Fortistar RNG operated as portfolio companies of Fortistar LLC. The three companies merged together to form OPAL Fuels, bringing together upstream and downstream capabilities. Later that year, OPAL combined with ArcLight Clean Transition Corp. II, officially exiting the private sector as a vertically integrated producer and distributor of RNG.

“We saw a really interesting opportunity to transform what we were doing at the Fortistar Methane Group on the landfill gas-to-electric side,” Comora continues. “We really got excited that there could be something better to do with the biogas resource from an economic perspective, and create an opportunity to help fleets achieve their objectives.”

OPAL’s long-term partnership with American legacy utility NextEra Energy began in April 2021 with the development of a Minnesota RNG project designed to produce 2,140 dekatherms of RNG per day, eliminating 43,900 metric tons of carbon per year. In December 2022, OPAL signed a long-term agreement with UPS to provide operations and maintenance services to 51 UPS RNG dispensing stations in the U.S. In 2023, OPAL and South Jersey Industries signed a 50-50 joint venture agreement to develop RNG facilities. The following year, OPAL announced commercial operations at its RNG facility at the Polk County municipal landfill in Jones Corner, Florida.

Today, OPAL splits its operating segments into three categories: RNG fuel, renewable power and fuel station services, Comora explains. In a report of OPAL’s third-quarter results, Comora noted an 8% increase in RNG production compared to the second quarter and a 30% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024, despite depressed D3 RIN prices. Maurer shared the company’s annual design capacity of 9.1 million MMBtu across 12 projects in operation during the same briefing, adding that “at present, RNG and CNG are the most attractive alternatives to replace diesel for the Class 8 trucking market.”

With D3 RINs remaining depressed, Comora and Maurer’s lengthy backgrounds in renewable energy investing bring stability to their work. “There are a few cost areas that we’re really focused on,” Comora says. “One is the capital costs of the facilities, where we did see some significant inflationary cost pressures over the past three to four years or so. Thankfully, those have been offset by the Section 48 ITC tax credit, and we did safe harbor a number of projects in our advanced development pipeline that will qualify for those ITC tax credits. But we are spending a lot of time on value engineering.”

Further federal tax incentives like the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit and the Renewable Fuel Standard program affect how OPAL moves. “Policy clarity has a lot more impact on investing in RNG assets, and they all form a piece of the puzzle,” he says. “And 45Z is definitely helpful when thinking about investing in new RNG production facilities. Those run through 2029, so if new facilities take a ballpark estimate of 18 months to build, you may only be getting a year of 45Z benefits.”

Current legislative efforts, including a notice of proposed rulemaking released by the White House Office of Management and Budget, attempt to further extend 45Z beyond 2029, as well as reinstate the $1.75-per-gallon sustainable aviation fuel incentive, which Comora says makes a significant impact on RNG investments. “We’re waiting for final clarity on a GREET model to do all the carbon intensity scoring around our projects, but if you can have visibility or clarity on 45Z for a period of time, that can have a big impact on investing in RNG facilities,” he says. “It also works in conjunction with the 48 ITC, so 45Z is a tool or a lever that can offset those capital cost increases.”

Trucking Along

Despite OPAL’s roots in the U.S., Comora says opportunities beyond the domestic market are growing. “Japan is starting to import RNG. They have a mandate that by 2030, 1% of their net gas has to be low-CI. You can send it there as LNG or as renewable methanol,” he says. “In Europe, marine fuel is really interesting, as well as here in the U.S., whether it be in barges or around ports, and potentially for ocean-going vessels. There’s going to be a big market because they’re going to be taxed based on their carbon emissions when they pull into ports, and now you’ve got all these ships on the ocean that can run on renewable methanol. So, there are other offtake markets that want low-CI natural gas.”

New markets, of course, mean new regulations, even inside the continental U.S. “Any time we dispense RNG in California, CARB assigns us a CI score based off the Argonne GREET models. 45Z is going to have something similar. And we also have third-party engineers that do baselines,” Comora says.

When it comes to the transportation sector, the challenges of decarbonization are half the fun, and OPAL is happy to answer the call. “The reason why we’re focused on transportation fuel, and specifically heavy-duty trucking here in the U.S., is because it’s a hard-to-decarbonize sector,” he says. “Electrification is challenged by battery weight and electricity grids—there are just so many things that stand in the way, and hydrogen has proved challenging to distribute in the U.S. as well.

“We’re collecting biogas that’s maybe 50% methane,” Comora continues. “We are physically passing it through membranes to separate all other impurities so that you can get it up to a pipeline-quality spec, use existing pipeline infrastructure to transport it where you need it, build a fueling station that pulls off the RNG, compresses it and puts it right into the vehicle where it can be used. You can’t get a more streamlined operational economic model for the sector.”

The balancing act between building new RNG plants and expanding OPAL’s current fueling infrastructure is calculated at every step. “Everything that we invest capital in competes for that capital resource and needs to be justified on a strong, unlevered, risk-adjusted return,” Comora explains. “And the good news is we’re seeing good opportunities on both sides.

With major fleets increasingly reengaging with CNG and RNG, Comora and the OPAL Fuels team view fueling infrastructure as a compelling growth opportunity and are investing accordingly. “We see a stronger adoption curve of natural gas or RNG for heavy-duty trucking,” he says. “That being said, you’ll likely see us continue to invest in both, and at the same time, I feel like some of the capital is going to get shifted more toward the fuel station part of the business in the next couple of years.”

Using RNG allows companies to record zero Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions and fossil fuels) and zero Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions released through purchased energy). The CI of the combusted RNG can then be used to offset Scope 3 emissions, which include all other indirect emissions occurring across the value chain. “It’s hard for companies to do Scope 3 emissions accounting work, but we provide the CI of the RNG we’re supplying if they’re trying to establish a Scope 3 framework,” Comora adds. “So if you use RNG in a fleet: zero Scope 1, zero Scope 2, you create a biogenic emission and then you have a reduction in your Scope 3 emissions based on the CI.”

Finding the Future

With five to six projects under construction, Comora says OPAL is looking ahead. “It’s been a lot more work, and it’s more expensive being a public company. And we think it’s worthwhile to do that work,” he says. “One, we think it’s a better platform to raise capital, raise awareness and do some of our public policy advocacy work. We also think it’s been really impactful to attract talent to our team, and it’s made us much more disciplined.”

With nearly 30 years of experience in the renewable investment industry, the challenges of operating as a public company are navigated by returning to fundamentals. “Methane emissions are 80 times more damaging than CO2, specifically over the first 20 years,” Comora stresses. “Methane abatement is likely the lowest-hanging fruit and the most impactful thing that we can do. Does it get us all the way there? No. Should we be doing it? Yes.”

For OPAL, success is defined by setting the industry benchmark for reliable RNG production, with high facility availability and uptime, Comora says. It also includes increasing fleet conversions for heavy-duty transportation, expanding into new markets such as marine fuels or exports to Japan, evaluating additional feedstocks, and growing the company’s fueling station network. “We really paved our own path in terms of how we built the company, so it was really exciting—and still is exciting,” he adds. “A lot of interesting things come from that. We found it to be really challenging and fun, and it continues to motivate all of us.”

Skyports Infrastructure and Linden Airport Services Corporation have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to develop, modernise and operationalise Miami’s Watson Island Heliport, creating an immediate landing zone for helicopters and a future hub for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.

The collaboration aims to transform the historic Watson Island site into one of the most advanced urban aviation facilities in the United States. The upgraded heliport will support both traditional rotorcraft operations and next generation eVTOL services, positioning Miami at the forefront of the emerging Advanced Air Mobility sector.

The project will bring together industry-leading partnerships and relationships, including engagement with helicopter and eVTOL operators, collaboration with real estate developers, and preparations for the introduction of future eVTOL services. A comprehensive development plan will set out how the site can be adapted to support safe, efficient and scalable urban aviation operations.

Watson Island has a long aviation history dating back to the early 20th century and once played a central role in Miami’s vertical aviation network. Its location makes it uniquely strategic, as the closest landing zone to Miami Beach and just minutes from Downtown Miami, Brickell, Fisher Island, Star Island, Palm Island, Hibiscus Island and the Port of Miami. This central position gives the heliport unmatched accessibility for residents, visitors and commercial operators, reinforcing its importance as South Florida prepares to become a leading global market for eVTOL operations.

Linden Airport Services Corporation has been involved with the Watson Island Heliport project for more than 20 years, having been awarded the original heliport contract and working to secure Federal Aviation Administration and Florida Department of Transportation approvals. Final local occupancy permits are now in process. Linden’s experience managing Linden Airport in New Jersey, a major helicopter base serving the New York metropolitan area, complements Skyports’ operational expertise as the manager of the Downtown Skyport in New York, the world’s busiest civilian commercial heliport.

Together, Skyports and Linden will assess the highest and best use of the Watson Island Heliport, with the goal of restoring it to prominence while supporting the long-term growth of advanced air mobility in Miami.

“Watson Island is an extraordinary asset for Miami and a pivotal location for the future of urban aviation,” said Robbie Ladov, General Manager of US Heliports and Vertiports at Skyports Infrastructure. “By partnering with Linden, we are combining Skyports’ global leadership in skyport development with Linden’s decades-long dedication to preparing this site. Together, we are laying the foundation for a next generation facility that will serve the region for decades to come.”

Paul Dudley, CEO of Linden Airport Services Corporation, added: “Our commitment to Watson Island spans more than 20 years, navigating regulatory and operational milestones to get this site ready for the future. Partnering with Skyports enables us to advance the heliport into a modern skyport, engage key aviation and real estate partners, and help establish Miami as a leader in advanced air mobility.”

The occasion was a splashy launch event in Snohomish County for a new state-funded eco-fuel development nonprofit, dubbed the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator.

The business accelerator debuted with $10 million in tax dollars approved by the Legislature, matched by another $10 million from an unidentified philanthropic donor. Those new commitments build on tens of millions of dollars the Legislature and Congress previously allocated. The earlier funding was meant to lure alternative fuel refiners to Washington state, supports a Washington State University research lab, and incentivizes green jet fuel use in the state.

Executives from Boeing, Amazon, Alaska Airlines and the Port of Seattle joined Gov. Bob Ferguson, state legislators and the president of WSU on stage at Boeing’s Future of Flight visitor center next to Paine Field.

“Collectively, we have the political will and the private partnerships to get big things done,” state Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, told the standing-room crowd.

State Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said, “Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it.”

The state’s approach contrasts with the Trump administration, which just this week pulled the U.S. out of the foundational United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Trump administration officials have heaped scorn on taxpayer-financed decarbonization incentives. They favor policies to maximize fossil fuel production to drive down energy costs.

“While there are confusing signals coming out of the other Washington, the rest of the world is all-in on sustainable aviation fuel,” Liias said. “This is the fuel of the future.”

The board chair and vice-chair of the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator said the trade organization would lead education and advocacy efforts, recruit companies, invest in research and go to bat for project developers.

The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short. There are multiple methods to make it using a variety of feedstocks such as crop and forestry waste, used cooking oil, algae or hydrogen. Depending on the details, the eco-fuel can reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by anywhere from 50% to 80%.

SAF is favored by airlines because it is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works with existing airplane engines and fuel infrastructure. Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel. Major engine makers are in the process of testing and certifying engines for 100% SAF.

The trouble is that SAF currently costs two to five times as much as conventional jet fuel. The high price and limited supply are holding back wider adoption.

At present, there is no continuous, commercial-scale production in Washington state. But several major companies have plants in design or construction.

Dutch energy company SkyNRG said Thursday that it aims to break ground in late 2027 or in 2028 on a large biofuel production facility at the Wallula Gap industrial park along the Columbia River southeast of Pasco. The company plans to produce 50 million gallons per year of SAF and renewable diesel by converting bio-methane collected from local and regional landfills, as well as a little bit from cow manure digesters.

A competitor named Twelve recently completed construction on a synthetic jet fuel plant in Moses Lake. Twelve plans to use a power-to-liquid production method that relies on lots of renewable electricity to transform carbon dioxide captured from the air and water into what it calls “E-Jet” fuel.

Executives at Twelve portrayed the Moses Lake facility as a demonstration plant. It may begin production in a matter of weeks and ramp up to 50,000 gallons annually. The California-based company plans to locate a much larger commercial-scale E-Jet fuel plant somewhere in the Midwest.

On the west side of the Cascades, BP received nearly $27 million in federal grant funding in 2024 to buy equipment and make upgrades at its Cherry Point refinery. The goal is to begin production in 2029 of 10 million gallons of SAF annually using biomass feedstocks, like food waste, vegetable oil and beef tallow. The BP oil refinery in Whatcom County is connected by pipeline to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and the major airports in Vancouver, British Columbia and Portland, Oregon.

If you add up the capacity of the eco-jet fuel projects announced in the state so far, you make only a modest dent to transition Washington airports to climate-friendly fuel. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated Washington’s jet fuel consumption at 848 million gallons in 2024. According to the Port of Seattle, Sea-Tac Airport alone dispenses around 600 million gallons of jet fuel per year, a number expected to rise over the coming decade.

By the end of the decade though, an Oregon border county could become home to a much larger alternative fuel refinery whose output would equal Sea-Tac’s annual demand. A Texas-headquartered company named NXTClean Fuels is in the process of permitting an alternative jet fuel and renewable diesel refinery along the Columbia River near Clatskanie with a capacity of 750 million gallons per year.

If that project comes to fruition, it would theoretically go a long way toward addressing limited supply in the Pacific Northwest. But that still leaves the barriers of feedstock availability and affordability for airlines.

During a press availability following Thursday’s launch event, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, John Plaza, said he foresaw plenty of availability of the renewable natural gas raw ingredient that his company needs to make jet fuel at its planned southeast Washington plant.

Airlines such as Amazon Air have demonstrated some willingness to pay a premium to achieve climate and sustainability goals.

“We strive to have the airline industry pay as little a premium as possible,” Plaza said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alaska_airlines_biofuel_001-2048x1363.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 07:58:14.308025

Corteva and bp have introduced Etlas, a new joint venture designed to support the production of clean fuels through agriculture. Etlas will grow oilseed crops such as canola, mustard, and sunflower to create feedstock used in making sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

This partnership combines Corteva’s long history in seed development with bp’s global fuel marketing and refining expertise. Together, they aim to build a reliable and scalable supply chain for biofuel feedstock.

Etlas plans to reach annual production of one million metric tonnes of feedstock by the mid-2030s. This production could support more than 800,000 tonnes of biofuel each year. Initial deliveries are expected to begin in 2027 for use in biofuel refineries.

“By helping found Etlas, Corteva continues to deliver on two critical parts of our mission: to help fuel the world and to support farmers. Agriculture is part of the solution, and we are excited to see Etlas come to life,” said Judd O’Connor, executive vice president of Corteva’s seed business.

Demand for clean fuels is rising worldwide as governments and industries look for ways to reduce emissions. Global demand for sustainable aviation fuel could reach 10 million tonnes by 2030, while renewable diesel demand may grow to 35 million tonnes. Etlas is being developed to help meet this demand.

The crops grown by Etlas will be planted on existing farmland between main crop seasons. These crops help improve soil quality and allow farmers to earn additional income without expanding farmland use.

Ignacio Conti will serve as Etlas Chief Executive Officer, while Gaurav Sonar will act as Chair of the Board. The company will work with farmers to expand production and strengthen the clean energy supply chain.

“As the aviation industry looks for reliable, sustainable and cost-competitive sources of SAF, it is clear farmers have a critical role to play,” said Etlas CEO, Ignacio Conti. “Etlas brings together global leaders in agriculture innovation and energy production to harness this demand by leveraging technological expertise and trusted relationships with farmers around the world to help scale production and boost supply while offering farmers new revenue streams.”

“Some of us have been sitting in workgroups on sustainable aviation fuel for ten years just to get to today,” Liias said.
Lift The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator is not a guarantee of success.","The reason everyone gathered at Paine Field last week was clear: to launch the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator.

More than 175 people filled Boeing’s Future of Flight building in Everett—senior state and county leaders, airline and aircraft executives, project developers, financiers, labor leadership, and top academic researchers—there to formally stand up a regional engine designed to do one thing exceptionally well: turn sustainable aviation fuel ambition into commercial velocity.

“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” said Governor Bob Ferguson. “Sustainable aviation fuel isn’t optional for this industry. It is literally the future—and Washington is uniquely positioned to lead.”

The launch is backed by $20 million in initial capital—$10 million from the State of Washington, matched dollar-for-dollar by philanthropy—with an explicit ambition to scale toward one billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production over time.

And then, during the launch, something happened that made the room lean forward.

SkyNRG announced that Project Wigeon—a commercial-scale SAF facility planned for Eastern Washington—had secured its key environmental approvals and was moving into engineering. Fifty million gallons per year. Renewable natural gas feedstocks. Operations targeted for 2030.

SkyNRG wasn’t why people came.

But the announcement confirmed why they were there.

As Earth Finance managing director Tim Zenk put it plainly from the stage, without years of coordinated work to build Cascadia’s accelerator, this project would not exist—and we would not be in this room today. The announcement didn’t hijack the launch. It validated it.

That is what acceleration looks like.

Near the coffee station sat a scale model of the Saturn V. One look at it and caffeine felt redundant. The message was implicit: this is a place that remembers what it takes to move from audacity to execution—and has done it before.

A Coalition That Shows Up

The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator didn’t appear overnight. Senator Marco Liias, who has worked on SAF policy for more than a decade, framed the moment plainly.

“Some of us have been sitting in workgroups on sustainable aviation fuel for ten years just to get to today,” Liias said. “This launch didn’t happen by accident. It happened because people stayed at the table.”

That persistence was on display when Governor Ferguson paused the program to honor Dave Somers, naming him Washingtonian of the Day live from the stage for his role as a catalyst.

“This region has been building airplanes for more than fifty years,” Somers said. “If sustainable aviation fuel is the future of flight, this is exactly where that future should be built.”

The Drag Problem

For years, the SAF story has been a study in drag.

Despite molecular brilliance and urgent climate necessity, sustainable aviation fuel has often felt like a seaplane trying to take off from a lake of peanut butter. The thrust is there. The demand is real. But velocity has been missing. Drag costs time. Time costs money. Money costs interest. Interest erodes return on investment. And when ROI collapses, adoption stalls.

After four cycles—ethanol, biodiesel, renewable natural gas, and now SAF—it’s time to ask a harder question: what if the constraint isn’t feedstocks, chemistry, or even price?

Markets don’t price distance. They price time under uncertainty.

Why Cascadia Exists

Cascadia was launched to attack that problem directly.

Its mission isn’t to invent new molecules. It’s to collapse timelines—to reduce the compounding delays that quietly kill projects long before the first gallon is produced.

Scaling SAF requires crossing multiple thresholds at once: ASTM certification (the global fuel safety standard), state environmental review under SEPA (Washington’s gold-standard environmental policy), engine testing, carbon accounting, permitting, and infrastructure build-out. None of these hurdles is fatal on its own. Together, they destroy velocity.

Cascadia exists to build scaffolding around producers—policy, finance, infrastructure, workforce, and research—so projects don’t have to survive a decade-long game of Half Dome Economics, where one slip sends capital over the edge.

“This is a systems problem,” said Betsy Cantwell, president of Washington State University. “Universities can’t solve it alone. Industry can’t solve it alone. Government can’t solve it alone. Regional efforts like this are how hard problems actually get solved.”

Proof, on Day One

That’s why the SkyNRG announcement landed with such force.

Project Wigeon cleared review by the Washington State Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County, confirming compliance with land use, water protection, air quality, and transportation standards. With permitting secured, the project now moves into engineering—the phase where steel replaces slides.

“This milestone allows us to move forward the right way,” said John Plaza. “It demonstrates that you can meet Washington’s rigorous environmental standards while building real projects that deliver clean fuel, economic opportunity, and long-term community benefits.”

The facility will use renewable natural gas from landfills, wastewater facilities, and agricultural operations, delivered through existing infrastructure. Once operational, the fuel can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85 percent compared to conventional jet fuel—while materially reducing soot and particulate matter.

Representative Mia Gregerson, who represents communities near Sea-Tac Airport, put a human frame around those numbers. In neighborhoods downwind of runways, she said, residents can die nearly a decade earlier due to chronic exposure to air particulates. One reason SAF matters is that when it burns, the reduction in soot and particulates is visible to the naked eye—not just to a carbon calculator.

Leaders from IAM 751 emphasized another dimension: scaling SAF is also about ensuring that the next century of aviation manufacturing and energy production remains rooted in family-wage jobs.

This wasn’t a promise. It was progress.

Why Washington, Why Now

Washington’s aerospace sector supports roughly 200,000 jobs and generates more than $70 billion in annual economic impact. For leaders in the room, SAF isn’t a climate accessory—it’s an industrial necessity.

Inside the glass-walled Future of Flight building, leaders talked about fuels and timelines—while just across the street, Boeing teams were assembling aircraft that will fly for decades. The message was quiet but unmistakable: this is a place where ambition eventually turns into hardware.

As President Cantwell noted, while federal agencies can set policy, only regional efforts can actually build physical supply chains. That’s why the rest of the world is watching Cascadia—not as a local experiment, but as a blueprint for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors globally.

Lift

The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator is not a guarantee of success. But its launch—validated immediately by a real, permitted project—marks a shift from activity to velocity. At Paine Field, it felt like the brakes were finally off.

The Sustainable Markets Initiative, founded by UK’s King Charles III in 2020 when he was Prince of Wales, has appointed Paul Griffiths, chief executive of Dubai Airports, as CEO Champion of its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Pathfinder Initiative, the organisation said on Thursday.

The initiative aims to accelerate the production and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is widely seen as the most viable near-term option for cutting aviation emissions. SAF can reduce flight emissions by up to 80 per cent, but currently accounts for less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel supply.

The SAF Pathfinder Initiative focuses on mobilising investment and demand signals to unlock production, advocating for harmonised global policies and incentives, enabling critical infrastructure upgrades, and driving collaboration across the aviation supply chain to address production and cost barriers.

Griffiths’ appointment comes as pressure mounts on the aviation industry to meet its long-term climate targets, including a sector-wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

Paul Griffiths: ‘SAF is one of the most important levers … to decarbonise flight’

“I’m honoured to take on this role at such a critical time for our industry,” Griffiths said in a statement. “Sustainable aviation fuel is one of the most important levers we have to decarbonise flight, and I’m committed to accelerating its availability and adoption across the sector.”

Griffiths said the work would align with the oneDXB Sustainability Alliance, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by Dubai Airports, which aims to drive decarbonisation, innovation, and resilience across Dubai International Airport and Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International.

Under Griffiths’ leadership, Dubai Airports has achieved Level 4 “Transformation” accreditation from Airports Council International, placing it among the top 5 per cent of airports globally.

The accreditation reflects measures including collaboration with partners, the use of biodiesel-powered ground fleets, and the rollout of green infrastructure projects at Dubai International Airport.

Jennifer Jordan-Saifi, chief executive of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, said SAF could play a central role beyond aviation. “We view Sustainable Aviation Fuel as a powerful catalyst, not only for decarbonising aviation, but also for driving the global expansion of sustainable technologies and investment,” she said.",https://gulfbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Paul-Griffiths-Headshot.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 05:57:35.985960

SAF’s Claim on Biomass Global efforts to displace fossil jet fuel with renewable SAF will have a significant impact on biomass economics.
Maritime: The Next Major Biomass Competitor The maritime sector’s decarbonization requirements are beginning to exert a meaningful pull on the global renewable feedstock pool.","The center of gravity in biofuels is shifting, and an emerging pressure point is biomass. For years, road transport has dominated demand for waste- and residue-based feedstocks, absorbing most of the available supply of used cooking oil, tallow, distillers corn oil and other key inputs for renewable diesel and biodiesel production.

That era is ending.

Aviation and maritime mandates are accelerating at a time when biomass markets are tightening. The shift is creating a more competitive landscape for all participants, from refiners and traders to compliance teams and feedstock aggregators.

The question is no longer which fuel pathway grows fastest, but which sector secures the biomass first.

The New Demand Equation for Biomass

Across global markets, policy is no longer the sole driver of change. Physical biomass availability is emerging as a defining constraint. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and maritime fuels are adding new demand for the same limited pool of waste and residue oils. Both sectors will compete on price with road transport fuels to secure the feedstock needed to supply decarbonized fuels.

Several forces are tightening biomass markets simultaneously:

• Rising obligation levels in Europe for 2026 under RED III

• Stricter sustainability and traceability requirements narrowing usable supply

• Higher-value SAF pathways diverting upstream material

• Early-stage maritime adoption scaling trials into contracted volumes

As each sector claims more tonnage, the competition becomes structural rather than cyclical. Growing demand across all segments will continue to alter how these sectors operate.

SAF’s Claim on Biomass

Global efforts to displace fossil jet fuel with renewable SAF will have a significant impact on biomass economics. Refiners are increasingly testing every marginal unit of feedstock against potential SAF value, not just renewable diesel output.

What is changing:

• Current SAF production relies heavily on the same feedstocks as hydrotreated vegetable oil and renewable diesel.

• Compliance and voluntary airline demand are creating price premiums competitors cannot ignore.

• European SAF mandates are sharply increasing blending requirements.

• U.S. producers are optimizing for Section 40B and 45Z incentives, driving increased domestic SAF production.

As SAF scales, residual feedstock availability for transport renewables will tighten, requiring price adjustments to reflect these shifts.

Maritime: The Next Major Biomass Competitor

The maritime sector’s decarbonization requirements are beginning to exert a meaningful pull on the global renewable feedstock pool. The EU’s FuelEU Maritime emissions-intensity reductions, which began in 2025, require carriers to adopt low-carbon fuels well before ammonia, methanol or hydrogen reach broad commercial viability.

As a result, advanced biofuels such as used cooking oil methyl ester, fatty acid methyl ester blends and other bio-bunker fuels are entering direct competition for waste oils with road and aviation fuels.

The maritime sector may prove disruptive for several reasons:

• Large-volume consumption potential

• Immediate ability to use drop-in fuel blends

• Increased visibility of customer-driven decarbonization

While maritime demand remains relatively small today, its growth trajectory will draw biomass into a third major sector, further tightening supply.

A Feedstock Bottleneck is Forming

The most important market reality for 2026 is clear: The available biomass pool is not growing fast enough to meet policy-driven demand across all sectors.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cont1_biomass_shipyard_lede_0126_c249a52b97.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 05:58:23.652749

On Thursday, Washington leaders launched a nonprofit committed to sustainable aviation fuel, which promises to reduce aviation carbon emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The nonprofit, called the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, secured $20 million from state funding and a private donation to “de-risk” the production of sustainable aviation fuel, making it easier for companies, universities and institutions to study, develop and, eventually, produce the alternative fuel source.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been in the works for nearly two decades, but the industry has not taken off. SAF is slow and costly to produce and, though the technology is mature, there are few facilities producing the alternative fuel.

SAF accounted for less than 1% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to a December report from the International Air Transport Association.

On Thursday, Washington’s elected officials and aviation leaders gathered at Boeing’s Future of Flight museum in Mukilteo to celebrate the new initiative. Leaders from Boeing, Alaska, Amazon, Washington State University and the state Department of Commerce pledged again and again that Washington would be at the forefront of sustainable aviation, carrying on a legacy of aviation firsts in the state.

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said.

“You have a partner in the state of Washington,” he told the aviation industry. “For this truly historic opportunity, we have to move our state forward.”

SAF is an alternative to petroleum that makes fuel from so-called “feedstocks.” There are several ways to make it, but all capture gases from renewable sources, like used cooking oils or animal waste. After a complicated process, SAF is eventually mixed with traditional jet fuel to lower carbon emissions during flight.

The accelerator introduced Thursday is meant to speed up both research and production, which will enable the state to produce SAF on a large scale. It will put Washington at the forefront of what the state expects will be the next economic boom in the aviation industry, the nonprofit’s leaders said.

Washington already passed legislation to accelerate permitting and environmental review for construction of clean energy plants and introduced a tax credit that provides subsidies for SAF.

At the celebratory event Thursday, Boeing announced that, starting this year, all its flights for operations and deliveries from Renton, Everett and Paine Field will fly on up to 30% SAF.

And SkyNRG, a Dutch company building a sustainable fuel production facility in Walla Walla, said Thursday it had completed state and county environmental reviews that will allow it to move forward with construction.

A ‘catalyst’ for the industry

The aviation industry has been chasing SAF for decades. Boeing conducted the world’s first test flight powered by biofuels with Virgin Atlantic in 2008.

Yet SAF production accounted for just 0.6% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to the December report from the International Air Transport Association.

SAF production doubled from 2024 to 2025, IATA found, totaling about 634 million gallons last year. For comparison, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport alone uses about 600 million gallons of jet fuel annually, according to the Port of Seattle.

The alternative fuel is also still pricey, IATA found. In 2025, the extra costs associated with SAF added $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the aviation industry.

On Thursday, Washington’s aviation industry nonetheless projected optimism. The accelerator it introduced is meant to tackle those problems, its supporters repeated over the course of the event.

Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell told the group “it’s probably late to the game to begin solving it at this scale, but it’s not too little. It’s exactly what’s needed.”

The accelerator’s list of partners is extensive: Alaska Airlines, Amazon, Boeing, the Port of Seattle, Snohomish County, the state Department of Commerce and Washington State University.

The group received $10 million in state appropriations last year and another $10 million from a philanthropic gift, said Sen. Marko Liias, a Democrat representing Edmonds. “We are now sitting on $20 million to catalyze this industry,” he said.

It’s not clear how far that funding will go, though.

SkyNRG, the Dutch company, originally estimated it would need $600 million to $800 million to get its facility up and running.

SkyNRG plant moves forward

John Plaza, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, acknowledged at Thursday’s event that the industry has more demand for SAF than supply, but urged attendees to consider how far the initiative has come in the last 20 years.

“Lots of people like to say ‘there’s not enough SAF, we haven’t made enough progress,’” Plaza said. “Today, we’re past the theory. We’re into the implementation.”

SkyNRG set out to develop its Washington site in 2023, calling it Project Wigeon. The facility will sit on a 165-acre site at Wallula Gap and, once up and running, will produce 50 million gallons of SAF a year.

SkyNRG said Thursday the company secured approval from the state Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County to begin construction.

The company will start construction in 2028 and begin producing SAF in 2030.

Plaza declined to share how much private funding the company has for the Walla Walla facility. In 2025, the state Department of Commerce awarded a $1.5 million grant to the Port of Walla Walla to support SkyNRG’s construction of the facility.

Andy Billig, a former Washington state senator and now senior adviser for SkyNRG, said passing those environmental reviews was the hardest part of the process. The technology SkyNRG will use to make SAF is already in use elsewhere, Billig said, so he isn’t worried about putting it into practice.

“Now it feels like not easy sailing, but easier sailing,” he said.

The Sinopec-CNAF merger, announced by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission yesterday, following approval from the State Council, the country's cabinet, is a landmark event in the latest round of state-owned enterprise reorganization, said Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute. It is a proactive response to global competition and green transformation, he noted.

In addition, it is a crucial step in optimizing core business operations, which could catalyze more specialized integration among state-owned enterprises, Li pointed out.

The merger is expected to unlock significant potential in aviation's green transition. CNAF is Asia's largest aviation fuel service provider, integrating procurement, transportation, storage, testing, sales, and refueling, focusing on aviation fuel, petroleum, logistics, international business, and general aviation, while Sinopec is the world's largest refining firm and second-largest chemical company, ranking sixth in the 2025 Fortune Global 500.

Sustainable aviation fuel is crucial for the green transition, Li noted. Sinopec's SAF production tech, combined with CNAF's distribution channels, could accelerate the fuel's commercialization, helping the aviation industry meet carbon reduction goals and integrate green fuel into regular flights, he pointed out.

China's aviation fuel consumption will likely top 75 million tons by 2040 from 39.3 million tons in 2024, according to a forecast by S&P Global Ratings.

CNAF holds a virtual monopoly in the Chinese aviation fuel market, supplying all domestic and international airlines operating in the country, while also building or managing fueling facilities at most airports. However, the firm does not produce the fuel, sourcing it mainly from Sinopec, PetroChina, China National Offshore Oil, and overseas markets through its Singaporean subsidiary.

The merger will provide CNAF with more stable upstream resources while expanding Sinopec's sales channels. It could also reduce intermediary steps, potentially lowering aviation fuel prices.

The Sinopec-CNAF merger aims to optimize state capital allocation and prevent redundant competition, said Zhou Lisha, a researcher at the China Enterprise Reform and Development Research Association. CNAF occupies a crucial downstream position in the aviation fuel supply chain, with a sales network covering national airports and airline customers, so the move creates a ""refining-distribution"" system that could enhance supply chain stability and bargaining power, she noted.

However, actual price cuts depend on changes to domestic aviation fuel pricing mechanisms, industry insiders told Yicai. The ""comprehensive procurement cost"" combines factory prices with certain discounts, they said.

Factory prices are negotiated between suppliers and buyers, not exceeding the Singaporean market import prices after tax, which are announced monthly by the National Development and Reform Commission, incorporating international oil prices, exchange rates, and taxes, the insiders pointed out.

Some industry observers suggest that if the Sinopec-CNAF merger creates an integrated ""production-supply-sales"" chain, airlines that lack pricing power might find themselves in an even weaker position.

The blending target fixed by the government for SAF is 1%, 2% and 5% for 2027, 2028 and 2030, respectively. The industry’s optimism stems from the fact that the recent International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) SAF Report, launched in collaboration with Ministry of Civil Aviation, considers production of SAF through the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process as the largest opportunity for India.

Incidentally, production of SAF through ATJ process is not a time tested technology. The first plant which uses this technology has just come up in Atlanta, US. If Indian bio-energy companies can build capacities and capability to use ethanol to produce SAF to be blended with aviation fuel, the country could be an early player in this segment.

India can produce 150 cr litre sugarcane SAF by 2030

Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) estimates India has the potential to produce 125-150 crore litre of sugarcane driven SAF by 2030 without affecting ethanol demand for petrol blending and alternative use cases. CORSIA Blending Targets (2030) as well as Global CORSIA Export Market (5%) can itself generate a demand for 150 crore litres by 2030, the industry body says.

Sameer Sinha, CEO, Sugar Business, Triveni Engineering and Industries Ltd agrees. According to him, if SAF happens, India has a very significant potential to emerge as an export hub as CORSIA blending targets will see demand for SAF increase globally and ethanol based SAF can be the cleanest option with demand coming from aviation hubs like Singapore in India’s East Coast and Dubai in the West Coast.

“India has a surplus of ethanol. The feedstock is already available, and Indian ethanol, compared to that of Brazil has less carbon intensity. Which means the cleaning of the environment is larger if I use the Indian ethanol versus the Brazilian ethanol. India is already exporting refined petroleum products to many countries, and SAF can be an addition. So India has multiple advantages”, he says.

Ethanol SAF manufacturing units cannot come up overnight

However, ethanol based SAF manufacturing facilities cannot come up overnight. Experts say it takes at least three and a half years to set up a green field facility running. Even if Indian companies invest in SAF today, the production will begin only when India’s annual SAF blending target reaches near 5%. That’s the time when volume demand will rise, ISMA says.

Sinha says government policy can play a major role in making SAF an attractive investment option for the industry. He expects government to assure 100% off take in the initial years, and also an administered pricing structure for SAF. A policy regime similar to what help ethanol blending in petrol in the country can help, he feels. “We have been engaged with the government and we believe the government is working on a policy and the policy should be out before the end of the financial year. That is our hope and expectation”, he said.

The SAF blending plan for 2027 will not be driven by ethanol based SAF. It will be based on used cooking oil (UCO). Indian Oil Corporation Limited had became the first Indian company to receive ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat Refinery, followed by the signing of an MoU between IOCL and Air India for SAF supply last year.

That is the core idea behind sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.
The International Council on Clean Transportation says the fuel still costs two to five times more than conventional jet fuel.","EVERETT, Wash. — Just weeks after Washington officials acknowledged they overstated the climate benefits of past projects, the state is making a bold new promise about the future of flight.

The announcement came Thursday inside Boeing’s Future of Flight Museum, where state and aviation leaders unveiled what they are calling a multi-million-dollar push to turn Washington into a sustainable jet fuel powerhouse.

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once in a generation economic opportunity is realized and this accelerator will make that happen,” Governor Bob Ferguson said.

The event marked the official launch of the Cascadia Sustainable Accelerator, a new nonprofit designed to grow the region’s clean-fuel industry. The accelerator is funded by $10 million in state money and a separate $10 million private donation.

“It’s good for jobs, it’s good for the economy, it’s good for the environment and sustainable aviation fuel is the future of this industry,” Ferguson added.

At the same event, the Dutch-based company SkyNRG announced its first U.S. project: a 50-million-gallon-a-year sustainable aviation fuel facility planned for Walla Walla County.

“It’s been less than 20 years since the first airplane flew on something other than jet-fuel powered kerosene,” said John Plaza, SkyNRG’s chief executive.

The company says the plant will turn renewable natural gas, captured from landfills, farms and wastewater systems, into jet fuel. That is the core idea behind sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

The Port of Seattle says SAF can cut lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions by about 50 to 80 percent. However, the cost is still higher than regular jet fuel. The International Council on Clean Transportation says the fuel still costs two to five times more than conventional jet fuel.

“Aviation has very few solutions to decarbonize,” Plaza said.

That optimism is now being tempered by fresh scrutiny of the state’s climate accounting. The push for SAF comes just weeks after Washington officials acknowledged they overstated emissions reductions in their latest climate impact report.

“86% of what they claimed was simply fake,” said Todd Myers, of the Washington Policy Center. “So what they said was we thought that these projects reduced 7.5 million metric tons of CO2 and the actual number was 78,000. That’s a huge error.”

SkyNRG says its carbon-reduction claims will be subject to oversight by both federal and state regulators.

“Everything we do will be overseen and implemented by both federal and state government as required to benefit from policy that helps reduce cost to the consumer,” Plaza said.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/aea81acc-61b9-45c7-ae6f-3a0ecf555bd3/20260109T022450/aea81acc-61b9-45c7-ae6f-3a0ecf555bd3_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 00:57:56.104682

Reports accompanying the legislation include guidance on small refinery exemptions (SREs) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The House and Senate Appropriations Committee on Jan. 5 released the legislative package, which includes three bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills. The three bills include fiscal year 2026 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; and Interior, Environment and Related Agencies.

The legislative package, H.R. 6938, includes language on policies related to biomass energy. Specifically, Section 429 of the bill directs the U.S. Department of Energy, the USDA, and the U.S. EPA to jointly ensure that federal policy relating to biomass energy is consistent across all federal departments and agencies and recognizes the full benefits of the use of forest biomass for energy, conservation and responsible forest management. The agencies are also directed to establish clear and simple policies for the use of forest biomass as an energy solution, including policies that reflect the carbon neutrality of forest bioenergy and recognize biomass as a renewable energy source, provided the use of forest biomass for energy production does not cause conversion of forests to non-forest use. Biomass policies are also expected to encourage provide investment throughout the biomass supply chain, including forest bioenergy production.

The Senate Appropriations Committee on Jan. 5 also released an explanatory statement that accompanies the EPA appropriations bill. The report does not carry the force of law. Rather, it includes guidance on congressional intent regarding a variety of matters, including those related to the RFS and small refinery exemption (SRE) program.

Regarding the SRE program, the explanatory statement stresses that the EPA may exempt small refineries from compliance with the RFS in certain circumstances, and that small refineries “may at any time petition the Administrator for an extension of the exemption for the reason of disproportionate economic hardship.” The statement also directs EPA to develop policies and procedures for making SRE decisions consistent with a report published by the Government Accountability Office in November 2022.

That GAO report, titled ""Renewable Fuel Standard: Actions Needed to Improve Decision-Making in the Small Refinery Exemption Program,” was slammed as shoddy and obsolete by representatives of the U.S. biofuel industry.

Within the report, the GOA made seven specific recommendations. First, the agency recommended that the EPA reassess its conclusion that small refineries recover their RFS compliance costs in the price of gasoline and diesel they sell. Second, the GAO recommended the DOE develop an approach for consulting on SREs that provides EPA with useful information on disproportionate economic hardship. In addition, the GAO said the EPA should identify and communicate what refineries would need to submit to demonstrate disproportionate economic hardship; develop policies and procedures for making SRE decisions; develop policies and procedures to ensure the agency meets statutory deadlines; and assess the effect of SRE decision timing on the benefit provided to small refineries, as well as the effect on fuel markets, and reconsider petition requirements. The report also encouraged the DOE to develop policies and procedures for its consultation with EPA on SRE petitions.

The explanatory statement also directs the EPA to provide a briefing within 60 days on its proposed actions related to eRINs within the RFS program. In addition, the agency is directed to submit a report to lawmakers within 30 days that is focused on fuel derived from waste plastic or waste tires, including any plans the EPA may have to qualify such fuels as cellulosic biofuel under the RFS.

A separate explanatory statement released in conjunction with the portion of the legislative package providing fiscal year 2026 funding for the U.S. Department of Energy notes up to $5 million can be made available to continue supporting the development of new domestically manufactured, low-emission, high-efficiency resident wood heaters.

Lawmakers also specify that the appropriations funding agreement provides up to $5 million to support research and development aimed as advancing the supply of renewable natural gas (RNG), clean hydrogen, and other impactful products form syngas; up to $25 million for algae-related activities; and up to $10 million for research and development of the anaerobic bioproduction of 3-hydroxypropionic acid utilizing existing Midwest ethanol fermentation infrastructure and renewable whole-kernel corn feedstock.

Within the statement, lawmakers also encourage the DOE “to conduct research related to the development, pre-piloting, piloting, and demonstration scale-up of renewable liquefied petroleum gas or alternative fuels production, in parallel with the department’s focus on the scale-up of sustainable aviation fuel technologies.” The DOE is also “encouraged to pursue the advancement and development of pre-commercial, advanced sustainable aviation fuel feedstocks and technologies to include non-biogenic feedstocks and technologies, such as hydrogen-based e-fuels.”

MUKILTEO, Wash. — Industry leaders from the Pacific Northwest convened on Thursday at the Boeing Future of Flight Aviation Center to inaugurate the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, a new initiative designed to establish the region as a leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) innovation. The event brought together elected officials, corporate executives, and academic figures to emphasize the region’s commitment to advancing cleaner aviation technologies.

Washington Governor Bob Ferguson emphasized the unique economic opportunity presented by the accelerator, stating, “We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen.” The initiative aims to overcome existing barriers to SAF adoption by fostering a robust marketplace, closing the price gap with conventional jet fuel, and increasing production capacity.

Addressing Challenges in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Adoption

Sustainable aviation fuel, typically derived from plant-based sources and waste materials, is widely regarded as the most promising and scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. Despite its potential, SAF remains at least twice as expensive as traditional jet fuel, limiting its widespread use even as airlines and logistics companies commit to sustainability goals.

The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator launches with a combined $20 million in funding, including $10 million from the state and an equal amount from philanthropic sources. Amazon’s director of public policy, Guy Palumbo, highlighted the company’s role as a major SAF customer, noting Amazon’s planned purchase of 3.7 million gallons of SAF in 2024 to reduce the carbon footprint of its air cargo operations. Palumbo underscored the systemic nature of the challenge, stating, “This is a systems issue that no one company can solve. You’ve got great companies up here in this room right now that are ready to use this fuel, but we have to make it available.”

The launch event showcased the accelerator’s public-private partnership model, featuring remarks from Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyen, Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell, and executives from Alaska Airlines, Boeing, and SkyNRG. A panel discussion included representatives from Amazon, SkyNRG, the Machinists Union, and the Port of Seattle, reflecting the broad coalition supporting the initiative.

Strategic Focus and Industry Outlook

The accelerator’s strategy encompasses several key areas: providing research and development resources to startups and fuel manufacturers; advocating for SAF-friendly policies at both state and federal levels; facilitating funding and purchase agreements for producers; developing supply chains for diverse feedstocks such as agricultural waste, algae, cooking oils, and animal fats; and supporting infrastructure for transporting and blending low-carbon fuels with conventional aviation fuels.

Despite the Pacific Northwest’s strong aerospace heritage and concentration of industry leaders, significant challenges persist. Regulatory dependencies and protracted certification processes remain critical concerns, particularly for Boeing, whose future earnings and cash flow are closely linked to the commercial viability of SAF. Market responses to the accelerator’s launch have been mixed, with demand for freighter aircraft providing some support amid broader economic uncertainties influenced by Federal Reserve policy debates and fluctuating economic indicators.

Global competition is also intensifying. European governments and the European Space Agency are increasing investments in space and aviation technologies, while Amazon’s Leo space communications business competes against both established and emerging players in the sector.

Proponents of the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator argue that the Pacific Northwest’s deep aerospace roots and collaborative ecosystem uniquely position it to become a hub for sustainable aviation fuel. Nonetheless, realizing this vision will require navigating complex regulatory, economic, and competitive challenges in the years ahead.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/56e87f3f2c2a419689f097f6db2abca8.avif,N,,2026-01-08 19:57:04.331763

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?","MUKILTEO—Washington State Governor Bob Ferguson, Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers, Senator Marko Liias, other law makers, and leaders in aviation technology research and sustainability launched the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator (CSAA) today – a new initiative designed to accelerate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production deployment and adoption across the Pacific Northwest.

“Clean fuels are a priority for Washington State. It’s good for jobs, it’s good for the economy, it’s good for the environment. And I think we can all agree that sustainable aviation fuel is literally the future of this industry,” said Gov. Ferguson. “The good news is that Washington is uniquely situated to be the leader in this massive fuel industry for decades, and generations, to come.”

In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, CSAA is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable fuels industry in the Pacific Northwest.

The announcement came at Boeing’s Future of Flight Aviation Center in Mukilteo on Thursday, January 8. The event consisted of remarks by government, and industry leaders and partners, followed by a panel discussion with CSAA Board vice chair and Managing Director, Earth Finance Tim Zenk, Amazon executive Guy Palumbo, SkyNRG executive and former State Sen. Andy Billig, Port of Seattle Executive Director Steve Metruck, and Machinists Union, District 751, Jon Holden. The topic of the panel discussion was focused on investment innovation and workforce development.

“Today we’re launching the next chapter in our state’s history, as a global, environmental, economic, and technology leader,” said Senator Liias. “In the last couple of years, I’ve been proud to champion for investments in the state legislature, most recently $10 million from WA State, met with a $10 million philanthropic match. So we’re sitting on a $20 million investment on catalyzing on this industry and that is so exciting.”

Liias thanked the Boeing Company, Alaska Airlines, Snohomish County, Microsoft, the Port of Seattle, Washington State University, Amazon, and the Washington State Department of Commerce for their continual support and partnership.

Gov. Ferguson, who followed Senator Liias in remarks, first deemed Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers as the “Washingtonian of the Day” for being the one person who has been forefront in the State’s initiative of bringing sustainable aviation fuel to, not only to Snohomish County, but to the state at large.

In 2023, the County, under Somers’ leadership, opened the world’s very first SAF Research and Development facility at the Snohomish County-operated Paine Field Airport. While the site is currently temporary, the county has plans to open a permanent facility at a later date – yet to be determined, according to Snohomish County Communications Director Kari Bray.

Well before, and even after, the opening of Paine Field’s SAF R&D facility, Somers has continued to be a champion for sustainable aviation fuel in Snohomish County and beyond, Ferguson said Thursday.

“We have the resources, we have the will, we have the leadership, and we have the partnership who are all here today. In other words, we all have pieces to play to ensure this once in a generation economic opportunity is realized,” said Gov. Ferguson.

Ferguson also thanked Washington State University for the continued research on SAF.

The ‘Washingtonian of the Day’ himself, and Chair of the CSAA, Executive Dave Somers, was next to speak beginning with a joke: “Sustainable jet fuel is great; same jet lag, but with a cleaner conscious.”

Somers was proud of Snohomish County’s role in Washington State’s economic footprint, being the home of the Boeing company who employees approximately 130,000 Washingtonians and contributes roughly $60 billion to the state annually.

“For all of these reasons, Snohomish County is really the perfect place to house the Cascadia Institute,” said Executive Somers. “The County has four keyholes for the future of research and development. First, we’ll bridge the gap between academia and history by partnering with Washington State University and eventually other national, and international institutions. The second is to lead the world in development, distribution, and adoption of new technologies to reduce the carbon-based footprint. The third is to address the skill shortage and to continue our efforts to create a gold standard in workforce development by connecting local youth to high-quality jobs in the field. Fourth is to attract international investment to our innovation, economy, and create jobs.”

Other speakers included Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyen, Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell, Hawaiian Airlines President and CEO Diana Birkett Rakow, and Boeing Vice President of State and Local Government Operations Bill McSherry. State, tribal, and community leaders were also in attendance to show their support.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the most viable pathway today to significantly reduce aviation emissions. Cascadia has the natural resources, research expertise, policy environment, infrastructure, workforce and industry leadership needed to become a global leader in SAF production.

The launch of CSAA marks a major step toward aligning public policy, private investment, research and community support to secure long-term economic and environmental benefits for our region. The launch is made possible by $10M in state funding and a $10M private gift.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

SAF’s are a biofuel with similar properties and safety requirements as conventional jet fuel used in aircraft but with a smaller carbon footprint. These certified “Jet-A1” fuels are made by blending conventional kerosene (fossil-based) with renewable hydrocarbon. Currently, SAFs are used as a “drop-in” replacement to conventional petroleum-based jet fuel that when combined called a blend. The minimal acceptance blend is 10% SAF to a high of 50%. The goal is a certified 100% replacement blend of SAF to conventional jet fuel.

A huge benefit to SAFs than alternative green aviation solutions such as electric and hydrogen powered aircraft fleets is the minimal disruption to implement into existing infrastructure. It is cost beneficial to ensure that manufacturers do not have to redesign engines nor aircraft, and that fuel suppliers and airports do not have to build new fuel delivery systems.

SkyNRG Secures Key Environmental Approvals to Advance Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Eastern Washington

Following Thursday’s remarks and panel discussion, SkyNRG announced a key milestone for Project Wigeon, a planned sustainable aviation fuel facility in Eastern Washington, after securing environmental approvals from the Washington State Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County.

The approvals confirm that the project meets state and local environmental standards, including requirements related to land use, water protection, and fuel transportation. Project Wigeon will be among North America’s first commercial-scale SAF projects producing jet fuel from renewable natural gas (RNG).

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to reduce harmful emissions, which is why SkyNRG is building SAF facilities such as Project Wigeon around the world,” said John Plaza, Chief Executive Officer of SkyRNG Americas. “The Department of Ecology’s environmental review and Walla Walla County’s approval demonstrate our commitment to building this facility the right way – using industry-leading technology and conducting robust analysis of environmental impacts. This milestone allows SkyNRG to continue delivering clean fuel to major airports, building economic opportunity in Eastern Washington, and protecting natural resources and community health for years to come.”

SkyNRG’s new facility will support a fast-expanding global demand, which is projected to reach five billion gallons by 2030 and more than 12 billion gallons by 2035.",https://lynnwoodtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_0623-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 19:57:15.590284

Ferguson launches sustainable jet fuel research center at Paine Field | HeraldNet.com,Randy Diamond,,,,,https://www.heraldnet.com/news/gov-ferguson-launches-sustainable-jet-fuel-research-center-at-paine-field/,"Bob Ferguson joined Snohomish County officials and aviation executives Thursday morning to formally launch a sustainable jet fuel research center at Paine Field.
Heyne, who said he has tested sustainable jet fuel from 40 companies in his lab, said that, currently, the sustainable fuel must be blended with conventional jet fuel to power an airline.
Heyne said that sustainable aviation fuel accounts for a minor share of the fuel airlines use today.
Under the accelerator model being explored, companies could work with the center’s staff to help develop their sustainable fuel products, he said.
Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel will be the future, said Ray Stephanson, president and CEO of Economic Alliance Snohomish County.","MUKILTEO — Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson joined Snohomish County officials and aviation executives Thursday morning to formally launch a sustainable jet fuel research center at Paine Field.

“I think we can all agree that sustainable aviation fuel is literally the future of this (aviation) industry,” Ferguson told the several hundred people gathered at the Boeing Future of Flight museum and tour center.

He said the state was uniquely positioned to host the center because Washington State University has become a key research center for the development of sustainable fuels.

The center, with $10 million in new funding from the state Legislature and $10 million from an anonymous donor, aims to make Snohomish County a global hub for the development of green aviation fuel. It’s scheduled to be built on an 8-acre site south of the main Paine Field runway.

Called the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, the nonprofit would be run in conjunction with Snohomish County and Washington State University.

But Sen. Marko Liias, D-Everett, who helped secure an initial $6.5 million grant from the state Department of Transportation grant for the center back in April 2023, told the audience that the use of sustainable aviation fuel for airlines today accounts for less than 1% of the fuel carriers use.

He said increasing usage will be a difficult proposition.

“This is going to be a tremendous challenge,” he said. “It’s going to be hard. There are still barriers that we need to overcome.”

After the program, Liias said that building a permanent home for the center will require up to $40 million in additional funding.

He said he expects the legislature to be asked to appropriate additional funds in the future, and that a campaign will be mounted to secure additional grants and private funding. Liias said federal funds could also be a possibility but, for now, Congress has let previous sustainable fuel aid programs expire.

Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers, who chairs the Cascadia Accelerator board, said after the program that a temporary facility will open in the next several months in a rented building at Paine Field, with suites for labs and offices. He said several storage tanks will also be built in the next year to house the sustainable fuel.

Somers said funding challenges do remain, but he was confident that the center would be built.

Somers, speaking earlier at the event, said the accelerator’s partnership with Washington State University will establish a “world-class research and development facility.”

“Combined with our region’s aviation industry cluster, these developments ensure we will be a leader in global aviation sustainability and investment well into the future,” he said.

Proponents of sustainable aviation fuel, which is made from plants, sewage and or food, tout it as the future of aviation mobility. However, the current costs for airlines to use the fuel are two to three times the cost of conventional jet fuel, said Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab at Washington State University in Pullman.

Heyne, who said he has tested sustainable jet fuel from 40 companies in his lab, said that, currently, the sustainable fuel must be blended with conventional jet fuel to power an airline.

He said more research is needed on fuels that don’t require blending.

Consequently, he said, airlines use very little of the fuel as they aim to be price-competitive with other airlines.

“Fuel costs are a major contributor to airline fares,” he said.

Heyne said that sustainable aviation fuel accounts for a minor share of the fuel airlines use today.

The International Air Transport Association, which represents 300 airlines globally, said its statistics show that SAF production accounted for only 0.3% of global jet fuel production, though it has double the 2023 level.

The association said initial projections for 2024 show that companies had planned to produce more than three times what they estimated.

SAF volumes are increasing, but disappointingly slowly,” the association said in a press release on its website. “Governments are sending mixed signals to oil companies, which continue to receive subsidies for their exploration and production of fossil oil and gas.”

The commercial aviation industry has pledged to transition to 100% sustainable fuel use by 2050.

How the center will work and how many people it will employ is still being worked out, Heyne said. Under the accelerator model being explored, companies could work with the center’s staff to help develop their sustainable fuel products, he said.

Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel will be the future, said Ray Stephanson, president and CEO of Economic Alliance Snohomish County.

He said the establishment of the center is a positive for Snohomish County, but it’s pretty early in the process and unclear how many jobs it will bring for now.

“We’re going to have to accelerate our learning curve and bring this fuel to market in a way that it could be used in substantial quantities,” he said.",https://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/41260607_web1_TSR-EDH-SustainableAviation-EDH-260108-fs.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:57:53.433723

Announced Jan. 8 at the Boeing Future of Flight in Everett, the accelerator brings together state leaders, aviation and manufacturing partners, research institutions, Tribal representatives, labor, and community organizations to rapidly scale the production and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Funded through a 2025 state legislative appropriation and an additional $10 million in private philanthropic support, CSAA is the most comprehensive initiative of its kind in the Pacific Northwest.

WSU President Betsy Cantwell said the partnership reflects both the urgency and the opportunity facing the aviation sector.

“Aviation connects people, communities, and economies across Washington, the nation, and the world,” Cantwell said. “But for aviation to remain strong and resilient in the decades ahead, sustainability must be part of its future. That’s why partnerships like this one matter so much.”

Research driving real-world impact

WSU researchers from eight programs across three colleges are advancing work on sustainable aviation fuels, spanning alternative feedstocks, fuel testing and certification, supply-chain logistics, economic impacts, and policy frameworks. That breadth of work positions the university to contribute at every stage of SAF development, from early research to commercial deployment.

“We are fortunate to have some of the world’s leading experts in this field at WSU,” Cantwell said, recognizing faculty leaders Josh Heyne and Mike Wolcott during the launch event. “Their leadership, along with the dedication of their colleagues and students, has helped position WSU at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuels research, both nationally and globally.”

SAF is produced from renewable and waste-based feedstocks such as oilseed crops, agricultural residues and forestry byproducts. When used in place of conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% while meeting the safety and performance standards required for commercial aviation.

As part of these efforts, WSU is partnering with Snohomish County to establish a world-leading Sustainable Aviation Fuel Research and Development Center at Paine Field Airport. This work will accelerate research, testing, and adoption of sustainable aviation fuels that can dramatically reduce the aviation industry’s dependence on carbon-based fuels and help decarbonize air travel.

The Center will host the world’s first SAF repository, where fuel samples are collected, tested at laboratory and larger scales, indexed, and distributed globally to support research and commercialization. WSU researchers, including experts from WSU’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Laboratory, will lead efforts in fuel testing, finishing, and scaling while collaborating with government, industry, and academic partners to foster innovation, workforce development, and economic growth in the region.

National leadership in sustainable aviation

WSU’s role in CSAA builds on nearly a decade of national leadership in the field. The university also serves as a co-leader, alongside the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, of ASCENT — the FAA-convened Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment.

The consortium brings together universities, federal agencies, national laboratories and private-sector partners to advance sustainable air transportation.

Looking ahead

Aviation currently accounts for roughly 2–3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, and demand for air travel is expected to grow. Leaders at the launch event emphasized that SAF offers one of the most promising near-term pathways to reduce emissions while maintaining safety, affordability, and reliability.

As CSAA moves forward, WSU will continue contributing its research expertise, convening power, and land grant perspective to help ensure sustainable aviation fuels are developed responsibly and at scale.",https://wpcdn.web.wsu.edu/news/uploads/sites/2797/2026/01/planes-on-tarmac.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:57:59.260789

In 2025, the company advanced several key levers of its sustainability strategy, from scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to electrifying last‑mile delivery and building solar‑powered infrastructure.

These achievements mark meaningful progress toward DHL’s goal of net‑zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and reinforce its role in building more sustainable, efficient, and resilient global trade.

Here are five milestones that defined this progress.

Advancing sustainable aviation: Largest SAF agreement in the U.S.

Air freight remains the most carbon-intensive mode of transport per ton-kilometer, and DHL has been a pioneer in adopting SAF since 2021. In 2025, DHL signed one of its largest-ever SAF agreements with Phillips 66: over 240,000 metric tons (approximately 314 million liters) of SAF over three years. This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e – about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL’s West Coast operations.

Cutting emissions at sea: Partnership with CMA CGM

Ocean freight moves most global goods, making sustainable marine fuel (SMF) critical for reducing emissions. DHL and CMA CGM partnered to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO₂e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions). That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport.

Hydrogen on the horizon: First pilot in the Middle East

Hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonizing long-haul logistics, providing longer range than electric trucks. DHL has been actively testing hydrogen trucks in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, and will now introduce them in the Middle East. Last year, DHL signed an MoU with Hyperview in Saudi Arabia to pilot hydrogen-powered trucks. The project aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 and includes a feasibility study for hydrogen infrastructure, reinforcing DHL’s commitment to reduce logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions in emerging markets.

Fully electric delivery across Germany

DHL aims to electrify 66% of its last-mile fleet – the final step of getting a shipment to the end customer – by 2030, with Germany leading the charge. In 2025, the company announced one of its largest electric‑vehicle purchases: 2,400 new Ford electric vans for its Post & Parcel Germany division, the majority of which have already been delivered and are in operation. This milestone means that onethird of all German postcodes will benefit from zero-GHG-emission last-mile delivery, powered by a fleet of more than 35,000 electric vehicles, including e-trikes, e-vans, and e-bikes.

Solar-powered warehousing in Asia

Beyond operational carbon neutrality, DHL is exploring facilities that produce or source renewable energy on-site, combining sustainability with energy self-sufficiency. In Thailand last year, DHL launched a solar-powered warehouse expected to generate 100% of its energy on-site through a 4.2 MWp solar array and advanced battery storage. This facility eliminates reliance on fossil-based grid electricity and sets a blueprint for future logistics infrastructure worldwide.",https://www.thebwa.com/wp-content/uploads/Solar.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 04:12:57.225564

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen,” said Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson.

SAF is widely viewed as the most promising, scalable solution for cutting carbon emissions from aviation. The fuel is typically made from plant-based sources and can be blended with conventional fossil fuels used to power aircraft. But it costs twice as much or more than existing fuels, and the industry has struggled to take off in the U.S. or internationally despite sustainability pledges by airlines and others.

The new accelerator hopes to close that price gap, create a SAF marketplace and boost fuel production. It’s kicking off with $10 million in state funding and a $10 million philanthropic gift.

Guy Palumbo, Amazon’s director of public policy, said the company is a SAF customer, buying 3.7 million gallons of the fuel in 2024 to make a small dent in the carbon impact of its air cargo transportation. And it would buy much more, he added, but the fuel isn’t available.

“This is a systems issue that no one company can solve,” Palumbo said. “You’ve got great companies up here in this room right now that are ready to use this fuel, but we have to make it available.”

The event highlighted the initiative’s public-private partnership by featuring speakers that also included Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyen, Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell, county and state elected officials, leaders from Alaska Airlines, Boeing, SkyNRG and others.

The accelerator has a multi-pronged strategy that includes:

Providing R&D resources for startups and other fuel manufacturers, including equipment and expertise.

Promoting SAF-friendly policies.

Helping facilitate funding for SAF producers, including purchase agreements with SAF customers.

Developing feedstock supply chains for the fuel, which can include waste from agriculture and logging, algae, cooking oils, animal fats and manure.

Supporting infrastructure development for transporting and blending low-carbon fuels with traditional aviation fuels to create SAF.

Establishing the sector is a Herculean task, but supporters argue this region is well-positioned for a SAF hub, citing its status as Boeing’s original home, its robust aviation industry, the availability of feedstocks, its strong environmental policies, and other strengths.

Despite years of work by organizations in Washington and around the globe, SAF comprises less than 1% of the aviation fuel in use today. And geopolitics — most recently including President Trump’s plans to begin cranking up oil production in Venezuela — continue to complicate progress.

“This is going to be a tremendous challenge. It’s going to be hard,” said Sen. Marko Liias. But, he added, “we know the rest of the world is going all in on SAF and this is the fuel of the future. There’s no better place than Washington state to catalyze the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale.”

The need is pressing. Aviation’s impact on carbon emissions is growing as flights serving passenger travel and air cargo increase. There are companies developing sustainable aircraft, such as those powered by batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, but that technology will take decades to scale and its applications are uncertain. SAF, on the other hand, can be used in existing aircraft.

Multiple SAF companies are already operating in the Pacific Northwest:

SkyNRG is a Dutch company building a SAF facility in Walla Walla, Wash., and will use renewable natural gas that’s captured at landfills and from dairy waste as a feedstock. On Thursday the company announced it has secured key environmental approvals from the state, and plans to start commercial operations in 2030.

Montana Renewables is manufacturing approximately 30 million gallons of synthetic paraffinic kerosene, or SPK, per year which is blended with jet fuel to make SAF. The Montana company employs used cooking oils, animal fat from meat production, and plant oils as its feedstock and plans to dramatically increase production.

NXTClean Fuels has plans to develop two clean fuels facilities in Oregon. Its flagship site, a $3 billion plant at Port Westward on the Columbia River, is in the final stages of federal permitting and could break ground this year, with operations starting in late 2028 at the earliest.

Twelve is a California-based company that broke ground in 2023 on a SAF facility called AirPlant One in Moses Lake, Wash., and is currently commissioning its facility. It plans to use liquid ethanol produced in the state as its carbon source.

In the coming months, the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator is moving temporarily into a commercial space at Everett’s Paine Field airport. Initial funding has been secured to build a new facility, with the hope of completing construction no later than 2029.

The accelerator effort took root two years ago when Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers announced plans for a SAF center and state legislators from the county committed to seek funding for the initiative.

“Washington has been the SAF leader from the beginning,” said SkyNRG executive and former state Sen. Andy Billig. The first commercial test flight using SAF came from a Washington producer and was used on a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400 flying from London to Amsterdam in 2008.",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260108_1850586221.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:58:30.636508

Technip Energies Hummingbird® technology plays an important role in LanzaJet AtJ process, which converts bioethanol derived from waste, off-gases, CO2 or biomass into SAF. Hummingbird® is used in the crucial first step to dehydrate the ethanol to ethylene.

Andreas Bormann, Technip Energies VP Technology - Sustainable Fuels, Chemicals, & Circularity, said: “By integrating Hummingbird® technology with LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) platform, we have delivered a scalable solution for sustainable aviation fuel. We appreciate the confidence LanzaJet has shown by choosing our advanced and efficient technology.”

“It is another reminder how technology and innovation set Technip Energies apart, allow us to continue growing our products and services, and help our clients to decarbonize their business.”",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2026-01-08 19:12:20.588151

Announced at the Boeing Future of Flight, the initiative is the most comprehensive and well-funded across the region of its kind to accelerate the production, deployment and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Funded through a 2025 State of Washington appropriation and private philanthropic donation of an additional $10 million, the CSAA positions the Pacific Northwest as a global leader in an accelerated transition to sustainable aviation fuel while capitalizing on the once-in-a-generation economic opportunity of scaling local SAF production. In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, CSAA is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable fuels industry in the Pacific Northwest.

The Cascadia region has been a trailblazer in aerospace innovation for over a century, and today it is uniquely positioned as a global center of aviation innovation, with an opportunity to unlock the next generation of sustainable fuel. With access to local, low carbon feedstocks, affordable clean energy, established infrastructure and a skilled workforce, the region has all the elements necessary to support production of up to one billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2035. Scaling production at this level would drive economic prosperity and development, strengthen regional energy security and independence, support state and regional climate initiatives and build on Cascadia’s long legacy as an aviation innovator.

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. SAF is a safe, effective drop-in solution projected to be used for the next 70-plus years that can reduce emissions by 80% compared to fossil-based fuels and the transition to a thriving circular economy through locally produced SAF.

The Jan. 8 launch event featured remarks from leaders across the aviation, research and public sectors. Executives from Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines and Boeing spoke to the importance of aligning the full ecosystem of manufacturers and operators, policy, research, financing and public awareness to scale sustainable aviation fuel and secure the long-term future of aviation. Representative Mia Gregerson highlighted the need to center sustainability and airport communities as the industry transitions to cleaner fuels. Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell underscored the role of research and innovation in advancing sustainable aviation fuel from the lab to commercial deployment, while Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn addressed the state’s investments in clean energy, economic development and partnerships with Tribal nations.

The event also hosted a panel discussion moderated by Tim Zenk, a sustainable aviation fuel expert at Earth Finance, featuring executives Guy Palumbo at Amazon; Andy Billig, board member at SkyNRG; labor leader Jon Holden, Machinists Union, District 751; and Port of Seattle Executive Director Steve Metruck. The panel focused on investment pathways, workforce development and the economic opportunity presented by large scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

Word of the merger initiated by Beijing first emerged in November 2025, involving CAO’s parent China National Aviation Fuel (CNAF) and Sinopec – also known as China Petrochemical.

CAO said that following deliberation by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Council, an institution under the State Council of China, the two companies would proceed with the “corporate restructuring”.

It added that the restructuring remains subject to further approvals and filing procedures in accordance with applicable regulations.

Sinopec is China’s biggest oil and petrochemical products supplier. The company is also the largest refining company and the second-largest chemical company in the world. The Fortune 500 firm’s Singapore interests include petrochemical trading, marine bunkering operations and the sale of refined and chemical products. It also operates petrol stations in Yishun and Bukit Timah.

Sinopec is expected to absorb all of CNAF’s assets and operations if the merger goes through, Bloomberg reported, quoting a source.

CNAF owns 51 per cent of CAO, and, on occasion, balances domestic supplies by importing or exporting cargoes via trading arms such as the company.

The core business of CAO is in jet fuel supply and trading. It is the largest physical jet fuel buyer in the Asia-Pacific and the key importer of such fuel into China.

China is one of the world’s biggest civil aviation markets. Demand for air travel has rebounded sharply since the end of the pandemic, with flights returning to the skies.

The country is expected to consume more than 40 million tonnes of jet fuel this year, or close to a million barrels a day – valued at about US$30 billion at prevailing prices.

Research from Sweden’s Linnaeus University suggests that operating near-full, economy-only seating, combined with efficient airframes, could halve CO2 emissions.

Frequently described as one of the most carbon-intensive activities, aviation accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, but has contributed around 4% to global warming to date.

Commercial airlines burned the equivalent of 892-936 million tonnes of CO2 in 2019, and without intervention, this figure is projected to rise as air travel demand grows.

Airline efficiency could halve aviation CO2 emissions

In the study published by Communications Earth & Environment, researchers highlight that policymakers, airlines and other stakeholders need to think beyond alternative fuels and new technologies to reduce aviation’s CO2 emissions. They should also rethink how aircraft are configured and operated.

The report led by Prof. Stefan Gössling at Linnaeus University found that operating flights with only economy-class seating on efficient aircraft with optimum load factors could theoretically reduce commercial aviation’s CO2 emissions by nearly 50% compared with current practices.

Commenting on the study, Gössling said: “We found that at least 50% (and up to 75%) of current fuel use could be avoided if airlines were forced to operate at maximum efficiency, while still transporting the same number of passengers over the same distances.”

He also argued that while much of the focus to reduce CO2 emissions has been on sustainable fuels, producing SAF is an expensive and uncertain process with a “significant business risk.” Instead, “It is far more prudent to reduce fuel use,” he said.

Carbon-intensive city pairs and airports

Gössling and his fellow researchers analysed data on 27.5 million flights between 26,156 city pairs in 2023 to understand the variations in CO2 emissions per passenger. The results showed that efficiency differs by region.

Flights departing from airports in the US, Australia and parts of Africa were found to be the most polluting. Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall. The study also found that the US – the largest emitting country in the world – had over 14% more polluting flights than the global average.

Airports in India, Brazil and Southeast Asia were primarily served by less polluting flights.

Typically, larger airports have a higher efficiency averaged across arriving and departing flights, while smaller airports that often serve less busy flights have a lower efficiency rating.

Crucially, the report highlighted that operating all routes at their demonstrated optimum could cut emissions by 10.7%. The theoretical 50% reduction is possible with all-economy layouts on the most efficient aircraft and 95% load factors.

Key efficiency measures for reducing CO2 emissions of airlines

Phasing out inefficient aircraft models (27% to 34% efficiency gain)

(Plus) removing premium-class seating (total 46% to 71% efficiency gain)

(Plus) increasing load factors (55% to 76% efficiency gain)

Why economy-only seating matters for airline carbon emissions

While factors influencing fuel consumption and the wider adoption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are well documented, variations in operational efficiency across global markets have received far less attention.

In response, the Linnaeus University study explores not only the total fuel burned but also how that fuel translates into emissions per revenue passenger-kilometre (RPK) – or the amount of CO2 emitted to carry one paying passenger per km.

Researchers also found that modern aircraft vary widely in their CO2 intensity. The most efficient route (31.6g CO2/RPK) was from Milan in Italy to Incheon Airport in South Korea, while the least efficient (888.3g CO2/ RPK) was between two destinations – Kavieng and Tokua Laukunai, in Papua New Guinea.

It’s no great surprise that newer, lighter and more aerodynamic aircraft will burn significantly less fuel per passenger than their older counterparts. However, the seating layout and passenger load matter because emissions are spread over more people.

Premium seating takes up more space per passenger but generates roughly the same emissions as economy seats for the same flight distance. Configuring an aircraft with all-economy layouts increases the number of seats filled and spreads the emissions more thinly.

The International Air Transportation Association (IATA) reiterates this. It suggests that business and first-class seats are up to five times more CO2-intensive than economy class seats.

The report also highlighted that beyond seating, procedural and more efficient routing also contribute to additional gains. When implemented at scale across airline networks and regions, it’s this ecosystem of operational improvements combined that underpins the theoretical halving of emissions.

Real-world challenges and trade-offs

While the report’s theoretical reduction in CO2 emissions is compelling, significant practical challenges remain.

Passenger preferences continue to influence both seating choices and airline selection. Many travellers value the space, comfort and discretion offered in premium cabins. There is also the risk that previously premium passengers will switch to business jets, which would only further increase the global emissions per passenger-kilometre.

For airlines, these higher-yield products are also integral to commercial strategies, subsidising economy fares and supporting route viability.

What’s more, achieving 95% load factors or at least close to it and all-economy configurations could require policy incentives or restrictions, as well as higher chargers.

Gossling argues that “while strong resistance can be expected, the trade-off is essentially a temporary reduction in personal comfort for a minority of passengers in exchange for avoiding around half a gigatonne of CO2 emissions (in addition to non-CO2 effects).” In fuel terms, this would be equivalent to eliminating the need for approximately 150Mt of SAF.”

Ultimately, the study underlines that meaningful CO2 emission reductions do not rely solely on innovative fuel technology and new aircraft. Changes in how aircraft are configured and operated could also deliver substantial gains. It also reinforces that emissions per passenger are shaped as much by how we fly as what we fly.

Outokumpu, the global leader in sustainable stainless steel, and Norsk e-Fuel, a Nordic pioneer in Power-to-Liquid project development, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to work together towards realizing a CO-to-SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) production plant to be located next to Outokumpu’s stainless steel mill in Koivuluoto, Tornio, Finland. Under the signed MoU, Norsk e-Fuel will start a feasibility study in 2026. If the study leads to positive results, Norsk e-Fuel anticipates taking an investment decision around 2028, with production start planned for 2032.

Outokumpu would provide carbon monoxide (CO) side streams from its ferrochrome production as a feedstock for the production of 80,000-100,000 tons of eSAF annually, supporting the EU’s eSAF quota and advancing the decarbonization of aviation – one of the hard-to-abate sectors. Once operational, the eSAF plant would create financial value for Outokumpu through increased side stream utilization. The project will support Outokumpu’s decarbonization journey by allowing the company to reduce direct CO₂ emissions by 200,000 tons annually, representing 20% of Outokumpu's global direct emissions. In addition, it would contribute to the EU’s targets for the clean energy transition and increase the EU’s resilience and strategic independence through strengthening domestic fuels supply.

Norsk e-Fuel will lead the project development, drawing on its longstanding experience and strong partner network to carry out engineering, secure financing and engage future customers for the produced fuels. Responsible for funding the project, Norsk e-Fuel estimates the investment to be approximately EUR ~1.2–1.5 billion while expecting to create approximately 250 new jobs locally.

“Decarbonization is at the core of Outokumpu’s strategy and demonstrates our vision to lead in sustainable materials and technologies. We continuously seek new smart ways to reduce climate emissions across the entire value chain, and our Kemi-Tornio ecosystem provides an excellent platform to further strengthen the circular economy, while delivering financial value to Outokumpu. The partnership with Norsk e-Fuel demonstrates how Outokumpu’s commitment to sustainability extends beyond low-emission stainless steel and ferrochrome production to the utilization of our side streams”, says Martti Sassi, President for Business Area Ferrochrome at Outokumpu.

“The collaboration with Outokumpu brings together two companies with complementary strengths and a shared ambition to advance the energy transition in Finland and Europe. Outokumpu’s industrial platform and available side streams, combined with our experience in developing Power-to-Liquid projects, create a strong foundation for competitive eSAF production in Tornio. We value the openness and ambition Outokumpu brings to this partnership, and we are looking forward to evaluating the potentials of this eSAF project that will support both aviation decarbonization and Europe’s energy resilience”, says Lars Bjørn Larsen, CCO at Norsk e-Fuel.

Finland – one of the best locations in Europe for SAF production. Driven by abundant supply of clean electricity, public support for hydrogen economy development and access to relevant resources, Finland ranks among the best locations in Europe for eSAF production*. Within Finland, the Bothnia Bay region stands out due to its robust industrial infrastructure and access to recycled carbon streams with Outokumpu Tornio site offering the most competitive carbon sources available. Its carbon monoxide (CO) stream is continuously available throughout the year in high volumes and concentrations and is collected at a single point. This enables eSAF production with lower investment requirements and operating costs compared to projects based on captured CO₂. As a result, Outokumpu Tornio site provides an optimal location for large-scale, cost-efficient eSAF production in Europe.

The planned eSAF production facility is intended to become a benchmark project of Outokumpu's circular ecosystem in the Koivuluoto area of Tornio. The cooperation with Norsk e-Fuel will mark the first industrial development in the area supporting Outokumpu’s ambition to build a vibrant circular economy ecosystem.

“Our Tornio site is already among the largest recycling hubs in Europe, processing over one million tonnes of scrap annually. Our long-term vision is to host multiple new projects at the Koivuluoto area that would utilize our other side streams and attract new partnerships to join the ecosystem”, says Tommi Silvennoinen, Senior Manager, Strategic Partnerships in CCUS and New Energy Solutions at Outokumpu.

At that scale, Etlas expects to enable the production of more than 800,000 metric tonnes of biofuels per year.
Global demand for SAF is projected to increase sharply, reaching up to 10 million tonnes by 2030, compared with roughly 1 million tonnes in 2024.
Similarly, demand for renewable diesel is expected to grow from around 17 million tonnes in 2024 to as much as 35 million tonnes by 2030.
Etlas aims to connect agricultural innovation with energy demand, scaling production globally while creating new revenue opportunities for farming communities.","Corteva Inc. and bp have announced the formation of Etlas™, a newly established 50:50 joint venture focused on developing and supplying plant-based oil feedstocks for the rapidly expanding biofuels market. The venture is designed to support the production of low-carbon fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (RD), by sourcing oil from crops such as canola, mustard, and sunflower.

Etlas combines the complementary strengths of its two parent companies. Corteva brings more than a century of experience in seed science, crop genetics, and agricultural innovation, which will be applied to develop and optimize oilseed crops specifically tailored for biofuel applications. bp contributes its extensive expertise in fuel refining, processing, distribution, and marketing, along with deep connections to the global commercial transportation sector. Together, these capabilities are intended to create a reliable, scalable, and commercially viable feedstock supply chain that can support the long-term growth of biofuels.

The joint venture has set an ambitious production target of one million metric tonnes of feedstock annually by the mid-2030s. At that scale, Etlas expects to enable the production of more than 800,000 metric tonnes of biofuels per year. Initial volumes of feedstock are planned to become available from 2027 onward, supplying both co-processing units at existing refineries and dedicated biofuel production facilities. This phased approach allows Etlas to integrate smoothly into current refining infrastructure while also supporting the expansion of specialized biofuel plants.

Industry forecasts highlight why such initiatives are gaining momentum. Global demand for SAF is projected to increase sharply, reaching up to 10 million tonnes by 2030, compared with roughly 1 million tonnes in 2024. Similarly, demand for renewable diesel is expected to grow from around 17 million tonnes in 2024 to as much as 35 million tonnes by 2030. Etlas has been structured specifically to address this anticipated growth by ensuring consistent availability of sustainable feedstocks at scale.

A defining feature of the Etlas model is its agricultural approach. The feedstock crops will be grown on existing farmland during periods between primary food crop cycles. These intermediate or cover-season crops can enhance soil health, improve nutrient management, and reduce erosion, while also generating additional income for farmers. Importantly, because these crops utilize land that would otherwise remain fallow or underused, they do not increase pressure on land resources or compete directly with food production.

Judd O’Connor, executive vice president of Corteva’s seed business unit, emphasized that Etlas reflects Corteva’s broader mission of supporting both global energy needs and agricultural communities. He noted that agriculture can play a meaningful role in the energy transition, and that Etlas demonstrates how innovation in farming can contribute to lower-carbon fuel solutions while benefiting growers.

From bp’s perspective, Philipp Schoelzel, senior vice president for biofuels growth, described the joint venture as a capital-light strategy that adds flexibility to bp’s biofuels value chain. By partnering with Corteva, bp aims to strengthen its market position, respond to evolving customer demand, and generate competitive returns.

Leadership for the new company has also been announced. Ignacio Conti, Global Business Development Director at Corteva, will serve as Chief Executive Officer of Etlas, while Gaurav Sonar, bp’s vice president for Novel Feedstocks, will take on the role of Chair of the Board of Directors. According to Conti, as aviation and transport sectors seek dependable, cost-effective, and sustainable fuel options, farmers will play a central role. Etlas aims to connect agricultural innovation with energy demand, scaling production globally while creating new revenue opportunities for farming communities.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-08 09:57:14.131619

Top five asks

Ask #1: Extending concessional corporate tax rate for new manufacturing companies

The existing 15 percent concessional corporate tax rate has played a key role in attracting investments into India. Under Section 115BAB, new domestic manufacturing companies are eligible for this rate. However, a crucial requirement for these companies is that they must have started manufacturing by 31 March 2024.

By attracting foreign investments, this provision has been crucial in achieving economic objectives. As a result, the tax administration may extend the regime’s sunset clause for two additional years. This extension will undoubtedly boost India’s economic growth and increase the country’s attractiveness to investors.

Extending the concessional tax rate would help manufacturing sector investors, who are currently considering or setting up businesses in India, to take advantage of this opportunity.

Ask #2: Providing concessional tax rate on sale of all carbon credits and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and, not limited to carbon credits validated by the UN Framework on Climate Change (UNFCC), along with clarification on set-off of losses and unabsorbed depreciation thereof

Sale of carbon credits validated by the UNFCC is currently eligible for a concessional tax rate under Section 115BBG of the Income Tax Act. This provision does not apply to VERs, RECs, etc.

Therefore, a concessional tax rate should be offered to all carbon credits, RECs, etc., to encourage the sector, reduce litigation and bring carbon credits at par. Additionally, specific clarification allowing the set-off of losses and unabsorbed depreciation against sale of such carbon credits, VERs and RECs should be provided.

Ask #3: Offering tax incentives for Green Bonds – New section recommended

Interest income earned by investors in Green Bonds may be considered tax exempt in the hands of investors.

Additionally, profits earned by investors in Green Bonds from the sale/transfer of such bonds may be treated as tax exempt in the hands of the investors, irrespective of whether such profits/gains are offered to tax in India by investors as business profits or capital gains. It will also indirectly help bond issuers, as they will be able to get a lower borrowing rate.

To ensure clarity, the definition of Green Bonds may be aligned with the regulatory prescription issued by SEBI for granting such income tax benefits.

The income tax exemption may be granted to such bond investors, irrespective of whether (i) the bonds are issued under the FDI, FPI or the ECB window, (ii) the bonds are issued by an Indian issuer entity or a financier such as a bank/NBFC/HFC, or (iii) the bonds are listed or unlisted.

Ask #4: Providing guidelines for revenue recognition in case of BOOT/BOT projects/HAM for power, roadways and other ERI projects

BOT/BOOT/HAM models are commonly used in the ERI sector. Considering the extant ambiguity, specific guidelines regarding the adoption of straight-line method instead of percentage completion method, provided for roadways, power and similar ERI projects, can be used to reduce litigation and increase clarity.

Additionally, any other specific guidelines/clarifications needed with respect to taxation of income and manner of claiming deduction of expenses.

Ask #5: Offering settlement scheme to resolve past tax disputes arising from differential treaty interpretations

The Supreme Court’s decision in the Nestle SA case has had wide ramifications on treaty interpretation and various treaty benefits historically availed. A key takeaway from the ruling is the necessity for specific notifications from the tax policy administration under the act, to implement treaty protocols, especially in the context of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause.

The tax policy administration has started releasing specific guidelines regarding the interpretation of protocols to treaties between India and other countries, which will be implemented in future transactions, promoting clarity and consistency in treaty interpretation.

However, recognising the need to provide certainty and resolution for present cases where lower rate has already been claimed, the tax policy administration should consider establishing guidelines under a settlement scheme, which may provide one-time window to make voluntary tax payments of differential taxes, without interest or penalty. This initiative would offer relief and certainty to taxpayers, while facilitating efficient tax collection.

Ask #6: Optimising indirect tax cost for the green hydrogen sector

Currently, indirect tax has become a major cost component for Green Hydrogen (GH) sector in two ways. First, the customs duty paid on the import of solar modules or solar cells used in setting up solar power plants for supplying renewable energy to GH plant. Second, the loss of GST input pertaining to all procurements made by solar/wind power plant in setting up the unit, as the output electricity is exempt.

The electricity supply by a solar/wind power plant to a GH unit should be considered as deemed export, so that the solar/wind power plant is eligible to claim refund of input GST, which then does not become a cost for the GH unit. Alternatively, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) should also allow direct refund of the GST paid on all capital goods, inputs and input services used in generating power to solar/wind power plants, with the condition that output electricity is supplied exclusively to a GH unit.

For customs duty, the CBIC should provide upfront exemption from a 40 percent basic customs duty on the import of solar modules, with specified end-use condition of using such solar power plant for supplying electricity exclusively to a GH project, or provide the benefit of project import with concessional basic customs duty of 7.5 percent on solar power plant or solar power project, being set-up for supply of electricity exclusively to GH project.

Policy recommendations and expected impact/outcome

Recommendation #1

Hydrogen purchase obligation for sectors such as refinery and fertiliser to drive domestic demand. This would provide the necessary fillip to the sector similar to the renewable purchase obligation.

Recommendation #2

Considering the contribution of the aviation sector to carbon emissions, an incentive programme for production of sustainable aviation fuel could be considered by the government. This would help reduce emissions from the aviation sector.",https://media.deloitte.com/is/image/deloitte/promo-image-global-trade-advisory-tax-1920x880:1200-x-627,N,,2026-01-08 09:57:19.679212

It’s a rare career progression among corporate sustainability professionals, but Birkett Rakow argues it should be more common because CSOs and CEOs share a common challenge: creating business value while navigating systems change.

“Fundamentally, the definition of sustainability is durability,” she said during the latest episode of our Climate Pioneers interview series. “It’s being here and being successful for a long time.”

Hawaiian celebrated its 96th anniversary in 2025, making it one of the oldest U.S. airlines. It was acquired by Alaska Air in September 2024, and Birkett Rakow was closely involved with the integration planning as part of the executive committee led by her boss, Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci. She was named to Hawaiian’s board when the integration was completed, ahead of her promotion. Her mission: build on the airlines’ investments in sustainable aviation fuel and efficiency measures, such as local sourcing, to position the combined company for low-carbon business growth.

“Knowing climate science is a real asset, increasingly, for chief sustainability officers, but not just knowing that science, knowing how to translate it into business integration and business outcomes and into initiatives that will actually drive impact,” she said. “I think the duality of that experience is also really important.”

Birkett Rakow’s long-time experience in public affairs and community relations was also a key factor in her promotion to CEO one year later. Before her experience at Alaska Air, she worked on public health policy in the U.S. Senate and in corporate roles at Group Health and Kaiser Permanente (which bought Group Health in 2017).

“One of the things that has always been part of my career is working with multiple stakeholders to get to a solution,” she said. “You can’t go off in a corner and come up with a piece of legislation and expect that it’s going to get done, partly because no one person has all the answers.”

Airline CEOs love fuel efficiency

Birkett Rakow remains accountable for Alaska Air’s overall sustainability strategy and for Alaska Star Ventures, created four years ago, and the work to reduce emissions across the airlines’ operations is top of mind in both her roles. One of the combined company’s environmental goals (adopted from Alaska Air’s sustainability playbook) is to be the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. airline, a title it already claims.

Alaska Air cut 6.4 million gallons of jet fuel in 2024; almost half that amount came from a procedure that requires planes to taxi to runways using just one engine before turning both on for takeoff. It saved 900,000 gallons by using Flyways, an AI software application Alaska developed in collaboration with Air Space Intelligence. The system optimizes flight path information for dispatchers and pilots in real time, so adjustments can be made on the fly that decrease fuel consumption.

Alaska Air doesn’t publish how much fuel it burns annually, but it used close to 300 million gallons in the first half of 2024. “Fuel that we don’t burn is emissions that we don’t need to create,” Birkett Rakow said. “It’s a win-win for the business, because it also is fuel that we don’t need to pay for.”

Alaska Air’s partnership with Air Space Intelligence inspired the creation of Alaska Star Ventures. “Seeing how technology could be built and serve us in the future started us thinking about the role we should play in enabling that new technology,” Birkett Rakow said. “Some of the role we should play is using it. Some of it is informing its development with our own expertise.”

SAF ambitions

The venture group invests in startups and technologies that support the airlines’ operational efficiency goals, fleet renewal initiatives and the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For example, Alaska Air in August 2024 funded JetZero, which is developing a blended wing aircraft design designed to burn 50 percent less fuel than current planes.

Alaska Air has funded several SAF companies, with the goal of building supplies for its hubs in Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest. For example, Hawaiian and Alaska will receive the first SAF deliveries in the first quarter made from locally grown Camelina crops through its partnership with Par Hawaii and Pono Energy. Alaska is investing in carbontech company Twelve through a venture with Microsoft and others in Washington state, the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator. It is also backing a new Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund that aims to scale commercial availability of sustainable aviation fuel. To build awareness with customers, Alaska Air awards elite qualifying miles to flyers who buy SAF credits.

SAF production is building slowly, and it will take a combination of definitive airline purchasing commitments, policy development and customer engagement to accelerate commercial availability. Alaska Air’s corporate customers including Autodesk, Meta, Microsoft, Skanska, Watershed and We are buying into the mission

“It’s really exciting, but it’s going to take time,” Birkett Rakow said. “I think a couple of years ago with SAF, we thought if we just created … demand signals, if we just purchase SAF, the market will grow. I think there was some rationale to that, but it hasn’t worked in part because the regulatory environment hasn’t been consistently supportive in a way that was probably required for that to happen, and the cost of building new technologies and new production and the capital needed to stand that up is very significant.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/trellis_climate_pioneers_diana_birkett_rakow_feature_image_1470x894.png,N,,2026-01-08 09:57:24.842402

Corteva Inc. and bp have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to form a joint venture (JV) focused on producing biofuel feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The JV plans to scale production to deliver one million metric tons per year of SAF feedstocks by the mid-2030s.

Corteva will contract with farmers in North America, South America, and Europe to grow proprietary mustard seed, sunflower, and canola feedstocks suited for SAF production.

The collaboration aligns with global SAF mandates, such as the EU requirement for 20% SAF content in aviation fuel by 2035, rising to 70% by 2050.

Definitive agreements are expected to be finalized in 2025, with operations targeted to begin later that year.

Addressing Growing Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Corteva and bp announced their shared intent to form a joint venture aimed at producing biofuel feedstocks to meet increasing global demand for SAF. With aviation sector decarbonization becoming a focus of government mandates and incentives, the proposed JV aims to contribute to achieving these sustainability goals.

The EU, for example, has mandated a minimum of 20% SAF content in aviation fuel by 2035, with the target rising to 70% by 2050. Similar incentives are emerging globally, creating opportunities for scaling SAF feedstock production.

Leveraging Agricultural and Energy Expertise

Under the collaboration, Corteva plans to work with farmers across the Americas and Europe to grow proprietary crops such as mustard seed, sunflower, and canola. These crops are designed to meet sustainability criteria under EU RED III standards and qualify for U.S. low-carbon intensity policy incentives. The initiative also introduces new cropping systems to generate revenue for farmers while supporting sustainable practices.

Brook Cunningham, Corteva’s Chief Strategy Officer, commented: “This partnership shows that agriculture can play a vital role in addressing global decarbonization goals. By leveraging Corteva’s technology, scale, and grower relationships, we look forward to supporting the European airline industry while offering farmers new income streams.”

bp will contribute its expertise in refining and trading to optimize the supply chain for SAF production.

Emma Delaney, bp’s executive vice president for customers & products, stated: “We see significant potential in partnering with Corteva. Together, we are positioned to create value by combining Corteva’s agricultural innovations with bp’s refining capabilities.”

Path to Commercialization

The JV envisions progressively scaling up feedstock production, with the goal of delivering one million metric tons annually of biofuel feedstocks by the mid-2030s. This feedstock will support SAF production at bp’s facilities, with plans to finalize agreements by 2025 and begin operations later that year.

By Amber Bryan

In 2023, each paying passenger flying on planes around the world emitted 84.4 grams of CO₂ per kilometre. A study, however, co-led by the University of Oxford, has found three ways of mitigating such emissions and potentially reducing them by up to 75 per cent. These include operating only the most fuel-efficient aircraft, removing premium-class seating to carry more passengers, and raising passenger loads to 95 per cent. In addition, the study shows that an immediate reduction of 11 per cent could be achieved simply by using the most efficient aircraft.

The Boeing 787-9, used for long-haul flights, and the Airbus A321neo, used for short and medium-haul flights, are the most carbon-effective planes. Replacing all aircraft with these would result in fuel savings of 25–28 per cent, according to the study.

Business and first-class seating are five times more CO2-intensive than economy class. By increasing passenger capacity to maximum for the most efficient aircraft, emissions would further reduce by 22-57 per cent. The average aircraft passenger occupancy in 2023 was 79 per cent. By increasing this to 95 per cent, emissions would reduce by 16 per cent.

The study was published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment and involved analysing more than 27 million commercial flights in 2023, covering 26,000 city pairs and nearly 3.5 billion passengers. Some routes were found to be producing nearly 900 grams of CO2 per kilometre for each passenger – which is almost 30 times higher than the most efficient (around 30 grams of CO₂ per kilometre).

The study was based on data from Airline Data, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and the International Air Transport Association. The regions with the most inefficient flights were Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, Central Asia, and North America. However, the most effective regions were Brazil, India and Southeast Asia.

The researchers suggest efficiency improvements could be promoted using marketing tools, similar to those used for household appliances and vehicles. For example, emissions ratings, adjusted landing fees and carbon intensity caps.

Lead author and Professor at Linnaeus University, Stefan Gössling, said: ‘Efficiency-based policies have a great potential to curb aviation emissions, and can be in airlines’ own economic interest. But the reality is that many airlines continue to fly with old aircraft, low passenger occupancies, and growing proportions of premium-class seating.’

Co-author and Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Dr Milan Klöwer said: ‘While economically and practically unfeasible to replace all older aircraft short term, this analysis shows the potential more efficient aircraft have in comparison to other efficiency gains. Realistically, this would be a long-term transition – one that could be promoted by policies that reward efficiency, so that the most efficient aircraft are favoured whenever replacement decisions are made.’

How to choose low-carbon flights

While airlines themselves may not make the changes needed to reduce global aviation emissions, there are some things that passengers can be conscious of to reduce their own carbon footprint when flying.

Different models of aircraft determine engine type and fuel efficiency. Age is also a factor, as newer models have better fuel economy. The carbon footprint of a flight is worked out per person. This means the more people on a flight, the more people share that flight’s total carbon footprint.

The route taken can also make a difference. Direct flights rather than layovers reduce carbon emissions, as take-off and landing use much more fuel than cruising at altitude – as well as the fact that the route will take longer if it stops off. Also, ensuring the airline you’re flying with is using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is another way to choose a low-carbon flight.

Yet only about 20% of Greenland is ice‑free. There are no intercity roads, and for every 100 mineral exploration projects, only one may become a mine, making development slow, risky, and capital‑intensive. Past mines left heavy metal pollution still detectable 50 years later, fueling public skepticism.

Oil prices falls after Trump’s statements on Venezuelan oil

Oil fell for a second day as Trump’s deal to import up to $2 billion of Venezuelan crude signalled higher U.S. supplies, with Brent down 1.2% to $59.96 per barrel and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) off 2% to $55.99 per barrel. Trump said Venezuela will be “turning over between 30 million and 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil” to the U.S., likely rerouted from China, keeping crude “on the defensive,” according to BOK Financial’s

The U.S. also seized an empty Russian‑flagged Venezuela‑linked tanker as part of its broader control over Caracas’ exports after Maduro’s capture, which Venezuelan officials call a “kidnapping.” Data from the U.S. EIA (Energy Information Administration) showed a 3.8 million‑barrel drop in U.S. crude stocks versus expectations for a 447,000‑barrel build, but gasoline and distillates rose 7.7 million and 5.6 million barrels, respectively.

Venezuela’s Merey crude is selling at about $22 below Brent, and BMI warns that cheap flows could “raise the expected price of oil over the medium term” if the regime endures.

As the sector grapples with contributing 2.5% of global CO2 emissions—with 80% originating from long-haul flights—the search for viable alternatives to conventional jet fuel has intensified.

Alternative Aviation Technology Challenges

The promise of electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft has captured headlines and imagination, yet both technologies face fundamental barriers that limit their near-term viability for commercial aviation. Electric aircraft confront the harsh reality of battery energy density constraints. Current lithium-ion technology achieves approximately 200 to 250 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), with expectations to plateau at around 300 Wh/kg due to fundamental chemistry limitations, compared to 12,000 Wh/kg for jet fuel. However, studies have identified that electric aviation would require 400 Wh/kg for general aviation applications and 750 Wh/kg for commercial regional air service, representing a two- to three-fold improvement that remains beyond current capabilities. While electric aircraft may serve a role on short-haul regional routes, their energy density limitations constrain their applicability to the majority of commercial aviation.

The infrastructure implications are equally daunting. Electric aviation would necessitate comprehensive airport charging systems, overhauls of electrical grid capacity, and aircraft redesign. To date, not a single commercial electric aircraft deployment has occurred in scheduled passenger service, underscoring the technological and economic hurdles that remain.

Hydrogen propulsion presents similar challenges. While hydrogen offers impressive energy density by weight, its storage requirements create significant design constraints. Liquid hydrogen must be maintained at -253 degrees Celsius, requiring specialized cryogenic storage systems that fundamentally alter aircraft architecture. The safety considerations, airport infrastructure modifications and lengthy recertification processes have proven so challenging that even Airbus recently scaled back its hydrogen aircraft program timeline.

These realities underscore that electric and hydrogen technologies will require significant technological breakthroughs before their full potential can be realized, highlighting the aviation industry’s need for immediate solutions to achieve its decarbonization goals.

SAF: The Drop-In Solution

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers a direct path to decarbonization by working within existing systems rather than requiring wholesale transformation. Produced from renewable feedstocks—including alcohols, used cooking oil, animal fats, municipal solid waste, agricultural residues and even captured CO2—SAF can blend with conventional jet fuel without modifying aircraft engines or airport infrastructure.

This compatibility is critical. Airlines operate on thin margins, and aircraft lifecycles span decades. A fuel that integrates with existing fleets enables immediate deployment without the massive capital investments required by alternative technologies.

The market has responded. Global SAF production is projected to reach 6.1 billion to 8.2 billion gallons annually by 2030, according to RMI’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Outlook, up from about 350 million gallons in 2024—underscoring both industry commitment and scalability.

Today’s Leading Pathway

The dominant SAF production technology today is hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), which converts fats, oils and greases into jet fuel through hydrogen treatment. Its appeal lies in compatibility with existing refinery infrastructure, allowing producers to leverage current equipment with modifications.

However, HEFA faces constraints that limit long-term scalability; chief among them is feedstock availability. The U.S. produces about 23 million tons of suitable feedstock annually, with soybean oil accounting for 57% of supply. Used cooking oil is limited by collection logistics, while animal fats are geographically concentrated in states such as Nebraska, Texas and Iowa, increasing transportation costs and carbon intensity.

Competition from the renewable diesel market further complicates HEFA economics, as incentives often favor diesel production and intensify feedstock competition. Maximizing SAF yields also generates substantial naphtha byproducts—up to 25% of total output—which can become a low-value burden for facilities located far from petrochemical markets.

These factors create a complex optimization challenge. HEFA produces only paraffinic components, while conventional jet fuel requires 8% to 25% aromatics for proper engine performance. As a result, HEFA SAF must be blended with fossil jet fuel, limiting its carbon reduction potential. Producers must balance feedstock costs, blending requirements and infrastructure proximity while navigating agricultural commodity volatility.

Innovation in SAF Production

The industry’s response to HEFA’s challenges has been to diversify production pathways and optimize existing processes. Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts solid waste after gasification into syngas into synthetic fuels, offers access to more abundant feedstocks but at higher capital and operating costs. Alcohol-to-jet pathways provide another alternative, though current processes remain energy-intensive and expensive.

Current ASTM standards limit most SAF pathways to 50% blending with conventional jet fuel. Still, the industry is moving toward higher blend ratios and eventually 100% drop-in synthetic fuels. Achieving this goal requires addressing the aromatic component gap in HEFA SAF production, making economical sources of these molecules crucial for future fuel specifications.

One particularly promising area involves upgrading the naphtha byproducts from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes into aromatic components of SAF that are otherwise missing from these outputs. Rather than treating these naphtha materials as low-value byproducts, emerging add-on technologies can convert them into high-value aromatics. For example, Universal Fuel Technologies has developed a chemical processing technology that complements HEFA and FT by converting their naphtha byproducts into high-quality aromatic components essential for jet fuel.

The challenge of upgrading naphtha byproducts stems from two key factors: the chemical properties of paraffinic molecules, which make them difficult to convert into aromatics, and the small quantities produced at individual HEFA facilities, which preclude economies of scale. These chemical and economic dual constraints explain why few technologies have emerged to convert this low-value stream into higher-value products. However, this approach not only improves the economics of existing SAF production, but also addresses a critical technical requirement for future 100% SAF blends.

Economic Viability Through Integration

The future of SAF production likely depends on integrated approaches that maximize resource utilization and minimize waste. Rather than viewing each production pathway in isolation, the industry must consider how different technologies can complement each other.

The flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions becomes crucial as well. Feedstock availability and pricing fluctuate in response to agricultural cycles, regulatory changes, and competing demand. Production facilities that can adjust their operations—switching between different feedstocks or product slates based on market conditions—will have significant competitive advantages.

Scaling for Impact

Meeting aviation’s decarbonization goals requires SAF production to scale from hundreds of millions of gallons annually to tens of billions of gallons per year. This expansion demands not only technological improvements but also supply chain development, policy support and effective financing mechanisms. The industry must also develop production technologies that can compete economically with conventional jet fuel while maintaining the performance characteristics that aviation demands. This requires continued innovation in processing technologies, feedstock development and systems integration. In many cases, investors may be reluctant to fund HEFA and FT plants where the naphtha byproduct stream cannot be effectively monetized. Technologies that solve this byproduct utilization challenge become critical enablers, potentially transforming otherwise uneconomical projects into viable investments and accelerating the deployment of SAF production capacity.

An Immediate Path to Sustainable Aviation

While electric and hydrogen aircraft may eventually transform aviation, SAF offers the most viable path to immediate emissions reduction. Unlike alternative propulsion technologies that require fundamental changes to aircraft design and infrastructure, SAF works within existing systems while delivering measurable environmental benefits.

The industry’s commitment to sustainability is clear, yet progress depends on solutions that can be deployed at scale. SAF provides that bridge, linking today’s fossil fuel reliance with a fully sustainable aviation future. By advancing production technologies that address current economic and technical barriers, the industry can accelerate SAF adoption while moving toward the goal of 100% SAF.

The facility is owned and run by its long-time partner Sekisui Chemical Co. Ltd. and has demonstrated the feasibility of converting mixed waste into ethanol at a near-commercial scale, reports The Globe And Mail.

The pilot plant, built at one-tenth of a full commercial size, can produce about 400 tonnes of ethanol each year. It remained in operation for nearly four years after mechanical completion in April 2022. During this time, the plant showed that LanzaTech’s fermentation technology can reliably handle mixed, non-recyclable waste that would otherwise be sent to landfills or incinerators. The ability to manage uneven and changing waste streams is seen as important for supporting circular use of carbon resources across different regions.

The project was funded through investments by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, a public-private investment fund overseen by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Financial support was also provided by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.

According to the company, the plant met all its guaranteed performance targets and sustained ethanol production above guaranteed levels for more than 14 consecutive days after reaching stable operations. This marked the most productive fermentation period achieved at the site so far, even while operating with challenging gas conditions.

The facility processed synthesis gas made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in varying proportions that are generally difficult for many technologies to handle. Despite this, ethanol output remained steady, highlighting the flexibility and strength of the fermentation process.

Gasification is a commonly used method for treating solid waste, and LanzaTech has previously combined its fermentation system with established gasifier technologies. The Kuji project also involved work with a new gasifier design, providing further proof that the fermentation process can perform reliably even when gas quality varies.

LanzaTech chief executive Jennifer Holmgren said the results reflected strong cooperation between the company, Sekisui Chemical, and local and national authorities. She said the project confirmed that the technology works well beyond the laboratory stage and can be scaled up, while also acknowledging the support of the Japanese government for sustainable technology initiatives.

The company said it will continue to focus on waste-to-energy projects that support a circular economy and supply key inputs for sustainable aviation fuel and other low-carbon chemicals. By turning difficult waste streams into useful products, such projects are expected to help lower emissions and support the global move toward cleaner fuels.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ethanol-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 00:56:42.809617

Achieved ethanol yields exceeding guaranteed performance for over 14 consecutive days at steady state

Successfully operated on complex syngas streams with CO + H₂ contents as low as 40%

Demonstrated robust waste-to-ethanol process under varying feedstock conditions

SKOKIE, Ill., Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA), a leader in industrial carbon recycling, has announced successful operational results at the municipal solid waste (MSW) to ethanol pilot plant in Kuji City, Iwate, Japan owned and operated by longstanding partner, SEKISUI CHEMICAL CO., LTD. (TSE: 4204) (SEKISUI). This 1/10th commercial scale facility, with the capacity to produce approximately 400 tons of ethanol per year, operated for nearly four years following mechanical completion in April 2022. Throughout this period, the plant demonstrated that LanzaTech’s gas fermentation platform can reliably process highly inhomogeneous, unsorted mixed non-recyclable waste streams—materials that would otherwise be destined for landfill or incineration. The demonstrated ability to manage challenging and variable waste sources is especially significant, as it shows that the technology can adapt to diverse regional waste profiles and support the development of a global circular carbon economy.

The waste-to-ethanol plant was funded with investment by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, a private-public fund overseen by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). It also received funding from the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.

The plant achieved its guaranteed performance, sustaining specific ethanol yields above guaranteed values for over 14 consecutive days after reaching steady state - making this the most productive fermentation campaign at the site to date. Notably, the ethanol yield was maintained above guaranteed performance despite operating on particularly challenging gas mixtures. The plant processed syngas (a blend of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) with a combined CO + H₂ content ranging from 40% to 55%, and an H₂:CO ratio between 1.1 and 1.4, a balance that can be especially demanding for other catalytic technologies. To put this in context, achieving high performance under these conditions is akin to running a marathon at high altitude; it demonstrates both the adaptability and resilience of the LanzaTech process.

Gasification is a widely used and established technology for processing solid waste streams, with LanzaTech having successfully integrated its fermentation platform with several proven, traditional gasifier systems. The project at Kuji provided an opportunity to collaborate on a novel gasifier design, underscoring both the value of ongoing innovation in waste conversion technologies and the adaptability of LanzaTech’s fermentation process. Even with varied feed gas conditions, the process not only remained robust but also met key performance targets, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of LanzaTech’s platform.

“We are immensely proud of what we’ve achieved together at our Japan demonstration facility,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “Our sincere thanks go to our partner Sekisui Chemical and the prefecture of Iwate and the city of Kuji for their outstanding collaboration and support. The results at Kuji once again demonstrate the scalability and technical viability of our fermentation platform. We are also grateful to the Government of Japan for its continued support and investment in sustainable technologies. We look forward to building on this progress and expanding sustainable fuels and chemicals in Japan and beyond.”

LanzaTech remains committed to advancing waste-to-energy solutions that are essential for a circular economy and that create valuable feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel and other chemicals. By turning challenging waste streams into critical resources, projects like this help enable low-carbon industries and accelerate the global transition to more sustainable fuels.

The EU Innovation Fund has selected 61 projects for funding

The EU Innovation Fund was established to advance innovative energy projects that could reshape the global energy industry as the need to diversify energy output across the world intensifies. Towards the end of last year, the Innovation Fund identified 61 projects across Europe that will receive funding.

Five Finnish projects were selected as part of the 61 approved applications. Finland has become a progressive nation thanks to its ambitions to increase renewable biofuel production through several projects being led by market-leading companies in Europe.

Renewable biofuel and diesel play an important role in decarbonizing the global energy market

Over the past few years, it has become abundantly clear to the world that we need to decarbonize the energy market to meet clean energy and emission targets. While the world still needs oil and gas, one method of decarbonization may be to increase biofuel and renewable diesel production.

Neste has now opted to expand its already impressive standing in the European energy market by establishing a co-processing facility for biofuels and renewable diesel at its Porvoo oil refinery in Finland. The company is a market leader in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, and has now received the backing of the EU Innovation Fund for its refinery project in Finland.

“Switching to renewable diesel is a cost-effective and straightforward process aiming to enhance sustainability. This fuel is fully compatible with existing diesel storage tanks, fueling equipment and vehicles eliminating the need for expensive new infrastructure.” – Advanced BioFuels USA

Neste aims to develop an entirely new co-processing technology in Finland

The company has some lofty ambitions for the Finnish project. Neste aims to establish an entirely new co-processing technology at its Porvoo oil refinery in Finland. SCOOP will make use of crude tall oil to produce vast amounts of sustainable biofuels as well as renewable diesel for the regional market.

Thanks to the significant funding allocation from the EU Innovation Fund, the project is now seen as strategically important for the European continent and may pave the way forward for other nations to follow suit and develop new, innovative projects that will deliver vast amounts of energy while not placing the climate in peril.

Crude tall oil is a residue created at mills from the use of pine wood, which mostly goes to waste. Neste aims to develop an all-new technology to process said residue and use it to create biofuels and renewable diesel, which will help Neste’s customers reduce their carbon footprint.

As several energy-rich nations aim to increase petrochemical production over the coming years, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the market is in a constant state of evolution as nations and companies aim to meet clean energy and emission reduction targets by the end of the decade.

Neste is fostering a new era of decarbonization for the industry

The need to diversify the energy market is only matched by the challenge it faces in securing funding for innovative projects that will reshape the global industry. With geopolitical tensions rearing their ugly heads across the world at the moment, nations will need to invest heavily in diversifying their energy portfolios to meet clean energy and emission targets over the coming years. Neste is aiming to lead the way forward for the global energy industry.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/71.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 23:57:32.621926

However, its projections represent a fall in net profits on its previous released numbers, but margins are expected to increase.

In an update to its 2025 airline industry financial outlook, released at its AGM in New Delhi, India, IATA predicted industry net profits of USD36.0 billion, improved from the USD32.4 billion earned in 2024. This is slightly down on the previously projected USD36.6 billion (Dec-2024).

The projected net profit margin at 3.7% is an improvement from the 3.4% earned in 2024 and up 0.1pp on the previously projected 3.6%. Return on invested capital at 6.7%, is also an improvement from the 6.6% earned in 2024, but largely unchanged from previous projections.

Operating profits at USD66.0 billion, are also an improvement from an estimated USD61.9 billion in 2024, but down from the previously projected USD67.5 billion.

The standout projection though is that the industry will not exceed the anticipated USD1 trillion revenues, albeit will still hit record annual levels. Total revenues are projected to reach USD979 billion (+1.3% on 2024). Total expenses will hit USD913 billion (+1.0% on 2024, but below the previously projected USD940 billion).

Total traveller numbers will also reach a record high but will again miss a key milestone. An anticipated 4% rise over 2024 will bring annual passenger traffic to 4.99 billion for 2025, a revision from the 5.22 billion projection from the end of 2024.

Total air cargo volumes will follow the same trend reaching 69 million tonnes, up 0.6% on 2024, but below the previously projected 72.5 million tonnes.

2024 was a historic year for the aviation industry, as global passenger traffic finally achieved a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels, supported by continued strong travel demand.

This strong demand coupled with restricted capacity drove higher load factors and impacted consumers in the form of higher airfares.

Airlines benefited from lower fuel prices, but non-fuel costs generally increased across the board.

These market dynamics are expected to help keep airline operating profits at historically high levels.

Supply chain issues remained a major restriction on industry growth throughout the year, headlined by aircraft delivery delays and significant additional engine maintenance requirements.

Airlines were particularly impacted by being unable to introduce new aircraft as planned, limiting their growth potential, increasing the average fleet age, hampering efforts to improve efficiency and cut emissions, and driving greater demand and costs for maintenance and aircraft leasing.

Service providers to airlines were among the major beneficiaries of the supply chain problems, with many lessors and MRO providers reporting high demand and record financial performance.

As 2023 begins, CAPA presents a snapshot of the global airline industry in 15 numbers.

Based on a presentation given at CAPA's World Aviation Summit in Gibraltar in Dec-2022, with updated numbers as appropriate, this graphic report summarises a range of key aviation metrics.

It paints a picture of an industry recovering from a period when it faced the most serious challenges ever encountered.

In the three years 2020-2022 the world's airlines lost 80% of the industry's all-time accumulated profit of all previous years.

Yet, capacity and traffic have made significant steps towards recovering 2019 levels, and there has been no net reduction in the number of airlines over the past three years.

Unlike hydrogen or ammonia, which require massive new infrastructure and safety overhauls, sustainable biofuels can decarbonize the existing global fleet immediately.
The Global Biofuels Alliance, strengthened by our new Global Biofuel Champion Fellowship to nurture young scientists, stands at the forefront of this shift.
The Global South has proven that biofuels are a sophisticated, high-tech, and socially inclusive pathway to Net Zero.","In the race to decarbonize the global economy, the world often finds itself paralyzed by a search for perfection. We wait for battery technologies that do not yet exist at scale, or for green hydrogen infrastructure that is decades away from ubiquity. But last month at COP30, amidst the backdrop of the Amazon, a different narrative emerged—one grounded not in future miracles, but in immediate, scalable reality.

The message from Belem is clear: We cannot afford to wait. And we don’t have to.

Brazil, leveraging its presidency of the climate talks, introduced the “Belem 4X Pledge,” a bold commitment to quadruple the global use of sustainable fuels by 2035. While nations debate the politics of pledges, the GBA is already building the technical scaffold to make ambitions, targets, pledges, and commitments a reality. We see biofuels not as a “bridge technology,” but as a destination—a critical, permanent pillar of a just energy transition.

For too long, the debate on bioenergy has been stifled by the “food versus fuel” myth. Critics argue that growing crops for energy threatens global food security. However, data shared at our high-level roundtables dismantles this zero-sum thinking. In Brazil, fifty years of ethanol production have coincided with record food output. Modern biofuel production is circular; the by-products of corn ethanol, such as distillers’ grains, serve as high-protein animal feed, actually supporting food systems rather than competing with them.

The urgency of this shift is most visible in the sectors we call “hard-to-abate.” Consider shipping and aviation. While electric vehicles are transforming road transport, batteries cannot fly a jumbo jet across the Atlantic or power a container ship across the Pacific. Here, biofuels are the only commercially viable, drop-in solution available today.

The maritime sector is already pivoting. Data presented at COP30 reveals that 50 percent of new ship orders are now capable of using alternative fuels. Unlike hydrogen or ammonia, which require massive new infrastructure and safety overhauls, sustainable biofuels can decarbonize the existing global fleet immediately.

Yet, barriers remain. As noted in the GBA’s new whitepaper released at the summit, “Green Fuels for Blue Skies,” Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) currently costs three to four times more than conventional jet fuel. Airlines cannot bridge this gap alone. We need harmonized global policies—blending mandates, book-and-claim systems, and tax incentives—to drive costs down and production up. We also need to harmonize sustainability standards so that a litre of SAF produced in the Global South is recognized and valued the same way in Europe or Asia.

Perhaps most importantly, the bioenergy revolution is a matter of equity. The energy transition cannot just be about Teslas in California; it must be about clean cooking in Kenya. Today, 2.4 billion people still breathe toxic smoke from cooking with wood and charcoal. Bioethanol offers a clean, localized solution that improves health and empowers women. Initiatives like the KOKO Networks in Kenya demonstrate that when we treat biofuels as a tool for development, we can solve the climate crisis and the energy poverty crisis simultaneously.

The Global Biofuels Alliance, strengthened by our new Global Biofuel Champion Fellowship to nurture young scientists, stands at the forefront of this shift. We are moving from diplomatic pledges to implementation.

For companies managing large shipping networks, indirect greenhouse-gas emissions—particularly those classified as GHG Protocol’s Scope 3—represent both the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity. Scope 3 encompasses all indirect emissions (i.e., emissions that aren’t directly produced by the company of origin but are produced by other organizations in their supply chain) that result from the beginning of the corporate value chain to the end, from transportation to distribution and the final use of sold products.

As a global company serving over 220 countries, DHL relies on an extensive network outside of our own organization, which makes tracking and minimizing Scope 3 shipping emissions an imperative part of our sustainability initiative. Regardless of scale, however, tracking is important for businesses of every size.

Why Scope 3 matters for your shipping network

While Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (purchased energy) are important, for logistics providers and shippers alike, Scope 3 frequently comprises the majority of the carbon footprint — up to 80-90%.

For a shipping network, Scope 3 includes:

Emissions from upstream activities (e.g., procurement of packaging materials, inbound transport).

Emissions from downstream distribution (e.g., onward transport, customer delivery, returns).

Emissions embedded in third-party logistics providers or carrier services.

Tracking Scope 3 is vital because:

It enables you to identify the biggest lever for decarbonization in your supply chain and network.

It allows you to respond to regulatory and customer demand for transparency. 66% of respondents say that they consider sustainability when making a purchase, so responsible carbon reporting is increasingly important.

It gives you a data-driven foundation for setting reduction targets, differentiating on green credentials and building competitive advantage.

Step-by-step: How to track Scope 3 emissions across your shipping network

How do you get started with measuring Scope 3 emissions and implementing a supply chain decarbonization plan? Let’s break it down into four actionable steps.

Step 1: Measure your footprint and set targets

Inventory all emissions sources across your network (inbound, outbound, warehousing, returns).

Use standard frameworks such as the GHG Protocol to classify and quantify Scope 3. AI for emissions tracking in logistics is also an increasingly useful tool.

Where exact data is unavailable, use estimation methods or benchmarking to fill gaps (e.g., carrier vehicles, air vs. sea freight, packaging).

Establish measurable reduction targets for your network (e.g., “reduce downstream delivery emissions by 20% by 2030”).

Step 2: Secure resources & stakeholder buy-in

Engage your carriers, logistics partners and internal departments (procurement, operations, sustainability) to align on data sharing.

Invest in analytics tools, dashboards and data capture systems that enable visibility across network nodes (transport modes, carriers, packaging).

Ensure budget and governance are in place — tracking emissions across a complex network requires dedicated effort.

Step 3: Implement tracking systems and reduction strategies

Map the shipping network: origin-to-destination flows, transport modes, intermediaries, packaging types, returns flows.

For each segment, capture data such as distance, mode (road, rail, sea, air), load factor, fuel type, packaging weight and material.

Use carriers and providers who disclose their fuel usage, electrification status or use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) if airfreight. For example, our GoGreen Plus shipping option uses SAF and helps reduce shipping emissions.

Build a dashboard that aggregates all this data, segments it by upstream vs downstream, by carrier, by mode, by packaging, and tracks your baseline vs target.

Don’t forget reverse logistics: returns increase emissions. DHL advises reducing returns and using parcel-lockers or optimized return flows.

Leverage trends and innovations: route optimization, green packaging, EV fleets and other sustainable freight solutions, etc.

Step 4: Monitor progress, review & communicate

Regularly benchmark performance and track trend lines.

Review which carriers, modes, packaging types or regions are under-performing? Where are the greatest reduction opportunities?

Use the measurements to inform procurement: select partners based on sustainability credentials (e.g., green packaging, EV fleets, SAF adoption). Provide transparent communication to customers, stakeholders, regulators. Shipping and logistics emissions reporting is an increasingly important part of fortifying brand image and building trust

Why choosing the right logistics partner matters

Your choice of logistics provider is not just about cost and speed. It’s also about emissions transparency, sustainable transport modes, carrier data access and packaging innovation. DHL has strategies and toolkits in place to help you actively and effectively reduce your company’s carbon footprint, including Scope 3 emissions.

For example, our GoGreen Plus shipping option uses Sustainable Aviation Fuel, allowing you to increase the impact of your sustainability initiatives in a way that works for your journey. GoGreen Plus also makes tracking your emissions reductions easy by providing a detailed emissions report and a CO2e reduction certificate.

Because so many moving parts and partners are involved, tracking Scope 3 emissions across a shipping network is complex, but it’s also where the largest sustainability gains lie. For B2B logistics operations, the opportunity to measure, manage and reduce these emissions translates into cost savings, risk mitigation, brand value and competitive advantage.

By integrating your shipping network’s data with a partner that shares your sustainability ambition, tracking and reducing Scope 3 becomes far more attainable.

At DHL, we believe that with the right tools, partner alignment, and data-driven strategy, your organization can turn what seems like an indirect, intangible challenge into a measurable, manageable pathway to a greener future.

JFE Engineering is in discussions with chemical manufacturers to start a chemical recycling business by the end of fiscal 2030.
Caption The gasification furnace in Chiba (Provided by JFE Engineering Corp.)","CHIBA--JFE Engineering Corp. started a pilot operation on what it says is the world’s only furnace that can turn household waste into synthetic gas for use in creating plastics and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The small gasification furnace was built within the premises of JFE Steel Corp.’s East Japan Works in Chiba city.

The furnace injects oxygen into household and industrial waste, and uses the waste’s own heat to drive a reaction that produces synthetic gas composed mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

The resulting gas can be used as a raw material for plastics and SAF, the company said.

This technology is called “chemical recycling,” in which waste is chemically decomposed and returned it to its molecular-level raw state.

It differs from “material recycling,” which physically reverts plastic bottles back into raw material.

Chemical recycling also requires significantly less energy and releases far fewer carbon dioxide than “thermal recycling,” which burns waste to generate heat energy.

In the trial operation that began in December, JFE’s goal is to stably produce synthetic gas and establish a chemical recycling technology that can be economically self-sustaining.

“By redefining the concept of waste, this technology will push green innovation in the manufacturing industry to a new stage,” Susumu Ayukawa, a director of JFE Engineering, said.

The trial operation will continue until June 2026. The waste used will be accepted mainly from Chiba city.

The facility has the capacity to process up to 20 tons of waste per day. A large-scale verification test capable of processing 150 tons daily is planned for fiscal 2029.

In Japan, municipal incineration plants are aging and final disposal sites are in short supply while demand for recycling continues to grow.

JFE Engineering is in discussions with chemical manufacturers to start a chemical recycling business by the end of fiscal 2030.

Successfully operated on complex syngas streams with CO + H ₂ contents as low as 40%

Demonstrated robust waste-to-ethanol process under varying feedstock conditions

SKOKIE, Ill., Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA), a leader in industrial carbon recycling, has announced successful operational results at the municipal solid waste (MSW) to ethanol pilot plant in Kuji City, Iwate, Japan owned and operated by longstanding partner, SEKISUI CHEMICAL CO., LTD. (TSE: 4204) (SEKISUI). This 1/10th commercial scale facility, with the capacity to produce approximately 400 tons of ethanol per year, operated for nearly four years following mechanical completion in April 2022. Throughout this period, the plant demonstrated that LanzaTech’s gas fermentation platform can reliably process highly inhomogeneous, unsorted mixed non-recyclable waste streams—materials that would otherwise be destined for landfill or incineration. The demonstrated ability to manage challenging and variable waste sources is especially significant, as it shows that the technology can adapt to diverse regional waste profiles and support the development of a global circular carbon economy.

The waste-to-ethanol plant was funded with investment by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, a private-public fund overseen by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). It also received funding from the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.

The plant achieved its guaranteed performance, sustaining specific ethanol yields above guaranteed values for over 14 consecutive days after reaching steady state - making this the most productive fermentation campaign at the site to date. Notably, the ethanol yield was maintained above guaranteed performance despite operating on particularly challenging gas mixtures. The plant processed syngas (a blend of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) with a combined CO + H ₂ content ranging from 40% to 55%, and an H ₂ :CO ratio between 1.1 and 1.4, a balance that can be especially demanding for other catalytic technologies. To put this in context, achieving high performance under these conditions is akin to running a marathon at high altitude; it demonstrates both the adaptability and resilience of the LanzaTech process.

Gasification is a widely used and established technology for processing solid waste streams, with LanzaTech having successfully integrated its fermentation platform with several proven, traditional gasifier systems. The project at Kuji provided an opportunity to collaborate on a novel gasifier design, underscoring both the value of ongoing innovation in waste conversion technologies and the adaptability of LanzaTech’s fermentation process. Even with varied feed gas conditions, the process not only remained robust but also met key performance targets, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of LanzaTech’s platform.

“We are immensely proud of what we’ve achieved together at our Japan demonstration facility,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “Our sincere thanks go to our partner Sekisui Chemical and the prefecture of Iwate and the city of Kuji for their outstanding collaboration and support. The results at Kuji once again demonstrate the scalability and technical viability of our fermentation platform. We are also grateful to the Government of Japan for its continued support and investment in sustainable technologies. We look forward to building on this progress and expanding sustainable fuels and chemicals in Japan and beyond.”

LanzaTech remains committed to advancing waste-to-energy solutions that are essential for a circular economy and that create valuable feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel and other chemicals. By turning challenging waste streams into critical resources, projects like this help enable low-carbon industries and accelerate the global transition to more sustainable fuels.

SAF, which the aviation industry predicts could reduce emissions by up to 70%, only accounts for 0.8% of jet fuel.
“In the future, we do know we won’t have enough SAF to make a real dent in emissions from air transport,” he said.
The Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321neo burn up to 25% less fuel than older models, reducing both emissions and operating costs.
That’s due to more inefficient aircraft, air traffic control issues, and planes that are less than 90% full.","Airlines could immediately cut carbon emissions by as much as 50% by taking just three steps: eliminating premium seating, flying newer aircraft, and maximizing seat occupancy, according to a new study that analyzed more than 27 million flights.

Thinking in these terms is an important shift from reliance on sustainable aviation fuel, according to Stefan Gössling, professor of Tourism Research at Linnaeus University, who led the study.

SAF, which the aviation industry predicts could reduce emissions by up to 70%, only accounts for 0.8% of jet fuel. Projections are that there won’t be enough for airlines to meet their 2050 net-zero goal.

Gössling said that achieving the reductions his study identified would lower passenger comfort but could mean that the SAF available could make a difference.

“In the future, we do know we won’t have enough SAF to make a real dent in emissions from air transport,” he said. “If air transport fuel demand doubles, following these three points, it makes it far more likely we can move closer towards using SAF in the future.”

Are Airlines Flying Inefficiently?

The Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321neo burn up to 25% less fuel than older models, reducing both emissions and operating costs. But the growth in flight numbers means the sector’s total emissions keep rising.

One source of inefficiency: Premium seating configurations. Removing them would reduce the amount of emissions per passenger.

“That means we can transport more people on the same flight, meaning we can go to the same destinations with the same amount of people,” Gössling said.

But airlines are increasingly retrofitting cabins with more premium seats in order to meet rising demand. They have seen a surge in demand for premium tickets from leisure travelers in the past five years, and it’s a trend that shows no sign of slowing down.

For example, United Airlines executives said during an earnings call in 2025 that premium cabin revenues were increasing by 5.6% year-over-year, and that the airline planned to invest more in premium capacity in the coming years.

U.S. Flights Lag Behind Global Efficiency

The research found that the United States, which accounts for a quarter of all aviation emissions, operated flights that were 14% more polluting than the global average.

That’s due to more inefficient aircraft, air traffic control issues, and planes that are less than 90% full.

Atlanta and New York were among the airports with the least efficient flights overall, according to the study: They were almost 50% worse than airports like Abu Dhabi and Madrid.

China, the second biggest aviation polluter, had flight efficiencies slightly above the global average. The UK, the world’s third biggest air travel polluter, was slightly below average.

Industry Response

IATA, which represents most airlines and has set the sector’s decarbonization goals, said progress toward its climate goals will come from deploying SAF and using carbon credits. It added that backlogs of new aircraft have resulted in carriers using older, less efficient planes.

“Airlines have a strong self-interest to reduce fuel burn and maximize load factors, the latter is now at a record 84%,” Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist, told Skift.

“However, supply-chain failures have caused an aircraft order backlog of over 5,000 planes, stalling habitual annual fuel-efficiency gains. Real progress lies in building new energy markets, as the world did regarding wind and solar.”

As the company’s first wholly-owned coffee farm, the site is a model for other large international coffee companies to follow.","The opportunity was exclusively available to SkyMiles Members and kicked off Delta’s Group Drop on SkyMiles Experiences — a “ new way for SkyMiles Members to access unforgettable events with a group of friends, zero miles needed,” as the brand puts it.

The In-Air Coffeehouse flight departed from the far end of the international terminal at Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson International Airport following a pre-party that included far more excitement than I’m used to at 9 AM on a Tuesday. We heard the revelry as we approached the gate, which had been tricked out with a makeshift Starbucks coffee bar and deep-green flora evoking the mood of Costa Rica’s tropical environs. Mimosas flowed freely among the 150 or so travelers gathered for the charter flight.

The new experiential perk also coincided with Delta’s 100th anniversary. But back in the terminal, the present took precedence, as did the future. Primarily, what it means to be a part of an airline loyalty program, and what it could mean in the future.

I’d never been on a charter flight before this one. Full disclosure, my travel media career allowed me to bypass the actual sweepstakes, but I still felt like quite the winner as I observed the layman travelers sitting lumpily at the adjacent gate, looking jealously at the early morning shenanigans happening at ours.

The plane itself was a standard Boeing 737 modified for the occasion with faux leather accents and seatback nametags made of burlap coffee sacks. It felt as much like a coffeehouse as economy class could, with the added bonus of empty middle seats. En route, a Starbucks barista led us through a guided tasting of two blends from Hacienda Alsacia, the coffee farm we’d visit in Costa Rica. The mood was revelrous – I’ve never heard such clapping and whooping on a flight. We cheered after the coffee tasting, and again when it was announced that affogatos would be served after lunch. There were multiple rounds of applause for the stewardesses, and even a few claps when the pilot announced the time change as we pulled into the gate in San Jose (something certainly not stirred by the free Imperial beers on board).

Sustainable coffee at Hacienda Alsacia

The next morning, we boarded a bus for Hacienda Alsacia. The farm is in the hills outside of San Jose, overlooking the Central Valley region where some 70 percent of Costa Rica’s 5 million residents live. As we toured the beautiful farm, guides explaining sustainable farming and “safeguarding the future of coffee,” I found myself looking for evidence of corporate greenwashing. Or at least a sense that we were being duped by a giant corporation that buys 3 percent of the world’s coffee from growing regions around the world, yet somehow manages to keep it tasting the same every time.

The farm exists for research and development – nothing grown here is exported out of Costa Rica. The goal is to create coffee plants that are resistant to both climate change and disease, and that use less water and energy. Studies have found that coffee farms will need to move to higher elevations as regions warm, and the threat of diseases like leaf rust (also made worse by climate change) are ever-present and devastating.

Hacienda Alsacia grows a plant resistant to climate change, and blends it with a plant resistant to disease for a durable hybrid. More than 800,000 coffee trees are on the farm, and each of the guests with Delta planted one more on the trip. My wife Alisha was particularly interested in this project as the owner of a boutique heirloom seed company in Colorado. How can sustainable farming practices in Central America be translated to growers in Asia, in the United States, or in the Southern Hemisphere?

It’s easy to blame big corporations for negatively impacting local businesses and communities, and in many cases that finger pointing is justified. When a Starbucks first opened in the small mountain town where I attended college, an angry mob of over-caffeinated locals threw bricks through the windows and publicly vowed never to support the big guy threatening local coffee shops. I didn’t participate in the window smashing, though I agreed with some of the sentiment. I figured that continuing to patronize local cafes was a strong enough vote. Two decades of added wisdom have since taught me that holding big companies to account also means recognizing when they do something right.

Hacienda Alsacia is, from what I gathered during our short time in Costa Rica, a prime example. During a guided tasting of three house blends, we learned about how the R&D farm’s research is open-sourced to growers around the world through the Starbucks Costa Rica Farmer Support Center, one of 10 in coffee growing regions around the globe. It serves as a database of knowledge about how to grow coffee for the future. According to LinkedIn, between 501 and 1,000 people work at Hacienda Alsacia, from farmers to customer service staff, making it a mid-sized employer in the region. As the company’s first wholly-owned coffee farm, the site is a model for other large international coffee companies to follow.

Experiencing a new side of Starbucks

Anyone can visit Hacienda Alsacia and enjoy the unique coffees grown and roasted onsite, and can even watch the roasting happen live while they sip. Our return flight to Atlanta was a regular commercial flight, and I sat next to an American expat who lived in San Jose. He told me when family or friends visit him from back home, he asks if they want to “stop and get a Starbucks” on the way in from the airport, only to detour 40 minutes into the hills to Hacienda Alsacia to treat them to a Starbucks they’ve never tasted, complete with epic mountain views.

At Hacienda Alsacia’s onsite coffeeshop, looking over a waterfall spilling into a canyon below, I spoke with Joshua Kaehler, Delta’s managing director of Loyalty Partnerships, about whether experiences like the In-Air Coffeehouse are going to be more common. I told him I felt that Delta, or really any major airline willing to do so, has a strong opportunity to add memorable moments to the otherwise anxiety-inducing experience of air travel. In the view of this travel editor, knowing something as simple as a good cup of coffee and decent free Wi-Fi await onboard is more than enough to earn my business.

“I think our goal is to figure out what do customers want from brands they care about,” Kaelher says. “We’ve seen really good success so far when we do collaborations on the experiences side with brands that customers know.”

He noted that this means not just more in-air collaborations with Starbucks, but also with services travelers use regularly, such as Uber. These collaborations can help make a full-service experience for Delta flyers that rewards them for choosing Delta and its partners. He emphasized the airline’s focus on establishing itself as the premium American airline, and that it has to maintain that trust with flyers in order to up the ante on experiences. Delta is frequently cited as the most on-time US airline, and has built an image as “premium” for an experience and ticketing process that is more streamlined than budget airlines, though customers pay for that convenience. Some studies have found Delta to be 20 to 40 percent more expensive than these budget carriers.

​​”We wouldn’t have the right to do this if we didn’t run a reliable, careful airline,” Kaelher says. “We’ve spent the last two decades building that and then you sort of can stack these memorable experiences on top of that. It comes back to delivering the core business really well, consistently, and then you have the right to speak about everything else.”

If the goal is for frequent fliers to have a reason to be loyal Delta customers, then these efforts, as well as perks like the In-Air Coffeehouse, represent a different way of thinking about the mass-market flying experience. Travelers have loads of options for the carrier they choose to fly with these days. Few of them inspire or live up to the aspirations of airlines like PanAm and TWA during the Jet Age when flying was an experience rather than a necessity. Today’s reality is more defined by shrinking legroom, angry passengers, confusing pricing and flier rights, and the feeling that hurtling through the sky in a metal tube is just another way to get where you’re going.

Travel inspiration is lacking. The perks for being part of an airline loyalty program are primarily reserved for people who fly a number of miles that seems unheard of to the average person. Something like Group Drop flips that and gives reason to be inspired by a loyalty program for once. Those of us of the Millennial and younger generations missed the “golden era” of flying, and its high time a legacy carrier like Delta brought it back. May the believers among us continue to gather round the proverbial coffee bar at 30,000 feet, toasting our cappuccinos to a new era of journeys, joe, and ample legroom.",https://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2026/01/inair-coffeehouse-gate-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 22:56:33.156186

The company confirmed that construction activities for the low-carbon ammonia plant are now underway, reinforcing its commitment to advancing cleaner energy solutions on a global scale.

The groundbreaking ceremony for the Wabash Low-Carbon Ammonia Project took place on January 5 and was held at the Hay Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. The event brought together approximately 70 attendees, including senior government representatives, industry leaders, and key stakeholders involved in the project. Among the distinguished participants were Kim Yoon-duk, Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Republic of Korea; Hong Namkoong, President and Chief Executive Officer of SAMSUNG E&A; James P. Danly, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy; and Simon Greenshields, Chairman of the Board of Wabash Valley Resources.

The project will be constructed in Terre Haute, Indiana, and is designed as an environmentally responsible ammonia production facility. Once operational, the plant will have the capacity to produce approximately 500,000 metric tons of ammonia annually. In addition, it will incorporate advanced carbon capture technologies capable of capturing up to 1.67 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to the decarbonization of industrial ammonia production.

This initiative is recognized as a nationally significant project and is supported through funding and collaboration from the U.S. Department of Energy, Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, and the Ministry of Climate, Energy, and Environment. In October of the previous year, SAMSUNG E&A signed an Engineering, Procurement, and Fabrication (EPF) contract with Wabash Valley Resources valued at approximately KRW 680 billion, or around USD 475 million. The company is currently executing the project with a targeted completion date set for 2029.

To ensure the project’s success, SAMSUNG E&A plans to apply its extensive experience in ammonia plant development alongside its proprietary and differentiated technologies. These include digital transformation tools, artificial intelligence, automation systems, and modular construction techniques. The company is also working closely with its client and its technology partner, Honeywell UOP, to deliver a high-efficiency and reliable low-carbon ammonia facility.

Beyond this project, SAMSUNG E&A has been actively expanding its capabilities in future-oriented energy technologies. The company continues to invest in and develop core and diversified energy solutions, including ammonia, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), liquefied natural gas (LNG), carbon capture, and hydrogen. These efforts have recently translated into a series of successful contract awards, such as a Malaysian SAF plant, a biodegradable plastics facility in the UAE, eco-friendly LNG basic design work in Indonesia, a conceptual LNG design project in North America, and a SAF basic design project in the United States.

Commenting on the project, CEO Hong Namkoong stated that the company is pleased to participate in a meaningful collaboration between Korea and the United States. He further emphasized that SAMSUNG E&A will continue to pursue and expand innovative business models that support additive and diversified energy solutions for a sustainable future.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-07 11:57:11.829487
