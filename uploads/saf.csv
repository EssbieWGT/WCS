,,2025-08-29 08:06:24+00:00,CBC,Investing in biofuel could help Canadian canola producers struggling with tariffs | CBC News,"Sam Maciag, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/canola-biofuel-option-1.7619401,"Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said biofuels are a great way to make better domestic use of Canadian canola.
The Canadian canola industry has been upended by international trade wars.
The change to a producer-based system essentially eliminated eligibility for Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel in the U.S., which reduces demand for Canadian feedstock like canola oil.
The 265-million-litre canola biodiesel plant opened in 2013 at the site of ADM's already-existing canola crushing facility.
He was stunned to learn the majority of Saskatchewan canola gets exported out of the country.","As Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe plans a trade mission to China to address recent tariffs the country imposed on Canadian canola exports, some of those impacted are eyeing up homegrown solutions.

Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said biofuels are a great way to make better domestic use of Canadian canola. Those fuels include biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

""When you produce the fuels close to home, the economic value stays in the local economy. It's one of the best solutions to lower emissions [and] increase economic activity, while really not requiring people to change the way they operate,"" he said.

The Canadian canola industry has been upended by international trade wars. On Aug. 14, China imposed a provisional duty rate of 75.8 per cent on canola seed, on top of the 100 per cent tariff levied on Canadian canola oil and meal in March.

The new anti-dumping duty marked another escalation in the yearlong trade dispute that started when Canada imposed 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese-produced electric vehicles in August 2024.

It's a big deal for Canada — particularly for Saskatchewan. According to the Canola Council of Canada, growers produced 17.8 million metric tonnes of canola in 2024, with 55 per cent of that coming from Saskatchewan.

China is Canada's second-biggest canola export market behind the United States, to the tune of $4.9 billion last year.

Right now, the fuel standard policies around using canola oil are different across the country, which means some provinces are using a lot more than others. Ghatala said he sees it as an opportunity and pointed to British Columbia as doing the best, with 31 per cent renewable content in its diesel.

Saskatchewan has a renewable fuel standard that requires at least two per cent of the diesel mix to be renewable. Right now, about 2.5 per cent of the mix is renewable. When it comes to renewables in gasoline, Saskatchewan is doing even better at nearly 10 per cent, surpassing the provincial goal of 7.5 per cent.

Ghatala said the opportunities to use even more domestic canola oil would improve with access to biofuel refineries. But that takes investment — and he said investors need to know the government would support biofuel with policies that increase renewable fuel standard requirements.

Ghatala said Canadian plants are also competing with imported fuel from the United States. In January, the clean fuel production credit replaced the bio-diesel blenders credit. It offers varying amounts of credits based on fuel types and emission reduction. The eligibility is limited to U.S.-produced fuels, meaning producers in the States can sell their products for cheaper.

The change to a producer-based system essentially eliminated eligibility for Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel in the U.S., which reduces demand for Canadian feedstock like canola oil.

""We don't have anything equivalent in Canada,"" Ghatala said, adding he'd like to see a competitive playing field.

In Canada, renewable diesel is being produced in B.C., Alberta and Newfoundland. Biodiesel is being produced in B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec.

Saskatchewan primarily provides canola feedstock that is turned into biodiesel and is exported to foreign markets where it can also be turned into renewable fuels.

The closest biofuel processing facility to Saskatchewan is operated by ADM, just across the Alberta border in Lloydminster. The 265-million-litre canola biodiesel plant opened in 2013 at the site of ADM's already-existing canola crushing facility.

The need for these kinds of facilities is why Josh Gustafson has added president and CEO to his title of farmer. He's behind Covenant Energy, which is in the process of building a $900-million renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel refinery in Lloydminster.

Gustafson farms near Macoun, in southeastern Saskatchewan. On his 14,000-acre farm, he grows red lentils, canola, durum and barley.

He was stunned to learn the majority of Saskatchewan canola gets exported out of the country.

""The desire to build [the plant] came out of seeing the need for domestic processing in Canada with our own homegrown canola,"" he said.

""It's an extensive refining process,"" he said, noting that it is expensive, and will also require precious critical minerals — something Saskatchewan is also trying to find a market for.

The Covenant plant is still in its engineering phase. Gustafson is expecting it to be operational by 2029.

It's something that could already be in progress in the province.

But in January, Federated Co-operatives Limited paused the construction of its own biodiesel and canola crushing project in Regina ""due to regulatory and political uncertainty, potential shifts in low-carbon public policy and escalating costs.""

Ghalta said without production capacity, the renewable fuel policies won't endure. In short, they need each other. The plant needs the incentives to compete and produce, and the production needs to happen to keep the policies viable and consumers engaged. Ghatala said if one drops off, so could support and investment.

Financial Risks and Labor Unrest Boeing’s cash position remains fragile.
Boeing’s next earnings report, scheduled for October 22, 2025, will provide critical data on whether its Q2 gains are sustainable [11].
Positive outcomes—such as progress on 737 MAX certification or a resolution to the labor strike—could catalyze further outperformance.
Boeing’s $618.54 billion backlog and strategic focus on sustainable aviation fuel partnerships by 2030 [1] offer long-term growth potential.","Boeing’s Q2 2025 earnings report marked a pivotal moment in its long-awaited turnaround. Revenue surged 34.9% year-over-year to $22.7 billion, driven by a 81% increase in Commercial Airplane segment revenue to $10.87 billion and a 10% rise in Defense, Space & Security (BDS) revenue to $6.62 billion [1]. The company’s net loss narrowed to $612 million, a 63% reduction compared to the same period in 2024 [2]. These figures suggest Boeing is stabilizing, but the question remains: Can this momentum endure amid unresolved risks?

Operational Gains and Strategic Shifts

Boeing’s improved performance stems from two key areas. First, the Commercial Airplanes segment has rebounded, with 737 MAX production stabilized at 38 units per month—a critical step toward regaining market share. This rate, while below pre-2020 levels, aligns with FAA requirements and supports the company’s goal of achieving positive free cash flow by Q4 2025 [3]. Second, the BDS segment has turned profitable, posting $110 million in operating income after a $913 million loss in 2024 [1]. This shift reflects stronger defense contracts, including a $2.8 billion deal with the U.S. Space Force [4].

However, these gains are tempered by persistent challenges. The 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants remain uncertified due to unresolved issues with the LEAP-1B engine’s de-icing system, delaying entry into a competitive narrowbody market [2]. Certification is now expected in 2026, a year later than initially planned, which could erode Boeing’s ability to capture market share from Airbus’ A320neo family [5].

Financial Risks and Labor Unrest

Boeing’s cash position remains fragile. While free cash outflows narrowed to $2.49 billion in the first half of 2025 (compared to $8.26 billion in 2024), the company still faces a $53.3 billion gross debt load, offset by $23 billion in cash reserves [1]. Analysts project further debt reduction by 2026, but this depends on sustained revenue growth and disciplined cost management [6].

Labor disputes add another layer of uncertainty. A strike by 3,200 defense workers in Missouri and Illinois, which began in August 2025, has paused contract negotiations until after Labor Day [7]. This strike, though smaller than the 2024 commercial jet strike, risks disrupting production of critical military aircraft like the F-15 and F/A-18. Union demands for improved retirement security and healthcare contributions highlight broader tensions between Boeing’s cost-cutting strategy and employee expectations [8].

Valuation and Market Sentiment

From a valuation perspective, Boeing appears undervalued. A DCF model estimates its intrinsic value at $324.06 per share, 27.3% above its current price [1]. The stock’s forward P/E ratio of 265.44 and a P/S ratio of 2.37x suggest mixed signals: while the former indicates high expectations for future earnings, the latter aligns with industry averages [9]. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, with 20 out of 25 rating the stock as a “Strong Buy” and an average 12-month price target of $258.17 [10].

Strategic Entry Point Considerations

For investors, the key question is timing. Boeing’s next earnings report, scheduled for October 22, 2025, will provide critical data on whether its Q2 gains are sustainable [11]. Positive outcomes—such as progress on 737 MAX certification or a resolution to the labor strike—could catalyze further outperformance. Conversely, delays or setbacks could reignite investor skepticism.

The risk-reward profile tilts in favor of long-term investors who can tolerate near-term volatility. Boeing’s $618.54 billion backlog and strategic focus on sustainable aviation fuel partnerships by 2030 [1] offer long-term growth potential. However, short-term risks, including regulatory scrutiny and production bottlenecks, remain elevated.

Conclusion

Boeing’s Q2 2025 results demonstrate that the company is on a path to recovery, but sustainability hinges on resolving certification delays, stabilizing labor relations, and maintaining financial discipline. While the stock’s valuation and analyst optimism suggest a compelling entry point, investors must weigh these positives against the likelihood of near-term headwinds. For those with a multi-year horizon, Boeing’s turnaround could deliver outsized returns—if management executes its strategy effectively.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 03:56:07.639857

During an engaging session titled “Ag Sector Innovations – Powering Sustainable Solutions in the Aviation Industry,” the audience learned how crops and ethanol are being developed into sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to help reduce emissions in one of the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors. Panelists highlighted innovations originating in the St. Louis region that are fueling progress on these efforts.

The panel was moderated by Andy Banker, anchor and reporter with KTVI Fox 2, and featured Dr. Yan Zhang, interim center director and director of research for the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and Jim Hedges, CEO of St. Louis-based CoverCress, Inc. (CCI).

Dr. Zhang explained that since its opening in 2003, NCERC’s focus has expanded from corn-to-ethanol production to scaling up technologies for biopolymers and various other fuels, including SAF. She noted that NCERC is working on the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway, one of eight approved processes for SAF.

“Among the eight pathways in this country, the ATJ is actually a very, very promising way to make a jet fuel to meet the 3-billion-gallon per year mark by 2030 in this country using ethanol from corn starch,” Zhang said. “However, right now there are some challenges. We are not there yet.”

She said the No. 1 challenge the corn-to-ethanol industry is working on is trying to lower the carbon intensity score. “For us, we just need to push a little bit more on the reduction of carbon dioxide emission from fermentation,” Zhang said. “NCERC has a demo-scale project planned in six months. If the results look okay, we will contribute a lot to the development.”

Hedges described how CoverCress Inc., an ag-tech company, is converting a once-noxious weed into a commercially viable crop for renewable fuel. “In a startup world, don’t build a solution in search of a problem. At CCI, we have built a solution to answer a problem,” Hedges said. “The problem is there’s a huge demand for renewable fuel, in this case sustainable aviation fuel. The demand is going to outpace what we can do as an individual company or as a crop. We don’t view other crops as competitors. We want to lift all these solutions up to fulfill the demand, so that the demand doesn’t go away because there’s a lack of solutions.”

He explained that CoverCress, the company’s main crop, is the first new crop introduced in the industry since canola about 60 years ago. It grows between corn and soybean seasons, creating a new revenue stream for farmers while improving soil health.

Hedges highlighted the strategic advantages of the St. Louis region for SAF research and development. “I’ve been in five different startups and I’ve never had the level of talent that I have at CCI,” said Hedges. “The ecosystem of Ag Tech in St. Louis rivals anything in the United States.” He highlighted the proximity to key agricultural stakeholders, access to talent, and a strong innovation community through the Danforth Plant Science Center, 39 North, and BioSTL noting that the local ag-tech ecosystem makes it possible to connect research, commercialization, and farmers efficiently.

Beyond improving carbon intensity scores, both speakers also addressed additional barriers to scaling up SAF production, including retrofitting facilities and encouraging farmers to adopt new crops, and delivering fuel at a competitive cost. But Hedges indicated the change for farmers is very minor, essentially just a few adjustments on the harvesting equipment around small grains. “The grain infrastructure, as it is, is robust and it will satisfy, but we’re going to have to do some adaptation to that infrastructure,” he said. “As we start to scale the product into the hundreds of thousands of acres and into the millions of acres, it’s super competitive; competitive enough that the investors we have are Bayer, Chevron and Bunge.”

Despite the challenges, both panelists expressed optimism about the growing market for sustainable fuels from both commercial and military aviation. Dr. Zhang noted, “We are very proud that my team actually got funding through the Department of Defense to research making SAF-qualified ethanol with feedstocks from Hawaii and tropical islands in the Pacific Ocean. We have the trust and we can do a good job for the future.”

The session also explored the timeline for adoption of SAF in aviation. Both panelists stressed that while the industry is still in its early stages, demand is strong and commitments from industrial partners are real. “We’re at the infancy of that shift,” Hedges said. “Every industrial company involved in aviation is committed, and the funding and innovation will help change the next generation of travel and fuel. As we start into that process of helping deliver on the demand, I can’t even imagine how much different it’s going be 10 years from now.”

Dr. Zhang emphasized the importance of progress for future generations, noting that, as a mother of two, she can see ahead how the next generation will benefit from these changes. “It’s hard to predict exactly how quickly aviation fuels will evolve, but if you have the energy and talent to contribute to change, it feels good to be part of it,” she said.

Banker called attention to Avina Clean Hydrogen’s plan to develop a $280 million SAF facility in the Metro East. “We’re eager to see that project moving forward and look forward to seeing what great new milestones lie ahead for today’s panelists and the rest of this burgeoning SAF industry.”

Collaboration and innovation: Essential for turning challenges into opportunities Reaching net zero carbon emissions is a daunting task that airlines cannot achieve alone.","By Preeti Jain, Head Net Zero Research and Programs, IATA

Since our commitment at the 77th IATA Annual General Meeting in October 2021 to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we are in a moment of retrospection and reflection to assess our journey so far. Achieving net zero emissions is a challenging task in view of the growing demand from a world eager to fly. At the same time, mitigating carbon emissions is an existential need and not an option.

Given that 2025 is the year of the 42nd ICAO Assembly for states to review their long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, it’s the opportune time for us to see what we have been able to catalyze, shape, and accomplish, and which solutions must be accelerated through supportive government policies to eventually achieve sustainable flying for our future generations.

Implementing net zero transition through concrete actions

One of the biggest challenges is converting ‘Net Zero’ commitments into credible actions. Aviation is a hard-to-decarbonize sector, requiring a multifarious approach through the combined effect of multiple CO2 emissions reduction measures. These include the accelerated adoption of new and innovative aircraft technologies, streamlined flight operations, carbon offsets, and the increased production and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Airlines made a sincere commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 with optimism that it would be supported by sovereign policy frameworks and industry partners delivering solutions in an economically and timely prudent manner.

However, this is not happening as anticipated. Particularly in the area of SAF, the development and deployment of SAF is instrumental in mitigating industry carbon emissions by 65% by 2050. Although SAF production has doubled to one million tonnes of SAF in 2024 compared to the previous year and is projected to reach 2 million metric tonnes in 2025, it still represents less than 1% of overall jet fuel demand. This slow pace of SAF adoption, coupled with its higher price, has become a critical dampener to the airlines' decarbonization efforts. Furthermore, the anticipated growth in the offsets market and the momentum towards hydrogen-fueled planes are not propagating enough to sustain the aggressive 2050 timeline. We must realize the transition toward net zero carbon emissions is an economic opportunity and should not be missed.

Strengthening technical understanding to foster collective action toward net zero transition

IATA strives to refine and communicate the scientific and technical understanding of net zero solutions to our airline members and stakeholders at large. Our research objectives reflect the industry’s need for innovative solutions to achieve net zero carbon emissions. In this process, we collaborate across all actors to build understanding and consensus for changing the status quo of existing energy models and supply chains for different net zero solutions.

Last year, IATA released an updated version of the Net Zero Finance Roadmap that contains our detailed assessment of the necessary steps to accelerate the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In parallel, IATA has worked on building a comprehensive understanding of the key levers and produced several strategically important publications for the industry, including SAF production assessment, guidance on the use of hydrogen in aircraft and aviation infrastructure, assessment of contrail climate impacts, and studies on carbon dioxide removals (CDRs). All these initiatives will, in turn, help set a tone for net zero enablers and collective action.

Collaboration and innovation: Essential for turning challenges into opportunities

Reaching net zero carbon emissions is a daunting task that airlines cannot achieve alone. It requires collaboration among policymakers and stakeholders across energy, aviation, and financing institutions. While developing future-ready technologies, it is equally important to optimize current solutions which are available for deployment. Governments should support the aviation industry's use of solutions like SAF through harmonized, incentive-based policies, rather than restrictive regulatory framework and mandates.

It is good to remember that innovation lies at the heart of the sustainable future we envision today. Renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter’s ‘Theory of Innovation Cycles’ highlights the transformative power of innovation on economies, industries, and societies. The world has witnessed these cycles in the past, where risk capital and policies fostered new technologies before they became the norm. Just as past innovations have transformed various sectors, aviation now stands at a similar crossroads. Innovation in aviation should be supported, promoted, and propagated until new technologies and business models mature to transform existing energy systems. Developing cost-efficient and streamlined technologies is crucial for reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/d1162bb5256f449ebe7f2491f5f743b8/net-zero-blog.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 04:56:13.636875

Plant construction is projected to start in the first half of 2026. The initial test flight is expected in 2027 and commercial flight service by 2030.

As much as 15% of JetZero’s pledged 14,560 employees — or 2,184 — could be contractors serving in full-time roles, the manufacturer confirmed Tuesday to N.C. Commerce Department.

Da Silva said JetZero doesn’t view the PTI’s aviation corridor, which includes Boom Supersonic, HAECO, Honda Aircraft Co. and Marshall Aerospace, as competition for employees.

“We’re coming to join you, not to displace you,” Da Silva said. “We’re happy to be here with you.”

Revolutionary, not evolutionary

Da Silva said the aviation industry has spent much of the past 60 years tweaking fuel and engine efficiency and passenger seating, but not the shape of the aircraft itself.

“There’s only so much you can extract from out of the (current) shape in terms of physics,” Da Silva said.

“JetZero’s approach is revolutionary because it does change the shape of the aircraft, using technology that has been studied for more than 35 years.

“We decided it was time to bring that technology to market because the materials are there to do it, the advent of AI, composite materials,” he said. “This time is ripe for the future of flight.”

Da Silva said JetZero’s Z4 blended wing aircraft should appeal to airlines and passengers searching for a more economic and climate friendly way to travel.

Da Silva said that because the Z4 aircraft will consume about half of the aviation fuel of current passenger aircraft, he said “airlines will be able to afford you a more affordable, lower-priced commodity.”

By reducing fuel consumption, Da Silva said the Z4 aircraft also significantly cuts down on carbon dioxide emissions.

“By cutting half of the fuel burn, you cut half of the emissions,” he said. “You can have a great evolution without even having to change the fuel source.”

Da Silva also talked about the challenges of air travel in current passenger aircraft as another selling point for JetZero.

“The shape of our airplane offers us the opportunity to change from what sitting in a tube feels like to sitting in your living room because you have this wide-open space that the airlines can shape in whatever way they want,” Da Silva said.

Da Silva drew a round of applause after saying “we are dimensioning the (passenger) bays in a way where the airlines cannot squeeze as much as they do today.”

“They won’t need to because they are burning 50% less fuel, they’ll be turning around their flight schedule quicker because passenger boardings and deplanings will be faster, servicing will be faster,” Da Silva said.

Background

North Carolina’s $450 million state economic incentive offer to JetZero became official on Aug. 6 as part of Gov. Josh Stein signing into law a mini-state budget bill.

The JetZero funding, provided over a six-year period, is included in House Bill 125 while House and Senate Republicans remain at an impasse over the overall budget bill.

JetZero jobs will include systems and aerospace engineering, supply chain, production workers, administrative and financial, human resources, research and development and customer service.

As JetZero begins to ramp up hiring, available jobs will be posted on its career page (job-boards.greenhouse.io/jetzero), as well as at NCworks.gov and GuilfordWorks.com.

The Z4 airplane, JetZero’s flagship model, is engineered with a blended-wing body to achieve up to 50% better fuel efficiency. The aircraft can seat between 200 and 250 passengers, fly up to 5,000 nautical miles and is compatible with existing airport infrastructure and sustainable aviation fuel.

JetZero is planning for a monthly production rate of 20 planes when five years into full production.

Plenty of infrastructure decisions remain for JetZero and the Piedmont Triad Airport Authority, foremost the size of the plant and how many acres the campus will require.

JetZero and the authority plan to dedicate the rest of 2025 to determining the shape of the plant and how best to fit the structure on the airport campus.

According to a presentation by the company, JetZero plans to pay an average annual wage of $89,340.

In exchange, the State Economic Investment Committee said the plant would be eligible for up to $1.57 billion in direct Job Investment Development grants.

The Guilford County Board of Commissioners confirmed at a special incentive hearing that the county will provide up to $75.9 million in performance-based incentives over 20 years.

Meanwhile, the Greensboro City Council approved paying $1,000 in incentives for every job created, which would make for at least a $14.56 million commitment.

Your business will be on the path to success if you land yourself at Teesside International Airport.

Since being brought back into public ownership in 2019, a consistent focus on estate and asset development has made the airport a prime location for top companies – with fantastic news stories spinning out of their arrival.

Willis Aviation Services is constructing its second twin-bay hangar to cater for its growing aircraft repair and overhaul operations, expanding the company’s thriving presence which recently saw it sign a new maintenance deal with Jet2.

Aircraft painting firm Airbourne Colours is also building a second facility, as it scores jobs with EasyJet, Jet2, Loganair, TUI and others, bringing even more jobs and apprenticeships to the site.

Aviation services and technology firm Draken, which currently operates two hangars for its £173m MoD contract, has signalled its further commitment with the airport as it seeks to build a new five-bay maintenance hangar with offices and workshops.

And FedEx, the world’s largest transportation company, has signed a five-year deal for an airfreight handling facility at Teesside – moving its operations from Newcastle. The airport already boasts its own cargo handling facility, with the latest screening technology, and is famed for its handling of urgent or last-minute goods.

Thanks to these, the airport recorded a year-on-year cargo increase of 130.7% in June 2025.

When it comes to import and export, as part of the Teesside Freeport’s customs zones, firms operating here will receive a range of tariff benefits, including duty deferral while the goods remain on-site and the suspension of VAT on goods entering the customs zone.

Businesses can also manufacture goods using the imports and add value, before exporting to international markets, without ever paying the full tariff on the original goods.

It’s not only aviation-related firms relocating here. Global car repair firm ABL 1Touch has become the first tenant at the south of the site, which offers high-quality office and Grade A industrial development opportunities across 270 acres, all with airside access if required.

ABL 1Touch’s Unit D is the first of four units which will be built to cover 130,000 sq ft with direct access to the road network via a convenient mile-long link road off the A67.

Like all the developments to come, the principle behind the 25,105 sq ft facility has been to provide a loose fit base build to each unit with a plug-and-play approach to meet individual requirements.

This has been established with an understood base performance that can be enhanced by an uplift in material choices as well as bespoke elements of fitout to suit individual tenant needs.

In total, Teesside Airport boasts 375 acres of developable land, including 5.2m sq ft/483,277 sq m of industrial, logistics and aviation development.

The airport has a strategy to become operationally net zero by 2030. This includes self-sufficient electricity for the site and tenants from an under-development solar array, a hydrogen vehicle refuelling station and involvement in sustainable aviation fuel research – helping your company meet its clean energy ambitions.

Yet, the question remains: Is this turnaround sustainable enough to justify long-term investment in a stock still shadowed by debt, regulatory scrutiny, and operational fragility?
In defense, Boeing’s F-47 fighter jet contract and sixth-generation R&D investments signal a bid to reclaim market share from competitors like Lockheed Martin [6].
The $53.3 billion debt load, coupled with potential labor strikes and certification delays, could derail progress.
Conclusion: A High-Stakes Gamble Boeing’s 2025 turnaround under Ortberg is a testament to the power of disciplined leadership in crisis.","Boeing’s journey under CEO Kelly Ortberg has been a study in balancing short-term survival with long-term reinvention. After reporting a $6 billion quarterly loss in Q3 2024—the second-largest in its history—the aerospace giant has shown glimmers of recovery in 2025. Yet, the question remains: Is this turnaround sustainable enough to justify long-term investment in a stock still shadowed by debt, regulatory scrutiny, and operational fragility?

Operational Recovery: Stabilizing the Core

Ortberg’s first act as CEO was to prioritize quality over speed. By slowing 737 MAX production to 38 units per month in Q2 2025, Boeing reduced bottlenecks and improved margins, which turned from -11.9% in 2024 to -5.1% in 2025 [1]. This disciplined approach, though initially controversial, has stabilized cash burn, which fell to $200 million per quarter from $4.3 billion in the prior year [4]. The Commercial Airplanes segment, now generating $10.87 billion in revenue (up 81% year-over-year), has become a cash flow engine, supported by a $522 billion backlog of orders [6].

However, challenges persist. Certification delays for the 737 MAX 7 and 10 variants, expected until 2026, could disrupt production timelines [1]. Meanwhile, the Defense, Space & Security segment—once a drag on profits—has turned a corner, posting a 1.7% operating margin in Q2 2025 and securing a $2.8 billion satellite contract for the U.S. Space Force [3]. This pivot to defense and space, now accounting for 35% of revenue, offers a stable cash flow stream amid commercial aviation’s volatility [5].

Strategic Shifts: From Debt to Discipline

Ortberg’s strategic playbook includes aggressive debt reduction and a focus on sustainable aviation. Boeing’s gross debt of $53.3 billion remains daunting, but deleveraging efforts—such as the $21 billion stock issuance in 2024 and the sale of its Digital Aviation Solutions business—have improved its credit profile [2]. Fitch Ratings recently noted that Boeing’s debt could fall “significantly” by 2026, though its debt-to-capital ratio of 106.6% still exceeds the 60% covenant threshold in its new $3 billion credit facility [7].

The CEO has also reoriented Boeing toward innovation. Partnerships for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatibility by 2030 and net-zero emissions targets align with global decarbonization trends [5]. In defense, Boeing’s F-47 fighter jet contract and sixth-generation R&D investments signal a bid to reclaim market share from competitors like Lockheed Martin [6].

Analyst Optimism vs. Lingering Risks

Analysts remain cautiously optimistic. With 20 out of 25 analysts recommending a “Strong Buy” and a $249.21 average target price (12.3% upside from current levels), the stock has gained 39% since Ortberg’s appointment [8]. Projections suggest adjusted earnings per share could jump from a $1.95 loss in 2025 to $11.92 in 2029, driven by free cash flow turning positive by 2026 [8].

Yet, risks loom large. The $53.3 billion debt load, coupled with potential labor strikes and certification delays, could derail progress. A recent $445 million DOJ fine for compliance lapses further underscores operational vulnerabilities [3]. Moreover, the proposed sale of Boeing’s space division—home to the Starliner spacecraft—remains unresolved, with Blue Origin and other bidders weighing in [6].

The Calculus for Long-Term Investors

For long-term investors, Boeing’s appeal lies in its structural advantages: a $619 billion total backlog, a 35% defense revenue buffer, and a leadership team prioritizing operational discipline. Ortberg’s emphasis on safety culture—reducing tool loss by 85% and streamlining governance documents—has restored some customer trust, with United Airlines praising Boeing’s “straight talk” on delivery schedules [5].

However, the path to profitability is far from certain. The company’s interest coverage ratio remains negative, and its BBB- credit rating carries a negative outlook [7]. A successful turnaround will require not only stabilizing the 737 MAX program but also launching a new aircraft to compete with Airbus—a costly and time-intensive endeavor.

Conclusion: A High-Stakes Gamble

Boeing’s 2025 turnaround under Ortberg is a testament to the power of disciplined leadership in crisis. Yet, the stock’s long-term potential hinges on its ability to navigate regulatory hurdles, manage debt, and innovate in a sector defined by rapid technological shifts. For investors with a high risk tolerance and a multi-year horizon, Boeing offers a compelling narrative of resilience. But for those seeking certainty, the aerospace giant’s turbulent history serves as a stark reminder: even the most ambitious turnarounds can falter under the weight of their own legacy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 02:56:38.423962

Biofuels (and Sustainable Aviation Fuel in particular) hold the promise of reduced carbon emissions – without the need to overhaul the aircraft and technology already in use.

Let’s explore what biofuels are, how they’re made, why they matter for helicopter operations, and what hurdles remain. We’ll also take a look at what the future looks like as the industry begins to integrate this cleaner fuel option into daily operations.

What Are Biofuels in Helicopter Operations?

Biofuels are fuels derived from renewable resources. They are an eco-friendly alternative to conventional jet fuel, which has powered helicopter engines for decades.

The biofuel that is used in helicopter operations is called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is derived from non-petroleum organic material known as feedstocks, which include:

Agricultural waste

Algae

Animal waste

Municipal waste

Non-food crops

Plant oils

Recycled cooking grease

One key benefit of SAF is that it’s a “drop-in replacement” for conventional jet fuel. This means SAF can power existing aircraft without the need for engine modifications.

The other critical advantage is that SAF is made from carbon sources that already exist as part of the natural carbon cycle. This results in lower overall emissions, making it a powerful tool in the aircraft industry’s push for sustainability.

Powering the Future: Benefits of Biofuels for Helicopter Missions

Biofuels like Sustainable Aviation Fuel offer a practical way for the helicopter industry to reduce the environmental impact of flights, especially in essential sectors like disaster response, firefighting, and heavy-lift construction.

Here are the top three advantages of making biofuels the go-to fuel for the helicopter industry:

Reduced Carbon Emissions

Aviation currently accounts for 2% of all carbon dioxide CO₂ emissions and 12% of all CO₂ emissions from transportation on a global scale. SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by 80% over the fuel’s lifecycle when compared to fossil fuels, directly contributing to more sustainable aviation.

No Need for New Infrastructure

Because SAF is a drop-in replacement, it integrates with existing fuel systems and helicopter engines. This means helicopter teams won’t need to overhaul their fleet or construct new fueling stations in order to significantly reduce the harmful emissions that contribute to climate change.

SAF can currently be blended with conventional jet fuel at levels ranging from 10% to 50%, depending on feedstock type and production method. In the future, 100% SAF could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94%.

Long-Term Cost Effectiveness

While production is still scaling up and current prices for SAF tend to be higher than for traditional jet fuel, this renewable option will likely offer long-term savings as carbon pricing and environmental regulations evolve.

Barriers to the Widespread Adoption of Biofuels

While biofuels promise a more sustainable future, there are several key obstacles the aviation industry is still working to overcome. These challenges must be addressed before renewable fuels can become the standard in helicopter operations:

Production Scalability: The availability of feedstock supply must expand (without disrupting food production) to meet the growing demands from the aviation industry. While innovations like algae-based fuels are promising, scaling production remains a challenge.

Engine Certification Requirements: Not all helicopter engines and aircraft are fully approved to operate on 100% SAF. Fuel blends of up to 50% are becoming more common, but more research and testing – as well as industry and policymaker collaboration – are needed for full certification.

Higher Upfront Costs: SAF is still more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Prices are expected to decrease as production methods improve and demand grows, but we’re not quite there yet.

Where We Are Now: The Status of SAF in Helicopter Operations

In 2021, Safran Helicopter Engines achieved a world first at its Bordes facility in France, where the company successfully ran a helicopter engine on 100% SAF. In this groundbreaking test, a Makila 2 engine was powered entirely by biofuel made from waste and residue including used cooking oil.

All aircraft from Safran Helicopter Engines are certified to run on 50% SAF, and the manufacturer plans to obtain a 100% biofuel approval by 2030.

Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company, also approved the use of SAF blends (of up to 50%) for its S-92 helicopter, which is in routine use in offshore energy support and other commercial operations.

Other helicopters – like the Bell 505 and Airbus H225 – are also either approved or have successfully demonstrated using SAF, and that list is steadily growing. More engines are undergoing testing, with manufacturers working to certify higher SAF blends.

Many companies, from Sikorsky to Airbus, are spearheading efforts to certify their aircraft for 100% SAF by the end of the decade.

What the Future Holds for Biofuels in Helicopter Aviation

Biofuels are set to play a major role in the future of helicopter operations. With growing research and investment, the path ahead is becoming clearer and more promising every day.

Here’s what we can expect to see over the next couple of decades:

Certification Advancements: Regulatory approval for using 100% SAF in helicopters is getting closer, thanks to successful tests with higher-blend fuels paving the way.

Faster, Cheaper Production: Emerging technologies are making SAF production more efficient and cost-effective. Innovations using algae, agricultural residue, and even municipal waste show significant promise.

Supportive Policy and Industry Goals: Global and national climate goals, along with financial incentives and fuel blending mandates, are helping drive the adoption of SAF across the aviation industry. As policy momentum grows, the gap between SAF and fossil fuel prices will close.

Hybrid Power Systems: Looking further ahead, hybrid-electric helicopters could pair battery-powered systems with turbines running on SAF to blend clean electricity with sustainable fuel for even greener flight. This would offer even greater emissions reductions. Leading engine manufacturers are already working on prototypes.

The document captures the urgency of climate challenges and the need for transformational markets, emphasizing that sustainable growth requires collaboration between public institutions, private investors, and innovators. ADB’s message is unmistakable: no single actor can deliver the sweeping transformation the region needs, but partnerships, informed by research and backed by finance, can reshape development trajectories.

Climate Finance at the Center of Growth

A central feature of ADB’s vision is its commitment to climate finance. The bank has pledged to raise more than $100 billion in cumulative climate-related financing from its own resources between 2019 and 2030. By the end of that period, 50% of its total committed financing will be climate-focused. This goal reflects both the scale of the climate crisis and the economic opportunity in accelerating the energy transition and green growth. The urgency is matched by results: between 2022 and 2024, ADB’s private sector operations more than doubled, signaling a surge in investor interest and institutional commitment. By 2030, the target is to quadruple private investment financing to $13 billion annually. This expansion is framed as a way to build vibrant private sectors that not only generate jobs and income but also channel capital into impactful climate investments.

Building Markets through Advisory and Innovation

The report identifies three main areas where ADB is working to shape markets. First is policy and institutional support, which helps governments create strong frameworks that attract investors and ensure transparent, stable markets. Second is transaction advisory, where ADB leverages its expertise to help both public and private clients design infrastructure projects that are commercially viable and investment-ready. Third is innovative financing, which blends instruments such as loans, guarantees, equity, and concessional resources to mitigate risks and create pathways for capital that might otherwise stay on the sidelines. These functions work together: strong policies build confidence, expert advisory creates sound projects, and innovative financing ensures bankability. ADB’s role is not confined to funding; it is about shaping entire ecosystems where markets can flourish and where development gains are sustainable.

Tangible Results and Demonstrated Impact

The report makes its case with a portfolio of results that highlight both financial impact and developmental outcomes. In 2024, ADB committed $2.6 billion to private sector projects and delivered $2.4 billion in climate cofinancing. It reached a record 58 project commitments, underscoring rising momentum. The bank’s Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program executed $4.9 billion in transactions during the year, while $4.3 billion in private capital was mobilized, including a milestone $2.1 billion for the rehabilitation of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in the Philippines. Between 2016 and 2024, ADB supported more than 100 completed or ongoing public–private partnership projects, a testament to its growing role as a market enabler. The numbers are paired with stories of change: new jobs for vulnerable groups, expanded opportunities for women, and a stronger private sector backbone across developing member countries.

Flagship Projects in Action

Two highlighted initiatives illustrate how ADB translates strategy into impact. In Pakistan, the bank partnered with SAFCO Venture Holdings Limited to develop the region’s first private-sector-led sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility. The $91.2 million financing package, structured by ADB as lead arranger, combines its own resources with syndicated contributions from global financiers like the Emerging Africa & Asia Infrastructure Fund, ILX, and the International Finance Corporation. The plant will convert waste-based feedstock such as used cooking oil into aviation fuel, reducing carbon emissions by up to 85% compared to conventional jet fuel. More than a single project, it positions Pakistan as a pioneer in a growing global market while contributing to the target of 70% SAF in the aviation fuel mix by 2050.

In the Philippines, ADB served as transaction advisor for the modernization of NAIA, one of Southeast Asia’s busiest airports. The project was designed under a rehabilitate–operate–expand–transfer model that integrates climate resilience and mandates at least 20% renewable energy use. It also promotes sustainable aviation fuel. A carefully structured financial model ensures both private profitability and public benefit, using a blend of upfront payments, annuities, and revenue-sharing to maximize government receipts. This project demonstrates how ADB’s advisory role goes beyond technical guidance, it embeds climate sensitivity and financial innovation into long-term infrastructure planning.

The report is a broader narrative of inclusion and shared prosperity. ADB stresses that its projects are not only about infrastructure or finance but about creating jobs, particularly for vulnerable populations and women, while advancing green growth. By mobilizing private markets, the bank argues it is helping member countries achieve sustainable progress that benefits both communities and ecosystems. The tone is forward-looking and confident, presenting ADB as an institution that has evolved from a traditional lender into a market-shaping partner. In doing so, it seeks to rally investors, innovators, and governments around the idea that sustainable development is a collective enterprise, and that well-designed markets, backed by robust institutions and innovative finance, can transform the future of Asia and the Pacific.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/28_08_2025_10_19_24_0385809.png?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-08-29 02:56:54.800170

“It’s about creating a place where companies of all sizes can work side by side with researchers to seek to turn bold ideas into reality,” he said.

“I’m proud that we’re building something here in Queensland that you simply won’t find anywhere else in Australia.”

The initiative builds on more than a decade of world-leading biomanufacturing expertise at UQ’s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN).

“Ten years ago, Professor Lars Nielsen and I were approached at AIBN by LanzaTech to see if we could build a mathematical model to understand microbes that can turn carbon emissions into ethanol,” Professor Marcellin recalled.

“That small idea has grown into a leading biohub driving net-zero innovation.”

Dr Sean Simpson, LanzaTech founder and part of the Hub steering committee, described the initiative as a critical step for the global industry, emphasising its role in bridging research and commercialisation.

“The Hub is a vital platform for connecting academic research with industry-scale innovation,” Dr Simpson said.

“It provides the deep knowledge we need to enable commercialisation and expand the space in which we can convert above-ground carbon resources into sustainable products.”

The award ceremony in Sydney also showcased the Hub’s value for local partners, with Professor Marcellin joined by Jan Pacas, CEO from industry partner All G.

“Partnering with the Hub gives us access to world-class researchers and facilities,” Mr Pacas said.

“It’s exactly what industry needs and allows companies like All G to scale innovation faster.”

The Hub’s impact reaches from emerging innovators to some of Australia’s largest companies.

“The Biosustainability Hub has the potential to help industry transition to a lower-carbon[1] economy,” said Dr Jitendra Joshi, Head of Carbon to Products at Woodside Energy.

“For Woodside, it’s an opportunity to work alongside UQ researchers on potential solutions that could deliver real impact at global scale.”

Australia currently ranks second to last out of 30 OECD countries on the proportion of businesses collaborating with higher education and public research institutions on innovation, according to OECD data cited by the Department of Education.

AIBN Director Professor Alan Rowan said the award underscored the Hub’s pivotal role in closing that gap and shaping Australia’s bioeconomy.

“This shows just how urgent it is to bridge the gap between research and industry,” Professor Rowan said.

“The Biosustainability Hub is exactly that bridge - a place where companies can cost-effectively tap into R&D and seek to build innovations that deliver both economic and environmental impact.

“It’s fantastic to see AFR recognise the Hub’s role as a national model for university-industry collaboration.

“The Hub is driving Australia’s bioeconomy by creating jobs, building industries, and tackling global challenges all at once.”

The Hub now has eleven research leaders spanning Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation (QAAFI), School of Chemistry and Molecular Biology (SCMB), School of Chemical Engineering, School of Civil Engineering, Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN), and School of Agriculture and Food Sustainability (SAFS), providing expertise in gas fermentation, precision fermentation, bioengineering, and bioprocess optimization.

The hub will be co-located at UQ’s Andrew N. Liveris Building and AIBN and is open to industry, researchers and governments from Australia and overseas.

The AIBN project is progressing in close collaboration with UQ Properties and Facilities Division, Wilson Architects, ADP Consulting, Wood Consulting, FARA Construction, and the Liveris Infrastructure team to ensure its timely completion by the end of 2025.",https://aibn.uq.edu.au/files/29423/Advanced-biomanufacturing-banner.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 22:56:56.604974

Porter is a privately held independent airline, making its debut in 2006 with two De Havilland Dash 8-400s.

A small group, including Michael Deluce, CEO of Porter, and his father Robert Deluce, current Executive Chairman, founder of the airline and scion of Canada’s famous aviation family, decided to design, build and pay for the terminal building at Billy Bishop in order to support the airline’s business plan, and from there, a single route to Ottawa was launched. The vision was to change the perception of regional air travel to create an experience that passengers enjoyed and looked forward to. Porter decided to focus on the onboard experience to channel this feeling, homing in on high quality, complimentary beer, wine, and snacks, as well as free access to Wi-Fi.

From the beginning, Porter faced numerous hurdles, such as having its request to operate A220s at Billy Bishop denied due to jet aircraft being forbidden.

Initially the airline had placed an order for 30 A220s and was set to be the Canadian launch customer of the aircraft, but the 1983 Tripartite Agreement at the airport restricted aircraft options.

Michael Deluce well recalls the array of challenges that arose as the airline first took to the skies.

He says: “Our competitors were prepared to do everything possible to prevent us from taking off, including challenging our application to operate US flights, being taken to court on multiple occasions regarding our operations at Billy Bishop Airport, and having our daily slots (or number of flights) temporarily reduced at Newark airport. It all took a certain amount of dedication and perseverance.”

However, Porter encountered its biggest hurdle of all when faced with the Covid-19 pandemic. While all airlines struggled, it was forced to suspend its operations in March 2020, only restarting 18 months later, and was the only airline in Canada to do so.

From September 2021, having had months to develop a growth plan, Porter began to rebuild, and Deluce maintains that it was the best choice the airline could have made to preserve the company.

Conquering Canada – APEX and Skytrax award-winning airline experience

Challenges faced and overcome, Porter is now a national airline, flying to every Canadian province and serving as the largest airline to operate from Ottawa and the third largest airline flying to the US and Canada from Toronto Pearson International Airport.

More importantly to Porter, the airline has achieved consistent soaring reviews and feedback from passengers, with customer satisfaction resting in the mid-80s, and numerous accolades to its name, including a four-star rating from the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) and North America’s Best Regional Airline award from Skytrax in 2024.

Today, with a team of 4,000 employees, Porter operates a fleet of 29 De Havilland Dash 8-400s and 44 Embraer E195-E2s, with plans to reach 100 of the latter aircraft over the coming years.

With such an extensive fleet expansion under way, the airline’s route portfolio has been steadily increasing in tandem.

As Deluce puts it: “We are just getting started.”

Porter flies to 23 Canadian destinations and 16 US destinations, with constant updates to its flight schedules and route maps to meet the growing demand for regional air travel.

In the first three months of 2025 alone, Porter announced six route developments, such as new destinations or increased flights for the summer season.

Currently, less than half of the 100 E195-E2s have been delivered, and gradually, as the remainder of the fleet is delivered, Porter intends to expand frequencies to key routes such as Toronto, Ottawa, Montréal and Halifax.

Another ambition in the pipeline is the addition of routes to more diverse destinations for winter tourism, such as Mexico and the Caribbean.

Deluce says: “In 2023, we launched our growth plan to expand the network across North America using the state-of-the-art E195-E2 aircraft. With the E195-E2 we are challenging the definition of economy air travel with a level of service that is non-existent in air travel today.

“Porter is now operating throughout North America, increasing the connectivity of our overall network. Passengers can also expect to travel seamlessly across the globe by connecting with our partner airlines, such as Air Transat and Alaska.”

Embraer everywhere – From De Havilland Canada’s Dash 8 to Embraer’s E195-E2

But why is the E195-E2 featuring so prominently in Porter’s success and future plans? It remains to be said that Porter stands by the Dash 8, with Deluce praising its performance.

“We’ve always been happy with the Dash 8,” he says. “It has served us very well for the past 18 years and is very efficient for the sectors we use it.

“Its jet-like performance is ideal for serving the high-frequency business routes that make up a significant portion of our regional network.”

Yet the increase of Embraer aircraft within Porter’s fleet is a marker of an even stronger future for the airline.

First and foremost, the aircraft fits the airline’s mantra of “Flying Refined” due to its two-seat configuration and extra leg room. A lack of a middle seat means that there is no “bad seat” in the customer’s mind.

Equally, the aircraft are optimal for Porter’s operations. With a full-passenger range of 2,600 nm and claims from Embraer that the aircraft is 12.5 per cent more fuel efficient than its closest competitor, the E195-E2 is able to provide both the comfort and the performance desired from an airline that seeks to fill a premium regional aviation gap.

Deluce says: “The E195-E2 is a great product overall. It has the performance needed to reach the markets we want to serve, and from a sustainability standpoint it’s the most environmentally friendly single-aisle aircraft family.

“It has the lowest operating costs – cost per seat and cost per flight of aircraft its size. The interior complements Porter’s traditional service offering, with a passenger-focused design emphasising space and comfort. They allow us to fly just about anywhere in North America from Eastern Canada.”

Strategising for success – Tracking passenger travel behaviours for airline operation strategy

When it comes to operational strategy, Porter benefits from the frequent busy periods of travel to Canada, with peaks during the March break and other holidays, as well as over the summer and Christmas.

Meanwhile, its US destinations see similar periods, with more passengers travelling to warm destinations such as Florida, California and Arizona during the winter.

In the quieter periods, Porter prioritises aircraft maintenance and has recently announced plans to expand its maintenance facilities by leasing a 20,000 square foot hangar at Halifax Stanfield International Airport.

The airline’s primary location at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport is another benefit, with the airport seeing 1.7 million passengers in 2024 and ranking as the ninth busiest airport in Canada.

Billy Bishop also supports the local community considerably, generating over CAD 2.1 billion in economic output and providing 4,450 jobs.

Deluce says: “Our high-frequency schedule is valued by our passengers – both business and leisure – providing unmatched connectivity to downtown Toronto and other key regional centres. Billy Bishop is a key driver for tourism in Toronto.”

On the market front, the airline is continuing to target the crossover section between high-standard service for an economy price and is particularly looking at pushing its reach further across North America.

A bright future – New loyalty programme and passenger terminal to assist passenger growth

The future looks bright for Porter, and Deluce says there is a lot of growth ahead for 2025.

At the end of March, the airline launched the BMO VIPorter Mastercard line-up, enabling customers to use a loyalty credit card that it is hoped will develop into an impactful revenue stream.

It also marks the only travel credit card programme in Canada to grant immediate frequent flyer benefits for cardholders.

Launching the credit card, Edmond Eldebs, the airline’s Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, said: “Porter is growing faster than any Canadian airline and opportunities to use points for meaningful travel experiences are growing along with us.”

For the second half of 2025, Porter will complete the co-development of a passenger terminal at Montréal Metropolitan Airport (MET) in Saint Hubert.

Discussing what this will mean for Porter and its customers, Deluce says: “Much like efforts to revitalise Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport 18 years ago, this second airport will provide Greater Montréal with a convenient alternative for much of the population within a comfortable terminal environment. More than 10 potential MET routes have been initially identified, spanning from Vancouver to St John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador.”

Another update in the pipeline is the opening of US Customs Preclearance at Billy Bishop in late 2025, which is expected to improve connection times with partner airlines and the possibility of new locations that were not previously available due to a lack of customs services.

When it comes to sustainability, Porter doesn’t have any firm initiatives in place, but rather approaches the subject from a broader perspective, with responsible practices and emissions management.

Deluce says: “We know that travel is beneficial for personal, cultural and economic reasons. The industry is investing in many new technologies, including significantly more efficient aircraft, to reduce emissions and meet net zero goals. It’s important for governments to assist with this transition globally by making financial investments in areas such as sustainable aviation fuel – much like they are doing for other industries.”

Passenger priority – Enhancing travel experiences with PorterReserve and PorterClassic

Porter continues to target a specific audience of the economy air travel market and is upping the ante by providing a range of superior services that previously were not often seen in short-haul and regional travel.

Currently, Porter offers PorterReserve and PorterClassic as tiers of service. PorterClassic enables passengers to customise the perks that are most important to them, such as extra baggage and travel flexibility, with varying fares – Basic, Standard, Flexible, Freedom – while maintaining the premium benefits of Porter’s standard fare.

PorterReserve provides a more all-inclusive experience and is selected by a balanced split of leisure and business travellers, with an extra checked bag, shorter security lines and early boarding.

Varying ticket fares for enhanced economy experiences haven’t been the norm for this segment of the travel market thus far, but Deluce sees a growing demand for these types of services.

He says: “We’ve seen an increase in leisure economy travellers interested in the PorterReserve experience for longer flights on board the E195-E2. This all-inclusive economy product has many attributes that other airlines provide with business class or premium economy, such as extra legroom and priority boarding. We also offer free Wi-Fi and healthy meals on longer flights.

“The pricing of PorterReserve is very attractive for leisure travellers who want a better experience with all the perks included or for business travellers who want a quality experience at a much more affordable price.”

There are few airlines like Porter, and this unique perspective of passenger experience from an affordable price point is what has propelled this airline’s success and assisted it to overcome the plentiful challenges along the way.

With expansion to a wider range of destinations on the horizon and an ever-growing efficient fleet, Porter’s customer-first service is set to impact many more happy passengers to come.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Copy-of-Front-image-for-web-3.png,N,,2025-08-28 17:56:42.964528
,,2025-08-28 20:32:49+00:00,Matador Network,Flying's Environmental Impact Is Undeniable. Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel the Answer?,Tim Wenger,,,,,https://matadornetwork.com/read/sustainable-aviation-fuel-future/,"Unlike kerosene-based jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or recycled bio-organic sources and can lower total greenhouse gas emissions over time.
Importantly, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without engine modifications.
The fuel produces nearly the same amount of CO₂ as traditional jet fuel when burned.
Total SAF usage currently accounts for less than 2 percent of total global jet fuel consumption.
Still, Neste says global SAF production is sufficient to meet existing mandates in the EU and UK.","Unlike kerosene-based jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or recycled bio-organic sources and can lower total greenhouse gas emissions over time. It can be produced from biomass like corn, used cooking oil, and agricultural residues, as well as from municipal waste or synthetic fuels made by combining captured CO₂ with green hydrogen (‘power-to-liquid’). Importantly, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without engine modifications. The fuel produces nearly the same amount of CO₂ as traditional jet fuel when burned. But because SAF is made from renewable or recycled carbon sources, net lifecycle emissions can be up to 80 percent lower, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Ultimately, the IATA estimates SAF could make up 65 percent of the emissions reduction need for aviation to reach net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. It’s an important piece of the pie in addition to improving technology like carbon capture.

The need for SAF is rising. Commercial aviation accounts for about 2.5 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. As other sectors of the economy become more sustainable and the amount of flights around the world increases, the share of total emissions from flying will only grow – unless airlines can find effective ways to lower their environmental impact. In addition to carbon capture, which involves pulling carbon from the air and storing it underground, the adoption of SAF is increasingly viewed as a viable means for the aviation sector to reduce its emissions.

Still, a spokesperson for Neste, a Finnish energy company founded in 1948, told me there’s still a long way to go. Total SAF usage currently accounts for less than 2 percent of total global jet fuel consumption.

Neste, originally focused on securing Finland’s oil supply, has transformed over the decades into a SAF leader focused on renewable and circular energy solutions. Neste’s Singapore refinery is the world’s largest SAF facility, capable of producing 1 million tons annually. Neste isn’t alone. Boston’s World Energy has produced SAF since 1998, while Reno-based XCF Global recently became the first publicly traded SAF company in the United States.

The industry is gaining traction, though critics remain skeptical of SAF’s scalability and environmental value. Its future is far from guaranteed, and SAF alone is unlikely to erase aviation’s heavy carbon footprint. Still, momentum is building. Commercial aviation may be moving toward a cleaner future. What role SAF will play remains unclear.

How SAF works

SAF is straightforward in concept but complex to produce. The most common production method is known as HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which uses renewable oils and fats such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and some non-food vegetable oils. These are treated with hydrogen at high temperature and pressure to remove oxygen and impurities, producing paraffinic hydrocarbons that closely resemble conventional jet fuel and can be blended directly (hence the term “drop-in” fuel).

Sustainability efforts are highly marketable these days. While companies that reduce their environmental impact deserve credit, consumers are wary of greenwashing. Delta Air Lines was the first US carrier to offer offsets when travelers book flights in 2007, and doing so is now an industry standard. It’s easy to see this as shifting the sustainability burden to consumers rather than the companies. SAF instead allows companies to take a bigger responsibility in reducing emissions.

Airlines buy SAF certificates (SAFc) to document emissions cuts. SAFc uses a system called ‘insetting,’ which separates the verified emissions savings from the fuel itself. Airlines can then apply those savings to their overall carbon footprint from flights. This sounds similar to how carbon offset credits, which have been shown to be ineffective without strict monitoring, are applied. But the SAFc system is considered more reliable because it’s tracked through a ‘Book and Claim’ ledger. This helps prevent double counting of emissions reductions, ensure integrity, and allows SAF to be used where most efficient, all while still letting companies claim the associated emissions cuts in their supply chains.

This could prove to be the key difference in helping both the public and airlines get on board with developing and implementing more SAF use.

“Delivering the emissions reduction value of SAF with SAFc insets is increasingly recognized as the best tool to scale investment in the SAF industry,” Karen Boyd, director of product sustainability at World Energy, says.

Where does current policy on SAF stand?

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a net-zero target for 2050. It introduced a Global Framework calling for a 5 percent emissions cut by 2030 through SAF and lower-carbon fuels. The European Union’s ReFuelEU regulation is the most ambitious program in the world, requiring airlines to blend their jet fuel with 2 percent SAF by 2025, 6 percent by 2030, and 70 percent by 2050, with dedicated targets for synthetic e-fuels. The UK has set a similar path with a 9.5% SAF target by 2030, while Ireland recently launched its first national SAF roadmap. In North America, the US Inflation Reduction Act offers SAF tax credits and $300 million for research and infrastructure, while Canada supports production through mandates, incentives, and public–private partnerships. Time will tell whether any of these benefits survive the current administration’s environmental rollbacks.

India, Brazil, and a handful of other countries also have SAF mandates in place. China, South Korea, Turkey, and the UAE are developing frameworks. By 2030, government mandates are expected to cover about 75 percent of global jet fuel use, requiring airlines to use roughly 2 billion gallons of SAF each year. That’s far more than the 1 percent of global jet fuel that SAF accounts for today, with production constrained by feedstock scarcity, high costs, and delayed projects.

The gap between policy goals and current supply means scaling up investment and infrastructure is essential. Still, Neste says global SAF production is sufficient to meet existing mandates in the EU and UK. That’s because these mandates are currently quite low – and because the ongoing expansion of Neste’s Rotterdam refinery will bring the company’s total SAF production capability to 2.2 million tons annually in 2027. XCF and other producers are scaling in the same manner.

Progress and making the costs make sense

In June 2025, XCF Global, a synthetic aviation fuel producer, took the vision for decarbonized air travel directly to Wall Street when it went public via a merger with Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Company under the ticker SAFX. The company promotes “feedstock-agnostic technology” that isn’t reliant on corn or monocrop agriculture. At the company’s facility in Reno, Nevada, it produces SAF in the largest industrial park in the country.

“SAF in our opinion is going to be one of the most predominant ways to decarbonize the aviation industry,” Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF, told Matador. “I think that’s the purpose of why we intended on going public is we wanted to add to the legitimacy. To bring visibility to what’s happening in our business but as well as what’s happening in the market.”

Technological improvements and availability are one step to a more sustainable industry, but won’t have the intended impact if it’s still too expensive to implement. XCF Global’s business plan is key to growing the sector as a whole. The company reduces costs by having its facility in a location near a source for various types of feedstocks like tallow, cooking oil, the waste byproduct distillers corn oil, and soybean oil.

Dange acknowledges the challenges but feels like his business, and SAF more broadly, is well-positioned for growth. Meeting the 2050 goal of a 70 percent decrease in carbon intensity will require roughly 100 times today’s infrastructure, he said, adding “we’re just not building infrastructure that fast.”

“I don’t consider [other SAF companies] competitors” in the bigger picture of a more sustainable future, Dange said. “We need as much staff infrastructure as we can to come online to help meet the demands of the future, to help reduce the carbon intensity around aviation.”

He argues that success depends on industry and regulators working together to create consistent global standards. Clear reporting and verification will not only move the sector forward but also build public trust — a view echoed by World Energy and Neste.

“We take our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculations very seriously, conducting rigorous evaluations that account for full cradle-to-grave emissions and vetting them through independent third-party audits on an annual basis to ensure transparency and accuracy,” says Boyd, of World Energy. “This approach aligns with industry standards. Where properly certified SAF achieves at least a 50 percent lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel, our SAF can achieve up to 85 percent in optimal cases using waste-based or advanced feedstocks.”

The case against sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel isn’t without critics who point out that SAF comes with its own inherent climate risks. For one, corn requires an immense amount of land and water to grow.

Chuck Collins, director at the Institute for Policy Studies, is a vocal critic of SAF. He coauthored the 2024 report “Greenwashing the Skies” that argued SAF is largely a marketing ploy and not a scalable solution for aviation emissions. He and his coauthors point out that current SAF production is nowhere near what would be required to meet US climate goals, a valid stance.

The report notes that scaling up would demand massive subsidies and land-use changes, and that the aviation industry has a poor track record of meeting its own SAF targets. Collins also warns that including fuels like corn-based ethanol could worsen climate impacts due to land clearance and soil loss.

To produce enough corn-based ethanol to replace just 10 percent of current US jet fuel demand, corn yields and production methods would need major improvements. Replacing 100 percent of jet fuel with corn-based ethanol would be far more damaging and would require vast new cropland that reduces forests and strains water supplies.

Other vocal critics include airline executives themselves. AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes has called SAF “stupid”, and, like Collins and the IPS, questions its scalability given feedstock limitations and cost. Breeze Airways CEO David Neeleman agrees, telling Skift that SAF is economically and environmentally inadequate.

Collins and other SAF opponents call for rejecting ethanol-based SAF due to the harmful lifecycle impacts, and instead push for independent, science-driven research rather than what Collins has described as industry-influenced standards. His warning that turning farmland into fuel crops would be disastrous has merit, though it may overlook other viable SAF pathways.

Even industry players recognize these concerns – and are working to address them.

“Critics’ worries about scalability and environmental trade-offs, such as those from biofuel competition with food crops, are being addressed through evolving frameworks like ICAO’s sustainability criteria,” Boyd says. “Ultimately, dismissing SAF entirely overlooks its role in aviation’s net-zero pathway, but ongoing scrutiny drives improvements in production and certification to maximize real-world decarbonization.”

Embracing today’s solutions while building tomorrow’s

Waiting for researchers to develop a silver bullet solution is an increasingly less viable option as the effects of climate change speed up. Still, for SAF to be viable, more production methods need to be embraced to turn waste into energy.

One place to find inspiration is Denmark. Copenhagen’s CopenHill (Amager Bakke) plant burns the city’s non-recyclable waste in a high-efficiency incinerator, generating both electricity and hot water for tens of thousands of homes. If similar waste-to-energy plants were adapted to produce jet fuel using advanced filtration and catalytic systems to capture pollutants, the result could be cleaner than today’s kerosene while also diverting waste from landfills and cutting methane emissions. CopenHill is especially notable for its design: the plant doubles as a recreation space, with a ski slope, climbing wall, and hiking trails built into its sloping roof, helping secure public support.

Technology isn’t the only challenge to increasing production, however. Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the industry’s biggest roadblocks.

“The primary regulatory obstacles to scaling SAF production involve inconsistent international policies and varying sustainability criteria across jurisdictions, which can hinder compliance and deter investment in certain pathways or regions,” Boyd says.

She adds that regulatory uncertainty in both the US and EU, such as delays in tax credits and blending mandates, continues to slow progress. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) provides a framework to standardize international aviation emissions reductions, but its impact is limited by patchy participation and uneven carbon pricing.

The future for SAF – and what travelers can do now

The core takeaway is clear: For SAF to both scale and notably reduce the emissions of the aviation sector, production must be done responsibly with consistent global regulation and enactment.

For travelers, small steps matter too. Airlines including Alaska, JetBlue, and Turkish now allow flyers to “purchase” SAF credits at checkout, effectively only contributing a couple bucks to the cause but importantly voicing their support.

“I would emphasize that while some concerns are valid and highlight the need for careful pathway and feedstock selection,” Boyd says, “the evidence shows SAF can deliver substantial net GHG reductions when produced responsibly.”

For travelers from the US, a successful way forward involves educating both the public and lawmakers on the benefits, and supporting organizations, politicians, and individuals advocating for responsible development. Each step to replace fossil fuels with a more sustainable alternative is a step in the right direction. When SAF-powered long-hauls like Virgin’s Flight100 become the norm is still years or decades away – but in the broad stroke of human progress, this time is a blink of the eye.",https://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2025/08/SAF-2463328421-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 22:57:06.001681

This strategic move solidifies Menzies’ position as the world’s largest aviation services provider, now operating across 350 airports in 65 countries with a workforce of 65,000 employees. The acquisition is expected to increase group revenue by 20%, pushing annual turnover beyond US$3.1 billion based on 2024 projections.

Expansion of U.S. Presence and Service Capabilities

With the integration of G2 Secure Staff, Menzies becomes the leading aviation services provider by the number of airports served in the United States, the largest aviation market globally. The merger effectively doubles Menzies’ U.S. operations to over 110 locations, including key hubs such as Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Los Angeles International, and Denver International airports. This expanded network enhances Menzies’ service portfolio, combining G2’s strengths in ground services, passenger assistance, and cabin cleaning with Menzies’ existing expertise in ground handling, air cargo, and fuel services.

John Redmond, Executive Vice President Americas at Menzies, will continue to oversee the region, with G2’s senior management integrated into his leadership team. The rebranding of G2’s operations under the Menzies Aviation name will commence immediately. The company plans to implement its global standards for training, safety, sustainability, and technology across all newly acquired operations to ensure a seamless transition for employees, customers, and partners.

Strategic Objectives and Industry Challenges

Companies will have to meet the RFS mandate by purchasing more expensive advanced biofuels biofuels such as renewable diesel.
Imported biofuels or domestic biofuels fuels made from imported feedstock will receive a 50% discount towards meeting the biofuel mandate.
In addition, US companies have fewer tax incentives to increase biofuel capacity.
The small refinery exemptions that the US recently announced will do little – if anything – to offset the costs of the proposed RFS.","HOUSTON (ICIS)–The new biofuel mandate proposed by the US calls for larger amounts of renewable fuel to be blended into gasoline and diesel, all while penalizing companies that import biofuels or the feedstock needed to make them domestically.

The proposed mandate, called the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), will not just increase costs in the fuel market. Oleochemical producers rely on the same feedstocks to make fatty acids.

The proposed penalty on imports of feedstock will increase demand for domestically produced material, which will raise prices for oleochemical producers and others company that use natural oils to produce goods.

The following table shows the proposed RFS. The mandate volumes for each fuel is listed as renewable identification numbers (RINs), which is the unit of measurement used to determine compliance with the RFS. For ethanol, 1 RIN is equivalent to 1 gallon. For distillates, each gallon is worth more than 1 RIN to take into account their higher energy density.

Figures in the table are listed in billions of RINs.

2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Cellulosic biofuel 0.84 1.09 1.38 1.30 1.36 Biomass-based diesel 4.51 4.86 5.36 7.12 7.50 Advanced biofuel 5.94 6.54 7.33 9.02 9.46 Total renewable fuel 20.94 21.54 22.33 24.02 24.46 Implied conventional biofuels 15.00 15.00 15.00 15.00 15.00

Source: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

The proposed RFS will increase costs in the following ways:

It will require more advanced biofuels to be blended into finished fuels. Advanced biofuels typically cost more.

It assumes that the same volume of conventional ethanol will be added into a shrinking domestic market for gasoline. This will require gasoline to contain higher concentrations of ethanol at a time when most service stations cannot handle fuels containing more than 10% ethanol. Companies will have to meet the RFS mandate by purchasing more expensive advanced biofuels biofuels such as renewable diesel.

Imported biofuels or domestic biofuels fuels made from imported feedstock will receive a 50% discount towards meeting the biofuel mandate. This proposed discount would further increase compliance costs if refiners cannot obtain domestic biofuels or feedstock.

Previous US policies already have raised biofuel costs. Tariffs have increased the costs of imported biofuels and the feedstocks needed to make them.

In addition, US companies have fewer tax incentives to increase biofuel capacity.

In all, the proposed RFS could increase compliance costs by nearly $70 billion annually in 2026 and 2027, according to studies commissioned by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), a trade group that represents refiners. That is nearly twice as high as the previous record year for RFS compliance.

The small refinery exemptions that the US recently announced will do little – if anything – to offset the costs of the proposed RFS. Those exemptions did not lower the biofuel mandate. Instead, they exemptions simply reallocated the obligations from the small refiners to larger ones.

ETHANOL HITS BLENDING CEILING

Ideally, the fuel market would meet mandated volumes for total renewable fuels by blending conventional ethanol. Ethanol is typically cheaper than advanced fuels, and the proposed RFS assumes that this will happen.

The mandate implies that blenders will continue adding 15 billion gal/year of conventional ethanol in the years 2026 and 2027, a figure unchanged from 2023-2025.

However, US gasoline demand will continue declining, as shown in the following chart. Figures show millions of barrels per day of gasoline supplied to the US market.

Source: Energy Information Administration

To meet the mandate, finished gasoline will need to contain higher concentrations of ethanol, and fuel stations will need to the equipment necessary to store and distribute those higher blends.

The problem is most fuel stations in the US can handle gasoline with maximum ethanol blends of 10% (E10). A relatively small number of fuel stations have the equipment and infrastructure necessary to handle gasoline with blends of 15% ethanol (E15) and 85% ethanol (E85), as shown in the following table:

Total fueling stations 150,000 E15 3,000 E85 4,200

Sources: American Petroleum Institute (API), US Department of Energy (DoE)

The lack of fuel stations that can distribute E15 and E85 makes it difficult to blend more ethanol in a shrinking market for domestic gasoline.

US forecasts for fuel consumption acknowledge this ceiling on ethanol demand. They expect demand to decline, as shown in the following chart. Figures show millions of barrels/day of ethanol consumed in the US.

Source: EIA

Once the gasoline pool hits that ceiling for ethanol blending, blenders will have to meet the RFS mandate buy obtaining more expensive advanced biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and cellulosic fuels.

In particular, renewable diesel and SAF have no blending limits, so the fuel market would face no physical constraints in using these fuels instead of conventional ethanol to meet their RFS mandates.

However, the AFPM wars that such a strategy could prove way more costly than using conventional ethanol. It accounts for half of the $70 billion in annual compliance costs, according to the AFPM studies.

IMPORTED BIOFUELS TO BECOME TWICE AS EXPENSIVE

Under the proposed RFS, imports of biofuels and domestic biofuels made from imported feedstock will receive a 50% discount towards meeting the biofuels mandate. In other words, it will be twice as expensive to rely on imported biofuels or feedstock to meet the proposed RFS mandates.

The discount on imported feedstock will have more widespread effects because the biofuel industry is just one of many sectors that use natural oils.

Oleochemical producers and other oil-dependent industries also rely on natural oils, so they will be competing with renewable fuels producers for limited quantities of domestic feedstock.

The effects of this feedstock displacement would be amplified if biofuel producers replace imports of used cooking oil with domestic oils.

Most of this used cooking oil is used to make biofuels, according to the business intelligence and analytical firm GlobalData.

Moreover, the US imports significant amounts of used cooking oil, as shown in the following chart. Figures are in kilograms and reflect 2024 imports for consumption under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) code 15180040.

Source: US International Trade Commission (figures in kilograms)

US TARIFFS INCREASE COMPLIANCE COSTS FOR DIESEL-TYPE BIOFUELS

Even without the RFS, compliance costs will likely increase because of tariffs, which the US has imposed on some of its largest suppliers of feedstock used to make biofuels.

In 2024, China was the largest US supplier of imports of used cooking oil, Brazil was the largest for tallow and Argentina for refined soybean oil.

The following chart shows the US 2024 trade balance for tallow (HTS code 150210) and refined soybean oil (HTS code 150710). Figures are in kilograms, and they show imports for consumption and domestic exports for 2024.

Source: ITC

The US could conceivably replace these imports with domestically produced soybean oil, but it will need to increase production and install crushing capacity to provide enough feedstock to offset the imports.

It will also present logistic challenges, since supply chains would need to be re-arranged to accommodate the new sources of feedstock.

If the new supply chains require domestic shipping, then the Jones Act could further increase costs because it requires shipping between US ports to be conducted by ships built, flagged, owned and crewed domestically.

US TAX CODE PROVIDES FEWER INCENTIVES FOR RENEWABLE FUELS

The US tax code is reducing its incentives for biofuel production, which will make it more expensive for companies to increase production to meet the larger mandate in the proposed RFS.

The biodiesel blender tax credit expired at the end of 2024. It provided a $1 tax incentive for each gallon of pure biodiesel or renewable diesel blended into petroleum-based diesel.

By contrast, the section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC) provides a 35 cent/gal benefit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and 20 cents/gal for all other fuel. The credit rises to $1.75/gal for SAF and $1.00/gal for all others for producers that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. However, feedstocks must be sourced from the US, Canada or Mexico.

HOW THE RFS WORKS

The RFS requires that a mandated volume of biofuel is added to the nation’s fuel pool. The RFS distinguishes among the different types of biofuels by their feedstock, the process used to produce them and their effect on greenhouse gas emissions. The following table summarizes the different classes of biofuels.

Code Content Greenhouse Gas Reduction Renewable Fuel D-6 Any biomass, including corn starch At least 20% versus petroleum Advanced Biofuels D-5 Any renewable biomass except corn-starch-based ethanol At least 50% versus petroleum Biomass-based Diesel D-4 Biodiesel, renewable diesel At least 50% versus diesel Cellulosic biofuel D-3, D-7 Made from cellulose, hemicellulose or lignin At least 60% versus petroleum

Delegates reinforced their backing for ICAO’s long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) for international aviation of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, including through strong continued endorsement of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, reiterating their agreement to preserve CORSIA as the sole global market-based measure for emissions reduction.

Partners also pledged to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel deployment and develop climate-resilient airport infrastructure, directly accelerating progress towards the LTAG.

The FINVEST Hub initiative gained significant momentum through Japanese government and industry backing. The initiative will connect sustainable aviation fuel projects with financing opportunities, addressing investment needs to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Focus on innovation

Aviation leaders addressed integrating artificial intelligence into operations and air traffic management systems. Secretary General Salazar emphasized developing consistent safety standards across the region, particularly for emerging technologies like Advanced Air Mobility systems. Regional Director Tao Ma highlighted updates to the Global Air Navigation Plan, incorporating AI developments and addressing emerging technologies.

The System Wide Information Management initiative received enhanced endorsement, along with agreements to address Global Navigation Satellite System interference affecting civil aviation operations.

Cybersecurity discussions reinforced standards for protecting aviation systems, with States agreeing to implement the cybersecurity framework for communications, navigation and surveillance systems.

New strategic partnerships

Aviation authorities formalized multiple partnerships during the gathering.

Malaysia announced a $500,000 contribution to the Asia-Pacific Capacity Development Initiative, demonstrating significant leadership on capacity building. Officials also signed an agreement with the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority for technical assistance to Pacific Small Island Developing States, advancing the ""No Country Left Behind"" initiative and the Aviation Safety Implementation Assistance Partnership (ASIAP) goals.

The event highlighted the success of the inaugural Asia-Pacific Regional Training Symposium in Singapore and secured agreements for future training initiatives. States endorsed the Next Generation of Aviation Professionals (NGAP) programme and agreed to develop aviation training centers aligned with international standards.

Training programmes received expanded backing, including agreements for the Asia-Pacific Flight Procedure Programme and future symposiums. Officials also secured pledges for implementing revised Obstacle Limitation Surface Standards and Recommended Practices.

States agreed to advance digital air cargo initiatives, including the ONE Record system for improved data sharing. Discussions with the Asian Development Bank explored collaboration on procurement services and sustainable aviation fuel investments.

Looking forward

The 59 action items adopted during the conference provide a roadmap for implementation across the region, with States pledging to report progress ahead of the next gathering. Malaysia will host the 61st DGCA Conference in 2026 under the theme “Smart Skies: Emerging Technologies for Safe, Secure, Sustainable and Efficient Aviation.”",https://www.icao.int/sites/default/files/2025-08/APAC-DGCA.png,N,,2025-08-28 14:56:19.796837

“The problem is there’s a huge demand for renewable fuel, in this case sustainable aviation fuel.","O'FALLON – The connection between agriculture, technology and aviation was front and center during a Global Aerospace Summit held in the St. Louis region in mid-August. During an engaging session titled “Ag Sector Innovations – Powering Sustainable Solutions in the Aviation Industry,” the audience learned how crops and ethanol are being developed into sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to help reduce emissions in one of the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors. Panelists highlighted innovations originating in the St. Louis region that are fueling progress on these efforts.

The inaugural Global Aerospace Summit was presented by the Leadership Council Southwestern Illinois in partnership with Madison County, St. Clair County, and Bi-State Development’s St. Louis Regional Freightway. It drew 400-plus industry leaders, educators, government officials, workforce development experts and career seekers who also learned about the St. Louis region’s aerospace assets, its potential for continued growth and innovation and various initiatives to grow the workforce.

The inaugural Global Aerospace Summit took place on Aug. 13 and 14, 2025, at the Regency Conference Center in O'Fallon, IL.

The panel was moderated by Andy Banker, anchor and reporter with KTVI Fox 2, and featured Dr. Yan Zhang, interim center director and director of research for the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and Jim Hedges, CEO of St. Louis-based CoverCress, Inc. (CCI).

Dr. Zhang explained that since its opening in 2003, NCERC’s focus has expanded from corn-to-ethanol production to scaling up technologies for biopolymers and various other fuels, including SAF. She noted that NCERC is working on the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway, one of eight approved processes for SAF.

“Among the eight pathways in this country, the ATJ is actually a very, very promising way to make a jet fuel to meet the 3-billion-gallon per year mark by 2030 in this country using ethanol from corn starch,” Zhang said. “However, right now there are some challenges. We are not there yet.”

She said the No. 1 challenge the corn-to-ethanol industry is working on is trying to lower the carbon intensity score. “For us, we just need to push a little bit more on the reduction of carbon dioxide emission from fermentation,” Zhang said. “NCERC has a demo-scale project planned in six months. If the results look okay, we will contribute a lot to the development.”

Hedges described how CoverCress Inc., an ag-tech company, is converting a once-noxious weed into a commercially viable crop for renewable fuel. “In a startup world, don’t build a solution in search of a problem. At CCI, we have built a solution to answer a problem,” Hedges said. “The problem is there’s a huge demand for renewable fuel, in this case sustainable aviation fuel. The demand is going to outpace what we can do as an individual company or as a crop. We don’t view other crops as competitors. We want to lift all these solutions up to fulfill the demand, so that the demand doesn’t go away because there’s a lack of solutions.”

He explained that CoverCress, the company’s main crop, is the first new crop introduced in the industry since canola about 60 years ago. It grows between corn and soybean seasons, creating a new revenue stream for farmers while improving soil health.

Hedges highlighted the strategic advantages of the St. Louis region for SAF research and development. “I've been in five different startups and I’ve never had the level of talent that I have at CCI,” said Hedges. “The ecosystem of Ag Tech in St. Louis rivals anything in the United States.” He highlighted the proximity to key agricultural stakeholders, access to talent, and a strong innovation community through the Danforth Plant Science Center, 39 North, and BioSTL noting that the local ag-tech ecosystem makes it possible to connect research, commercialization, and farmers efficiently.

Beyond improving carbon intensity scores, both speakers also addressed additional barriers to scaling up SAF production, including retrofitting facilities and encouraging farmers to adopt new crops, and delivering fuel at a competitive cost. But Hedges indicated the change for farmers is very minor, essentially just a few adjustments on the harvesting equipment around small grains. “The grain infrastructure, as it is, is robust and it will satisfy, but we're going to have to do some adaptation to that infrastructure,” he said. “As we start to scale the product into the hundreds of thousands of acres and into the millions of acres, it's super competitive; competitive enough that the investors we have are Bayer, Chevron and Bunge.”

Despite the challenges, both panelists expressed optimism about the growing market for sustainable fuels from both commercial and military aviation. Dr. Zhang noted, “We are very proud that my team actually got funding through the Department of Defense to research making SAF-qualified ethanol with feedstocks from Hawaii and tropical islands in the Pacific Ocean. We have the trust and we can do a good job for the future.”

The session also explored the timeline for adoption of SAF in aviation. Both panelists stressed that while the industry is still in its early stages, demand is strong and commitments from industrial partners are real. “We’re at the infancy of that shift,” Hedges said. “Every industrial company involved in aviation is committed, and the funding and innovation will help change the next generation of travel and fuel. As we start into that process of helping deliver on the demand, I can't even imagine how much different it's going be 10 years from now.”

Dr. Zhang emphasized the importance of progress for future generations, noting that, as a mother of two, she can see ahead how the next generation will benefit from these changes. “It’s hard to predict exactly how quickly aviation fuels will evolve, but if you have the energy and talent to contribute to change, it feels good to be part of it,” she said.

Banker called attention to Avina Clean Hydrogen’s plan to develop a $280 million SAF facility in the Metro East. “We're eager to see that project moving forward and look forward to seeing what great new milestones lie ahead for today’s panelists and the rest of this burgeoning SAF industry.”

The Thailand Taxonomy is a national classification framework that divides economic activities into three tiers—green, amber, and red—based on their level of environmental sustainability. Currently, it applies to six key sectors that are major contributors to Thailand’s greenhouse gas emissions: energy, transport, agriculture, manufacturing, construction and real estate, and waste management. For businesses, the Thailand Taxonomy provides several advantages. It strengthens credibility with investors and trading partners by enabling firms to disclose the proportion of revenues and investments aligned with the Taxonomy. In addition, it offers a roadmap for companies to adjust their operations toward greater sustainability, thereby improving their access to sustainable finance. However, although adoption of the Taxonomy is still voluntary, its establishment brings both pressure and challenges for the private sector in two critical areas: (1) collecting and reporting business data consistent with the Taxonomy, and (2) transforming business models toward sustainability, including securing internationally recognized sustainability certifications.

Understanding the Thailand Taxonomy: A Standard for Classifying Sustainable Economic Activities

As the climate crisis intensifies, the world is accelerating its transition toward achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thailand is no exception, having publicly committed on the global stage to reach net-zero emissions by 2065. In response, the government has been advancing green legislation and regulations, such as the Climate Change Act and a carbon tax. At the same time, the private sector is increasingly proactive, responding to pressures from both domestic and international measures, including the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). As a result, we have seen more organizations setting net-zero targets and investing in carbon reduction projects, which has, in turn, fueled rapid growth in the green finance market that supports environmentally friendly investments.

Amid this expansion, the risk of greenwashing arises when businesses claim to be “green” without actually reducing their environmental impact. This makes it difficult for financial institutions, investors, and consumers to accurately identify genuinely sustainable activities. The Thailand Taxonomy was introduced as a tool to screen and classify environmentally sustainable economic activities, enhancing transparency in the sustainable finance market and supporting the country’s net-zero ambitions.

This article focuses on exploring the Thailand Taxonomy, which was most recently launched in May 2025, and evaluates its benefits, impacts, challenges, and opportunities for stakeholders across various economic sectors.

What is the Thailand Taxonomy?

The Thailand Taxonomy is a classification framework that defines and categorizes economic activities based on their environmental impact. It applies technical screening criteria to determine whether an activity qualifies as environmentally friendly.1/ While the Taxonomy primarily emphasizes environmental criteria, activities that align with it must also meet broader sustainability requirements, taking into account both environmental and social dimensions. Specifically:

Contribution to Environmental Objectives: Activities must make a substantial contribution to at least one of six environmental objectives, namely, (1) Climate Change Mitigation, (2) Climate Change Adaptation, (3) Sustainable Use and Protection of Water Resources, (4) Transition to a Circular Economy and Sustainable Resource Use, (5) Pollution Prevention and Control, and (6) Protection and Restoration of Ecosystems and Biodiversity.

Do No Significant Harm (DNSH): Activities must not cause significant adverse impacts on the remaining five environmental objectives.

Minimum Social Safeguards (MSS): Activities must uphold social considerations, including human rights, labor rights, community well-being, and cultural heritage, in line with international standards such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Core Conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

For instance, a wind power project may contribute significantly to reducing carbon emissions, yet if it generates excessive noise that disturbs wildlife or involves unfair labor practices, it will not qualify under DNSH and MSS. In such cases, the responsible entity must prepare and implement a remediation plan within three years; otherwise, the project will be considered non-aligned with the Taxonomy.

Assessing the Benefits and Impacts of the Thailand Taxonomy

Benefits

The Thailand Taxonomy serves as a tool for classifying the sustainability of economic activities, available for voluntary use by all sectors. It is expected to generate positive outcomes for businesses, the financial sector, and the country as a whole, including:

1. Businesses gain guidance for their transition and greater opportunities to access sustainable financing.

Businesses are likely to benefit from the Taxonomy in several ways, such as:

Improving corporate image through Taxonomy-aligned reporting: Companies can enhance their reputation by disclosing the proportion of revenues and expenditures aligned with the Taxonomy, potentially attracting sustainability-conscious investors, partners, and customers. For example, B.Grimm Power PCL reported that in 2024, although only 7% of its revenue came from green activities due to its traditional power plant structure, 67% of its capital expenditure (CapEx) was allocated to green initiatives, reflecting its commitment to clean energy technology development.3/

Guiding business transition towards sustainability: Organizations can use the Taxonomy as a roadmap for improving energy efficiency, reducing carbon intensity, managing supply chains, and encouraging partners to align with the defined criteria. Early adoption of sustainable practices also helps mitigate transition risks associated with increasingly stringent green regulations.

Opening doors to green business opportunities: The Taxonomy facilitates engagement in sectors such as electric vehicles and related infrastructure, renewable energy components, climate technology, and sustainability services, including carbon assessment, consulting, and verification, which are essential for demonstrating compliance with the Taxonomy.

Enhancing access to sustainable finance: Activities aligned with the Taxonomy are more likely to secure funding. Green activities—whether improving existing operations or investing in new projects—can access green loans or issue green bonds. Amber activities can also obtain transition loans or bonds. Furthermore, businesses could benefit from government-planned climate funds designed to support private sector investment in carbon-reducing technologies through loans or grants, with the Taxonomy expected to serve as a key eligibility criterion.

2. Financial sector receives a framework to assess risks and design sustainable financial products.

The financial sector can use the Taxonomy as a guide to design financial products that support the transition of Thai businesses and to develop strategies for funding companies aligned with the net zero pathway. For example, banks may review and adjust their lending portfolios to increase green financing, while investment funds may shift allocations toward businesses that comply with the Taxonomy. In addition, the Taxonomy serves as a common tool for effectively assessing risks associated with sustainable financial products and mitigating greenwashing, thereby supporting the sustainable growth of Thailand’s sustainable finance sector.

The sustainable finance market in Thailand has shown continuous growth. As of July 31, 2025, the outstanding value of ESG bonds4/ stood at THB 910 billion, nearly 40 times higher than in 2019 (Figure 4)5/, with more than half of this amount raised by the energy and transport sectors. However, ESG bonds still account for only 5.3% of total bonds6/, highlighting substantial room for further expansion, with the Taxonomy expected to play a key role in driving sustainable finance. This is reflected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) waiving registration fees for Sustainability-Linked Bonds (SLBs) aligned with the Thailand or ASEAN Taxonomy from June 1, 2025, to May 31, 20287/, which enhances the appeal of these financial instruments.

3. Thailand is equipped with a tool to drive the green economy and advance national sustainability goals.

Government agencies can design climate change regulations and policies based on the technical criteria of the Taxonomy. This tool also provides guidance for directing investments toward green businesses and low-carbon technologies. Together, these will help support the achievement of national sustainability targets, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30–40% from business-as-usual (BAU) levels by 2030, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2065.

Impacts and challenges

The Thailand Taxonomy creates impacts and challenges for various sectors in two main areas: (1) data collection and reporting, and (2) the transition toward sustainability, as outlined below.

1. Business data collection and reporting under the Taxonomy

Although adoption of the Thailand Taxonomy is currently voluntary, businesses may face peer pressure from other industry players to disclose information categorized by green, amber, and red activities. This includes reporting proportions of revenues, capital expenditure (CapEx), operating expenditure (OpEx), supplier shares, bank lending portfolios, and investment fund allocations. Furthermore, businesses may be subject to mandatory reporting obligations in the future, similar to those required under the EU Taxonomy.

In addition to financial reporting, businesses also face challenges in collecting technical environmental data required to demonstrate compliance with the Thailand Taxonomy. Such data include greenhouse gas emissions8/, the percentage of energy efficiency improvements, water savings, and information on compliance with social and labor standards. However, most Thai companies are still developing their carbon measurement capabilities. Among companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, only about half currently disclose carbon footprint data. Disclosure is most common in the energy, transport, and agribusiness sectors, while smaller firms report at roughly half the rate of larger firms.9/ As a result, the Taxonomy may exert pressure on businesses to invest in sustainability data collection processes, requiring financial resources and skilled personnel, which disproportionately affects smaller enterprises.

2. The business transition toward sustainability

Thai businesses are increasingly under pressure to align their operations with the high environmental and social standards set by the Taxonomy. This transition is expected to raise costs in two main areas: (1) investment in green technologies such as renewable energy, hydraulic cement, green steel, and low-emission rice farming, which remain more expensive than conventional, carbon-intensive alternatives—for example, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is currently priced at two to three times the cost of traditional jet fuel; and (2) obtaining sustainability certifications, which serve as proof of compliance with the Taxonomy criteria, particularly for companies in real estate and agriculture where certification provides a viable pathway to meeting the Taxonomy’s standards.

While the transition will initially be gradual, urgency will mount as Thailand approaches its climate commitments. In 2022, Thailand’s net greenhouse gas emissions—after accounting for forest carbon absorption—stood at 278 million tons of CO₂ equivalent (MtCO₂e).10/ This figure remains far from net zero and emissions are expected to continue rising in the post-COVID recovery (Figure 5).

At the sectoral level, each industry under the Taxonomy faces distinct transition challenges. Transport and industrial sectors continue to record rising emissions, whereas the energy sector shows a downward trend thanks to its growing reliance on renewables. Nonetheless, energy remains the highest-emitting sector and thus faces sustained pressure to decarbonize further. Agriculture poses another major challenge. It accounts for 17.9% of emissions—only behind energy and transport—and is characterized by a dominance of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which make up as much as 99.8% of the sector.11/

Ultimately, firms in sectors unable to transition (red) or only able to transition slowly (dark amber/brown) may find it difficult to remain competitive. Not only could access to finance become more constrained, but buyers and consumers are also likely to shift toward more sustainable alternatives.

Sectoral Deep Dive: Opportunities and Challenges under the Thailand Taxonomy

Because the classification of activities varies across economic sectors—depending on factors such as their significance in greenhouse gas emissions and the availability of green technologies—businesses under the Thailand Taxonomy face different opportunities and challenges. The sector-specific details are as follows:

Energy

The energy sector is the highest-emitting sector in Thailand, with electricity and heat production alone accounting for 21.4% of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, most activities under the Taxonomy focus on energy generation from various sources, as well as related activities such as storage, transmission, and distribution. A key criterion for classifying energy-sector activities is the greenhouse gas intensity per unit of energy produced. Green activities include electricity generation from solar, wind, marine, and waste heat. For natural gas, biomass, bioenergy, hydropower, and combined-heat-and-power plants, green classification requires meeting emission thresholds and/or other criteria, such as the feedstock used for bioenergy or the power density of hydropower plants.12/ Amber criteria generally require upgrading existing power plants to reduce carbon emissions in line with the net-zero transition pathway. Finally, activities involving fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, are classified as red.

The Taxonomy underscores that the energy sector must lead the transition to net zero, as reliance on carbon-intensive energy increases the indirect emissions of other sectors. This has driven a clear shift from fossil fuels toward renewable energy over recent years. Comparing commercial bank lending data from 2019 to 202413/ reveals a significant contraction in outstanding loans: coal mining fell by -41.5% (averaging -10.2% per year), and crude oil and natural gas extraction declined by -74.3% (-23.8% per year), reflecting the banking sector’s continued reduction of financial support for fossil fuels.

At the same time, energy companies demonstrate strong sustainability awareness, evidenced by their dominant share in the sustainable bond market—accounting for roughly 30% of total outstanding bonds—primarily from large players such as Global Power Synergy PCL (GPSC), Ratch Group PCL, and BCPG PCL. The Taxonomy not only pressures these businesses to accelerate their transition but also facilitates access to sustainable finance, particularly for renewable energy ventures that are poised for high growth amid rising global clean energy demand and are key targets for banking sector support. Nevertheless, renewable energy projects must comply with the Taxonomy’s comprehensive environmental criteria, including noise control for wind turbines and designing solar panels and other renewable energy systems for durability, ease of maintenance, and recyclability according to international standards.

Transport

The transport sector accounts for about one-fifth of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second-largest emitter after the energy sector. Accordingly, the Taxonomy applies carbon emission criteria and considers the availability of low-carbon technologies, which vary across different modes of transport. In general, green activities require the use of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hydrogen-powered vehicles14/, or the use of low-carbon fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while also prohibiting activities that support fossil fuel use. Amber activities typically set annual maximum carbon emission limits, which gradually decrease to zero by 2040 (Sunset Date) (Figure 7).

Within the transport sector, land transport businesses—such as passenger services, public transit, and freight—are expected to be most affected by the Thailand Taxonomy, as they collectively account for more than 96% of transport-related carbon emissions. This segment is also where low-carbon vehicle technologies have advanced the furthest, compelling businesses to transition toward ZEVs to remain aligned with the Taxonomy. The next most affected subsector is aviation, which ranks second in carbon emissions. Airlines are therefore encouraged to increase the use of SAF, even though its cost remains higher than conventional jet fuel. Nonetheless, this pressure may facilitate compliance with international aviation requirements such as CORSIA15/, which aims to reduce global aviation emissions. At the same time, businesses across various industries will find opportunities to invest in infrastructure that supports low-carbon transportation—spanning road, water, air, and rail.

In terms of sustainable finance activity, the transport sector has demonstrated significant momentum, ranking second only to the energy sector in sustainable bond issuance. Leading examples include BTS Group Holdings PCL and Bangkok Expressway and Metro PCL (BEM), both of which have leveraged the Taxonomy to access financing. For instance, BEM has applied the Taxonomy framework in issuing bonds and securing loans for the development of environmentally friendly transport systems, totaling more than THB 34 billion during 2021-2024.16/

Agriculture

Unlike other sectors, the classification of agricultural activities under the Thailand Taxonomy does not employ the traffic-light system. This is largely due to challenges in defining technical screening criteria—for example, measuring carbon emissions at the farm level—stemming from limitations in data availability and completeness. Instead, the Taxonomy applies a practice-based approach to assess sustainable agriculture. Currently, it covers eight subsectors: rice, sugarcane, oil palm, rubber, cassava, other crops, livestock, and aquaculture. For each subsector, sustainable practices are categorized into three levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced.17/ Farmers or project developers are required to adopt at least two practices, of which at least one must be intermediate or advanced. Projects may then proceed through either of two pathways:",https://www.krungsri.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-28 12:56:28.684715

One of the latest developments: jet fuel made from corn.

Corn-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) takes biofuels to a new level beyond ethanol production. It actually begins with ethanol, which is then enhanced via “Alcohol-to-Jet” pathways to form a fuel suitable for aviation.

According to the American Coalition for Ethanol, SAF is “a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel that could be used in today’s aircraft and immediately improve the environmental impact of flight.” Relying on renewable sources like corn, SAF is said to deliver equivalent performance to petroleum-based jet fuel with a fraction of its carbon footprint, and is suitable to use in today’s existing aircraft engines and infrastructure.

At an estimated 80% reduction in overall CO2 lifecycle emissions compared to fossil fuels, SAF promises to drive the “decarbonization” of air travel.

Like ethanol, corn-based SAF could yield massive quantities of co-products. The U.S. livestock industry is poised to embrace those resources, according to Dr. Kurt Rosentrater, Professor of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State University.

On a recent episode of The Dairy Podcast Show, Rosentrater noted that after just two decades, dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) have become a widely implemented staple in animal nutrition.

“When the ethanol industry was in its earliest stages, I remember having conversations with companies saying, ‘in a couple of years, we’re going to be dealing with 10 million tons of DDGS. What are we going to do with all of that? We’re going to have to burn it and landfill it,’” he recalled. “Well, right now we’re sitting at about 33-35 million tons per year, and we’re not landfilling it, we’re not burning it. We’re using it in beef, dairy, swine, fish, and pet foods, plus we’re exporting about a third of it.”

The disease is causing turmoil for farmers who have a large crop in the making. In some cases, a Hail Mary fungicide application at R4 up to early dent (R5) might make sense this season, say agronomists.

Butter plunged to a new year-to-date low, while cheese prices continue to bounce.

Rosentrater credited dairy and livestock nutritionists with optimizing ingredients like DDGS for a variety of species. At the same time, ethanol manufacturers have fine-tuned production practices to create more consistent, specialized, and high-quality co-products.

He expects that same ingenuity to prevail if corn (and also potentially soybeans) is channeled at a large scale into SAF production. “In the past few years, there has been a big push among lots of different organizations about the idea of the ‘circular economy,’” he shared. “I laugh at that, because, in agriculture, we’ve been doing the circular economy for generations.”

The first commercial-scale facility converting U.S. corn into SAF is currently slated to be in the dairy-boom state of South Dakota. Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 plant near Lake Preston, SD, is projected to produce an estimated annual 60 million gallons of SAF, plus an accompanying 1.32 billion pounds of protein and animal feed and 30 million pounds of corn oil.

Although the South Dakota plant was initially slated to begin production in 2025, delays in financing and carbon pipeline approval/access have stalled the project.

Still, proponents of SAF note that airlines have already made commitments to purchase sustainable fuels to offset their carbon footprints. And they argue that using only the starch fraction of corn for fuel, while preserving the protein and nutrients for livestock feed, helps negate “fuel-versus- fuel” debates.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/abdde3b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+4/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-farm-journal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F89%2F2d%2F4bbbc4e849dc96b3f7f4a590c76c%2Fadobestock-1222109492.jpeg,N,,2025-08-28 11:57:33.551709

The expansion of the Qantas Group’s largest ever fleet renewal programme will see 16 of the 20 additional A321XLRs configured with lie-flat Business seats and seat back entertainment screens to serve longer routes, including transcontinental services to and from Perth and short and medium haul international routes.

The new configuration A321XLRs will begin arriving in calendar year 2028, taking the airline’s total order for the next generation A321XLR to 48 aircraft.

The extended range of up to 8,700 kilometres is more than 3,000 kilometres further than the Boeing 737 it replaces and will enable Qantas to launch direct flights to destinations across South East Asia and the Pacific Islands that are not currently viable.

Qantas’ first two A321XLRs, which are configured for domestic and short haul international flying, are expected to start operating commercial flights in mid-September, making Qantas the first airline in the Asia Pacific to operate the aircraft type. The aircraft will initially operate on Sydney-Melbourne and Sydney-Perth and be progressively rolled out on other routes. By the end of this financial year Qantas will have seven of the aircraft type.

Jetstar’s A321XLRs will begin to arrive from calendar year 2027 and will be fitted with a two-class cabin to suit international travel.

Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson said the expansion of the A321XLR fleet represented a significant step in the Group’s fleet renewal programme: “Investing in new aircraft is one of the most significant ways that we can provide our customers with a better flying experience and these billion-dollar investments are possible because of our continued strong financial performance.

“These additional A321XLRs will accelerate the retirement of our 737 fleet and open up new opportunities for domestic and international travel, allowing us to reach destinations that aren’t possible with our current narrowbody fleet.

“Not only will the A321XLRs help us serve the corporate market travelling between Perth and the east coast of Australia, they will also allow us to expand flying on existing routes into South East Asia and open up new possibilities like Perth-India and Adelaide-Singapore.

“The lie-flat Business seats, seat back screens and fast and free Wi-Fi will provide a consistent premium experience for our customers who fly domestically with Qantas and connect onto our long haul services.

“All of the next generation aircraft joining our fleet benefit from longer range, more comfort, less noise, better economics and will improve how people travel around Australia and overseas. It also means we’re recruiting and training more pilots, cabin crew and engineers, creating opportunities for our people.”

Fleet Overview

The Group’s total firm aircraft order now stands at 214 aircraft, with 32 delivered as at 30th June, representing a multibillion dollar investment in renewing and growing Qantas and Jetstar’s fleet. In addition to these firm orders, the Group has additional purchase right options with Airbus and Boeing which provide flexibility for future growth.

The airline took delivery of 17 new aircraft in FY25. This increases to 20 new aircraft arriving this financial year and 29 in FY27, including 36 for Qantas, 10 for Jetstar and three for Qantas Freight.

The first Project Sunrise A350-1000ULR will move to Airbus’ final assembly line in October this year, with deliveries commencing from October 2026.

The introduction of new aircraft is already delivering significant improvements in customer satisfaction, as well as financial and fuel benefits for the Group.

Acceptance validates proven technical capability and production scale required for Clearinghouse qualification

Milestone positions Unifuel as a credible pathway towards 100% drop-in SAF for commercial airline adoption

As the global aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions while demand for air travel continues to grow, Universal Fuel Technologies' (Unifuel) Ethanol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced via the company’s Flexiforming technology has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse, which supports the technical evaluation of new aviation fuels, for qualification. This acceptance positions Unifuel among an exclusive group of companies advancing toward ASTM qualification, the essential gateway for new fuels to enter commercial aviation markets.

""The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse is an important validation of our Flexiforming technology and significantly derisks our road to approval for commercial use,"" said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. ""This advancement indicates that our SAF can meet the toughest performance standards without sacrificing scalability or quality, and has technical credibility in the eyes of industry experts.""

The ASTM D4054 evaluation process is the aviation industry’s framework for ensuring that new fuels can safely power aircraft engines. It includes multiple tiers of testing, data collection, and technical review by experts from leading aerospace companies. Acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse requires demonstrating, by independent testing, that a fuel is not only technically credible and can be produced at a meaningful scale, but also that it has met strict quality and safety criteria.

""We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,"" said Dr. Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director. ""This marks a significant milestone for Universal Fuel Technologies towards their goal of commercial acceptance.”

The acceptance follows a successful five-month pilot project where the company produced nearly 100 liters of sample material for four different SAF pathways under stable process conditions. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol, and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), into SAF. The samples then underwent comprehensive testing by Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Lab, the world-leading authority on SAF research.

""The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse confirms that Flexiforming can produce high-quality synthetic aviation turbine fuel with a clear route to ASTM qualification,"" said Denis Pchelintsev, Co-Founder of Universal Fuel Technologies. ""We're positioned to support the aviation industry's urgent need for cost-effective synthetic aviation turbine fuel that doesn't compromise on performance or safety.""

Following Unifuel’s D4054 Clearinghouse acceptance, the company will proceed with producing larger fuel samples for detailed Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing required for ASTM qualification. The initial qualification could come as soon as the end of 2026 as a blend component with fossil jet. From there, further testing is planned, with the goal of leading to a 100% drop-in fully synthetic jet fuel in the future.

Unifuel's advancement through the qualification process is supported by Flexiforming's unique capabilities, which upgrade various renewable feedstocks—including ethanol, methanol, renewable naphthas, and liquefied petroleum gas—into high-quality SAF. In ethanol-to-jet applications, Flexiforming uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other processes, cutting production costs by up to 50%. The technology is also valuable as a complementary process, upgrading low-value naphtha byproduct from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, creating new revenue opportunities for renewable fuel producers.

Que: WOG maintains a strong R&D culture, including pilot and demonstration units from bench-scale to onsite deployment.
Can you tell us about a standout pilot project that led to its commercial adoption, particularly in the renewable energy sector?
Ans: India presents a significant opportunity for various renewable energy technologies, with central and state governments now proactively supporting such initiatives through policy interventions.
Que: Given the evolving landscape of the circular economy and decarbonisation, what emerging technologies or market segments are you exploring next within renewable energy?","Que: Nearly half of WOG’s ~200 global projects convert industrial effluent into Bio-CNG. What is your roadmap to scale this model, both domestically and internationally?

Ans: Bio-CNG has a very promising future. Domestically, we are very bullish on Bio-CNG, and with supportive central and state government policies, we are planning multiple Bio-Methane/CNG plants in the country. On the international front, WOG has already delivered many successful biomethane plants.

Que: WOG’s five-pronged innovation suite includes Compressed Biogas, Biochar, Pyrolysis, Torrefaction, and Sewage-to-Hydrogen systems. Which of these technologies has shown the greatest commercial traction so far, and why?

Ans: Commercially, Bio-CNG is already being produced by many players, with close to 100 operational plants across the country. Among all options, torrefaction holds high potential due to the central government’s mandate on biomass-based fuel blending at TPPs and the presence of over 100 potential TPPs that will require this. Hard-to-abate CO₂-emitting sectors, such as steel, are already conducting trials with biochar to replace pulverised coal in blast furnaces and sintering plants. Sewage-to-hydrogen is still a work in progress, and the technology is expected to mature over the next 2–3 years.

Que: WOG’s end-to-end model, from feedstock assessment to off-take, is said to secure multiple revenue streams through energy, fertilisers, carbon credits, and compost. Could you share how this integrated approach enhances project viability and stakehold

Ans: This is a prime example of circularity. Biomass feedstock is valorised either as a renewable, carbon-neutral energy source through torrefaction, as carbon-dense biochar for industries seeking to replace fossil coal as much as possible, or sequestered back into the soil as organic fertiliser, enhancing soil organic carbon, improving water retention, and supporting nutrient uptake by plants, while earning carbon credits in the process. There is a revenue stream at every stage, whether from supplying renewable energy or returning it to the soil.

Que: WOG maintains a strong R&D culture, including pilot and demonstration units from bench-scale to onsite deployment. Can you tell us about a standout pilot project that led to its commercial adoption, particularly in the renewable energy sector?

Ans: Through its strong R&D and innovative process solutions culture, WOG has already addressed several industry challenges, including eliminating the use of millions of tonnes of acids in the textile industry, reducing 17 process steps to just 2 in the oil and gas industry, saving several million dollars in OPEX annually, and achieving over 90 percent conversion of organics into bio-methane/Bio-CNG. WOG is currently working on five major industry challenges in its R&D, with a primary focus on bioenergy and circularity solutions for the bioenergy sector. The company is also in the process of building the next generation of its R&D laboratory and technology centre.

Que: What is your roadmap for globalising your renewable energy footprint beyond India?

Ans: India presents a significant opportunity for various renewable energy technologies, with central and state governments now proactively supporting such initiatives through policy interventions. Many of these technologies, such as CBG using feedstocks like MSW and Napier grass; biochar through pyrolysis of multiple feedstocks including bamboo; torrefaction; green hydrogen; SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel); and SMF (Sustainable Marine Fuels) are under active consideration. Once the initial projects are successfully deployed, we are confident of replicating their success in overseas markets.

Que: Given the evolving landscape of the circular economy and decarbonisation, what emerging technologies or market segments are you exploring next within renewable energy?

Ans: The Indian government is committed to achieving a 50 percent contribution of renewable energy sources in the total energy basket by 2030. While the 20 percent ethanol blending target has already been met, the CBG industry is witnessing steady growth. The key now is to introduce technology interventions that improve yields and make the bottom line more attractive for investors. Replacing fossil coal with renewable, carbon-neutral fuel presents another promising opportunity. Just as the solar industry received an initial government push, similar support for biomass manufacturers could accelerate industry growth. With abundant and diverse agro-biomass available across the country, high-carbon-density biochar, both for sequestration and for replacing fossil fuel in the steel industry, emerges as another strong opportunity over the next 2–5 years.",https://www.energetica-india.net/images/entrevistas/Qr8FIKJQlKnYmskuic2Xa7lWENzz3Fj7KrGU9rekFFRqz1IqMipII.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 15:57:17.529890

In a significant step towards sustainable logistics, Shein has partnered with Lufthansa Cargo to reduce aviation emissions. This collaboration will see Shein use carbon credits linked to alternative aviation fuels within the next six months. At its core, the partnership aims to accelerate the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and explore wider solutions to cut carbon from global air freight.

The Memorandum of Understanding between the two companies signals a broader ambition to decarbonise transportation networks while making emissions tracking more credible and transparent.

How the Agreement Works

Lufthansa Cargo will issue certificates to Shein confirming its use of alternative aviation fuels. These certificates are aligned with independent verification standards, giving assurance that the fuels emit fewer greenhouse gases across their lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuel.

Although these fuels may not be physically powering flights carrying Shein goods, the certificates allow Shein to account for these reductions in its corporate reporting. Within six months, Shein plans to integrate these credits into its offsetting approach, while continuing to expand the partnership with longer term goals.

The Role of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

What is SAF

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable or waste-derived fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel. It is seen as the most viable near-term solution for reducing aviation emissions, especially for long-haul flights where electrification or hydrogen technologies remain years away.

Current Limitations

The uptake of SAF is limited by cost and supply. At present, it is several times more expensive than kerosene, and most flights only use small blends due to availability constraints. Still, industry experts see SAF as a critical bridge technology until other low-carbon propulsion systems mature.

Beyond the Fuel

SAF is part of a larger sustainability picture. Both Shein and Lufthansa have highlighted the need to combine fuel innovation with route optimisation, logistics efficiency, and a shift to lower carbon modes of transport such as rail and shipping when possible.

Addressing the Bigger Emissions Picture

While the SAF partnership is a visible step, Shein’s broader emissions profile reveals the scale of the challenge. Between 2021 and 2023, the company’s emissions rose sharply, with 96 percent of its footprint tied to purchased goods and upstream transport.

In response, Shein has developed a decarbonisation roadmap that includes:

Reducing air and trucking distances by optimising routes

Supporting trucking partners in adopting fuel-efficient vehicles

Increasing reliance on road and sea freight where possible

This strategy, developed with sustainability consultancy Anthesis Group, underlines the importance of a multi-pronged approach rather than reliance on a single solution.

Why This Matters for the Future of Aviation

Partnerships like the one between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo show how companies in very different sectors can collaborate to tackle complex sustainability challenges. Aviation is a hard-to-abate sector, and progress requires both industry leadership and collective responsibility across the supply chain.

This collaboration also highlights the importance of transparent emissions reporting. By aligning with third-party verification standards, companies can demonstrate progress in ways that build credibility and trust with regulators, partners, and consumers.

Conclusion

The partnership between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo is more than a business agreement. It reflects a growing recognition that sustainability in transport must be approached through collaboration, innovation, and accountability.

The use of sustainable aviation fuel certificates is a meaningful step, but it is only one part of the larger journey towards decarbonisation. By combining fuel innovation with smarter logistics, alternative modes of transport, and more rigorous reporting, companies can begin to chart a path towards a truly sustainable aviation future.

As the aviation and retail industries navigate this transition, the lessons from such partnerships will be essential for shaping strategies that balance economic growth with environmental responsibility.

In 2024, Brazil launched its National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) to promote SAF adoption in its energy mix.
NCGA says this naturally favors Brazil’s double-cropping of soybeans and corn while devaluing the lifecycle profile of the U.S. single-crop corn system.
The U.S. State Department objected, claiming the recommendation would “unfairly penalize” American farmers to Brazil’s benefit in global markets.
The goal would be to “eliminate the unjust and scientifically unfounded burden that Brazil’s model imposes on the competitiveness of U.S. exports.”","The Section 301 investigation—under which the U.S. can impose trade sanctions on foreign partners—may conclude within six months to a year, aligning with Brazil’s 2026 election calendar. In Brasília, government officials are convinced that tensions with the U.S. will persist through next year and could escalate further.

Some American business groups are using the investigation to increase pressure on Brazil. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), for instance, urged the Trump administration to intervene in a deal in which Anglo American is selling its nickel operations in Brazil to Chinese miner MMG, arguing the transaction would give China even greater control over global reserves of critical minerals.

Meanwhile, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is urging the USTR not only to demand compensation from Brazil for alleged losses in U.S. ethanol exports, but also to take aim at another perceived “threat”: Brazil’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program.

Ethanol has become a fixation for Donald Trump when discussing trade with Brazil and holds major political importance for Republicans. When Mr. Trump issued his executive order to prepare retaliation tariffs at the start of his administration, Brazil was the first country mentioned, and ethanol was the first product.

U.S. corn producers broadly argue that Brazil’s rapid agricultural expansion in recent years has been “partly driven by protectionist advantages and decades of neglect regarding deforestation” in the Amazon and the Cerrado, enabling Brazil to seize market share from American farmers.

Corn ethanol projects in Brazil reach R$23bn in new investments

Now, “on top of all that,” they view Brazil as a “serious threat” to the long-term competitiveness of U.S. exports in the emerging SAF market, which is seen as key to the global aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Brazil is viewed as a major potential supplier of the renewable fuel, which can be produced through various technologies.

In 2024, Brazil launched its National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) to promote SAF adoption in its energy mix. Airlines are required to increase SAF use by 1 percentage point annually until reaching 10% in 2036.

One U.S. complaint is that Brazil uses a carbon-neutral emissions model that assigns a premium to the lifecycle assessment of feedstocks from multiple crop cycles (main and second harvest) grown on formerly “degraded” pastureland. NCGA says this naturally favors Brazil’s double-cropping of soybeans and corn while devaluing the lifecycle profile of the U.S. single-crop corn system.

“Most concerning,” the group added, is that “unfortunately” Brazil has emerged as a central player in international standard-setting bodies for biofuels, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

As an example, they noted that earlier this year, ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) approved a recommendation on multi-cropping based on the Brazilian model. The U.S. State Department objected, claiming the recommendation would “unfairly penalize” American farmers to Brazil’s benefit in global markets.

U.S. producers fear that as international bodies and foreign markets—such as Japan and the European Union—begin to accept Brazil’s sustainability claims related to its multi-cropping systems, U.S. export competitiveness could be severely impacted. They warn of potential declines in the commercial value of American agricultural production and farmland, lost export revenue, reduced profits, and higher financing costs and risks for U.S. farmers and ethanol producers.

“That’s why the U.S. State Department raised objections with ICAO,” NCGA said. “The USTR should join the State Department’s efforts to address Brazil’s troubling influence in these international markets.”

The NCGA is proposing the creation of a U.S.-Brazil working group 90 days after the USTR’s investigation, aimed specifically at addressing emissions modeling in international forums. The goal would be to “eliminate the unjust and scientifically unfounded burden that Brazil’s model imposes on the competitiveness of U.S. exports.”",http://s.glbimg.com/en/ho/static/globocom2012/img/fb_marca.png,N,,2025-08-28 09:56:15.995617

Speaking in London, O’Leary said the industry is “dying a death” on sustainability and is unlikely to meet its 2030 SAF targets or the 2050 net zero goal.

The comments mark one of the bluntest rejections of mainstream climate policy by a major airline chief. While rivals like IAG, Lufthansa, and Delta tout biofuel investments, O’Leary doubled down on his view that SAF is a distraction. He argued that cost pressures and consumer demand will keep airlines focused on efficiency, not ideology.

Critics say such comments could undermine sector-wide efforts to decarbonize, especially as the EU prepares to mandate SAF blending. But O’Leary remains unmoved.

“Why would we spend more to go green,” he said, “when oil is about to get cheaper?”

“We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,” said Dr Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director.
These aromatics are necessary to replicate the energy density and fuel system compatibility of conventional fossil jet fuel.
Despite advances in technology, the path to widespread SAF adoption remains constrained by cost, feedstock availability, and the pace of regulatory approvals.
Current SAF production represents less than 0.5% of global jet fuel demand, leaving a vast gap to bridge as airlines and governments push for more.","A technology developed by California-based Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel) that upgrades renewable feedstocks into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has advanced through the initial qualification process which will support the fuel’s entry to commercial aviation markets.

The company’s ethanol-to-jet technology, known as Flexiforming, has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse, which supports the technical evaluation of new aviation fuels for qualification.

“The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse is an important validation of our Flexiforming technology and significantly derisks our road to approval for commercial use,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies.

The process is designed to assess the potential for new fuels to safely power aircraft engines. It involves several tiers of testing, data collection, and technical review by experts from leading aerospace companies.

“We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,” said Dr Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director.

Earlier this year, the company completed a five-month pilot project which produced nearly 100 litres of SAF using four different pathways including methanol and ethanol conversion before undergoing testing by Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab.

“The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise to proceed to full certification as aviation turbine fuel,” said Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Processor of the BSEL at Washington State University.

With its technology accepted, the company will go ahead with producing larger fuel samples for Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing required for full ASTM qualification.

“The initial qualification could come as soon as the end of 2026 as a blend component with fossil jet,” explained Denis Pchelintsev, Co-Founder of Unifuel. “From there, further testing is planned, with the goal of leading to a 100% drop-in fully synthetic jet fuel in the future.”

According to Unifuel, its technology uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other processes for ethanol-to-jet applications and could therefore cut costs by up to half.

The technology can also be used to upgrade low-value naphtha byproducts from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch processes into aromatic SAF, a type of jet fuel that is blended with synthetic aromatic kerosene or contains bio-based aromatics. These aromatics are necessary to replicate the energy density and fuel system compatibility of conventional fossil jet fuel.

Despite advances in technology, the path to widespread SAF adoption remains constrained by cost, feedstock availability, and the pace of regulatory approvals. Current SAF production represents less than 0.5% of global jet fuel demand, leaving a vast gap to bridge as airlines and governments push for more.

To accelerate market uptake, policies such as the US SAF Grand Challenge, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, and mandates in the UK and Japan are aiming to stimulate both production and demand through blending requirements, tax credits, and investment incentives.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2325764425.jpg",N,,2025-08-28 07:56:26.538854

The announcement was made at the 2025 Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois, where all equipment in the company’s Ride and Drive area is operating on B30, reports Chemanalyst.

Pierre Guyot, Senior Vice President of John Deere Power Systems, said the approval reflects the company’s push for renewable fuels. He noted that renewable fuels not only support a cleaner environment but also strengthen the agricultural economy, especially since many John Deere customers grow the crops used to make biodiesel.

The company has supported renewable fuels for decades. Tier 3/Stage III A and lower-tier engines are already cleared for biodiesel blends up to B100, while spark-ignition turf and utility machines can run on E10 ethanol. John Deere is also researching higher ethanol blends, including a concept 9.0L engine designed to run on near-pure ethanol (E98).

Industry leaders welcomed the move. Caleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association, called it a major boost for both farmers and rural communities, as higher biodiesel demand benefits soybean growers while offering cleaner fuel. Scott Fenwick, Technical Director of Clean Fuels Alliance America, said the approval reinforces biodiesel’s reliability and role in cutting emissions.

The airline reported underlying profit before tax of $2.39 billion, marking a 15% increase. Statutory profit after tax also rose by 28% to $1.61 billion. The Group's net capital expenditure saw a 22% increase, reaching $3.9 billion. Off the back of this, the airline has announced a final shareholder dividend of $250 million and a special dividend of $150 million, both fully franked. Additionally, Qantas has placed an order for 20 more A321XLR aircraft, with 16 of these featuring lie-flat business seats.

Approximately 25,000 non-executive employees across the Qantas Group are set to receive $1,000 of shares as part of a new share plan.

Highlights flagged by the airline for the year included Qantas and Jetstar achieving their best on-time performance since 2019, with Qantas being the most on-time major domestic airline for FY25. Qantas and Jetstar carried four million more customers during the year. Customer Net Promoter Scores for Qantas increased by 10 points, while Jetstar's score rose by 6 points.

Qantas Loyalty achieved 9% underlying EBIT growth to $556 million, with increased member engagement and a record number of Flight Reward Seats booked. Cash inflows from a growing list of partners also grew 10%. Hotels, Holidays and Tour bookings achieved double-digit growth in total transaction value to $1.5 billion, which includes an increase of more than 50 per cent in TripADeal bookings.

Hudson highlighted the company's focus on delivery and improving performance for customers, people, and shareholders. The list of customer-focused initiatives included the arrival of 17 new aircraft and operational improvements, which helped deliver better on-time performance.

""For everyone across the Qantas Group, this year has been all about delivery. While we are pleased with the progress we are making, we remain focused on further improving our performance and continuing to deliver for our customers, people and shareholders,"" she said.

""Continuing strong demand across all market segments, combined with our dual brand strategy, helped the Group grow earnings. Qantas and Jetstar carried four million more customers during the year, while our Loyalty business grew as frequent flyers engaged with the program more than ever before.""

This is despite a cyber incident in June affecting 5.7 million Qantas customers, compromising some personal data. Qantas also reached an out-of-court settlement with the Union for $120 million in compensation for former employees affected by the outsourcing of ground handling in 2020.

Internationally, sustained growth in demand for international travel and the addition of new routes helped Group International achieve a 20 per cent improvement in Underlying EBIT to $903 million. Qantas International capacity increased by 6% over the period, with strong demand for premium cabins and a 2 percentage point increase in seat factors across First, Business, and Premium Economy cabins.

Jetstar also experienced a significant year with fleet renewal boosting earnings and providing value for customers, Hudson continued. Jetstar carried around 25 per cent more customers internationally to and from Australia than the prior yea and a record 16 million passengers domestically, helping it deliver a 55 per cent increase in Underlying EBIT.

""In a high cost of living environment, Jetstar continued to provide value for customers, with around one in three travelling for under $100,"" Hudson said. This was enabled by new aircraft, strong demand which helped increase seat factor by 2 percentage points and lower fuel prices. New aircraft also provided customer benefits including inflight streaming and more onboard baggage space. Jetstar launched 11 new international routes supported by the delivery of the new A321LR and A320neo aircraft.

Qantas Domestic unit revenue increased by 5%, with charter revenue up 9% due to additional Airbus A319 aircraft servicing the resources market in Western Australia. Overall, Group Domestic delivered $1.52 billion in Underlying EBIT, up 12 per cent from the prior year, at a margin of 14 per cent.

Hudson said new aircraft investment would further improve operational performance and customer satisfaction. Qantas Link has also received five new A220s, expected to deliver up to $9 million additional annual EBITDA benefit per aircraft over the 717 aircraft they replaced.

The first two A321XLRs are expected to enter service on Qantas' domestic network in mid-September, making it the first airline in the Asia Pacific to operate this aircraft type.

Qantas ended the year with $12.2 billion of liquidity, including $2.2 billion in cash and $1.4 billion in committed undrawn facilities. Net debt increased to $5.0 billion, remaining below the middle of the Group's target range.

""Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about,"" said Hudson. The first A350-1000ULR for Project Sunrise is progressing, with delivery expected in October 2026 and the first non-stop ultra-long-haul commercial flight planned for the first half of 2027.

""This year will see an acceleration of Qantas’ domestic fleet renewal and in the coming years we’ll take delivery of additional A321XLR aircraft fitted with lie-flat Business seats. We will also be using more Sustainable Aviation Fuel from overseas airports while we continue efforts with Government and industry to establish a SAF industry in Australia.""

Middle East gasoline market braces for tight supply

Middle East gasoline market braces for tight supply

Singapore, 28 August (Argus) — A heavy refinery turnaround season in the Mideast Gulf is expected to exacerbate an already tight gasoline market in the fourth quarter, prompting key regional suppliers to boost imports. Saudi Arabia, which has already shut down two of its refineries, is preparing to take additional facilities off line in the coming months. Aramco's 460,000 b/d Satorp refinery in Jubail is due for a 60-day shutdown in November-December, while maintenance is also planned at the Riyadh refinery in the fourth quarter, though details have not been officially confirmed. The upcoming turnaround plans come on the back of earlier maintenances at Aramco's facilities, including the 400,000 b/d Jizan refinery, where the reformer unit was taken off line since July, although the unit is expected to come back on line this month. Around four to five MR-sized gasoline cargoes from Jizan heads to Asia Pacific because of restrictions around specifications, traders said. The heavy turnaround season in the Mideast Gulf also coincides with a period of increased off line refinery capacity in Asia-Pacific, which has tightened the regional supply balances . Adding to the supply strain, Aramco's 400,000 b/d Yasref refinery in Yanbu — a joint-venture with Sinopec — is currently operating its reformer at reduced rates. Kuwait's state-owned Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) also plans to shut several units at its 490,000 b/d Mina Abdullah (MAB) refinery for a 30-day maintenance period starting 1 October. Additional pressure may come from India, where the end of the monsoon season is expected to boost domestic demand, further reducing export volumes. The Argus MEBOB crack spread, which reflects 92R oxygenated cargoes trading from the Mideast Gulf, has mirrored the bullish sentiment, increasing to $11.84/bl on 27 August from $11.72/bl on 26 August. Premiums for gasoline cargoes offered by Mideast Gulf refineries have strengthened, with Pakistan's state-owned refiner PSO — a major gasoline importer in south Asia — receiving offers at premiums of $7–12/bl to the Mideast Gulf 92R spot assessment for cargoes loading for July-September. This compares to offers in the $5–6/bl range earlier in the year. The Argus assessed 92R Mideast Gulf gasoline premiums have averaged $5.91/bl and $5.71/bl in July and June, respectively. This is up from a monthly average of $4.17/bl in May and $3.50/bl in April. The latest EU sanctions on India's Nayara energy, a regular supplier to Aramco, has temporarily disrupted the company's access to at least one cargo per month. Nayara Energy has resumed gasoline exports, but the recent cargoes are heading to Oman's Sohar, traders said. The firm has also cut run rates at its 400,000 b/d Vadinar refinery after it became increasingly difficult to send products to both domestic and export markets. Turning to alternative sources With regional output lagging, the Mideast Gulf is increasingly turning to Europe and Asia to fill the gap. Imports of gasoline from northwest Europe to Mideast Gulf surged to a seven-month high in July, according to ship-tracking data from Vortexa. A total of 291,000t of gasoline — roughly 78,000 b/d — arrived in Saudi Arabia from European ports, the highest volume since December 2024. The Mideast Gulf's overall gasoline imports also jumped to 1.03mn t in July, up by 35pc from June, marking the highest monthly volume since January. Imports remain elevated in August, indicating continued shortfalls in domestic output. Saudi Arabia has sharply increased its gasoline imports, bringing in 478,000t of the motor fuel in July compared to just 144,000t in June. The UAE has also stepped up its buying, importing 864,000t in August so far, already surpassing the 648,000t received in July. Meanwhile, operational issues at Nigeria's 650,000 b/d Dangote refinery are likely to persist until early September. The refinery had previously supplied two LR cargoes to the Mideast Gulf region when the markets were tight in June-July. If economics align and its residual fluid catalytic cracker (RFCC) issues are resolved, flows from Dangote could emerge — but that remains uncertain for now.

Synkka declined to share valuation or round size with TFN, saying only that the priority was securing investors with direct industry experience rather than setting early financial benchmarks.

Bringing an automated AI workforce to the parcel delivery

Synkka was founded this year by Torbjörn Maaherra (CEO), Jordon Cornish (Chief Growth Officer) and Danylo Topchii (CTO). Maaherra spent more than a decade in parcel technology at companies including Einride, Centiro, and Australia Post Global, where he says he witnessed the inefficiencies of human-heavy processes firsthand. Cornish brings experience scaling venture-backed SaaS startups such as Affinity and Showpad, while Topchii has led AI development at LooqMe and Shares, with a focus on agentic AI systems.

The motivation was a direct response to a growth-killing rule that has governed the parcel delivery industry for decades: to scale your operation, you must scale your headcount.

Cornish shares with TFN, “Our founder, Torbjorn Maaherra, witnessed this firsthand for over ten years while building a parcel delivery technology. He recognised that this model of manual labour has become a permanent tax on growth for any ambitious company. They employ unnecessary headcount, which can now be automated. Synkka was founded not just to fix this, but to end it entirely by building the automated workforce for the future of Parcel Delivery.”

An AI-powered digital team

Synkka’s first product, the AI Carrier Integration Team, is pitched as a fully digital replacement for one of the costliest functions in parcel operations: connecting companies technically to delivery partners. What typically takes months of technical setup can, according to the company, be reduced to days, with costs cut by up to 60%.

Unlike workflow automation software that streamlines tasks but still expects human oversight, Synkka positions its agents as complete replacements for specific roles. That means the real competitor, in its view, isn’t other startups but the internal integration, QA and support teams that companies currently maintain.

The integration product is only the first step. Synkka’s roadmap includes launching AI teams to handle customer support, financial reconciliation, client onboarding and even claims management.

Cornish concludes: “The roadmap includes deploying a full suite of AI teams to manage the most challenging roles in parcel delivery, from technical support and client implementation to financial reconciliation. The ultimate objective over the next five years is to provide the intelligent, automated workforces required to run an entire delivery operation automatically.”",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Synkka-platform-1.png,N,,2025-08-28 07:56:47.195720

The clean manufacturing sector saw a 15% and 19% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2025 and the second quarter of 2024, respectively.
Battery manufacturing specifically is down 22% compared to the same period last year, and solar manufacturing is down 25%.
Another $5 billion projects were cancelled in the clean electricity and decarbonization sectors.

The second quarter of 2025 saw a total of $68 billion in investments, according to a new report released today by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Rhodium Group and MIT’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. The number represents a 1% increase compared to the same period last year — but it is the third consecutive quarterly decline recorded since President Trump was elected in November 2024.

Investment in manufacturing, in particular, is in decline. The clean manufacturing sector saw a 15% and 19% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2025 and the second quarter of 2024, respectively. Battery manufacturing specifically is down 22% compared to the same period last year, and solar manufacturing is down 25%.

Between April and June, companies canceled the equivalent of $5 billion in manufacturing projects; that’s in addition to the record $7 billion in cancellations that occurred during the first quarter of the year, mostly in electric vehicles and battery manufacturing. Another $5 billion projects were cancelled in the clean electricity and decarbonization sectors.

These findings mirror those of other recent reports, including an analysis by research group E2, which found that at least 35 clean energy projects have been closed, cancelled, or downsized since Trump took office, more than the totals for 2023 and 2024 combined.

And at least in manufacturing, these cancellations are not being offset by new projects. Companies announced only $4 billion in new projects in the second quarter of 2025, marking the first quarter when the value of cancellations exceeded new announcements.

Generally, the report also found a decrease in new project announcements across all sectors. Compared to last year, the average number of new announced projects per quarter was down 44% for manufacturing, 38% for industrial decarbonization, and 28% for utility electricity.

$517 billion on the line

The report provides a snapshot of how the clean energy sector is faring after months of policy uncertainty that culminated in the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill into law in early July. The slowdown in growth, however, is likely to persist, given that the new legislation slashed clean energy subsidies, shortened tax incentives eligibility timelines for qualifying projects, and introduced new “foreign entity of concern” rules restricting sourcing.

These measures are bound to impact $517 billion in outstanding investments in clean energy and transportation projects that are not yet online, according to the report.

Of those, $112 billion are manufacturing investments, heavily concentrated in the EV supply chain, including batteries and critical minerals projects. These will probably suffer from the addition of FEOC rules, as well as from the loss of federal tax credits for the purchase of new and used EVs. Meanwhile, $171 billion are outstanding solar and wind investments, which are now obliged to either start construction by July 2026 or else come online before 2027 to still be eligible for credits.

Technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen have received more favorable treatment from the current administration. Still, outstanding projects in those categories are also likely to be impacted by the changes in policy, with $56 billion in SAF projects having to source feedstock from within North America starting in 2026 to qualify for credits, and $47 billion in hydrogen projects having to start construction by the end of 2027.",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-08-27T172428.236.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-28 00:56:13.359404

Investment Advice: Navigating the ESG Maze For ESG-aligned investors, the Delta case offers three lessons: 1.
Conclusion Delta's fuel dump settlement and carbon neutrality litigation exemplify the challenges of integrating ESG into traditional industries.","In 2020, Delta Air Lines faced a crisis that exposed the fragile balance between operational safety and environmental responsibility. A fuel dump over Los Angeles, intended to reduce risk during an emergency landing, left a trail of controversy. The airline's $78.75 million settlement to resolve claims of property damage and health impacts has since become a case study in how regulatory and reputational risks are reshaping airline valuations and ESG-aligned investment strategies.

The Incident and Its Aftermath

On January 14, 2020, Delta Flight 89 jettisoned 15,000 pounds of jet fuel over densely populated areas after an engine failure. While the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cleared the pilots of wrongdoing, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) cited Delta for environmental violations, accusing the airline of exposing communities to harmful pollutants. The settlement, now pending judicial approval, allocates $50.6 million to affected residents and property owners. Beyond the financial toll, the incident raised questions about Delta's adherence to sustainable practices, particularly as the airline markets itself as a leader in decarbonization.

ESG Investing Under Scrutiny

The fuel dump settlement intersects with another high-profile legal challenge: a class-action lawsuit alleging Delta's “carbon-neutral” claims are misleading. Critics argue the airline's reliance on carbon offsets—criticized for inaccuracy and impermanence—fails to address its true emissions. This case, alongside similar lawsuits against United and American Airlines, underscores a growing skepticism toward corporate ESG claims. Investors are increasingly demanding verifiable, science-based targets rather than voluntary offsets.

Regulatory and Reputational Risks

Regulatory shifts are amplifying these risks. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signaled a narrower view of ESG disclosures, while state-level lawsuits, such as those targeting asset managers for ESG-driven divestment from coal, hint at broader political resistance. For airlines, the Spence v. American Airlines case—where a court ruled ESG investing in employee retirement plans breached fiduciary duties—sets a precedent that could deter companies from prioritizing non-pecuniary ESG goals.

Reputational damage, meanwhile, is harder to quantify but equally impactful. A 2024 academic study found that ESG misalignment can erode firm value by undermining trust. Delta's dual legal battles—over environmental claims and seat transparency—risk tarnishing its brand, particularly as consumers and investors grow more discerning.

Implications for Airline Valuations

The aviation sector's ESG transition is fraught with contradictions. While Delta invests in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fuel-efficient aircraft, incidents like the fuel dump highlight the gap between ambition and execution. For investors, the key question is whether airlines can align their ESG strategies with financial performance.

Data shows a divergence: airlines with robust ESG frameworks, such as Southwest and Alaska, have seen valuation premiums, while those facing greenwashing allegations lag. Delta's recent 25% dividend hike—a signal of financial resilience—may offset some reputational damage, but long-term credibility hinges on transparency.

Investment Advice: Navigating the ESG Maze

For ESG-aligned investors, the Delta case offers three lessons:

1. Demand Accountability: Scrutinize companies' use of carbon offsets and ensure they prioritize direct emissions reductions (Scope 1 and 2).

2. Monitor Regulatory Trends: The SEC's evolving stance on ESG disclosures could reshape airline valuations.

3. Balance ESG and Financial Metrics: While ESG criteria enhance risk management, they must align with profitability. Airlines like Delta that blend innovation (e.g., blended-wing-body aircraft) with tangible sustainability goals may outperform peers.

Conclusion

Delta's fuel dump settlement and carbon neutrality litigation exemplify the challenges of integrating ESG into traditional industries. As regulatory scrutiny intensifies and consumer expectations evolve, airlines must prove their ESG commitments are more than marketing tools. For investors, the path forward lies in rigorous due diligence—favoring companies that marry sustainability with verifiable financial returns. In an era where reputational risks can eclipse operational ones, the aviation sector's ESG journey is far from over.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 22:56:08.490168

As the aviation industry continues its recovery, Qantas is not just riding the wave—it's leading it.","The aviation sector, once battered by pandemic-era disruptions, is witnessing a renaissance driven by pent-up demand, shifting consumer preferences, and technological advancements. At the forefront of this recovery is Qantas Airways, whose Fiscal 2025 (FY25) earnings report underscores its resilience and strategic agility. With an underlying profit before tax of A$2.39 billion—the second-highest in its history—Qantas has not only outperformed expectations but also demonstrated how a diversified business model, loyalty program innovation, and disciplined capital allocation can create enduring shareholder value.

Profitability: A Dual-Brand Engine in a Post-Pandemic World

Qantas' FY25 results reflect a masterclass in balancing premium and budget operations. The Qantas Domestic segment generated A$1.52 billion in underlying EBIT, a 12% year-on-year increase, driven by a 5% rise in unit revenue and robust business travel demand. Meanwhile, Jetstar, the budget arm, delivered a staggering 55% surge in underlying EBIT, fueled by record domestic passenger numbers (16 million) and lower fuel costs. This dual-brand strategy allows Qantas to capture both high-margin premium travelers and price-sensitive customers, a critical advantage in an industry where demand volatility remains a risk.

The airline's international segment also rebounded strongly, with A$903 million in underlying EBIT—a 20% increase—supported by the return of the A380 aircraft and a 6% capacity expansion. Notably, unit revenue turned positive in the fourth quarter, a rare feat in the post-pandemic landscape where many carriers still grapple with pricing pressures.

Market Diversification: From Domestic Dominance to Global Ambitions

Qantas' strategic diversification extends beyond its brand portfolio. Domestically, the airline is modernizing its fleet with 20 new Airbus A321XLR aircraft, which will enhance efficiency and capacity. Internationally, the Project Sunrise initiative—aimed at launching non-stop ultra-long-haul flights to London and New York—represents a bold bet on future demand. The first A350-1000ULR aircraft is set to enter production in October 2025, with inaugural flights expected by early 2027. This move positions Qantas to capitalize on the growing appetite for direct transcontinental travel, a trend accelerated by the rise of ultra-long-haul aircraft.

The airline's expansion isn't limited to aircraft. Jetstar added 11 new international routes in FY25, carrying 25% more international passengers than the prior year. This geographic diversification reduces reliance on any single market and insulates Qantas from regional economic shocks.

Loyalty Program: A Goldmine for Retention and Revenue

The Qantas Loyalty program is a standout asset, generating A$556 million in underlying EBIT—a 9% increase. With 10% more frequent flyer points earned and 8% more redemptions, the program's success lies in its ability to monetize customer loyalty. The introduction of Classic Plus, which allows members to book reward seats for a fixed number of points, has been a game-changer. Over one million seats were booked under this product in FY25, proving that innovation in loyalty programs can drive both engagement and profitability.

Partnerships with major Australian brands like Woolworths Group and David Jones further strengthen the program's value proposition. These alliances expand the program's reach and create cross-industry revenue streams, a critical differentiator in an era where customer retention is paramount.

Strategic Positioning: Sustainability, Employee Engagement, and Capital Discipline

Qantas' long-term success hinges on its ability to balance growth with sustainability. The airline's $400 million Climate Fund and commitment to using 100 million liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) over three years align with global decarbonization goals. These initiatives not only mitigate regulatory risks but also appeal to environmentally conscious travelers, a growing demographic.

Employee engagement has also improved, with a 7 percentage point increase in satisfaction scores, placing Qantas 4 points above the global industry average. A new employee share plan and a $1,000 “Thank You” payment to 25,000 non-executive employees underscore the airline's focus on workforce retention—a critical factor in an industry plagued by labor shortages.

Financially, Qantas remains disciplined, with $12.2 billion in liquidity and net debt within its target range. The airline's ability to return A$400 million in dividends—including a special payout for the first time since 2000—demonstrates confidence in its cash flow generation and long-term stability.

Investment Thesis: A Compelling Case for the Long-Term

Qantas' FY25 results highlight a company that is not only surviving the post-pandemic landscape but thriving. Its dual-brand strategy, fleet modernization, and loyalty program innovation create a moat against competitors. The airline's focus on sustainability and employee engagement further insulates it from regulatory and operational risks.

For investors, Qantas offers a rare combination of strong earnings growth, dividend resilience, and strategic foresight. With a 3% to 5% projected increase in domestic unit revenue and 2% to 3% growth in international unit revenue for FY26, the airline is well-positioned to outperform industry peers. The Project Sunrise initiative and A321XLR fleet rollout represent long-term value drivers, while the loyalty program's scalability ensures recurring revenue streams.

Washington, DC, Aug. 27, 2025 – The most important developments shaping business aviation’s path to net-zero carbon emissions will be in the spotlight when industry leaders gather for the 2025 National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE), taking place Oct. 14-16 in Las Vegas.

The show will once again include a Business Aviation Sustainability Summit, taking place Oct. 14 and 15, with education sessions dedicated to taking a deeper look at the most pressing issues facing the industry.

For example, Congress has remained active on policy proposals for incentivizing the production, availability and uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can reduce business aircraft emissions by up to 80% over legacy fuels.

One recently passed congressional budget bill includes an additional two-year extension of the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit incentivizing production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to 2031; another bill under consideration would expand alternative fuels research.

On the regulatory front, the certification of low- or zero-emissions advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft is drawing closer to reality, since the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) release at last year’s convention of a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) to establish requirements for the safe, efficient integration of the next-generation aircraft into the nation’s aviation system.

As the industry continues innovating toward its sustainability aims, NBAA-BACE offers a vital opportunity for the business aviation community to come together, highlight recent breakthroughs, and chart the path forward for an even more sustainable future, “As the industry continues innovating toward its sustainability aims, NBAA-BACE offers a vital opportunity for the business aviation community to come together, highlight recent breakthroughs, and chart the path forward for an even more sustainable future,” said NBAA Senior Director, Environmental and Technical Operations Stewart D’Leon.

“We have demonstrated that by only re-routing a very small subset of those flights we could have a very significant impact.
This body of activity within the industry, despite the various uncertainties that remain, is enough to ­encourage those seeking action on aviation’s non-CO2 impact that momentum is increasing.","There is a cruel irony that one of the most visible parts of aviation’s impact on the ­environment has been one of the hardest to pin down in terms of its exact nature and the action required to mitigate its climate effect.

Contrails form the biggest part of the bucket of non-carbon dioxide (CO2) environmental impacts resulting from ­aviation, alongside nitrogen oxide, sulphur oxide, and soot particles.

But while contrails can often be seen with the naked eye, the science behind their formation and environmental impact is far less clear.

“The formation, persistence, and spread of contrails into cirrus clouds are subject to significant uncertainties,” writes KPMG, in a wide-ranging report on aviation’s non-CO2 impacts commissioned by the UK Department for Transport and co-produced with Cranfield University and SATAVIA (now part of GE Aerospace unit Aerospace Carbon Solutions).

“Factors such as the exact composition of aircraft exhaust, atmospheric humidity, and ambient temperature play critical roles in contrail development,” it adds.

Contrails are formed when an aircraft passes through Ice ­Super Saturated Regions (ISSRs), where water ­droplets emitted from the engine freeze. Around one in 20 flights is estimated to generate persistent ­contrails, which can last for several hours.

Persistent contrails can develop into cirrus clouds, which have a warming or cooling effect on the planet – either trapping hot air in, or reflecting sunlight away. While there is broadly consensus that there is a net warming effect from contrails, particularly at night when there is no sun to reflect heat away, agreement is harder to find on the exact impact and timeframe over which that should be considered.

SCIENTIFIC PICTURE

Speaking during a panel debate on the issue of ­contrails during the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) Sustainability Conference in June, Mark Stettler, professor of transport and environment at Imperial College London, said that despite the ­uncertainties there is a clear scientific picture.

“It is true that there are remaining and persisting uncertainties in the overall magnitude of the ­effect from contrails,” he says. “But it’s also true the ­uncertainty bar – even if you take the lowest point on that – is still a significant part of aviation’s ­climate impact.

“The opportunity is very significant,” he adds. “If we were to be able to avoid forming contrails then we would get rid of [not only] a very significant proportion of aviation’s climate impact, but also a very significant proportion of the earth anthropogenic impact on the climate.”

While CO2 effects have an accumulated impact, the short lifespan of contrails means the warming effect would be wiped out if they could be avoided.

Targets are in place to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, along with European mandates on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use, but so far there is limited regulation in place for non-CO2 emissions.

However, since the start of this year, a requirement for airlines to report their non-CO2 emissions was added to the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS). Initially mandated on all flights within the European Economic Area (EEA) – as well as Switzerland and the UK – airlines must provide the data under the Monitor, Report & Verify programme.

That will be expanded to flights from the EEA to third countries from 2027, although airlines can ­p­rovide that data on a voluntary basis before then.

That regulators in Europe are looking at non-CO2 emissions is unsurprising, given the EU’s track record of pushing environmental legislation and since Europe has relatively high levels of contrail formation.

Airline bodies though flag the risk of regulating without further understanding of the issues.

In a position paper, IATA says including non-CO2 provisions in the EU ETS or other such schemes is “premature”. It argues that in the absence of “accurate measurements and commercially available solutions”, to do so risks creating market distortions, adding operational complexity, reducing connectivity and producing negative climate-related trade-offs.

DEEPER UNDERSTANDING

IATA, which has been calling for “urgent action” to deepen understanding into contrails and their impact, is partnering with various stakeholders to research how to monitor and report non-CO2 emissions.

One moving part in the analysis is understanding what improvements in aircraft and engine technology, and a move to different fuel types like SAF, mean for non-CO2 emissions.

Industry partners have come together on several projects that have included research to better understand the impact of SAF on contrail formation. These include Boeing’s second Explorer Ecodemonstrator, a 737 Max 10 for United Airlines, in late 2023, and the ECLIF3 and VOLCAN flight test projects on Airbus narrowbody and A350 aircraft respectively.

Airbus says indications are there is an up to 25% reduction in ice-crystal formation from using SAF, but more research is needed. It has now teamed with engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, German aerospace research centre DLR, SAF specialist Neste, and several universities on the EU-funded PACIFIC project. This will further study the impact of fuels and the engine cycle on non-CO2 emissions.

The airframer, which remains an advocate for hydrogen power in the long term, has used a hydrogen-powered modified glider to study contrails produced by these propulsion systems. It hopes to report data from the Airbus UpNext Blue Condor project this year.

Other recent contrail research initiatives include by GE Aerospace, which was a partner on both the Boeing Ecodemonstrator and the ECLIF and VOLCAN Airbus projects, last November teaming with NASA and the DLR on the contrail optical depth experiment (CODEX) project. These flights involved NASA’s Gulfstream III research aircraft trailing GE’s 747 flying testbed and scanning its wake with LiDAR sensors.

“Teams were able to collect 3D imaging on ­contrails from all four CF6 engines using LiDAR at a ­variety of distances, as well as data on the surrounding ­atmospheric conditions to assist in calibrating ­predictive models,” says GE.

“More detailed LiDAR imaging helps improve ­understanding of how contrails form and behave over time. Also, the optical depth can be used to estimate their net warming effect,” it says. “When combined with the detailed atmospheric data gathered by onboard sensors and radio drops, the accuracy of contrail predictive models is improved.”

GE adds that learnings from CODEX are being applied to new combustion and engine technologies in its RISE programme to reduce non-CO2 emissions.

There also has been ongoing research and trials around contrail avoidance, particularly through ­altering flight altitudes.

Eurocontrol’s Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC), which manages the upper airspace over ­Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and ­northwest Germany, was the first to carry out a ­large-scale operational contrail mitigation trial in 2021, conducted during the night across all MUAC airspace in collaboration with the DLR.

The effort concluded that contrails could be prevented by taking practical measures such as adjusting the flight level of an aircraft, and highlighted that further research was necessary in areas including enhanced weather predictions and more automated ­decision-making processes.

MUAC has since conducted the first large-scale, ­real-time contrail prevention simulation comparing two operational concepts: mitigation by airlines through flight planning around contrail areas; and tactical vertical clearances by air traffic controllers.

“While both options are possible, the preferred option is pre-planned contrail avoidance. If contrail avoidance is to be carried out during periods of high traffic, additional capacity will be required,” MUAC says.

It has also developed a ground camera system to monitor the effectiveness of weather forecasts in ­relation to contrail development and is partnering with Google to utilise this satellite imagery and ­artificial intelligence to predict regions where ­contrails may develop.

“This information is being used as part of an ­operational flight trial, allowing us to provide tactical clearances for contrail mitigation at night during summer and autumn 2025,” MUAC says.

Some of MUAC’s work has been done as part of the CICONIA programme, a three-year SESAR Joint Undertaking project looking into mitigating the impact of aviation’s non-CO2 emissions. The wide-ranging programme has 15 participants, including Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Swiss International Air Lines and UK air traffic management body NATS.

“We’ve got a number of validation exercises [that] are ongoing. We are starting to see some really good results from that,” Sian Andrews, SESAR environmental lead at NATS, said during the RAeS Sustainability Conference.

MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES

Much of the initial opportunity for contrail mitigation is on quieter periods, as there is more scope to make alterations. There is a particular focus on night flights, given that this is a quieter time for flight activity, and that it fits with the bigger environmental opportunity of mitigating contrails given there is no cooling effect from reflection at night.

“What we are looking at, as we have developed the concept of operations within CICONIA, is a kind of step one, where are saying when it is a bit easier, when the traffic density is a bit lower, what can we do? And we think we can do quite a bit, we can get some significant results, and we are maturing that,” says Andrews.

Work is also continuing on what can be done when traffic levels are busier, while Andrews points to the wider importance of addressing contrails over the North Atlantic in particular.

“The North Atlantic is a very strong case for contrail mitigation, partly because it is very ­susceptible to ISSRs and the amount of traffic that is passing over the North Atlantic, especially at night, is quite high,” she says.

French carrier Amelia has been working on contrail avoidance with Thales and Breakthrough Energy Contrails for the last year and has already delivered notable environmental savings.

“Just focusing on some Amelia flights for a few months, we have saved several hundred tonnes of equivalent CO2 through the contrails we have avoided generating,” explains Julien Lopez, head of green operations within Thales’s avionics division.

Amelia has been working with Thales since 2022 on first evaluating its wider environmental impact, and since last summer on contrail avoidance. After initially demonstrating that contrail mitigation could work on Amelia’s scheduled service between Paris and Valladolid in northern Spain, Thales subsequently automated the process and Amelia has since February been deploying it progressively across its flights.

“Now it is fully automatic other than there is still a manual dispatcher of every flight-plan optimisation we propose,” explains Lopez.

As of mid-May, contrail avoidance had been implemented on around 50 out of roughly 1,700 Amelia flights assessed. That is in line with wider data on the number of flights causing persistent contrails.

“Contrails are generated by a very small portion of flights, so you can modify only a small ­portion of flights and have a very significant impact on ­contrails and on the whole climate impact of ­aviation,” notes Lopez.

CLEAR BENEFIT

One of the challenges of changing flight plans is the additional fuel, and therefore CO2 emissions, ­incurred in the new routing. “Usually, based on all the mitigation we have made, extra fuel was in the range of less than 1%,” he says. “So, for the about 700t of CO2 equivalent saved, we have generated only 0.3t of extra CO2.”

Validation work is carried out after a flight, as the model is re-run using actual weather data rather than the forecast. “On average we lose about 10% of the benefits because of the lack of precision of the forecast data,” Lopez explains. “But when you consider the gain we can make, that is still very consistent.

“Clearly the next step is to move from a flight-­per-flight basis with a single airline to an airspace ­approach in a co-ordinated way with air traffic ­management and airlines,” he says.

This is where Thales’s work on another SESAR Joint Undertaking project, CONCERTO, has a role to play. The initiative, which covers nine countries in northern Europe and involves 23 partners, aims to develop solutions to reduce CO2 emissions and introduce the management of non-CO2 impacts into daily operations.

Lopez says that CONCERTO has, based on a ­large-scale simulation, validated an ­operational concept to make contrail avoidance feasible at an airspace level. “We have demonstrated that by only re-routing a very small subset of those flights we could have a very significant impact. It is very promising,” Lopez says, noting the results will be published shortly.

This body of activity within the industry, despite the various uncertainties that remain, is enough to ­encourage those seeking action on aviation’s non-CO2 impact that momentum is increasing.

“We have been talking about it for a long time,” noted Tim Johnson, director of UK NGO Aviation Environment Federation during a panel debate at the Airbus Summit in late March.

“It feels different this time. It feels like the ­momentum is not just within Europe, it seems to be global. The interest has spread to ICAO. I don’t think this time we’re going to go back, having spiked the ­public’s interest and having these operational ­responses and trials.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/1/8/3/112183_contrailscgeoffreyswaine_shutterstock_8253_crop.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 22:56:14.745299

LTD. and Velocys Inc. have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishing a strategic partnership to advance production technology for electro-sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF), a CO2-derived synthetic fuel. This partnership combines SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s CO2→CO chemical looping technology with Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch (FT) microchannel reactor technology to enable the manufacture of synthetic fuels using CO2 as a feedstock, thus contributing to decarbonization.

Background

CO2 emissions must be reduced across all industries to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The aviation industry accounts for approximately 2.6% of global CO2 emissions, and a key emission reduction measure that is gaining attention is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other organizations, 65% of CO2 reduction targets for the aviation industry can be achieved through the adoption of SAF. At present, conventional SAF is manufactured from waste oil and biomass-derived raw materials. However, considering the anticipated increase in SAF demand going forward, the early commencement and widespread adoption of e-SAF—which is manufactured from CO2 and hydrogen derived from renewable energy—is considered essential.

In this context, CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) technology, which converts CO2 into fuel and chemical products for practical use, is attracting attention. CCU technology enables the reuse of CO2 as a valuable resource and replaces fossil resources, thereby reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

Strengths of both companies

SEKISUI CHEMICAL is working to reduce global CO2 emissions through the social implementation of CCU technology. To date, it has developed a unique chemical looping technology that converts CO2 into CO with a high reaction yield (90% or higher).

Velocys has been developing FT reaction technology for the manufacture of synthetic fuels from synthetic gas (a mixture of CO and H2) converted from municipal waste, industrial waste, biomass, and CO2 for over 20 years. Its proprietary catalyst and microchannel reactor design have established productivity six to ten times higher than conventional FT reaction technology.

Collaboration overview

This project aims to establish a new e-SAF manufacturing technology by combining SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s proprietary CO2→CO chemical looping reaction technology, which achieves high reaction yields (90% or higher), with Velocys’ FT reaction technology (synthetic gas → synthetic fuel), which achieves high CO conversion rates (90–95%).

In the future, the two companies will work to establish a highly efficient e-SAF manufacturing technology using CO2 as a raw material, thereby contributing to the decarbonization of the aviation industry and the realization of a sustainable society.

“Continuing strong demand across all market segments, combined with our dual brand strategy, helped the Group grow earnings. Qantas and Jetstar carried four million more customers during the year, while our Loyalty business grew as frequent flyers engaged with the program more than ever before.

“Our strong financial performance is enabling significant investment in new aircraft and customer initiatives, helping deliver better operational performance and customer satisfaction across both airlines.

“Jetstar had a standout year, with its fleet renewal providing a significant boost to earnings. In a high cost of living environment, Jetstar continued to provide value for customers, with around one in three travelling for under $100.

“Despite the strong performance across the Group, we saw some costs rise above the rate of inflation, which reduced the benefits of lower fuel. Transformation remains a priority given ongoing increases in airport and government charges, engineering and supply chain costs and the impact of Same Job Same Pay legislation.

“I want to thank our people who serve our customers with passion every day. They are the real stars of our performance and we are introducing a new employee share plan so they can share in our success.

“As well as rewarding our employees, we have also resumed paying dividends. We have announced we will pay a base final dividend of $250 million and a special dividend of $150 million, taking dividends for the full year to $800 million.

“Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about. This year will see an acceleration of Qantas’ domestic fleet renewal and in the coming years we’ll take delivery of additional A321XLR aircraft fitted with lie-flat Business seats. We will also be using more Sustainable Aviation Fuel from overseas airports while we continue efforts with Government and industry to establish a SAF industry in Australia.

“Direct flights from the east coast of Australia to London and New York are also a step closer to reality, with the first Project Sunrise A350-1000ULR aircraft to enter the final assembly line in the coming months, and the first aircraft delivery expected in October next year.”

Group Domestic

The Group’s dual brand strategy continues to provide value for both the premium and low fares segments of the market, with Group Domestic delivering $1.52 billion in Underlying EBIT, up 12 per cent from the prior year, at a margin of 14 per cent.

Qantas Domestic unit revenue increased 5 per cent, comprising a 3.5 percentage point improvement from higher seat factors and increased business-purpose travel, plus 1.5 percentage points from yield improvements. Qantas’ charter revenue increased 9 per cent, helped by the arrival of five additional Airbus A319 aircraft during the year to service the resources market in Western Australia.

QantasLink also received five new A220s during the year, which are on track to deliver up to $9 million additional annual EBITDA benefit per aircraft over the 717 aircraft they have replaced, once the fleet reaches scale. The regional carrier’s transition to an all-Q400 turboprop fleet continued during the year, with all Q200 and Q300 aircraft now retired.

Qantas’ first two A321XLRs are expected to enter service on its domestic network in mid-September, making it the first airline in the Asia Pacific to operate the new aircraft type.

Engineering, wages, airport and government charges were the major contributors to higher costs. New aircraft transition and entry into service costs were also higher, but these are expected to decrease as new fleet types reach scale.

Jetstar carried a record 16 million passengers domestically, helping it deliver a 55 per cent increase in Underlying EBIT. This was enabled by new aircraft, strong demand which helped increase seat factor by 2 percentage points and lower fuel prices. New aircraft also provided customer benefits including inflight streaming and more onboard baggage space.

Following the closure of Jetstar Asia last month, its 13 A320 aircraft will be progressively redeployed across Jetstar Australia, Jetstar New Zealand and QantasLink to support fleet renewal, replace leased aircraft and support growth. The first of these aircraft will enter service next month.

Group International and Freight

The sustained growth in demand for international travel and the addition of new routes helped Group International achieve a 20 per cent improvement in Underlying EBIT to $903 million.

Qantas International capacity increased by 6 per cent, with the return of another A380, while unit revenue turned positive in the fourth quarter[4]. Strong demand for premium cabins across its international network continued into the second half, with a 2 percentage point increase in seat factors across First, Business and Premium Economy cabins.

The strong financial performance and customer satisfaction on existing ultra long haul routes, including to Europe and the United States, continues to provide confidence ahead of Project Sunrise. Work on Qantas’ first A350-1000ULR is progressing, with the aircraft entering the final assembly line in Toulouse, France in October 2025. The first aircraft is due to be delivered in October 2026[5]. The aircraft will fly the first non-stop ultra long haul commercial flight in the first half of calendar year 2027.

Elevated engineering and supply chain costs, higher wages due to the Same Job Same Pay legislation and preparation for the return of Qantas’ final A380s were the major contributors to higher costs.

Jetstar carried around 25 per cent more customers internationally to and from Australia than the prior year, enabled by similar growth across its international network, with particularly positive performance into Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The airline launched 11 new international routes during the year, supported by the delivery of seven new A321LR and four A320neo aircraft, opening up more options for low fares holidays for Australians.

Jetstar’s refurbished Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet will commence flying towards the end of the current financial year. Its A321XLRs will begin to arrive from calendar year 2027 and will be fitted with a two-class cabin for medium haul international travel.

Net freight revenue grew 7 per cent year on year, despite global trade uncertainty, enabled by simplifying Qantas Freight’s fleet and transformation initiatives. Preparations are underway for the first freighter flight at Western Sydney Airport’s 24-hour cargo precinct in mid-calendar year 2026. The new freight facility will help meet growing e-commerce demand and will complement existing operations at Kingsford Smith Airport.

Qantas Loyalty

Growth in active members and strengthening engagement helped Qantas Loyalty achieve 9 per cent Underlying EBIT growth for the full year to $556 million.

Qantas Frequent Flyers earned 10 per cent more Qantas Points and redeemed 8 per cent more compared to the prior year, as program enhancements increased member interaction on the ground and in the air.

Members booked a record number of Flight Reward Seats during the year, with more seats made available on Qantas, Jetstar and partner airlines.

The launch of Classic Plus on domestic flights in December helped accelerate Classic Plus bookings to above one million seats for the year. Around one in three of those bookings were for travel during peak school holiday periods and one in four members who made a Classic Plus booking were redeeming their points on flights for the first time in five years.

There has also been an increase in Jetstar Classic Reward Seats booked following the introduction of the lowest one-way Economy reward seat in Australia, requiring just 5,700 points. This was one of a number of changes announced in January, which also included the first points increase to Classic Reward seats since 2019 and an increase in the number of points frequent flyers can earn when flying Qantas domestically.

Australian businesses continue to see value in partnering with Qantas Loyalty, with more coalition partners joining the program and cash inflows from partners up 10 per cent. David Jones is the latest major Australian brand to join the program and will provide another opportunity for members to earn and redeem points on the ground, while long-term partner Woolworths Group has extended its partnership with the program beyond 2030.

Hotels, Holidays and Tour bookings achieved double digit growth in total transaction value to $1.5 billion, which includes an increase of more than 50 per cent in TripADeal bookings.

Investment in Customer and Operations

The Group invested significantly in customer-focused initiatives during the year, including the arrival of 17 new aircraft, delivering a more reliable, on time and seamless customer experience.

Investments in operational improvements also helped Qantas achieve its best domestic on time performance since 2019, with 82 per cent of flights in the second half departing on time. Jetstar’s on time performance improved by 3 percentage points during the year, with 76 per cent of flights in the second half departing on time. Jetstar’s cancellation rate of less than 2 per cent is its best annual performance in seven years.

Customer satisfaction improved for Qantas and Jetstar, with Qantas’ Net Promoter Score improving by 10 percentage points and Jetstar improving by 6 percentage points. Qantas was awarded Best Airline in Australia/Pacific at the 2025 Skytrax World Airline Awards.

Qantas opened new lounges in Adelaide and Broome and commenced significant upgrades to its Sydney International and Los Angeles Business lounges, and its Auckland lounge. Qantas also activated fast and free international Wi-Fi on South East Asia and trans-Tasman routes, with more markets to be connected during the coming year. Jetstar enhanced its in-app self-service capability, launched tap and go for easy onboard payments and improved its ancillary product offering.

Our People

During the year, the Group invested significantly in training and development initiatives, as well as the ongoing rollout of frontline and corporate technology solutions that allow its people to work more efficiently.

Group employee engagement improved by 7 percentage points in the latest engagement survey[6], putting the organisation 4 points above the global industry average[7].

The Group also continues to reward its people, including a one-off $1,000 Thank You payment to around 25,000 non-executive employees which was made in December 2024 and a new employee share plan announced today, which will see eligible non-executive employees receive $1,000 in Qantas shares on an annual basis, subject to the Group’s financial performance.

Sustainability and Community

Sustainability remains a key priority for the Group as it takes action towards its 2030 sustainability targets. Through its $400 million Climate Fund, the Group has now committed more than $100 million to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other decarbonisation projects. In April, the Group announced a $15 million investment in ClimateTech Partners, an Australian-based venture capital fund investing in climate improvement businesses and projects.

The Group recently expanded its SAF uptake from Los Angeles with an agreement to use more than 100 million litres of SAF over the next three years.

In Australia, a partnership with Sydney Airport and a coalition of large corporate customers enabled the largest ever importation of SAF into the country. This importation was a positive test of Sydney’s fuel infrastructure and further confirmed the industry’s commitment and desire to see investment and policy support for Australian-based SAF supply.

The Group also made improvements to its customer-facing Voluntary Carbon Program during the year, with 70 per cent of the carbon portfolio now made up of nature-based projects, and 50 per cent of the portfolio linked to an Australian-based project.

The Group also continues to expand its support for Australian communities, including entering a new four-year partnership with Surf Life Saving Australia and three-year partnership with the Australian Red Cross during the year. The Group will provide funding for the training of 750 new Red Cross volunteers as part of the partnership, with more than 150 volunteers already trained.

More than $60 million in flight discounts were provided to regional and remote customers via the Resident Fares Program and more than $2 million in grants were given to regional community groups.

Financial Framework and Shareholder Returns

The Group ended the year with $12.2 billion of liquidity, including $2.2 billion in cash, $1.4 billion in committed undrawn facilities and $8.6 billion in unencumbered fleet and other assets.

Net debt increased to $5.0 billion, remaining below the middle of the Group’s target range of $4.6 billion to $5.7 billion, while net capital expenditure totalled $3.9 billion as the Group’s fleet renewal program accelerated.

The Board has approved a final dividend, comprising a fully franked base dividend of $250 million (16.5 cents per share), and a special dividend, also fully franked, of $150 million (9.9 cents per share). The dividends will be paid on 15 October 2025. This is in addition to the $400 million interim dividend announced in February.

Ground handling decision and cyber incident

Earlier this month, the Federal Court finalised the legal case relating to the outsourcing of Qantas’ ground handling in 2020. Qantas has reiterated its apology to affected former employees for the impact that losing their jobs and the subsequent five-year legal process has had on them and their families. In December, Qantas reached an out-of-court settlement with the Union for $120 million in compensation for former employees and has paid the full penalty that was handed down last week.

In June, 5.7 million Qantas customers were impacted by a cyber incident which saw some of their personal data compromised. Additional protections were put in place and the airline continues to support impacted customers, with a support line and specialist identity protection advice available.

Outlook

The Group expects ongoing strong travel demand into 1H26. Group Domestic unit revenue is expected to increase by 3-5 per cent in the first half of FY26 compared to the previous year. Group International unit revenue is expected to increase by 2-3[8] per cent over the same period. Qantas Loyalty is expected to grow Underlying EBIT by 10-12 per cent in FY26.

LTD. and Velocys Inc. have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishing a strategic partnership to advance production technology for electro-sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF), a CO2-derived synthetic fuel. This partnership combines SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s CO2→CO chemical looping technology with Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch (FT) microchannel reactor technology to enable the manufacture of synthetic fuels using CO2 as a feedstock, thus contributing to decarbonization.

Background

CO2 emissions must be reduced across all industries to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The aviation industry accounts for approximately 2.6% of global CO2 emissions, and a key emission reduction measure that is gaining attention is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other organizations, 65% of CO2 reduction targets for the aviation industry can be achieved through the adoption of SAF. At present, conventional SAF is manufactured from waste oil and biomass-derived raw materials. However, considering the anticipated increase in SAF demand going forward, the early commencement and widespread adoption of e-SAF—which is manufactured from CO2 and hydrogen derived from renewable energy—is considered essential.

In this context, CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) technology, which converts CO2 into fuel and chemical products for practical use, is attracting attention. CCU technology enables the reuse of CO2 as a valuable resource and replaces fossil resources, thereby reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

Strengths of both companies

SEKISUI CHEMICAL is working to reduce global CO2 emissions through the social implementation of CCU technology. To date, it has developed a unique chemical looping technology that converts CO2 into CO with a high reaction yield (90% or higher).

Velocys has been developing FT reaction technology for the manufacture of synthetic fuels from synthetic gas (a mixture of CO and H2) converted from municipal waste, industrial waste, biomass, and CO2 for over 20 years. Its proprietary catalyst and microchannel reactor design have established productivity six to ten times higher than conventional FT reaction technology.

Collaboration overview

This project aims to establish a new e-SAF manufacturing technology by combining SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s proprietary CO2→CO chemical looping reaction technology, which achieves high reaction yields (90% or higher), with Velocys’ FT reaction technology (synthetic gas → synthetic fuel), which achieves high CO conversion rates (90–95%).

In the future, the two companies will work to establish a highly efficient e-SAF manufacturing technology using CO2 as a raw material, thereby contributing to the decarbonization of the aviation industry and the realization of a sustainable society.

Previous initiatives of both companies

The Houston-based private equity firm announced in May that it had raised $800 million for Ara Infrastructure Fund I and associated co-investment vehicles, surpassing a target of $500 million.
Ara hired George Yong and Teresa O’Flynn as co-heads of infrastructure in 2022 and started fundraising for the infrastructure fund in September of the same year.
The fundraise helped the firm place 11th in the 2025 edition of NPM‘s Impact 50 ranking of the largest private markets impact managers.
To date, Ara has made three investments through the infrastructure fund.","Ara Partners is poised to take advantage of a “buyer’s market” in the decarbonisation industry, following the close of its first infrastructure fund this year, senior managing director Tuan Tran tells New Private Markets.

“What we’re seeing right now is pretty much record dealflow,” Tran says, adding that Ara has a couple of possible transactions in the pipeline and could make an announcement before the end of the year.

The Houston-based private equity firm announced in May that it had raised $800 million for Ara Infrastructure Fund I and associated co-investment vehicles, surpassing a target of $500 million.

“Ultimately, our investors saw that this strategy provided them with a distinctly different exposure to industrial decarbonisation – beyond traditional energy transition investments like wind and solar – while targeting the mid-market segment, which is increasingly overlooked as larger funds shift their focus up-market,” Tran says.

Ara hired George Yong and Teresa O’Flynn as co-heads of infrastructure in 2022 and started fundraising for the infrastructure fund in September of the same year. It reached first close with $100 million in September 2023, before coming to $185 million in September 2024 and $507 million in January this year. It got to final close with $800 million in May.

The fundraise helped the firm place 11th in the 2025 edition of NPM‘s Impact 50 ranking of the largest private markets impact managers. It also reinforced Ara’s view that decarbonisation and financial performance “go hand in hand”, according to Tran.

“We believe we are still in the early innings of this powerful secular trend as critical infrastructure is being built or repurposed to store and transport low-carbon molecules and green electrons,” he says.

To date, Ara has made three investments through the infrastructure fund. It bought a majority stake in renewable fuels logistics company Lincoln Terminals in November 2022, followed by deals for USD Clean Fuels in December 2023 and Irish organic waste recycler Natural Wood Products in February this year.

In other sectors, Tran mentions biofuels, particularly sustainable aviation fuel, and points to possible onshoring deals in the US market as the administration of President Donald Trump moves to enact policies to bolster the domestic supply chain, particularly for rare earths and other critical minerals.

“Ensuring a secure, domestic supply chain and reducing reliance on China is a top priority for them,” Tran says in reference to the Trump administration. “There is significant momentum behind onshoring critical industries, creating American jobs and strengthening national security in these areas.”

Ara, however, is “categorically” not a venture capital firm, instead choosing to focus its investments on the “missing middle”, according to Tran.

“We see superior risk-adjusted returns in the mid-market space, where smaller deals face less competition and lend themselves to bilateral discussions,” he says.

In 2022, for example, Ara acquired Genera Energy, a manufacturer of moulded fibre products, and committed up to $200 million to expand the company’s sustainable pulp and packaging business. In July this year, Genera completed the expansion of its plant in Tennessee at a cost of $340 million.

“We are largely focused on building out these new plants,” Trans says of Ara’s plans after acquisition, adding that budget overruns and construction delays can be “catastrophic” for an investment.

With that in mind, Ara employs experienced operator-builders alongside investment professionals, which give the firm “a decisive edge” when it comes to delivering projects on time and on budget, according to Tran.

For fuel buyers, more renewable diesel could soften diesel basis in some West Coast and Gulf Coast markets, offset by feedstock-driven cost inflation.
Corporate positioning: who’s hedged, who isn’t Integrated refiners with renewable diesel capacity and trading desks have a structural advantage.","The White House moved to turbocharge biofuels, proposing record 2026 blending quotas that sent soybean oil up 11% to the highest since October 2023 and lit a fire under renewable diesel sentiment. The EPA plan lifts total renewable fuel volumes 8% to 24.02 billion gallons and raises biomass-based diesel targets, while clearing a backlog of small-refinery exemptions that could swing compliance costs. It is a clear political and market play: a win for farm country and biofuel producers, a headache for petroleum refiners, and a fresh catalyst across RIN credits and ag commodities.

Record RFS targets jolt commodities and stocks

The EPA’s proposal sets the 2026 Renewable Fuel Standard at 24.02 billion gallons, up from last year’s mandate and the highest on record. The agency also proposed 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026, roughly 5.61 billion gallons of physical blending, reinforcing a rapid buildout in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel capacity. Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the policy as a domestic economic play: “We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers while mitigating the impact on gas prices and ensuring the continued existence of liquid fuels.” Markets got the message. Soybean oil spiked as traders recalibrated feedstock demand. RINs firmed across the board, signaling a tighter compliance outlook even as small-refinery waivers muddy the supply picture. The geopolitical backdrop adds fuel. Escalating tensions between Israel and Iran have investors hedging fuel security and cost risk, amplifying the bid for alternatives as crude volatility spills into refined products.

Winners: Farm Belt, biofuel producers and feedstock owners

The clear beneficiaries are corn and soy value chains and companies leveraged to blending growth. Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Bunge (BG) gain from stronger crush economics and merchandising volumes. Green Plains (GPRE) and other ethanol producers stand to benefit from higher implied offtake and firmer RIN support for blending. On the diesel side, Darling Ingredients (DAR) remains a pure-play winner through feedstocks and renewable diesel partnerships, while Chevron (CVX), Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Phillips 66 (PSX) gain from vertically integrated renewable diesel platforms that can arbitrage RINs, tax credits and Low Carbon Fuel Standard markets. Farmers get pricing power. A sustained soybean oil rally, if confirmed by the final rule, tightens margins for downstream food producers but transfers value back to the Farm Belt. The administration is betting that a liquid-fuels-first approach—more ethanol and diesel substitutes, fewer EV carrots—keeps pump prices in check and shores up rural support without ceding the energy transition narrative entirely. The risk for producers is operational: if feedstock inflation outpaces RIN and credit support, renewable diesel margins compress, and capacity additions slow. For now, traders are leaning into the volume story.

Losers: Refiners face RIN bill uncertainty and waiver whiplash

Oil refiners without sizable blending or renewable diesel hedges face a higher compliance tab. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers warned the package “plays politics with our fuel system,” flagging higher consumer costs and pressure on domestic manufacturing. The EPA complicated the calculus by moving on the long-stalled small-refinery exemptions: 63 granted, 28 denied and 77 partially approved, cleaning up petitions dating back to 2016. That decision temporarily enlarges the pool of exempted gallons, loosening RIN demand in the near term while prolonging uncertainty about reallocation and future enforcement. For names like Valero (VLO), PBF Energy (PBF) and Delek (DK), the distribution of exemptions, the trajectory of D6 and D4 RIN prices and the timing of the final 2026 rule will determine whether this becomes a pass-through cost at the rack or a hit to margins. Refiners argue the RIN market is opaque and volatile; the administration counters that the mandate lifts domestic supply and can coexist with stable retail prices. The spread between wholesale and retail will be the tell.

Policy risk: reallocation, lawsuits and the election calendar

The EPA signaled a supplemental rule to decide whether larger refiners should backfill exempted volumes through reallocation, a critical detail that would ratchet compliance costs if implemented. Litigation is likely no matter how the agency lands. Refiners will challenge aggressive targets and any reallocation, while producers will fight broad exemptions. Court timelines could stretch into the next compliance year, leaving traders to price legal risk into RIN curves. The political overlay is unmistakable. Biofuels are a lever in battleground states with deep ag footprints. The administration’s posture—elevate ethanol and renewable diesel while questioning EV subsidies and mandates—aims to thread a needle between energy transition optics and pump-price politics. If crude volatility persists amid Middle East shocks, the White House will sell biofuels as insurance against foreign supply risks, even as the oil industry calls the scheme a hidden tax.

Market implications: soy complex, corn, RINs and retail fuel

The immediate trade is soy oil strength and a firmer soy crush, with ripple effects for meal prices and livestock inputs. Corn demand expectations tick higher with an 8% increase in implied blending volumes, especially if driving demand holds through 2026. Ethanol crush margins improve on volume certainty and RIN support, though rail logistics and export channels remain swing factors. D4 RINs could tighten into year-end if traders anticipate reallocation and faster renewable diesel ramp rates, while D6 RINs will track gasoline demand and exemption headlines. For fuel buyers, more renewable diesel could soften diesel basis in some West Coast and Gulf Coast markets, offset by feedstock-driven cost inflation. Watch for retail spreads: if refiners succeed in passing through higher RIN costs, price transparency will become a political football.

Corporate positioning: who’s hedged, who isn’t

Integrated refiners with renewable diesel capacity and trading desks have a structural advantage. Chevron’s Renewable Energy Group acquisition and Marathon’s Martinez JV with Darling provide compliance credits and margin optionality. Phillips 66’s Rodeo project continues to scale. Pure-play refiners with thinner hedges rely on RIN strategies and term agreements, leaving them more exposed if RINs firm and reallocation hits. On the ag side, ADM and Bunge are positioned to capture crush and merchandising upside, but their guidance will hinge on how quickly feedstock costs transmit downstream. Green Plains’ technology-driven yield improvements become more valuable in a higher-volume world. For investors, the screen is simple: overweight feedstock owners and integrated blenders; underweight RIN-short refiners until the reallocation rule is clearer.

Key numbers and timelines to watch

The headline 24.02 billion-gallon target and the 7.12 billion D4 RIN quota will anchor models, but the swing variable is exemption policy. The 63 granted and 77 partial waivers clear backlog noise, yet they also set up a binary outcome on reallocation that could yo-yo RIN prices. Comment periods and a final 2026 rule later this year will be catalysts, followed by any supplemental reallocation decision. USDA crop reports and crush capacity updates will feed the soy oil trade. Quarterly calls from ADM, BG, DAR, VLO, MPC and PBF will surface how much of the mandate is already priced into contracts and how management teams are hedging.

What it means for energy transition math

The administration is doubling down on a transition path that keeps liquid fuels front and center. That stance puts biofuels in the political winner’s circle even as EVs and wind face tougher rhetoric and permitting friction. Investors should expect a policy tug-of-war to continue, with biofuels getting budget and headline support and opposition from refiners intensifying. In the near term, the market signal is clean: more mandated volumes, firmer feedstocks, higher compliance complexity. That combination makes the biofuels trade noisy but investable, with asymmetric upside for the Farm Belt and integrated renewable diesel players if the EPA follows through on reallocation.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ChatGPT-Image-Aug-12-2025-04_04_33-PM.png,N,,2025-08-27 22:56:40.173815

About SWISS Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) is Switzerland’s leading air carrier.","Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has entered a long-term strategic partnership with tech pioneer neustark, the first company in the world to store carbon dioxide generated by biogas facilities in demolished concrete to remove it permanently from the atmosphere.

The Swiss-based start-up has already demonstrated the viable benefits of its new technology. And its new partnership with SWISS should permit this Swiss innovation to be more rapidly further refined and internationally expanded as a key element in achieving the world’s carbon reduction goals.

The air transport sector is facing a major challenge. Flying brings people and cultures together; but it generates emissions, too. So firm action is needed today if future generations are also to enjoy all the benefits that mobility brings.

This is why SWISS is consistently pursuing its own objective of making its business and operations carbon-neutral by 2050 via various measures ranging from deploying more efficient aircraft and using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to promoting pioneering new solutions that permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

SWISS’s new partnership with Swiss-based start-up neustark is a further key element in these sustainability endeavors. SWISS is the first airline in the world to support the mineralization technology that this ETH Zurich spinoff has developed.

The technique takes carbon dioxide generated in biogas facilities and stores it in recycled concrete (sourced from demolished buildings and the like) to permanently remove it from the atmosphere. SWISS has concluded a partnership agreement with neustark which will remain in effect until 2030, with options for enlarging the volumes covered and/or extending the agreement’s duration.

SWISS’s early involvement in its venture will enable neustark to accelerate the development of its technologies and drive its international expansion. In forging such partnerships, SWISS and the Lufthansa Group are underlining their commitment to pursuing and promoting scalable science-based solutions for decarbonizing the air transport sector.

A strategic partnership for scalable CO₂ removal

“Our journey to net zero demands actions as well as words,” stressed SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “Switzerland is a land of innovation. And we’re proud to help carry this strength out into the world.

“In teaming up with neustark, we’re supporting a Swiss idea that can have a global impact. Permanent CO₂ removal is key to the future of the aviation sector; and we are intentionally getting involved in this technology as early as possible, to help scale it up and drive its further development. And as the first airline in the world to do so, we’re saying: At SWISS, we don’t wait; we lead the way.”

“We are delighted to have secured SWISS as our first airline partner,” added Valentin Gutknecht, Co-CEO and co-founder of neustark. “Our new collaboration shows how even difficult-to-decarbonize sectors like air transport can help to scale up core climate technologies.

“Pioneers like SWISS are playing a vital role in further developing our carbon removal technology and in enabling us to achieve our ambitious growth plans to permanently remove exponentially more tonnes of hard-to-avoid CO2 emissions from the atmosphere every day.”

Partnerships key to achieving ambitious objectives

SWISS’s new partnership with neustark further expands the already extensive involvements of the company and the Lufthansa Group in the fields of sustainable aviation fuel and CO₂ removal. SWISS was the first airline in the world to use the solar fuel developed and produced by Swiss-based start-up Synhelion. And SWISS is also the first airline to team up with the Climeworks company to help scale up its ‘direct air capture’ carbon removal technology.

Sustainability: a shared task and commitment

SWISS and the Lufthansa Group are adopting a range of actions to achieve net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. These include reducing their carbon emissions at the source through operating advanced aircraft, raising the efficiency of flight operations, and using sustainable fuels.

This is complemented by investments in climate projects and promoting the development of promising new technologies such as neustark’s that enable permanent CO₂ removal. Air transport can only become more sustainable if all its various parties and partners work together: airlines, their customers, tech pioneers and the political world.

neustark in brief

Swiss-based start-up neustark has developed an innovative technology that takes concrete from demolition sites – the world’s biggest waste stream of more than a billion tonnes a year – and other mineral waste and turns it into a carbon sink. To do so, CO₂ generated by biogas facilities is captured, liquefied and transported to nearby demolition waste recycling centers, where it is injected into the now- granular recycled concrete and permanently bound therein through an accelerated mineralization process that transforms the CO2 into rock. The CO₂-enriched recycled concrete granules can be re-used in construction – in road building, for instance, or to produce fresh recycled concrete. With more than 30 active CO2 separation and storage sites in Europe and more being planned, neustark is pursuing its vision of permanently storing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of CO2 in mineral waste in the next few years.

Neustark is a spinoff of ETH Zurich. Founded in 2019 and domiciled in Bern, the company is one of the leading developers of CO₂ mineralization and is rapidly expanding in Europe with active projects in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Austria and elsewhere.

Washington, DC, Aug. 27, 2025 – The most important developments shaping business aviation’s path to net-zero carbon emissions will be in the spotlight when industry leaders gather for the 2025 National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE), taking place Oct. 14-16 in Las Vegas.

The show will once again include a Business Aviation Sustainability Summit, taking place Oct. 14 and 15, with education sessions dedicated to taking a deeper look at the most pressing issues facing the industry.

For example, Congress has remained active on policy proposals for incentivizing the production, availability and uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can reduce business aircraft emissions by up to 80% over legacy fuels.

One recently passed congressional budget bill includes an additional two-year extension of the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit incentivizing production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to 2031; another bill under consideration would expand alternative fuels research.

On the regulatory front, the certification of low- or zero-emissions advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft is drawing closer to reality, since the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) release at last year’s convention of a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) to establish requirements for the safe, efficient integration of the next-generation aircraft into the nation’s aviation system.

“As the industry continues innovating toward its sustainability aims, NBAA-BACE offers a vital opportunity for the business aviation community to come together, highlight recent breakthroughs, and chart the path forward for an even more sustainable future,” said NBAA Senior Director, Environmental and Technical Operations Stewart D’Leon.

The new agreement aims to shift part of Shein’s air cargo to SAF and to add operational changes that can slow that growth without slowing deliveries.
Under the plan, Lufthansa Cargo will track SAF use on Shein routes and issue externally verified “Proof of Sustainability” certificates that show the related, traceable emission reductions.
The fast fashion model relies on speed, frequent restocks, and wide global reach, all of which have favored air freight.
– For Lufthansa Cargo: expand SAF supply deals, refine booking and fueling processes, and attract large retail customers seeking certified emissions cuts.","Shein has signed a wide-ranging deal with Lufthansa Cargo to cut the climate impact of its global air shipments, with a focus on scaling the use of Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding on August 19, 2025, and set a near-term target to finalize SAF adoption within six months, by February 2026. The move matters because air transport makes up more than half of Shein’s transport emissions, and the retailer’s air-heavy model has pushed its pollution far above peers.

In its latest figures for 2024, Shein reported 8.52 million tonnes CO₂e from transport, out of 16.7 million tonnes CO₂e overall. Transport emissions rose 13.7% year over year, and they are now more than three times those of Inditex, Zara’s parent company. The new agreement aims to shift part of Shein’s air cargo to SAF and to add operational changes that can slow that growth without slowing deliveries.

Under the plan, Lufthansa Cargo will track SAF use on Shein routes and issue externally verified “Proof of Sustainability” certificates that show the related, traceable emission reductions. The companies will share emissions data, improve reporting, and expand SAF volumes where supply, cost, and operations allow. They will also study other low-carbon steps, from fleet efficiency to logistics improvements, to cut fuel burn and waste along the route.

Shein’s Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment, said the company will pilot SAF on select lanes and expand use where it works, while looking for more ways to lower the footprint of deliveries. Lufthansa Cargo CEO Ashwin Bhat called the tie-up a model for “concrete measures and reliable implementation” in international freight and said the airline wants to support more sustainable supply chains at scale.

Policy and timeline

The MoU’s scope goes beyond fuel. It covers joint work on low-carbon and renewable energy options, better demand planning to reduce last-minute air lifts, and process changes that can move more goods by sea or truck when time allows.

The parties set a firm initial adoption window ending February 2026; progress will be reviewed and expanded after that, with SAF use tracked and certified on agreed routes. The agreement also includes:

Knowledge sharing

Stronger traceability of shipments

Improved environmental and operational reporting across the network

For Lufthansa Cargo, this partnership fits a larger pathway to cut net carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 (vs. 2019) and to reach net-zero by 2050. The carrier points to a mix of SAF, operational tweaks, and technical upgrades—such as aerodynamic films that reduce drag—to squeeze more distance from each tonne of fuel. Details of the group’s climate program are posted on its site: Lufthansa Cargo Sustainability.

For Shein, the numbers tell a hard story. The fast fashion model relies on speed, frequent restocks, and wide global reach, all of which have favored air freight. The company has shifted some volume to sea freight and trucking, but the need for speed-to-market keeps air as a key lever. That is why SAF, though still limited in global supply, is central to this pilot.

Sustainability specialists see SAF as a helpful step but stress that the biggest wins come from cutting the need for air in the first place. That means:

Better inventory planning

More local production

Fewer emergency flights triggered by stock-outs

The MoU nods to these ideas by calling for logistics improvements and stronger forecasting to reduce rush shipments.

Industry context and human impact

Aviation fuel choices can feel abstract, but they influence real jobs and delivery timelines. A shift to SAF on Shein lanes can lower the climate impact of the same work done by pilots, ramp crews, dispatchers, and customs brokers.

If demand planning also improves, warehouse teams may face fewer overnight rushes and more predictable schedules. At the same time, the industry will watch prices: SAF remains costlier than conventional jet fuel, which can flow through to freight rates if used at scale.

Market forces and rules will shape how fast this deal grows. The companies flagged that changes in trade policy—such as the UK’s de minimis rules for low‑value imports—and Shein’s public market plans could affect logistics choices. Strong, transparent reporting tied to externally verified certificates can help regulators and investors judge whether claimed reductions are real.

Key potential impacts:

– For Shein: cut logistics emissions, respond to regulator and consumer pressure, and demonstrate that fast delivery can be compatible with lower-carbon air freight.

– For Lufthansa Cargo: expand SAF supply deals, refine booking and fueling processes, and attract large retail customers seeking certified emissions cuts.

– For the broader sector: increased pressure on fast fashion and freight providers to publish comparable data, test SAF, and shift more volume to sea when schedules allow.

SAF accounting and transparency

In practice, SAF adoption for a global retailer usually follows a “book-and-claim” model:

Fuel is supplied and used within an airline’s network.

A certificate assigns the climate benefit to the buyer.

External verification prevents double counting.

The MoU confirms this path by highlighting Lufthansa Cargo’s Proof of Sustainability documents, which rely on external checks to maintain credible accounting. That approach lets Shein contract for a larger SAF share than may be physically available on any single flight while keeping emissions claims traceable.

Transparency is built into the agreement. The parties will share emissions data and improve reporting of operational and environmental metrics. That matters for independent review and for comparisons across companies, especially since Shein’s transport footprint already exceeds that of major rivals by a wide margin.

Katy Austin & Simon Browning

Transport correspondent & producer

The bonus for Ryanair workers who intercept passengers with oversized cabin bags will rise from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag, the airline's boss said.

Michael O'Leary told the BBC the change would come in this November, and that he made no apology for it.

Mr O'Leary said the bonus was meant to put off the small minority who brought cabin bags which were bigger than the size limit, insisting the airline was ""not trying to catch people out"".

He added that if people ""don't comply with the rules and try to get on with an outsize bag, we will catch you and I would look forward to rewarding and bonusing our staff that pick out those oversize bags"".

Ryanair passengers are allowed a free bag to take on board, but can be charged up to £75 they try to bring a larger bag than allowed onto a flight, depending on the route and travel date.

The airline currently allows a small carry-on bag – with a size capped at 40cm x 20cm x 25cm and weight of 10kg – with every ticket.

However, this is set to increase to 40cm x 30cm x 20cm from September after a change in EU rules.

Mr O'Leary said about 200,000 passengers per year have to pay extra to put carry-on luggage in the hold, and that he did not feel sorry for ""chancers"" trying bring ""rucksacks"" aboard.

""We're the airline with the lowest air fares in Europe,"" he said. ""Those are our rules. Please comply with the rules, as 99.9% of our 200 million passengers do, and you won't have any problem.""

He said if people ""comply with the bag rules then everyone will board faster"" and there will be ""fewer flight delays"".

In addition to increasing the bonus per bag, Ryanair is scrapping an €80 cap on how much staff can earn each month for catching people with bags that are too large.

The Ryanair chief executive also said he wanted ""ground handlers to catch people who are scamming the system"".

Sustainable fuel 'nonsense'

Mr O'Leary, who has previously voiced scepticism about sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), said there was ""not a hope in hell"" of the UK's SAF mandate of 10% being met by 2030.

He said Ryanair would not be increasing how much SAF it used because supply ""is not there"", and described SAF as ""nonsense"".

The mandate starts in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, increasing to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.

Mr O'Leary said sustainability targets for aviation are ""dying a death"", with the sector set to miss both 2030 targets for sustainable aviation fuel and a 2050 net zero mandate.

""Over the next 10 years, I believe oil prices will fall materially,"" he added.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d9f7/live/afc840f0-8359-11f0-825f-ef3af8edf016.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 16:56:25.062484

The private jet industry has undergone a significant market shift that many operators have not recognized, according to new research analyzing five years of search data.

A comprehensive study of private jet search trends from 2020-2025 reveals that traditional ownership models are declining rapidly. On-demand charter services now represent 52% of all revenue, while fractional ownership has grown 67% year-over-year. The market is projected to reach $24.28 billion by 2025, representing 14.3% growth from 2024.

North America maintains 63.5% of the global market share, aligning with NBAA’s latest industry reports. Belgium has demonstrated 10.6% growth, five times the EU average. The Philippines led Asia-Pacific with 38% growth, while Kenya showed 63% growth despite Africa’s overall 11.5% decline, matching patterns in EBAA’s regional analysis.

These growth markets have succeeded by addressing customer demand for flexibility without ownership. Entry-level jet cards start at £39,708, and event-specific access drives significant volume – the Cannes Film Festival alone generates 3,000 private jet movements, double the normal volume.

Three key factors are reshaping private jet market trends. Technology advancements have reduced operational costs, with AI route optimization delivering 10-15% fuel savings and composite materials reducing aircraft weight by 20-25%. Sustainability requirements are accelerating change, as Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces CO2 emissions by up to 80% despite costing 2-4 times more than conventional fuel. The EU mandates 2% SAF usage by 2025, rising to 70% by 2050. Business models have evolved to include fractional ownership, jet-sharing, subscription cards, and online booking platforms, replacing traditional brokerage models.

A significant disconnect exists in the industry’s digital presence. While 90% of wealthy travelers begin their search online, 87% of private jet companies lack proper tracking and optimization for these search patterns. Companies that effectively track search data can identify which aircraft types receive the most searches, when demand spikes occur around major events, which routes show highest purchase intent, and how customers research across 7-12 touchpoints.

The pandemic significantly impacted the industry, with deliveries dropping to 644 in 2020 before recovering to 764 in 2024. Forecasts indicate 820 deliveries for 2025, consistent with Aviation Week’s market projections. The fundamental change involves buyer preferences shifting from ownership to access. Fractional providers experienced 59% more flight hours in Q2 2024 versus Q2 2019, matching WingX flight data trends. Charter bookings increased by 23%.

Based on current growth rates, traditional ownership is projected to represent less than 25% of the market by 2027.

Three categories of operators are positioned to capture market share in this evolving landscape: companies offering fractional and on-demand models, operators in high-growth regions such as Belgium, Philippines, and Kenya, and early adopters of SAF and AI optimization technologies. Companies continuing to focus primarily on full ownership models risk losing market relevance as customer preferences shift toward flexibility over asset ownership.

Air France’s 46th A220-300, named VAISON-LA-ROMAINE, reduced lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by over 25 tonnes compared to fossil fuels during this milestone journey.

According to Air France-KLM, combining fleet renewal with SAF is essential for aviation’s decarbonization strategy.

The airline group, among the world’s largest SAF buyers, emphasized that receiving SAF at delivery increases transparency and accelerates industry adoption.

Expanding SAF Integration

Since introducing SAF deliveries to its Mirabel site, Airbus has been progressively integrating SAF into A220 production, acceptance, and test flights.

In 2025, the site aims to cut CO2 emissions by around 400 metric tonnes by consuming 170,000 litres of pure SAF.

This aligns with Airbus’ global initiative, with 78% of its aircraft delivered in the first half of the year using SAF blends.

Airbus targets 100% SAF compatibility across all aircraft by 2030. Current A220 models already operate with up to 50% SAF, reflecting both technical readiness and regulatory compliance.

Lifecycle Emissions

The SAF used in this delivery flight was certified to achieve up to an 85% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to fossil fuel.

This substantial decrease is managed through the mass balance system, where certified SAF volumes are tracked alongside conventional Jet A-1 fuel using an auditable chain of custody approach.

By adopting this system, Airbus ensures both operational feasibility and transparency in SAF usage, reinforcing its role as a driver of sustainable aviation.

Air France’s A220 Fleet

Air France’s first A220 entered service in 2021, part of a 60-aircraft order. The A220 family offers up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, further supporting the airline’s medium-haul efficiency goals.

The A220 programme continues to serve as a cornerstone in both Airbus’ and Air France’s sustainability roadmaps, combining cutting-edge aircraft efficiency with sustainable fuel adoption.

Conclusion: A turning point for African aviation Aviation Africa Summit 2025 arrives at a critical time for the continent’s aviation industry.
The future of African aviation may well depend on what comes next after Aviation Africa 2025.","The Aviation Africa Summit 2025 is set to bring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to the centre of discussions on the continent’s aviation future. The event will focus on practical solutions for producing SAF, ensuring supply chains, and creating policy frameworks to accelerate adoption. Experts including AfriSAF’s CEO and co-founder Kwame Bekoe and Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority Director General Silas Udahemuka will share their insights. Moderated by aviation industry veteran Vijay Poonoosamy, the panel promises a no-nonsense debate on moving from endless studies to real-world action. For Africa, the time for SAF is now.

Why Africa must embrace SAF urgently

Africa’s aviation sector faces the dual challenge of rapid growth and climate responsibility. With rising demand for flights across the continent, airlines and regulators are under pressure to cut emissions. SAF is seen as the most practical pathway to cleaner skies. Kwame Bekoe of AfriSAF notes that success depends on mobilising feedstock, choosing the right technologies, and reducing investment risks. Aligning policies with market incentives will also be crucial. If executed well, Africa can leapfrog into a leadership role, ensuring its aviation growth is both sustainable and competitive.

AfriSAF leads with innovation in feedstock management

At the heart of Africa’s SAF progress is AfriSAF, which is pioneering feedstock management solutions. By connecting farmers, waste producers, and energy developers, the company ensures that raw materials for SAF are available at scale. Bekoe explains that this is the first step to building cost-competitive projects. The aim is to lower barriers to entry and encourage private investment. AfriSAF’s model demonstrates how technology can simplify a complex value chain. Its role at Aviation Africa 2025 will be central to showcasing how innovation can bring SAF from concept to commercial reality.

Potential benefits beyond clean skies

The advantages of SAF for Africa stretch far beyond aviation. Bekoe highlights how production can create green jobs, reduce dependence on imported fuel, and improve waste management. Cleaner air in growing cities will also mean better public health. These ripple effects make SAF more than just a climate solution—it is an engine for sustainable development. From energy security to rural livelihoods, the benefits spread across multiple sectors. This explains why SAF is gaining traction not only among airlines but also among policymakers, investors, and community leaders.

Policy alignment remains the missing piece

Despite strong interest, Africa still faces policy gaps that slow down SAF adoption. Governments have often been reluctant to create financial incentives, fearing high costs. However, experts argue that without subsidies, tax breaks, or blending mandates, SAF will struggle to compete with conventional jet fuel. The Aviation Africa Summit 2025 will provide a forum to discuss how policy can catch up with ambition. Industry leaders are expected to call for a united approach, where governments, regulators, and businesses work hand in hand to ensure that progress moves beyond reports and pilot projects.

Rwanda showcases regulatory leadership

Rwanda’s Civil Aviation Authority, led by Director General Silas Udahemuka, has emerged as one of the leaders in advocating for SAF. Rwanda has already introduced policies encouraging green innovation and has invested in renewable energy. Udahemuka is expected to highlight how regulatory frameworks can set the tone for private sector investment. By embedding sustainability into national aviation strategies, Rwanda provides a model that other countries can adapt. Africa’s diversity means one-size-fits-all solutions will not work, but Rwanda’s proactive stance is a reminder that leadership at the state level matters.

Insight Theatre to present practical pathways

Beyond panel debates, Aviation Africa 2025 will feature the Insight Theatre where AfriSAF’s CEO will present concrete solutions for enabling SAF production in Africa. The presentation will outline how the company uses its feedstock management tool to drive efficiency and collaboration. It will also explore potential partnerships across the continent and highlight cost-competitive approaches. These discussions aim to move beyond vision statements and into actionable strategies. Delegates attending the session will leave with a clearer understanding of how SAF can be scaled up quickly in African contexts.

Risks and challenges must be addressed

While the promise of SAF is strong, risks remain. High upfront investment costs, uncertain demand, and technological complexities can deter stakeholders. Africa also faces challenges in logistics, with limited infrastructure in many regions. Experts warn that unless these issues are addressed, progress will stall. However, this is precisely why the Aviation Africa Summit 2025 is critical. By bringing together stakeholders from across the value chain—airlines, governments, fuel producers, and financiers—the event can create shared solutions. The message is clear: challenges are real, but so are the opportunities.

SAF as a driver of African competitiveness

Africa has the chance to position itself as a global leader in sustainable aviation. With abundant feedstock from agriculture and waste, the continent is uniquely placed to scale SAF. If successful, this could reduce reliance on expensive fuel imports and make African airlines more competitive globally. It could also improve Africa’s image as a region committed to sustainability, attracting investment and partnerships. Aviation Africa 2025 will be a litmus test for how committed stakeholders are to turning this opportunity into a reality. The stakes could not be higher.

Conclusion: A turning point for African aviation

Aviation Africa Summit 2025 arrives at a critical time for the continent’s aviation industry. With passenger demand growing, Africa cannot afford to delay action on sustainability. SAF offers a practical and powerful pathway to cleaner skies and broader economic benefits. Experts agree that feedstock mobilisation, risk reduction, and policy alignment are the keys. With AfriSAF leading innovation, Rwanda showing regulatory leadership, and stakeholders uniting, the summit could mark a turning point.

Critics, including academics and policymakers, are calling for stronger regulation on the lifecycle emissions of SAF, including upstream emissions in, for example, agricultural production.","The retailer, best known for its fast fashion offer, has this month signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with German cargo airline Lufthansa Cargo to “explore a range of initiatives to drive the adoption of sustainable solutions for air freight”.

It has been confirmed that Lufthansa Cargo will, in the first instance, provide Shein with certificates proving that it is increasing the quantity of alternative airline fuels it uses.

The certificates will be aligned with third-party verification standards and evidence that the new fuels produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions over their lifecycle than conventional jet fuel.

While the alternative fuels may not be directly used on flights carrying Shein shipments, the certificates will enable Shein to account for the emissions reductions in its own corporate accounting.

Shein’s statement announcing the MoU stipulates that it will use emissions offsetting solutions linked to the Lufthansa Cargo certificates within six months. Both companies intend to pursue longer-term collaboration, the statement adds.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network,” said Shein’s general manager of global fulfilment, Ethan Shen.

“While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonisation strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency, and exploring other low-carbon solutions.”

Shein and Lufthansa will additionally explore closer cooperation on reporting environmental data, including emissions data, in a more traceable and credible way.

SAF FAQ

SAF is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning that it can be blended with conventional jet fuel to reduce the carbon intensity of an aircraft’s fuel batch. It is therefore more commercially viable at present than using hydrogen or electric propulsion for large planes.

The typical limit for blending SAF with conventional jet fuel is around 50%. Most flights operating using some SAF use a far smaller proportion, partly due to a lack of supply and high costs. SAF costs remain up to seven times higher than kerosene.

The International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) defines SAF as “a renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria”. However, the exact “sustainability criteria” depend on where and under which jurisdiction or regulation the fuel is ultimately intended to be used.

SAF is not without controversy. Critics, including academics and policymakers, are calling for stronger regulation on the lifecycle emissions of SAF, including upstream emissions in, for example, agricultural production.

They are also urging national governments not to bullishly pursue airport expansion, as the use of 100% SAF, electric or hydrogen planes is some years away.

Shein’s new net-zero target

Shein’s parent company, Roadgadget Business, recently had its 2050 net-zero target verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) – a decision which caused much backlash in the corporate sustainability space, given Shein’s significant emissions growth in recent years.

Shein posted a 175% increase in its absolute emissions across all scopes between 2021 and 2023.

In a new decarbonisation roadmap, Shein estimates that 96% of its total emissions in 2024 resulted from purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution. Its SBTi target requires an ambition of a 90% absolute reduction in Scope 3 (indirect) emissions by 2050, against a 2023 baseline.

Shein’s decarbonisation roadmap details plans to optimise air and trucking routes to reduce transportation distances; support road transport partners to adopt fuel-efficient trucks; and shift from air freight to sea and road freight where possible.

However, it does not include figures for the projected emissions reductions of these activities.

Sustainability consultancy Anthesis Group assisted Shein in producing the roadmap.

SWISS joins ‘neustark’ in carbon removal partnership

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Swiss start-up neustark, a pioneering company that has developed a novel method of permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The partnership is set to accelerate both the refinement of neustark’s technology and its international rollout, furthering SWISS’s broader efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

The aviation industry faces the challenge of balancing the benefits of global connectivity with the environmental impact of emissions. SWISS has set itself the target of reaching net-zero by mid-century, pursuing a combination of measures such as operating more fuel-efficient aircraft, adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and investing in solutions that permanently eliminate carbon dioxide. The partnership with neustark represents a key step in the airline’s strategy to mitigate its carbon footprint.

Neustark, a spin-off from ETH Zurich, is the first company worldwide to apply a process that stores carbon dioxide from biogas facilities into demolished and recycled concrete. The gas is mineralised within the building material, ensuring its permanent removal from the atmosphere while also contributing to the circular economy by repurposing construction waste. SWISS is the first airline to actively support this mineralisation technology, highlighting its intention to back innovative and scalable approaches to decarbonisation.

The agreement between SWISS and neustark runs until 2030, with provisions to extend its scope either by increasing the volumes of carbon dioxide processed or by prolonging the partnership’s duration. By committing early, SWISS is enabling neustark to advance its technology at pace and pursue expansion into new markets.

Together with the Lufthansa Group, SWISS is demonstrating leadership in tackling aviation’s environmental impact by fostering partnerships that can deliver meaningful and lasting carbon reductions.

SAFs are a ‘drop-in’ fuel and can be blended into fossil-based aviation fuels and used in existing aircraft without modification.

SAFs are considered sustainable because they have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional fossil-based jet fuels.

The roadmap sets out a number of actions which aim to encourage and support SAF production in Ireland.

Emissions

The aviation sector faces a particular challenge to decarbonise due to a lack of renewable alternatives. Internationally, air travel accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions related to the combustion of fossil fuels.

According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the full-flight CO2 emissions of all flights departing from EU27 European free trade association airports were estimated to be 133 million tonnes in 2023.

Current production

From a production, capacity and demand point of view, SAF is still at an early stage of development.

It is estimated that EU SAF supply was less than 0.05% of total jet fuel demand in 2020.

In its 2022 environmental report, the EASA estimated potential SAF production capacity at around 0.24 million tonnes. This still amounts to less than 10% of the amount required to reach the EU mandate of 6% by 2030.

Irish production

Ireland has no commercial SAF production. The roadmap outlines that, in the near term, Ireland will rely on imports.

Blending SAF with conventional aviation fuel is expected to take place abroad or at Irish fuel terminals, which may require port upgrades.

However, the roadmap identifies limited short-term potential through the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway, using local feedstocks such as tallow and used cooking oils. Volumes are likely to be low.

Medium-term opportunities lie in advanced biofuels from waste and residues, though supply and technology challenges also remain.

Long-term potential is centred on synthetic eSAF, supported by Ireland’s offshore renewable electricity ambitions of 37 gigawatts by 2050, which could provide the inputs needed for large-scale production.

This depends on successful wind deployment and policies such as the national hydrogen strategy.",https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ifj/WEBFILES/000/882/196/2422811-882196.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:01:20.027119

The UK Government says that they “underpin almost all economic activity and innovation, including the development of AI [artificial intelligence] and other technology, public service delivery, and how we interact with one another”.

In September 2024, the UK Government designated data centres as part of the country’s critical national infrastructure.

The UK data centre sector

Data centres can be categorised by their use and ownership:

Enterprise data centres: owned and operated by a single organisation for internal purposes.

Co-location data centres: the facility is operated by a third party that rents space to customers.

Hyperscale data centres: massive facilities built by major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

AI data centres: facilities specialised for the high-performance computing needs of AI development.

A data centre’s capacity is usually expressed as the maximum power it can draw, which determines how much IT equipment it can support. The UK had approximately 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of data centre capacity in 2024.

Most UK data centres are concentrated in Greater London, which is Europe’s largest data centre market. However, new hubs are emerging in places such as Manchester and South Wales.

Economic impact

As data centres do not have an industrial classification in the UK, it is difficult to identify their economic impact. techUK estimates that UK data centres have an annual gross value added (GVA) of £4.7 billion. This is based on an average from a range of international studies.

Data centres also support other sectors that benefit from data processing and storage services, including AI, cloud computing, and financial services.

Data centres are highly automated facilities and the number of jobs they create is relatively modes, particularly given their size and cost. A £10 billion campus in Blyth, Northumberland, which could house up to 10 data centres, is expected to directly create 400 full time jobs.

Why have data centres in the UK?

Preliminary analysis for the government found that UK data centre capacity could rise to between 3.3 GW and 6.3 GW by 2030, depending on policy interventions, but that this may not be enough to meet demand.

Although data can in principle be stored and accessed from anywhere in the world, there are several reasons for expanding data centre capacity within the UK, including:

to make it easier for UK organisations to access high-quality data processing power, enabling them to conduct research and develop new products and services.

to support the deployment of AI technologies: data needs to be processed close to the user for AI applications that require real-time decision-making, such as autonomous vehicles or remote healthcare. The government sees data centres as a key part of its proposed AI Growth Zones (AIGZs), through which it aims to establish AI innovation hubs across the UK.

to allow the UK Government to regulate data centres, such as by requiring them to meet cybersecurity standards and reduce their environmental impact.

Policy issues for data centres

Planning policy

Following December 2024 reforms to the government’s National Planning Policy Framework, which applies in England only, local authorities are required to consider the need for data centres when setting local policies and deciding planning applications. This change was welcomed by industry stakeholders, who had previously faced challenges getting approval for new developments. Additionally, AIGZs will have fast-track planning and infrastructure support for AI data centres.

Data centres will also be able to opt into the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) regime. NSIP applications are determined by the Secretary of State, rather than local planning authorities.

Planning policy in Scotland is supportive of data centres that utilise renewable energy produced in Scotland. Data centres are not mentioned in planning policy in Wales or Northern Ireland.

Energy consumption

Data centres currently consume around 2.5% of the UK’s electricity. The sector’s electricity consumption s expected to rise four-fold by 2030.

This has led to concerns about the sustainability of data centres. Major data centre operators have committed to achieving voluntary sustainability targets by 2030. They support renewables projects through power purchase agreements (PPAs), although some studies have questioned whether PPAs contribute to decarbonisation. Data centre operators are also exploring nuclear power, including small modular reactors, as a source of clean, reliable power.

Industry stakeholders and commentators have pointed to high energy price and grid capacity constraints as factors limiting the growth of the UK data centre sector. The Social Market Foundation, a think tank, has found that powering a data centre in the UK is more expensive than in other European markets, and four times more expensive than in the United States. This has led to calls for data centres to be included in energy-intensive industry support schemes and for reforms to electricity pricing.

Limited grid capacity means it can take years to get permission to connect to the national grid. The government has tried to improve the situation by reforming the connections process and prioritising strategically significant projects.

Water consumption

Cooling is essential to data centre operations, as they generate heat, and many facilities use water for cooling. Depending on the size and the cooling method used, data centres can consume large quantities of water.

The Environment Agency has criticised the lack data on how much water UK data centres consume. However, industry groups argue that water consumption is much lower in the UK than in the US, because UK data centres tend not to use water-intensive cooling methods. The government is working with the industry to improve transparency and efficiency.

Resilience

As data centres become more critical, their resilience to cyberattacks, power outages and climate risks is increasingly important. techUK argues that data centres designed in accordance with international standards are highly resilient.",https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/AdobeStock_631485302.jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 13:01:24.319814

As the United States eyes its 2030 target of producing three billion gallons of SAF per year, the national conversation around SAF has shifted towards an economic lens. In fact, the U.S. SAF industry aligns with current federal priorities focused on job creation, domestic manufacturing, and economic growth across multiple sectors of the U.S. economy.

Today, the U.S. SAF industry remains in its early commercial phase, with current domestic production capacity estimated between 20-30 million gallons per year, or roughly 2,000 barrels per day. This remains a fraction of U.S. jet fuel demand, which exceeds 16 billion gallons annually. This article examines the economic impacts of current and future SAF production as the industry is poised for growth.

Scaling Production, Investment, and Employment

U.S. SAF production is still in its early phases, with total U.S. output at less than 0.1% of national jet fuel consumption. Of the numerous pathways that exist for SAF production, the few commercial plants currently in operation are HEFA and alcohol to jet (ATJ) pathways. To scale the industry, more than $44 billion in private and public capital has already been committed to SAF projects, with the Department of Energy (DOE) projecting that this will be sufficient to scale production to three billion gallons per year by 2030, achieving a 10% penetration rate.

This level of capital deployment entails significant employment opportunity within the sector. A single commercial-scale SAF facility, designed to produce around 100 million gallons per year, creates an estimated 1,100 jobs annually during construction. To keep the facility running and operational, between 75-150 full-time operations and management (O&M) jobs are required. This scale puts SAF facilities in line with other renewable fuel producers like renewable diesel and ethanol producers. Positions are skilled, and highly local for construction, chemical processing, engineering, operations, and technical services.

Scaling this to the industry wide goal of three billion gallons, will require building up to 30 new facilities or expanding existing production facilities across the U.S. This rollout would generate an estimated 33,000 construction-phase jobs over the next five years and sustain up to 4,500 permanent direct O&M jobs across the industry once fully operational.

Beyond production facility based jobs, the SAF value chain contributes substantial employment through equipment manufacturing, fabrication, and supporting industries. DOE estimates that each $1 billion invested in SAF projects supports approximately 1,590 direct supply chain jobs. Applying this figure to the full $44 billion in committed investment yields an additional 70,000 supply chain jobs, distributed across industrial hubs nationwide, further amplifying the impactthat the growth of the SAF industry has on U.S. jobs, manufacturing, and overall economic output.

Feedstock, Agriculture, and Rural Job Creation

Beyond production facilities, SAF’s economic footprint extends into American agriculture and logistics. Feedstock sourcing represents a significant share of SAF’s employment impact, particularly for ATJ and Fischer-Tropsch pathways that rely on large volumes of biomass inputs. These pathways drive substantial upstream employment across the agriculture and agribusiness value chains.

A strong proxy for estimating these impacts is drawn from the ethanol industry, which shares similar agricultural and logistical characteristics to ATJ-based SAF. According to that industry, the U.S. ethanol sector supported approximately 264,000 agriculture-related jobs tied to the supply of 5.3 billion bushels of corn, resulting in the production of 15.6 billion gallons of ethanol. This translates to roughly 17,000 agriculture and logistics jobs per 1 billion gallons of fuel produced.

Applying a similar ratio to SAF, suggests that SAF feedstock sourcing could generate between 50,000 and 60,000 direct U.S. jobs by 2030 when production reaches 3 billion gallons per year. This projection is consistent with employment modeling conducted by DOE, which anticipates tens of thousands of new jobs emerging in feedstock production, transport, and pre-processing as SAF scales.

The employment profile differs by pathway. ATJ and FT SAF production will draw heavily from agricultural residues and forest biomass, supporting farming communities, rural transport hubs, and rail logistics networks. In contrast, HEFA production, which relies on fats, oils, and greases, creates fewer upstream jobs but still generates significant employment during facility construction and in specialized collection networks for used cooking oils and animal fats. Because SAF production integrates both agricultural and industrial supply chains, its rural employment impact is widespread, a key metric for cultivating policymaker support.

Growing SAF’s Economic Impact

In addition to driving employment, SAF production contributes substantial economic output and public revenue. Based on the current pipeline of announced projects, $44 billion in capital investment is expected to flow into U.S. SAF facilities, feedstock infrastructure, and equipment manufacturing by 2030. Drawing from comparable industry data, this level of spending should yield approximately $80-$100 billion in cumulative U.S. economic output. Tax revenues generated from this economic activity are equally significant. Using comparable industry benchmarks, the SAF buildout would yield an estimated $12-$18 billion in public revenues by 2030. Importantly, a high proportion of this output will remain domestic, ensuring that SAF investment translates into American jobs and manufacturing growth.

For policymakers, the SAF industry represents a smart, long-term investment in American productivity. The economic case for SAF is clear, the industry is a catalyst for American jobs and economic growth. The build out of SAF infrastructure supports skilled manufacturing, generates billions in tax revenue across a wide geography, and exemplifies American energy dominance.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/68a5d8b5441fd442d8bec1db/1756292391265/9.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-08-27 13:01:34.829573

Air France welcomed its 46th Airbus A220-300 aircraft, christened VAISON-LA-ROMAINE, which successfully completed its debut flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), significantly cutting lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. Compared to traditional jet fuels, the use of SAF in this journey reduced GHG emissions by over 25 tonnes, further demonstrating the immense potential that SAF has in transforming the aviation industry.

The Importance of SAF in Decarbonization

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is central to the aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is made from renewable resources, such as plant oils, agricultural waste, and even carbon captured from the air. This makes SAF a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels and a key component of the aviation industry’s efforts to address climate change.

The use of SAF on this milestone flight underscores Air France’s commitment to integrating sustainable fuels into its operations. The airline’s parent company, Air France-KLM, has become one of the world’s largest buyers of SAF, emphasizing the importance of SAF adoption in the airline’s broader sustainability strategy. By using SAF at delivery, Air France not only meets its sustainability goals but also sets an example for the industry by increasing transparency and accelerating the widespread adoption of SAF.

Airbus’s Commitment to SAF and Sustainable Aviation

As a key partner in Air France’s sustainability journey, Airbus is also making significant strides in SAF integration. The aircraft manufacturer has been progressively incorporating SAF into its production process and test flights. The company is working towards a future where SAF is standard across all its aircraft deliveries, with a goal of ensuring 100% SAF compatibility across all of its aircraft by 2030.

Since introducing SAF deliveries to its Mirabel site in Canada, Airbus has already been integrating SAF into the production, acceptance, and test flights of its A220 series. This initiative aligns with Airbus’s commitment to reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. In 2025, Airbus aims to cut CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes, equivalent to consuming 170,000 litres of pure SAF. This progressive shift in fuel usage highlights Airbus’s dedication to sustainable aviation and the ongoing advancement of SAF technology.

The Role of SAF in Lifecycle Emission Reductions

The SAF used on Air France’s Airbus A220-300 flight was certified to achieve a reduction of up to 85% in lifecycle emissions compared to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuel. This remarkable reduction is achieved through the mass balance system, which tracks SAF volumes alongside conventional Jet A-1 fuel. The system uses an auditable chain of custody approach, ensuring both the operational feasibility and transparency of SAF usage. By adopting this system, Airbus is reinforcing its role as a leader in sustainable aviation, delivering on the promise of significantly lower carbon emissions without sacrificing performance or safety.

This commitment to reducing lifecycle emissions is crucial for the aviation sector, as it moves towards meeting the global sustainability goals set by international organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). As more airlines adopt SAF, the collective impact on global emissions can be profound, helping the aviation industry make significant progress toward its carbon-neutral future.

Air France’s Role in the A220 Program

Air France has made the Airbus A220 family a cornerstone of its fleet renewal program, with the airline planning to operate a total of 60 A220 aircraft in the coming years. The A220 family, known for its cutting-edge technology, offers impressive fuel efficiency, with up to 25% lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft. This fuel efficiency, combined with the use of SAF, makes the A220-300 a crucial part of Air France’s strategy to achieve its sustainability goals.

Since the introduction of its first A220 in 2021, Air France has seen firsthand the benefits of this aircraft model, which is well-suited for medium-haul routes. The aircraft’s advanced aerodynamics, lightweight design, and efficient engines allow it to minimize its environmental impact while maintaining high levels of passenger comfort and operational efficiency.

The introduction of SAF into the A220 program further enhances the airline’s commitment to sustainability. By combining the advanced efficiency of the A220 with the adoption of SAF, Air France is setting a powerful example for other airlines to follow.

But the LPG sector’s infrastructure investments are shaping a renewable-ready sector for off-grid homes and businesses, explains Megan Healy

A mixed-technology future for off-grid heating

While the majority of net-zero headlines and the clean energy debate centres around electrification, for the UK’s 1.5 to 2 million homes off the gas grid the transition is more complex. For many of these homes, often older, rural, and hard-to-treat, the adoption of heat pumps presents multiple barriers.

According to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), 20% of rural homes are technically unsuitable for heat pumps.1 Independent research commissioned by trade association Liquid Gas UK suggests that up to 36% may face additional technical and financial barriers,2 such as a potential £32,000 retrofit cost for heat pumps in some off-grid properties.3

Other issues include capacity limitations with the electricity grid, particularly in rural locations. An aging infrastructure, much of the grid dates from the 1960s or earlier and has long lead times for grid expansion – planning approval and construction for grid reinforcements can take 7-14 years, creating a backlog of projects. With the demand for electrification expected to double by 2050,4 there is a strain on distribution and transmission, particularly during peak usage periods.

The UK’s LPG sector is one industry stepping up to provide a solution for these off-grid properties, having committed to a renewable future.

Across the sector, there’s growing momentum in the demand for renewable liquid gases, particularly those readily compatible with existing supply chains like bioLPG.

Produced from sustainable carbon rich feedstocks including used cooking oil, agricultural residues and municipal waste, bioLPG offers an immediate and low-disruption route to decarbonisation.

Achieving up to 90% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional LPG and heating oil , these ‘drop-in’ gases are chemically identical to traditional LPG, making them a straightforward heating alternative for off-grid properties and applications that are unsuited to electrification.

Advancing the renewable readiness of the liquid gas sector relies not just on the fuels themselves, but on the infrastructure that enables their storage, movement, and availability.

Major LPG suppliers such as Flogas Britain are laying the groundwork for a renewable-ready transition by upgrading key distribution hubs, expanding storage capacity, and making strategic investments that will shape the energy mix for decades to come.

Ivan Trevor, Managing Director at Flogas Britain, says: “Achieving net zero requires a balanced approach.

“Electrification is a key piece of the net zero journey but is not a viable solution for hard-to-abate properties and high-heat industrial applications. Renewable liquid gases provide a flexible and scalable lower carbon solution that works with existing boilers, tanks and appliances, and alongside other technologies.”

To facilitate this transition, pivotal investments are being made at two major storage and import facilities: Avonmouth in the Southwest and Teesside in the Northeast, demonstrating the industry’s commitment to a net zero future.

Storage at Avonmouth

At Avonmouth, Flogas has successfully repurposed a former liquid natural gas (LNG) peak-shaving facility – where excess natural gas is stored to meet peak energy demands – transforming it into the UK’s largest above-ground LPG storage site.

Capable of handling 34,564 tonnes of LPG, the redevelopment has already seen the conversion and commissioning of a 17,000-tonne tank, with plans underway to recommission a second tank for further storage. Additionally, a new jetty will be built at Bristol Port, and a 6km pipeline will be laid to facilitate seamless upstream transfers of imports and storage to the site.

Due to the chemical similarities of bioLPG with traditional LPG, the facility is readily-capable of storing and distributing renewable fuels with minimal technical changes.

“The facility is ready to take bioLPG today, and future-proofed in terms of handling other low-carbon fuels, such as rDME and potentially ammonia, with minimal technical modifications,” Mr Trevor explains.

Importing energy security

With limited domestic production of bioLPG, currently around just 3,000 tonnes annually, imports will play a critical role in scaling up the UK’s renewable supply, says Mr Trevor.

“Avonmouth’s future import capacity of up to 500,000 tonnes per year opens the door to global markets, particularly the United States, which has a more developed bioLPG industry and abundant feedstocks.

“With a different pace towards their own energy transition, producers in the US have a growing interest in co-production and a stronger financial incentive to focus on exports,” he explains.

Mr Trevor highlights that while bioLPG imports from the US will be key, the UK is looking to diversify its sources.

“There are other places in the world where bioLPG can be produced—anywhere LPG or oil refining occurs could potentially produce bio,” he says.

“We’re focused on expanding our options and enhancing access to global bioLPG markets to meet growing demand.”

Supply at Teesside

A tripartite deal between Flogas, Exolum and North Sea Midstream Partners (NSMP) has enabled the Teesside facility to redirect previously exported North Sea propane inland to unlock LPG and bioLPG blends for customers across the UK.

By recommissioning storage, and transporting excess supply to the Avonmouth facility, Flogas is using the Teesside site to provide up to 90,000 tonnes of LPG each year to rural off-grid customers in both domestic and industry settings.

Renewable blends are also expected to become integrated into the Teesside supply in the future.

“Avonmouth is a game changer in terms of winter resilience due to its strategic location and storage capacity. Teesside, meanwhile, is bringing product that was once unavailable back inland to the UK market, improving energy resilience with groundwork being laid for blending bio into that stream,” explains Mr Trevor.

“Together, Avonmouth and Teesside form a complementary model, combining long-term storage and import capabilities at one end of the country with newly accessible domestic supply at the other.

“With these two sites working in tandem, a significant portion of the UK can be reliably supplied with LPG and bioLPG, bolstering our energy security and strengthening the resilience of our off-grid energy sector,” he says.

Building momentum on the way to decarbonisation

Flogas Britain, who are members of Liquid Gas UK, the trade association for the LPG and renewable liquid gases industry, is one major name at the forefront of driving the shift towards renewable liquid gases, however the momentum is a cross-industry partnership.

Member organisations are clear that collaboration is a key component of success, with parent companies SHV Energy (Calor) and DCC (Flogas) signing a memorandum of understanding to promote the renewable fuel development.

This partnership, alongside the Teesside tripartite deal, shows the industry is using joined-up thinking across the supply chain.

George Webb, CEO of Liquid Gas UK, says: “To achieve net zero, a balanced approach is needed, one that includes renewable liquid gases, which provide a flexible, cost-effective solution that works with existing systems and meets the needs of industry and consumers alike.

“Our members are committed to helping the UK transition to renewable energy, supporting hard-to-decarbonise sectors with significant investment and future-proofed infrastructure.”

With 80% of the national gas grid expected to be decommissioned by 2050, natural gas energy prices could rocket, impacting urban homeowners too, meaning transitionary fuels have a role to play beyond the off-grid sector, according to Mr Webb.

“Some homes and entire British high-heat industries risk becoming stranded without affordable heating alternatives in the future.

“This puts the investments from the LPG industry firmly in the spotlight, as there is potential for 50% of renewable liquid gas demand to come from on-grid homes transitioning away from the national gas grid due to the combination of increased fossil fuel costs, and high installation costs of heat pumps,” he says.

Future proofing through policy

However, the transition to renewable liquid gases isn’t just about switching fuels; building the infrastructure must go hand in hand with a supportive policy framework to enable large-scale adoption.

Mr Trevor explains: “You’ve got customers who want to decarbonise, and we are creating the ability to transition them from fossil to renewable liquid gas by importing and storing both gases through the same facility.

“This means we are not only improving national energy resilience, we’re delivering the potential for a more seamless energy transition for those customers at the same time.”

In addition to supporting and safeguarding the energy supply for rural homes and businesses, the future of the LPG industry includes economic growth with the potential to support a total of 12,500 jobs as the industry matures.

To this end, industry leaders are calling for clear recognition of renewable liquid fuels within the UK’s future energy mix, similar to how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been backed to decarbonise aviation.

“If the government provides certainty that renewable gases will be part of the fuel mix, it gives confidence for future investment in production and infrastructure,” says Mr Trevor.

“The sector is ready to step up – the infrastructure is being built, the supply chains are forming, but to maximise the full benefits of energy security, affordability and emissions reduction, the government must ensure a level playing field for all technologies.

“This will create a more just energy transition, stimulating greater demand for bio, which has a lot to offer the economy,” he says. Mr Webb adds: “Net zero won’t be achieved with a one-size-fits-all mentality, and government must support rural communities, who often face the steepest barriers.

“The UK’s renewable readiness is no longer a future goal – thanks to sites like Avonmouth and Teesside it’s already underway – what’s needed now is alignment between industry progress and supportive policy to drive it home.”",https://envirotecmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/FLOGAS-1200px.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 05:56:43.057164

The document relies on a task force bringing together government, airports, airlines, and academia. Its purpose is to identify barriers to imports and future production, and to prioritize initial actions that can evolve over time.

European framework and blending mandates

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation sets minimum shares of SAF in fuel delivered to European Union airports: 2% in 2025, 6% in 2030, and 20% in 2035, with sub-targets for synthetic fuels starting in 2030. These objectives are monitored by European agencies and integrated into the broader climate policy framework.

According to the roadmap, projected Irish demand would reach 88,000 t in 2030 and 318,000 t in 2035. The document also highlights that a European pipeline of eSAF (Power-to-Liquid, PtL, synthetic aviation fuel) of about 1.1 Mt by 2030 had not yet reached final investment decisions, underscoring the gap between global supply and the volumes required by ReFuelEU.

Costs, support mechanisms and price signals

The roadmap emphasizes the price gap between fossil kerosene and SAF, partly offset by European instruments. The European Union’s emissions trading system allocates 20 million free allowances to aviation from 2024 to 2030 to help bridge the price difference at incorporation. In parallel, the EU announced in 2025 a subsidy scheme covering up to €6/l for e-fuels and €0.5/l for biofuels, financed by the sale of part of the allowances.

Public estimates converge on a significant cost premium for SAF: two to seven times higher than fossil fuel under most scenarios, and even more for synthetic fuels. These figures explain the need for long-term offtake contracts and targeted incentives during the scale-up phase.

Industrial pathways and energy resources

The document identifies three horizons of production: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) through co-processing in the short term, advanced biofuels from agricultural and forestry residues in the medium term, and eSAF/PtL based on hydrogen and CO₂ in the long term. Competitiveness will depend on feedstock availability, electricity costs, and technological maturity.

Ireland explicitly links the eSAF option to its offshore wind ambitions: at least 37 GW of installed capacity by 2050, supported by grid reinforcement. The 2025 budget allocates around €750 million to accelerate grid investments, a prerequisite for large-scale eSAF production.

Airline demand and deployment trajectory

Irish-based carriers have set targets consistent with ReFuelEU: Aer Lingus aims for 10% SAF in 2030, and Ryanair 12.5% by the same year. These trajectories depend on supply agreements and the regional availability of volumes compliant with European standards. Several airlines and industry associations have warned of the risk of missing 2030 targets without lower costs and faster investment.

The ministry notes that the roadmap is an evolving document, designed to be updated as barriers to imports and production become clearer and as European and international instruments are refined. Monitoring will rely on the Task Force, regular consultations, and European reporting, guiding industrial priorities and support mechanisms.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/en_1140250842540-2-1.webp,N,,2025-08-27 05:57:03.177373

,,2025-08-27 03:25:48+00:00,DTN Progressive Farmer,Deputy Secretary: USDA Eyes 'Bridge' Policy for Farmers as Crop Prices Remain Low,Chris Clayton,,,,,https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/columns/washington-insider/article/2025/08/26/deputy-secretary-usda-eyes-bridge,"DECATUR, Ill. (DTN) -- Deputy Agriculture Secretary Stephen Vaden suggested Tuesday that USDA officials are looking at a ""bridge"" policy that would help crop farmers facing low commodity prices until stronger price supports take effect next year.
The National Association of Farmer Elected Committees (NAFEC) wrote to other farm groups last month, raising concerns about local staffing levels.
The NAFEC leadership said, ""the staffing levels in our counties have never been lower.""
Vaden said USDA would not be asking for temporary or permanent FSA staffing levels.
""We did it with our current staffing levels.","DECATUR, Ill. (DTN) -- Deputy Agriculture Secretary Stephen Vaden suggested Tuesday that USDA officials are looking at a ""bridge"" policy that would help crop farmers facing low commodity prices until stronger price supports take effect next year.

Vaden represented the Trump administration on Tuesday at the Farm Progress Show. He spoke about issues such as expanding markets and trying to hold trading partners accountable. He also said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins could not attend because of a Cabinet meeting where she would brief President Donald Trump about the state of the agricultural economy ""as we head into harvest and what we need to do to bridge this year to next year.""

Vaden pointed out the higher commodity safety net in the One Big Beautiful Bill, but higher Agricultural Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage (ARC and PLC) programs won't pay out until October 2026 for the 2025-26 crop. Improvements to crop insurance premium subsidies and higher coverage levels for most crops won't start until crops are planted next year as well.

""We have got to get to '26, and that's what we're talking about now,"" Vaden said.

Asked by DTN about what a ""bridge"" looks like, Vaden said, ""We're seeing the same thing that farmers are seeing with regard to commodity prices, and we know that many of the most important pieces of the One Big Beautiful Bill don't come into effect until 2026,"" he said.

The Commodity Credit Corp. (CCC) will be replenished for the next fiscal year, likely around November, Vaden noted.

""That's after harvest is completed for our corn and soybean farmers, so we've got to get them from this growing season to the next growing season.""

The Trump administration in 2018-19 tapped the CCC for more than $23 billion for commodity producers primarily to support declines in crop prices due to the trade war with China. It's possible a similar scenario could come into play, though Vaden didn't specifically spell that out in his comments.

Vaden pointed out USDA has paid more than $8 billion in Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP) aid payments for 2024 crop losses and another $4 billion in the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program for at least some of the crop and livestock losses in 2023 and 2024. Vaden noted there should be some future announcements in September for farmers to file other disaster claims for 2023 and 2024 crop losses that were not covered by crop insurance.

In regard to current market conditions, Vaden added, ""We are seeking to develop policy solutions to help bridge that, and that's what the secretary and I are working on, and what she's constantly talking to not only the president but other members of her cabinet about. You can rest assured that when we have those announcements to make, we'll do it.""

THERE ARE ENOUGH FSA STAFFERS TO MEET WORKLOAD

Vaden also rejected the notion that there are not enough Farm Service Agency (FSA) staff at county offices to handle the load of new programs or disaster aid.

The National Association of Farmer Elected Committees (NAFEC) wrote to other farm groups last month, raising concerns about local staffing levels. Like other agencies, FSA has seen a wave of people take early retirements and buyouts. The NAFEC leadership said, ""the staffing levels in our counties have never been lower."" While ""already at a breaking point,"" FSA staff were implementing aid programs while now have to develop 30 million more base acres that were added to farm programs in the budget reconciliation bill. NAFEC called on farm groups to press Congress to help FSA with staffing levels.

""Without staffing increases, critical services will be impacted,"" NAFEC wrote.

Vaden said USDA would not be asking for temporary or permanent FSA staffing levels. He said FSA staff had released ECAP and disaster program payments in record times through FSA.

""We did it with our current staffing levels. We did it so where our producers received their money in three business days after they submitted the form, and the forms were already preprinted, and all they had to do was sign, in most cases,"" Vaden said. ""That is the fastest roll out of any commodity assistance program in USDA's entire history. So, if we were having staffing level issues, how would that be possible? The answer is, it wouldn't, and we're not.""

PRESSING FOR MARKETS WITH TRADE

Vaden repeatedly said the only way for commodity prices to increase is with higher demand. He touched on announcements such as England committing to buy U.S. ethanol and Japan agreeing to buy sustainable aviation fuel from the U.S., though that production has yet to develop.

""You can bet that on every conversation that we're going to have with administration officials from whatever department, opening up new markets, focusing on the commodity price and focusing on the possible record yields we are seeing this fall, is first and foremost in every conversation that we are having.""

Recognizing Brazil is a major competitor for the U.S. when selling to China, Vaden said he believed the Trump administration's investigation into Brazilian trade practices such as import tariffs on ethanol or Brazil's deforestation would help show that Brazil is unfairly competing against U.S. corn and soybean farmers. Vaden suggested the results of that investigation would somehow help U.S. commodities increase sales.

""When we're producing the yields that we're producing on a sustainable basis, that we're producing without any environmental harm, and we're committing and we are competing rather against people who are literally burning down a forest to expand their agricultural productivity, that's something that's difficult to compete with,"" Vaden said. ""That's not an even playing field. We're not going to tolerate that, and that's why we've got this investigation going, because our farmers should not be competing with people who are not playing on a level playing field.""

(SOCAR) A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) covering cooperation in the field of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) was signed between SOCAR Turkey and Turkish Airlines at a ceremony held at Turkish Airlines Headquarters on August 13, 2025. Senior executives from both institutions attended the ceremony, and the signed memorandum was considered a strategic step toward a sustainability-focused transformation in the energy and aviation sectors.

Speaking at the ceremony, SOCAR Turkey CEO Elchin Ibadov emphasized that sustainability is one of SOCAR Turkey's key priorities, saying: “As SOCAR Turkey, we have a strong infrastructure for sustainable aviation fuel production thanks to the high production capacity of our group company, STAR Refinery, our advanced refinery technologies, our modern operations focused on digitalization, and our R&D efforts. Our technical know-how and integrated business model in the energy sector enable us to produce not only the fuels of today but also the fuels of the future.”

Aware of our responsibility to the future, we view sustainability as an integral part of our business practices and act with a transformation approach that considers environmental and social impacts. In line with this understanding, this strategic step taken together with Turkish Airlines is an initiative that will contribute to the vision of a more sustainable world not only for our sectors, but also for future generations. Considering Türkiye's strategic position in the aviation sector, we are pleased to be collaborating on this process with a strong global brand like Turkish Airlines.

I wholeheartedly believe that these efforts, which deepen our existing partnership in the jet fuel sector around sustainability, are just the beginning of our journey, and that together we can create much greater impact. I thank everyone who contributed to the realization of this shared vision, especially Turkish Airlines management. I hope this collaboration will be beneficial for our institutions, our country, and our region.

In his speech, Turkish Airlines CEO Bilal Ekşi emphasized the importance of this collaboration for sectoral transformation, stating: “As Turkish Airlines, we are taking steps in line with international targets for emission reduction in our operations. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is one of the most concrete and applicable tools on this journey. This agreement we signed with SOCAR Turkey elevates our strong fuel supply partnership to a new dimension that can deliver environmental benefits.”

This step will not only create an alternative fuel supply but will also pave the way for efforts to integrate SAF into our operations and increase production capacity in this area. As Turkish Airlines, we aim to contribute to the sustainability goals of the global aviation sector while also increasing our country's potential in this area. The future of global aviation will be shaped not by unilateral efforts, but by strong and committed partnerships. Therefore, we believe that this process we have initiated with SOCAR Turkey will create long-term value for both our institutions and our country's aviation sector. I hope our collaboration will be beneficial to all our stakeholders.

With the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding, the existing jet fuel cooperation will also be extended to the SAF field, while this partnership will also form the basis for the implementation of broader projects aimed at regional sustainability goals.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 19:56:09.890388

PCFs are critical to driving decarbonization and achieving our near-term science-based target of a 32.5% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2033 (from a 2022 baseline) and longer-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. PCFs must be accurate and comparable in order to be used in procurement decisions and drive GHG reductions. RMI’s guidance helps ensure accuracy and comparability as we analyze upstream emissions and provide our own PCFs to customers, in line with PACT, TfS, and GHG Protocol guidance.""

- Robert Flores, Amcor, VP, Sustainability Operations & Advocacy – Americas

Plastics production currently accounts for over 4% of GHG emissions, a share that continues to rise faster than other oil and gas products due to increasing demand in major end-use sectors such as packaging, textiles, and construction materials. The embodied emissions of an otherwise identical plastic product can vary significantly depending on the fossil feedstock type, extraction practices, monomer plant operations, methane management performance, and the electricity sources in downstream processes like molding and extrusion. Reducing climate risk requires both cutting unnecessary plastic use and lowering emissions from essential products. Yet climate pollution from production remains underrecognized in plastics, often overshadowed by concerns around waste and recycling. Despite existing emissions accounting standards and guidance, companies often lack the tools to assess plastic products' climate impact. Gaps remain particularly in the conversion step, which accounts for up to 38% of a plastic product’s embodied emissions. This is especially true when it comes to capturing methane intensity and evaluating recycling methods that align with the sector’s decarbonization pathways. These gaps hinder informed, low-emissions purchasing and design decisions. To address these challenges, RMI and Amcor pilot-tested RMI’s Plastic Conversion PCF Guidance with emissions collected from suppliers to explore practical emissions reporting and how it can drive industry decarbonization.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/headshot_placeholder.png,N,,2025-08-26 22:56:16.044165

This delivery flight solidifies Airbus’ commitment to using SAF for customer ferry flights and internal operations across its global commercial aircraft assembly sites.","An Air France Airbus A220 has completed its delivery flight from Airbus’ facility in Mirabel, Canada, to Paris, powered by a 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend.

This event represents a further step toward sustainable aviation, as Airbus in Canada issued official sustainability credentials for SAF directly to a customer for the first time.

The flight showcases Airbus’ commitment to supporting the aviation industry’s decarbonization goals.

Delivery of Air France A220 on SAF

The landmark delivery flight of Air France’s 46th A220-300, named “Vaison-la-Romaine,” used a 50% SAF blend. This reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by over 25 tonnes compared to traditional fossil fuels.

This reduction was verified through Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) credits, issued under the CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme approved by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

These credentials confirm that the SAF used in Mirabel achieves an 85% reduction in GHG emissions over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel.

Blaise Brigaud, Senior Vice President of Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM, emphasized the importance of this milestone. “Fleet renewal and sustainable aviation fuel are the two key pillars of aviation decarbonization.”

“Combining them is a logical step. Air France-KLM is proud to contribute to this Airbus achievement with our A220 delivery flight. As one of the world’s largest buyers of SAF, we see direct SAF delivery as a game-changer, enhancing transparency and advancing industry progress,” Brigaud said.

SAF Integration into Mirabel Flight Ops

Airbus has been integrating SAF into its operations at Mirabel since announcing its use for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights.

This delivery flight solidifies Airbus’ commitment to using SAF for customer ferry flights and internal operations across its global commercial aircraft assembly sites.

Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada gave further comment. “In 2025, we expect to reduce CO2 emissions by about 400 metric tonnes at Mirabel. We are incorporating 170,000 litres of pure SAF into our operations.”

“This ferry flight, with PoS credits for a 50% SAF blend, is a key milestone. This is especially so as we approach Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year.”

The A220, like all Airbus aircraft, is certified to operate with up to 50% SAF. Airbus is aiming for 100% SAF compatibility across its fleet by 2030.

In the first half of 2025, 78% of Airbus aircraft deliveries worldwide included a SAF blend. This highlights the growing emphasis customers place on sustainable practices.

SAF management at Mirabel follows the mass balance model. This is a widely accepted method where certified SAF volumes are tracked from input to output. It is blended with conventional Jet A-1 fuel per industry standards.

This ensures accurate accounting and compliance with sustainability certifications.

Conclusion

Air France’s A220-300s, part of a 60-aircraft order, have been operating on its medium-haul network since October 2021.

The A220 offers up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to older aircraft, making it a cornerstone of Air France’s sustainability strategy.

This delivery flight underscores the aviation industry’s collective push toward a decarbonized future by 2050, with SAF and modern aircraft playing pivotal roles.",https://aviationsourcenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airbus_and_air_france_complete_inaugural_saf_a220_ferry_flight-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 19:56:36.383936

All Airbus aircraft currently in production can operate with up to 50% SAF. The manufacturer is aiming for compatibility at up to 100% SAF by 2030.

Airbus Canada CEO Benoît Schultz said the company’s Mirabel site is projected to cut carbon emissions by around 440 tons this year through the use of almost 45,000 gallons of SAF integrated into operations.

Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. The airline said its newest A220, nicknamed “Vaison-La-Romaine,” will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 tons during its lifetime compared to an aircraft using fossil fuels.

Airbus and Air France-KLM said the ferry flight is part of a broader partnership between the two companies aimed at financing the purchase of SAF, which can cost between two and seven times as much as conventional jet fuel. Air France gives Airbus employees traveling for work the option of donating money toward the purchase of SAF, which the carrier said offsets some of the environmental impact of their trip.

Airbus estimates that, since the beginning of the partnership in November 2023, it has cut its emissions by more than 2,000 tons of carbon through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF.

SAF can be produced from sources such as plants, algae, tallows, solid biomass, waste oils, and some natural vegetable oils.

Still, the omission of air navigation infrastructure undermines the N712 billion investment in the project. An airport without ANS is a warehouse – a monument to incomplete strategy, writes WOLE SHADARE

The rebuilding of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMA) Terminal One in Lagos initially came with its controversy, given what some described as ‘outrageous’.

The plan to spend N712 billion on a total overhaul of the terminal that has outlived its usefulness to many is a step in the right direction, considering how dilapidated the terminal has become and the shame it has conferred on Nigeria and Nigerians.

A visit to the MMA terminal reveals the seriousness the government has attached to giving the country a world-class airport facility.

No Nigerian airport is among the ten best airports in Africa despite the country’s huge aviation market and a burgeoning domestic aviation industry.

Missing from the global ranking

The 2025 best airports in Africa, ranked by Skytrax, are the Cape Town Airport, South Africa, and King Shaka International Airport, Durban, OR. Tambo International Airport, Johannesburg; three airports in South Africa that came first, second and third, respectively. Others are Cabablanca, Mauritius, Marrakech, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Nairobi.

Nigerian airports often receive low rankings due to a combination of factors, including poor infrastructure, inadequate facilities, and inefficient service delivery.

Many Nigerian airports suffer from outdated infrastructure, including dilapidated runways, inadequate terminal space, and poorly maintained equipment and navigational facilities.

Common problems include poor maintenance, non-functioning equipment like air conditioning, crowded and disorganised environments with touts, and issues with luggage handling, all of which fall short of both local and international standards

While some improvements have been made, issues like inadequate air conditioning, dysfunctional equipment, and overcrowding persist, impacting the overall passenger experience.

It would be recalled that in 2014, three Nigerian airports were rated among the worst in Africa. While the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, was rated 10th worst in Africa, the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja and Port Harcourt International Airport, Port Harcourt, were ranked the seventh and sixth worst airports on the continent. Going by that ranking, Nigeria’s principal gateway airport in Lagos is the worst in Africa.

Automation

The key to getting Nigerian airports out of their present mess lies in investments in automation of most of the processes that deal with passengers and luggage, as well as in the general cleanliness of airports in the country.

Nigeria stands at an inflection point. The allocation of ₦712 billion to transform Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) into a world-class hub is visionary.

Exclusion

Yet, this investment carries a critical vulnerability: the exclusion of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA). This omission threatens to undermine every naira invested.

The decision by the management of NAMA to overhaul the country’s airspace infrastructure gives a fillip to the seriousness the Federal Government attaches to aviation infrastructure and the capacity to close the country’s aviation infrastructure gaps by commencing a comprehensive audit of the entire Kano Flight Information Region (FIR), also known as the Nigerian airspace.

The exercise which commenced last week Tuesday is a systematic self-assessment audit by the agency targeted at examining the overall safety performance, operational efficiency and regulatory compliance of the Nigerian airspace as well as strengthening NAMA’s readiness for the impending Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) Certification by Nigerian Civil Aviation Agency (NCAA) and the forthcoming ICAO Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (USOAP) Coordinated Validation Mission (ICVM) and Regional Office Safety Team (ROST) Mission.

ICAO divides the world’s airspace into Flight Information Regions (FIRs) to provide Air Traffic Services (ATS). Each FIR is officially recognised and published in ICAO documents and aeronautical charts.

FIRs are typically named after the city or location of the Area Control Centre (ACC) responsible for managing that airspace. The ACC is the central unit providing en-route air traffic control and coordination within the FIR.

Designating Nigeria’s airspace

Nigeria’s airspace is internationally designated by ICAO as the Kano Flight Information Region (FIR) because Kano was the country’s first international aviation hub and home to the pioneer Area Control Centre responsible for managing over-flight and en-route traffic. For continuity and global recognition, ICAO retained the name Kano FIR, and it today covers the entire Nigerian airspace as well as portions of the Gulf of Guinea delegated to Nigeria.

According to him, “This audit is a landmark initiative, the first of its kind in NAMA’s 25-year history, and it marks a bold and proactive step by the agency to reinforce its mandate of delivering safe, efficient, and seamless air navigation services in full alignment with international best practices.

An airport without advanced Air Navigation Services (ANS) is infrastructure without intelligence.

MMIA’s runways, terminals, and aprons are the body. The agency’s CNS/ATM (Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management) is the central nervous system. Without the latter, the former cannot function in the agency’s journey towards excellence in airspace management.

Strategic error, consequences

Allocating ₦712 billion exclusively to physical infrastructure while ignoring ANS violates ICAO’s fundamental principle of integrated aviation systems (ICAO Doc 9750), ignores global best practices (Dubai, Singapore, South Africa) where ANS receives 20–30% of major airport funding.

Over time, the country’s radars, especially the Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria (TRACON), are obsolete and unreliable communications increasing mid-air collision risks. Lagos TMA handles 60% of Nigeria’s air traffic with 1980s-era systems.

Without Category III Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), MMIA’s new runways will fail during harmattan – costing airlines ₦28 million/hour in delays (AON Data, 2023). Surface Movement Radar (SMR) gaps make runway incursions 47% more likely (NCAA Safety Audit, 2023).

Consequently, airlines lose $50M/year in fuel and delays due to ANS inefficiencies. Investor confidence erodes or collapses when airports lack ANS resilience could be likened to building Eko Atlantic City without sea walls, while building an airport without ANS is a catastrophe.

Experts’ views

An expert who spoke to Aviation Metric under strict conditions called on the Federal Government to reallocate 20% (N142 billion) of the entire Lagos airport terminal cost to NAMA to tackle decaying airspace infrastructure at many of the country’s airports.

The reallocation of funds to NAMA would help to replace or repair are Lagos ACC automation upgrade to prevent ATC bottlenecks at 40+flights/hours, CAT 3 ILS for MMIA runways to enable 24/7 all-weather operations.

Others are Surface Movement Radar (SMR) to eliminate runway incursions, ATCO recruitment and training to fill 42% staffing deficit and cyber security to prevent system-wide collapses.

He, however, called for a public dashboard tracking all ₦712bn expenditures (including NAMA’s portion) with the engagement of Independent auditors (PwC/Deloitte) validating milestones.

His words, “This is your chance to cement a legacy of integrated, safety-focused aviation transformation. The world is watching. For the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, delivering MMIA as a true hub requires ANS. Excluding NAMA sets your vision up for public failure. Airlines’ profitability hinges on efficient airspace.”

“The ₦712 billion MMIA project is a down payment on Nigeria’s future. But an airport without ANS is a warehouse – a monument to incomplete strategy. Amend the allocation immediately to include allocation for NAMA to tackle airspace navigation infrastructure.”

Chief Executive Officer of Belujane Konsult, Mr. Chris Azu Aligbe, said NAMA has the right to call for an upgrade on facilities, stressing that this is necessary and should be taken.

Air Navigation Service (ANS)

“The government needs to invest in aviation infrastructure beyond terminals. Not only terminals that make up aviation. They should bring these things to the public forum. They should let us know what type of airports they are building, the capacity of the airport after it has been completed. How many years are they projecting that this airport will last before we rebuild it again”?

Last line

MMIA’s runways, terminals, and aprons are the body. NAMA’s CNS/ATM (Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management) is the central nervous system. Without the latter, the former cannot function.

Following their alliance last June, H2V and Hy2gen – two leading players in the production of green hydrogen and synthetic fuels – have signed an agreement with Marseille Provence Airport (AMP) to support the development of sustainable aviation fuels.

These fuels, known as e-SAF (electro-sustainable aviation fuel), can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 86% compared to conventional kerosene. Production is planned for the H2V and Hy2gen site under development in Fos-sur-Mer, on land owned by the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille, with commissioning targeted for 2030.

This date is strategic as the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, adopted by the European Union in 2023, requires the progressive incorporation of e-SAF from 2030. These fuels are blended with kerosene, enabling aircraft to cut their carbon emissions without any modifications.

Hy2gen and H2V have joined forces to ensure that the Aix-Marseille-Provence metropolitan area will be able to supply this sustainable aviation fuel locally from 2030. The project is fully aligned with the decarbonisation plan for industrial and port activities, as well as the national low-carbon roadmap.

This is why Marseille Provence Airport – which has already undertaken efforts to further its energy and ecological transition and sustainable growth – expressed its support as early as the project’s development phase. Looking forward, AMP intends for e-kerosene refuelling to be available to airlines directly on the airport site, and in volumes exceeding the mandates set by the European Union. The airport also aims to play an active role in developing an industrial sector through production projects based in the region.

It is therefore only natural that AMP should give its full support to the industry, and today the three partners are announcing the signing of a partnership, starting from the development phase of the Fos-sur-Mer project, covering:

Technical collaboration to facilitate the deployment of e-kerosene at the airport;

Consideration of a possible equity stake by Marseille Provence Airport in the “project company” dedicated to the aviation sector.

This collaboration marks another step towards the creation of a French sustainable aviation fuel industry. It also paves the way for future cooperation with other stakeholders, with the aim of establishing a regional low-carbon energy hub.

Julien Coffinier, Chairman of the Executive Board of AMP: “We are proud of this first step, which will foster the development of synthetic fuels by 2030, produced close to the airport and helping to reduce CO₂ emissions. This agreement complements the forthcoming local production of fuels from biomass, available from 2026, enabling airlines to exceed European Union requirements. It is another milestone on the road to making Marseille Provence Airport a competitive hub in Europe for sustainable fuels.”

Julien Marteau, CEO of Hy2gen France: “This is a strategic partnership for an ambitious project that is vital to the future of air transport. The first of its kind to be launched in the Marseille Provence region, it reflects the commitment of all players in the sector, particularly airports, to deploying synthetic fuels as a means of decarbonising aviation. From 2030, Hy2gen and H2V will supply e-SAF to Marseille Provence Airport, enabling airlines to comply with European regulations.”

Alexis Martinez, CEO of H2V: “Our partnership strengthens the foundation and strategic importance of the H2V/Hy2gen project for the decarbonisation of aviation in the Southern Region, and we are convinced that this collaboration will accelerate the roll-out of the sector across the Marseille-Fos area.”

By signing an agreement to promote the deployment of e-kerosene at the airport, Marseille Provence Airport, H2V and Hy2gen are taking another step forward in the low-carbon transition of air transport.

Following their alliance last June, H2V and Hy2gen – two leading players in the production of green hydrogen and synthetic fuels – have signed an agreement with Marseille Provence Airport (AMP) to support the development of sustainable aviation fuels.

These fuels, known as e-SAF (electro-sustainable aviation fuel), can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 86% compared to conventional kerosene. Production is planned for the H2V and Hy2gen site under development in Fos-sur-Mer, on land owned by the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille, with commissioning targeted for 2030.

This date is strategic as the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, adopted by the European Union in 2023, requires the progressive incorporation of e-SAF from 2030. These fuels are blended with kerosene, enabling aircraft to cut their carbon emissions without any modifications.

Hy2gen and H2V have joined forces to ensure that the Aix-Marseille-Provence metropolitan area will be able to supply this sustainable aviation fuel locally from 2030. The project is fully aligned with the decarbonisation plan for industrial and port activities, as well as the national low-carbon roadmap.

This is why Marseille Provence Airport – which has already undertaken efforts to further its energy and ecological transition and sustainable growth – expressed its support as early as the project’s development phase. Looking forward, AMP intends for e-kerosene refuelling to be available to airlines directly on the airport site, and in volumes exceeding the mandates set by the European Union. The airport also aims to play an active role in developing an industrial sector through production projects based in the region.

It is therefore only natural that AMP should give its full support to the industry, and today the three partners are announcing the signing of a partnership, starting from the development phase of the Fos-sur-Mer project, covering:

Technical collaboration to facilitate the deployment of e-kerosene at the airport;

Consideration of a possible equity stake by Marseille Provence Airport in the “project company” dedicated to the aviation sector.

This collaboration marks another step towards the creation of a French sustainable aviation fuel industry. It also paves the way for future cooperation with other stakeholders, with the aim of establishing a regional low-carbon energy hub.

Julien Coffinier, Chairman of the Executive Board of AMP: “We are proud of this first step, which will foster the development of synthetic fuels by 2030, produced close to the airport and helping to reduce CO₂ emissions. This agreement complements the forthcoming local production of fuels from biomass, available from 2026, enabling airlines to exceed European Union requirements. It is another milestone on the road to making Marseille Provence Airport a competitive hub in Europe for sustainable fuels.”

Julien Marteau, CEO of Hy2gen France: “This is a strategic partnership for an ambitious project that is vital to the future of air transport. The first of its kind to be launched in the Marseille Provence region, it reflects the commitment of all players in the sector, particularly airports, to deploying synthetic fuels as a means of decarbonising aviation. From 2030, Hy2gen and H2V will supply e-SAF to Marseille Provence Airport, enabling airlines to comply with European regulations.”

Alexis Martinez, CEO of H2V: “Our partnership strengthens the foundation and strategic importance of the H2V/Hy2gen project for the decarbonisation of aviation in the Southern Region, and we are convinced that this collaboration will accelerate the roll-out of the sector across the Marseille-Fos area.”

Decarbonised Hydrogen: Realistic Prospects for a Sustainable Future The decarbonised hydrogen industry is an emerging sector that follows a typical technological maturation curve.","Decarbonised Hydrogen: A Key Lever for Decarbonisation

Hydrogen is used as a raw material in several industries with high CO2 emissions, such as oil refining, steel production, and the manufacture of fertilisers and chemicals. With appropriate adaptations, it can also substitute natural gas in industrial furnaces, thereby contributing to emission reductions in sectors such as cement and steel.

It also plays a growing role in decarbonising the transport sector. On the road, it's found in fuel cell electric vehicles or in hydrogen combustion engines. In maritime and air transport, hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) serve as low-carbon alternatives to replace petroleum-based fuels.

This significant potential has led to a wave of announcements for green and blue hydrogen production projects globally since 2020.

The Global Surge in Hydrogen Projects

To track this rapidly evolving sector, Enerdata has developed a tool that lists all large-scale decarbonised hydrogen projects. Currently, over 830 projects are listed worldwide, each with an electrolyser capacity of at least 100 MW. These have the potential to produce approximately 200 million tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen, as well as 470 million tonnes of clean derivatives (ammonia, methanol, methane, and jet fuel).

As electricity consumption accounts for approximately 70% of hydrogen production costs, regions rich in low-cost renewable resources have a significant advantage (Egypt, Australia, Chile, and Morocco, followed by the United States, China, India, and Europe).

Current Progress and Challenges of Decarbonised Hydrogen

Following a surge in project announcements between 2020 and 2023, 2024 has brought a dose of reality: Many projects are struggling to get past the initial phase or feasibility study and haven't reached a final investment decision. Some projects deemed unrealistic (such as 'Spirit of Scotia' in Canada – 43 million tonnes per year, or 'Western Green Energy Hub' in Australia – 3 million tonnes per year), have even been cancelled. Many other projects can't even secure off takers for the hydrogen they would produce.

Enerdata estimates that only 7% to 9% of announced projects are in an advanced phase, representing a maximum of 75 projects out of the 830 listed. This proportion remains broadly consistent across regions, including Europe and France, with slight variations.

France has announced over 28 large, decarbonised hydrogen projects, with a potential production capacity of over 1.4 million tonnes over the next 10 to 20 years. This contrasts with current hydrogen consumption of approximately 0.6 million tonnes (mostly grey). However, only 3 projects, totalling a combined production capacity of 0.1 million tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen, are in an advanced phase. The French government, also recently updated its national hydrogen strategy, revising the target to 0.5 million tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen, by 2030.

Despite these challenges, some projects are progressing thanks to off-take agreements and final investment decisions. For example, TotalEnergies has partnered with Air Liquide and RWE to supply decarbonised hydrogen to its European refineries. Verso Energy, a French developer, is advancing several green hydrogen projects to produce decarbonised jet fuel (SAF) in France and Finland. The 'Scatec Green Ammonia' project in Egypt is the first hydrogen import project into Europe to secure an off-take agreement and European subsidies.

These successful projects share common characteristics. To bridge the price gap between grey and green hydrogen, developers and buyers rely on a combination of demand- and supply-side subsidies, including local and regional support schemes—essential measures for ensuring economic viability. Public policy also plays a critical role in stimulating demand, using both incentives and regulatory pressures. For example, European regulations set emissions thresholds for refineries and mandate the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the aviation sector. Carbon pricing further supports the shift toward decarbonised hydrogen.

In some cases, green hydrogen buyers pass on some of the additional costs to end-consumers. For instance, the marginal cost of green steel in electric vehicle production is often accepted by consumers, who are willing to pay a premium for a less carbon-intensive product.

Policies and Geopolitics: Catalysts for Hydrogen

The energy transition and geopolitical upheavals — notably the war in Ukraine — have heightened concerns about energy security and supply risks. In response, major policy changes, preferential legislation, and support mechanisms have been introduced to promote cleaner, more local, and diversified energy sources.

Legal frameworks such as the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), as well as the European RED III directive and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), directly support the development and deployment of clean hydrogen. The European Hydrogen Strategy and the RePowerEU initiative have set ambitious targets: to produce 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen locally and import an additional 10 million tonnes by 2030.

Green hydrogen, classified as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) by the European Union, is eligible for various financial incentives (European Innovation Fund, European Hydrogen Bank). Furthermore, industries using these fuels can meet their emission reduction targets while avoiding carbon tax penalties, as is the case for refineries.

Overcoming Obstacles to Green Hydrogen Adoption

Despite the growing momentum and considerable public support, the decarbonised hydrogen industry faces significant financial, technological, and technical challenges. The primary obstacle remains its high production cost (approximately €6/kg in Europe) compared to traditional grey hydrogen (approximately €2/kg).

Beyond cost, the complexity of these projects is heightened by the need to develop additional solar and wind farms, secure water supplies, ensure proximity between production and consumption to limit transport, and adhere to strict environmental, social, and safety standards.

In Europe, to qualify as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) and retain its 'green' label, a project must comply with three strict principles: additionality, geographical correlation, and temporal correlation between renewable electricity production and green hydrogen production. The need for Rigorous synchronisation and thorough documentation throughout the process further increase costs and complexity.

For projects aiming for international export, hydrogen transport is a major challenge. Its low volumetric density requires it to be compressed to very high pressure, liquefied, or converted into more easily transportable liquid vectors (ammonia or methanol). These processes are energy-intensive and increase technical complexity as well as the necessary investments.

Decarbonised Hydrogen: Realistic Prospects for a Sustainable Future

The decarbonised hydrogen industry is an emerging sector that follows a typical technological maturation curve. This development will involve a learning process, the selection of the most resilient projects, a mix of setbacks and successes, and valuable lessons. These challenges are inherent to any new technology and should not deter investment in this promising energy vector. Hydrogen is, and will continue to be, a viable solution for decarbonising many industries.

However, this potential must be evaluated by considering economic opportunities, technical limitations, and available alternatives. Hydrogen should not be seen as the sole solution to carbon emissions, but rather as one option among others, to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The relationship between emission reduction and associated cost must guide public investments and subsidies.

While road transport can largely be decarbonised through battery electric vehicles, hydrogen is better suited for heavy transport applications. Continued investment and innovation are essential in marine engines using ammonia and methanol derived from green hydrogen. The maritime transport sector, a significant contributor to CO₂ emissions, currently lacks viable alternatives to fossil fuels.

Priority should also be given to developing industrial clusters with sufficient hydrogen demand, supported by associated infrastructure (such as gas pipelines repurposed for hydrogen transport) to enhance efficiency. Simplifying authorisation procedures for renewable energy projects and reducing investment risks will help lower development costs and accelerate the deployment of decarbonised hydrogen.

The French industrial value chain plays an important role in the hydrogen ecosystem, both in Europe and globally. It is among the most developed in the world and includes equipment manufacturers, project developers, and other value-creating players, thereby contributing to French industrial leadership in various regions worldwide – a positive trend that deserves recognition and support.

Under the MoU, Shein and Lufthansa Cargo will collaborate on the implementation of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offsetting solutions for Shein’s deliveries.

The goal is to finalise this adoption within six months.

Additionally, the partnership will explore other initiatives aimed at promoting renewable and lower-carbon energy sources in air transport operations.

This collaboration falls in line with Shein’s ongoing efforts to mitigate its transportation-related carbon emissions.

Shein global fulfilment general manager Ethan Shen said: “Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide Shein with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of SAF where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network. While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonization strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency, and exploring other low-carbon solutions.”

To ensure transparency and credibility, Lufthansa Cargo will issue “Proof of Sustainability” certificates for the SAF quantities used by Shein.

These certificates will adhere to externally verified standards and provide a traceable account of emission reductions compared to traditional jet fuel.

The two entities are also considering additional collaborative efforts such as knowledge sharing and enhancing traceability and reporting of operational and environmental data.

Lufthansa Cargo CEO Ashwin Bhat said: “Signing this memorandum with Shein represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence.

The carrier, part of Lufthansa Group, announced Tuesday it has signed a multi-year agreement with Swiss climate tech start-up neustark to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—making SWISS the first airline to join forces with the CDR firm.

Under the deal, SWISS will finance a portion of neustark’s expansion across Europe, where the start-up already operates 38 capture and storage sites in seven countries.

Neustark specializes in “mineralization,” a process that locks CO2 into recycled concrete and other mineral waste, permanently preventing it from reentering the atmosphere. The company expects to scale to hundreds of thousands of tons of CO2 removal in the coming years.

SWISS and neustark – another airline and carbon removal partnership

The move underscores SWISS’s broader climate strategy, which blends sustainable aviation fuel with investment in carbon capture and removal. Earlier this year, the airline also deepened ties with Swiss innovators Climeworks and Synhelion, which focus on direct air capture and solar fuels.

Jens Fehlinger, SWISS’s chief executive, said the partnership represents an “early step toward scaling” carbon removal technologies. “Permanent CO2 removal is a key building block on the path to net zero in aviation,” he said.

For neustark, the deal is both a milestone and a signal of confidence from a notoriously hard-to-decarbonize sector. “Pioneers like SWISS play a crucial role in further deploying our technology to permanently remove exponentially more tonnes of CO2 every single day,” said co-founder Valentin Gutknecht.

By linking two carbon-intensive industries—aviation and construction—the companies aim to accelerate the commercialization of durable carbon removal, which could prove essential for reaching net zero emissions.

In the U.S. direct air capture company 1PointFive has also been inking agreements with airlines like Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA) and easyJet with several more prospects exploring options.

neustark solidifying its position

Though details of the agreement haven’t been revealed, neustark appears to be on an upwards trajectory.

After raising $69 million in a funding round led by BlackRock and Temasek in June 2024, the company increased its efforts to achieve its goal of removing 1 million tons of CO2 by 2030.

A postdoctoral scholar at Oregon State University (OSU), Ibrahim designs and tests nanocatalyst strategies that upgrade crude bio-oils produced from residues like rice straw and forest slash into energy-dense, stable fuel fractions suitable for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathways.

“We’re learning how to get more usable fuel out of waste biomass while lowering carbon intensity,” he says. “My long-term goal is to help transfer these methods to contexts like Ghana, where agricultural by-products are abundant.”

From residues to renewable fuels

Thermochemical processes such as fast/catalytic pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction break down biomass into a heavy, oxygen-rich oil. Ibrahim’s work focuses on bimetallic magnetic nanocatalysts specialized materials that strip oxygen, stabilize the oil, and boost yields during upgrading. In plain terms: less waste, better product, and a cleaner drop-in feed for SAF refining.

Why aviation and why now

Aviation is a hard-to-abate sector; SAF is one of the few near-term tools to reduce its footprint. By improving conversion efficiency and fuel quality from low-value residues, Ibrahim’s research tackles a known bottleneck on the path to lower-carbon jet fuel.

The work has been recognized through peer-reviewed publications and invitations to evaluate others’ research as a journal reviewer and conference poster judge.

Policy relevance and real-world deployment

At OSU, Ibrahim plays a leading role in a state-funded Clean Fuel Initiative modeling Oregon-specific carbon-intensity (CI) outcomes for fuels derived from woody biomass.

He co-authored a Legislature-directed report describing GREET-based CI modeling, process design, and bench/pilot-linked yields evidence that his laboratory advances are feeding into policy and program planning.

What this could mean for Ghana

Ghana generates significant volumes of agricultural by-products (e.g., cocoa husks, corn stalks, sawdust). Ibrahim sees an opportunity to convert a disposal challenge into a fuel resource, provided there is sustained R&D, pilot facilities, and public-private partnerships.

“I don’t yet have formal collaborations in Ghana,” he notes.

“But the science is mature enough to begin feasibility studies mapping feedstock logistics, testing catalysts on local residues, and validating the carbon-intensity benefits under Ghana’s grid conditions.”

The road ahead

Challenges remain capital costs, supply-chain logistics, and consistent policy frameworks but Ibrahim is pragmatic. “The key is to start small and measure everything,” he says. “If Ghana invests in targeted pilots and workforce training, we can build toward a regional hub for sustainable fuels that creates jobs and reduces import dependence.”

Editor’s note: As of August 2025, Dr. Ibrahim’s publications have accrued 77 citations (h-index 3); he has served as a journal peer reviewer and conference poster judge, and he recently co-authored a state-commissioned clean-fuel report at OSU. He welcomes inquiries from Ghanaian universities, agencies, and industry on pilot collaborations.

“There is a missed opportunity with integrated data collection and analysis,” said Dror Yahav, CEO of Universal Avionics. “While many OEMs, install it to check a requirement, flight data recorders are a powerful tool that links to everything that your aircraft is connected to.”

Although their FDRs and cockpit voice recorders collect massive amounts of data, many operators often fail to do anything with it. Capturing the right data can be the first step toward improving pilot performance. It can help provide effective analysis to determine what factors may have contributed to an incident or accident. It has the potential to help prevent future accidents and enable more efficient operations.

Within the past two decades, innovations in this technology for the business aviation sector have been significant. ForeFlight Mobile, for example, is designed to efficiently and effectively help pilots and professional flight crews gather information on weather and on their destinations.

Cloud solutions, such as ForeFlight’s CloudAhoy, aim to improve post-flight debriefings to advance flight training. ForeFlight Cloud integrates with FDR systems, stores data and enables data sharing as well as data analysis. This allows FDRs to go beyond tracking and recording features. The focus is flight safety, data security – including of cloud-stored pilot flight logs, regulatory compliance and enhanced operational efficiency.

“One current development is the ongoing integration of flight data management and analysis into cloud platforms, bringing airline-style flight data monitoring and Flight Operations Quality Assurance programs to business aviation,” said Hannes Griebel, director consulting services, aerospace and assured space systems at CGI.

CGI has developed its VirtualFlightRecorder, a cloud-based flight recorder data storage and protection system. “It complements the functions traditionally performed by the conventional crash-resistant FDRs by storing flight recorder data transmitted by an aircraft in flight,” Griebel said.

Griebel acknowledged that modern avionics or retrofit units, which are often quick-access recorders or data gateways, can upload recorded flight data to cloud services after each flight, where it is processed for trends and safety insights. The initiative adds a layer of data security by using blockchain technology to authenticate, log and secure incoming flight data records to ensure confidence in the data collated for analysis.

CVR + FDR = CVFDR

FDRs and CVRs are usually two separate boxes. Universal Avionics decided to change this. The company has developed a new generation of these systems called KAPTURE. Installed in business jets and other aircraft, the new systems were designed to comply with European regulations and the latest FAA Technical Standard Orders.

“We wanted to ensure that customers are compliant with the latest mandate, which required new airplanes to equip a 25-hour CVR by May 16, 2025, and all airplanes will need to retrofit to this regulation by 2030,” Griebel said. The legislation was part of the 2024 FAA reauthorization.

“After the base regulation requirements were met, we still wanted to provide customers with more value for their daily workflows,” said Yahav. There is much stored value available in FDRs, which most users do not use to improve their operations. Universal Avionics aims to support customers with their data analysis as well as with their compliance obligations.

This involves the development of products and services, including the integration of FDR and CVR functions into one black box to create a single CVFDR unit. It records voice audio, flight data or both. For security reasons, in the business aviation sector, the data is encrypted. This has to be decrypted when there is an accident.

“Users of our flight management system have constant access to their data, enabling them to optimize their operations and to undertake proactive and predictive maintenance,” said Yahav. AI tools can be used when there are large amounts of data to analyze, for predictive maintenance, or to improve fuel efficiency. “You do not want to waste time performing maintenance too early or risk unscheduled downtime when it’s too late,” Yahav said.

Adding Video Data to FDRs

Technology also enables the integration of video into flight data recorders, connecting a cockpit camera to make a visual record of pilot activities or intruders entering the flight deck. “The evolution of data recorders is mostly around video recording and providing additional information whenever there is an incident,” said Yahav.

“Virtual recorder (VR) technologies have the potential to revolutionize CVR and FDR analysis by providing immersive and interactive experiences for investigators,” said Borka Vlacic, director of product management, Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. With this kind of technology, it is possible to recreate a cockpit environment and overlay any relevant data.

Connectivity Is Key

These innovations can often work with any kind of connectivity, but not always. “Only satellite communications provide practical connectivity solutions for operations over water or remote areas, where the safety benefits are greatest,” said Griebel.

Satellite is the only practical method to reach cloud-based storage solutions to back up data for an aircraft that operates in remote areas. “In practice, this means flight data is no longer confined to a physical device on board – it is also sent to remote storage in real time or near-real-time,” Griebel said. With modern satellite communications systems, connected recorders can transmit continuously, at intervals, or be triggered by an emergency, depending on operator preference.",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Pilot-ipad-flightdeck.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 15:56:29.536496

A step towards sustainability

On the occasion of its inaugural flight, CEO of Airbus, Benoît Schultz, said,

“In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities, And we’re pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year. On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.”

Moreover, the A220 can operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airbus also aims for its aircraft to be capable of flying with 100% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.

Ltd. (Osaka City, Japan; www.sekisuichemical.com) and Velocys Inc. (Houston, Tex.; www.velocys.com) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) establishing a strategic partnership to advance production technology for electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF), a CO2-derived synthetic fuel. This partnership combines Sekisui’s CO2→CO chemical looping technology with Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch (FT) microchannel reactor technology to enable the manufacture of synthetic fuels using CO2 as a feedstock, thus contributing to decarbonization.

The aviation industry accounts for approximately 2.6% of global CO2 emissions, and a key emission reduction measure that is gaining attention is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA; Paris, France; www.iea.org) and other organizations, 65% of CO2 reduction targets for the aviation industry can be achieved through the adoption of SAF. At present, conventional SAF is manufactured from waste oil and biomass-derived raw materials. However, considering the anticipated increase in SAF demand going forward, the early commencement and widespread adoption of e-SAF—which is manufactured from CO2 and hydrogen derived from renewable energy—is considered essential.

In this context, CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) technology, which converts CO2 into fuel and chemical products for practical use, is attracting attention. CCU technology enables the reuse of CO2 as a valuable resource and replaces fossil resources, thereby reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

Sekisui Chemical is working to reduce global CO2 emissions through the social implementation of CCU technology. To date, it has developed a unique chemical looping technology that converts CO2 into CO with a high reaction yield (90% or higher).

Velocys has been developing FT reaction technology for the manufacture of synthetic fuels from synthetic gas (a mixture of CO and H2) converted from municipal waste, industrial waste, biomass, and CO2 for over 20 years. Its proprietary catalyst and microchannel reactor design have established productivity six to ten times higher than conventional FT reaction technology.

If the operator exceeds a carbon emissions threshold, it must be offset through buying carbon credits, which are verified by a third party before submission to a national accreditation body.
Founded in 2024 by aviation industry veteran Houseman, Zenith Net-Zero emerged out of ZenithJet, a firm that provides aircraft owners with technical support.
One client is Jetcraft, a London-based aircraft broker, which asked Zenith Net-Zero to measure its carbon emissions and advise on purchasing carbon credits.
As its contribution to the SAF industry, Zenith Net-Zero is working on a project for SAF development in Africa.","Zenith Net-Zero, an environmental advisory focused on aviation, is now one of the few Canadian companies accredited by a national standards organization to provide assurance services for an international carbon offsets program.

Last week, the Dorval, Que.-based company announced the Standards Council of Canada affirmed its ability to deliver greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions validation and verification for aircraft operators that submit reports to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a major program run by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

CORSIA requires members to buy credits on carbon markets as a means of offsetting emissions generated on international routes between participating countries. Operators take steps such as paying to develop carbon sinks or produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Zenith Net-Zero can independently verify emission reports and offset claims submitted by aircraft operators such as Air Canada and WestJet to CORSIA.

A handful of domestic firms are accredited for such a service and many Canadian aircraft operators rely on foreign companies for such a task, Nick Houseman, founder and president of Zenith Net-Zero, said in an interview with Sustainable Biz Canada.

“It’s a big deal for us in the sense of, for Canada there (isn’t) really anybody accredited to do this in Canada,” he said.

Zenith Net-Zero's validation and verification

Armed with its accreditation from the council, Zenith Net-Zero can verify and validate if an aircraft operator is in line with CORSIA’s standards, and calculate its pollution based on factors such as fuel use and flights.

If the operator exceeds a carbon emissions threshold, it must be offset through buying carbon credits, which are verified by a third party before submission to a national accreditation body.

He is pleased to offer the validation and verification for CORISA after years of contemplating the possibility, Houseman said.

“I think it will be valuable to operators in Canada that have somebody in Canada who understands the landscape here and help them meet their obligations under CORSIA.”

The company can also provide its assurance for operators in other countries, especially with heightened pressure for CORSIA compliance he anticipates will only grow.

Founded in 2024 by aviation industry veteran Houseman, Zenith Net-Zero emerged out of ZenithJet, a firm that provides aircraft owners with technical support. ZenithJet offered environmental consulting services in 2022, helping aviation businesses understand their climate-warming pollution and steps to reduce it, Houseman said.

“We saw the opportunity there in the sense of, it’s not easy to comply with these schemes,” he explained. “So there’s a lot of work that goes into it, understanding all of the flights and for operators it’s not their core business.”

To guide those operators, its services include assisting clients in developing carbon offset projects, accounting for and reporting greenhouse gas emissions, and assessments of the environmental impacts of products and services.

The aviation industry is a notable polluter, responsible for 2.5 per cent of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions.

The future of sustainable aviation, according to Houseman

Zenith Net-Zero’s clients are mostly in business aviation, an industry in which Houseman has developed deep ties. They include operators of small business jets to Boeing 747s and small consulting firms. One client is Jetcraft, a London-based aircraft broker, which asked Zenith Net-Zero to measure its carbon emissions and advise on purchasing carbon credits.

Such offsets remain a primary tool for decarbonizing aviation because low-carbon jet fuel remains highly expensive and limited in supply, Houseman said. Yet SAF will likely be pivotal for aviation to reach net-zero, according to the International Air Transport Association in a 2025 document.

The Canadian government published a plan with the goal of 10 per cent SAF use by 2030. But such an ambition remains largely aspirational, while development on SAF production projects take place in Canada.

Electric-battery planes are at least 20 years away from mass adoption and limited to short flights, Houseman predicts, eliminating one pathway for quickly reducing aviation’s emissions.

For now, he sees the best options for aircraft operators to cut their emissions as adopting electric ground support equipment and using renewable energy.

As its contribution to the SAF industry, Zenith Net-Zero is working on a project for SAF development in Africa. The company is seeking to raise funds for a feasibility study for the effort.

“The conditions are right in certain areas of Africa,” Houseman said, on account of the abundant agricultural waste that can be turned into SAF feedstock plus the high cost of importing conventional aviation fuel for the continent.

Another innovation the company is exploring is reducing methane emissions from dairy cows by supplementing their feed with mycelium, the thin, root-like parts of fungi. It could even be added to manure to make fertilizer or SAF feedstock, Houseman said. He hopes to get the project off the ground later this year.",https://squall.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/posts/2025082503-nick-houseman-800x600.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:56:56.506903

This marked a significant step forward: Airbus in Canada directly issued official sustainability credentials for SAF to a customer for the first time.

This landmark flight not only confirms Airbus’ capability to provide Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) directly to customers and operators but also supports the industry’s commitment to decarbonisation.

With PoS credits for a 50 percent SAF blend applied through the mass balance process, this ferry flight conducted by Air France’s 46th A220-300 named “VAISON-LA- ROMAINE,” represented more than 25 tonnes reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels.

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game- changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability, Air France-KLM.

Since the announcement of the first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) delivery at Airbus site in Canada, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights, this achievement solidifies Airbus’ commitment to using SAF for internal operations as well as customer ferry flights across all its commercial aircraft assembly sites and delivery centers worldwide.

“In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,” said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada.

“And we’re pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50 percent SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year.

On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.”

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100 percent SAF by 2030. According to the PoS under CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme

approved by ICAO, the SAF received at Airbus in Mirabel is certified for 85 percent reduction in GHG emissions on its lifecycle compared to fossil fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the aerospace industry’s progress towards decarbonization by 2050.

SAF management in Mirabel is done using mass balance, a chain of custody model in which a company accounts for volumes of certified products by looking at the volumes entering the operation and the equivalent volume of products leaving the operations as a measurement, minus any processing losses.

As such, the SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel (Jet A-1) as per established industry standards and auditable bookkeeping.

Air France’s first A220-300s, part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft, have been flying on its medium-haul network since October 2021. The A220 delivers up to 25 percent lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plays a central role in reducing the carbon footprint of air transport, allowing at least a 65% reduction in CO₂ emissions over the full life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel.

Air France-KLM is among the world's top three SAF users and applies a strict sourcing policy: only fuel that does not compete with human food supply, does not contribute to deforestation, and is not produced from palm oil is selected.

Another joint initiative between the Group and the manufacturer: Air France-KLM and Airbus have signed an agreement enabling Airbus employees to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel by supporting the production of sustainable aviation fuel. This voluntary commitment is part of Air France-KLM's ""SAF Corporate"" program, which facilitates the financing and purchase of SAF. Since joining the program in November 2023, Airbus has cut its emissions by more than 2,000 tons of CO₂ through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF.

An increasingly modern and efficient fleet

Fleet renewal is a cornerstone of the Group's transformation strategy. With fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions reduced by 20% per seat-kilometer compared with previous-generation aircraft, the Airbus A220 embodies this ambition.

Air France-KLM has nearly 200 new-generation aircraft (A220, A320neo, A321neo, A350, and Boeing 787) on firm order, and in 2024 alone the Group took delivery of 41 new-generation aircraft across all its airlines.

These major investments - totaling more than €2 billion per year - are contributing to a fleet that, by 2030, could be composed of up to 80% new-generation aircraft.

Acceptance validates proven technical capability and production scale required for Clearinghouse qualification

Milestone positions Unifuel as a credible pathway towards 100% drop-in SAF for commercial airline adoption

LOS ALTOS, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–As the global aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions while demand for air travel continues to grow, Universal Fuel Technologies’ (Unifuel) Ethanol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced via the company’s Flexiforming technology has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse, which supports the technical evaluation of new aviation fuels, for qualification. This acceptance positions Unifuel among an exclusive group of companies advancing toward ASTM qualification, the essential gateway for new fuels to enter commercial aviation markets.

“The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse is an important validation of our Flexiforming technology and significantly derisks our road to approval for commercial use,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. “This advancement indicates that our SAF can meet the toughest performance standards without sacrificing scalability or quality, and has technical credibility in the eyes of industry experts.”

The ASTM D4054 evaluation process is the aviation industry’s framework for ensuring that new fuels can safely power aircraft engines. It includes multiple tiers of testing, data collection, and technical review by experts from leading aerospace companies. Acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse requires demonstrating, by independent testing, that a fuel is not only technically credible and can be produced at a meaningful scale, but also that it has met strict quality and safety criteria.

“We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,” said Dr. Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director. “This marks a significant milestone for Universal Fuel Technologies towards their goal of commercial acceptance.”

The acceptance follows a successful five-month pilot project where the company produced nearly 100 liters of sample material for four different SAF pathways under stable process conditions. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol, and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), into SAF. The samples then underwent comprehensive testing by Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, the world-leading authority on SAF research.

“The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse confirms that Flexiforming can produce high-quality synthetic aviation turbine fuel with a clear route to ASTM qualification,” said Denis Pchelintsev, Co-Founder of Universal Fuel Technologies. “We’re positioned to support the aviation industry’s urgent need for cost-effective synthetic aviation turbine fuel that doesn’t compromise on performance or safety.”

Following Unifuel’s D4054 Clearinghouse acceptance, the company will proceed with producing larger fuel samples for detailed Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing required for ASTM qualification. The initial qualification could come as soon as the end of 2026 as a blend component with fossil jet. From there, further testing is planned, with the goal of leading to a 100% drop-in fully synthetic jet fuel in the future.

Unifuel’s advancement through the qualification process is supported by Flexiforming’s unique capabilities, which upgrade various renewable feedstocks—including ethanol, methanol, renewable naphthas, and liquefied petroleum gas—into high-quality SAF. In ethanol-to-jet applications, Flexiforming uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other processes, cutting production costs by up to 50%. The technology is also valuable as a complementary process, upgrading low-value naphtha byproduct from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, creating new revenue opportunities for renewable fuel producers.

They reported stronger earnings and are shifting their strategy to buy more carbon credits. The move comes as the company, the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the region, boosts coal production and grows its renewable energy portfolio.

Investors, regulators, and climate observers are watching closely to see how Sasol balances its reliance on fossil fuels with its stated commitment to reaching net-zero emissions.

Earnings Power: Fueling a Dual Strategy

In its latest earnings report, Sasol posted a year-on-year improvement supported by stable product prices and efficiency gains. The company’s operating profit rose due to stronger chemical sales.

However, this was partly offset by higher costs in its coal division. Earnings were strong, giving Sasol the money to invest in fossil fuels and low-carbon projects.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, the company earned 10.60 rand per share. This is a turnaround from a loss of 69.94 rand per share. Asset write-downs fell sharply to 20.7 billion rand, down from 74.9 billion rand last year.

Sasol gained from a 4.3 billion rand settlement with Transnet over oil transport fees. Capital expenditure dropped 16% to 25.4 billion rand. This helped improve the company’s financial profile.

Management highlighted that a resilient balance sheet is critical as the company continues its transition journey.

Sasol has steady cash flows. This helps support its short-term coal operations. It also funds longer-term projects like renewable energy growth and carbon reduction efforts.

Sasol’s renewed profit helped lift investor sentiment. Following the earnings, the company’s shares climbed 7% in pre-market trading. Its stock on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE: SOL) surged by 44% over the last quarter.

Analysts predict that earnings per share will increase by 20% year-on-year. This shows rising confidence in the company’s ability to balance profit and sustainability.

Rising Carbon Credit Purchases: Flexibility or Delay?

One of the biggest headlines is Sasol’s decision to boost its purchase of carbon credits.

In the fiscal year that ended in June 2025, Sasol’s carbon credit purchases increased to R723 million, a 25% increase year-on-year.

This amount was nearly triple the value of the credits it bought in 2023.

Since 2019, Sasol has acquired more than 11 million South African carbon credits, which has reduced its carbon tax liability by more than R650 million.

Most of these credits come from international renewable energy and reforestation projects, while some are linked to African-based carbon offset programs. Sasol plans to grow its carbon credit portfolio, showing its commitment to climate responsibility.

Some offset projects supported by Sasol include:

Wonderbag: In 2021, Sasol announced it would use carbon credits generated by the Wonderbag project, which provides non-electric heat-retention cookers to reduce household emissions.

Bethlehem Hydro: In 2020, Sasol purchased over 100,000 credits from Bethlehem Hydro, a 7MW hydropower plant that was the first Independent Power Producer in South Africa.

Nitrous oxide abatement: As far back as 2007, Sasol received credits for a nitrous oxide abatement project at its nitric acid plants in Sasolburg and Secunda.

However, it recognizes that cutting emissions from its own operations is tough in the near term. The company plans to steadily increase reliance, but acknowledges that credits are a temporary solution.

The use of credits has generated debate. Supporters say it gives companies flexibility to meet interim targets while low-carbon technologies scale.

Critics argue it can delay direct emissions cuts. Sasol’s growing use of offsets shows the urgent climate pressures and the challenges of moving away from coal.

RELATED: How Kinetic Coalition Leverages Energy Transition Credits to Close Coal Plants Early

Coal’s Grip: South Africa’s Energy Dilemma

Sasol is one of South Africa’s top coal users. It relies on coal for power and to make synthetic fuels and chemicals. Its Secunda plant is one of the single largest point sources of carbon dioxide globally, emitting more than 56 million tons of CO₂ equivalent each year.

The world’s biggest producer of fuels and chemicals from coal emits around 63 million tons of CO₂ equivalent each year. This makes it one of Africa’s largest industrial polluters.

The company believes coal is still essential for South Africa’s energy and industry right now. This is especially true due to the country’s electricity shortages and its dependence on Eskom, the state utility. Sasol knows that relying on this can lead to risks such as regulatory pressure, investor scrutiny, and possible costs from future carbon pricing.

Counting Carbon: Sasol’s Net-Zero Targets and Progress

Despite its coal footprint, Sasol has stepped up efforts to diversify its energy mix. The company is putting money into renewable energy projects. This includes solar and wind farms. These efforts will help provide cleaner electricity for its operations.

Moreover, partnerships with independent power producers are helping Sasol shift portions of its energy use away from coal-generated power.

In addition, Sasol is advancing work in green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Its Fischer-Tropsch technology, long used for coal-to-liquids production, is being adapted for cleaner feedstocks, such as natural gas and green hydrogen. The company announced pilot projects to produce low-carbon chemicals for local and global markets.

Sasol aims to cut its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% by 2030. This goal uses a 2017 baseline, which is about 72 million tons of CO₂e. Progress: current emissions are down about 13% from baseline.

It aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. However, it admits that success relies on policy support, technological progress, and available funding.

In summary, Sasol’s key emission reduction initiatives are:

Green hydrogen projects – Developing hydrogen production in South Africa through partnerships to support cleaner fuels and power.

Renewable energy procurement – Securing up to 1,200 MW of renewable electricity (wind and solar) to replace coal-based power at operations.

Energy efficiency improvements – Implementing process optimization and equipment upgrades to reduce energy use across its facilities.

Coal-to-gas transition – Shifting part of its feedstock mix from coal toward natural gas, which has a lower carbon footprint.

Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) – Exploring technologies to capture CO₂ from operations for use in chemicals or fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development – Advancing projects to produce low-carbon jet fuel from sustainable feedstocks.

Offsets and carbon credits – Expanding purchases of carbon credits to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions.

Markets in Motion: Offsets, Renewables, and Risks

Sasol’s strategy reflects broader challenges facing energy and industrial companies worldwide. Carbon credits are gaining popularity. The voluntary carbon market was worth over $2 billion in 2024. It’s expected to grow to nearly $50 billion by 2030, under the best-case scenario.

However, the credibility of offsets is under scrutiny, and investors are demanding more transparency on how credits are used.

At the same time, global coal demand remains strong, particularly in emerging markets. South Africa’s energy system still relies heavily on coal, which generates about 80% of the country’s electricity. This makes decarbonization complex, as companies like Sasol must balance energy security with climate commitments.

Meanwhile, renewable energy costs continue to fall. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of new power generation in most regions. For Sasol, scaling renewables not only helps reduce emissions but also lowers long-term energy costs.

Balancing Growth, Risk, and Climate Goals

Sasol’s higher earnings give it the financial strength to follow its dual-track strategy. This means it can keep expanding coal operations and invest in low-carbon solutions. The company’s growing purchase of carbon credits shows its urgent need to meet climate goals. It also reflects the challenge of cutting emissions from coal-heavy operations.

Sasol’s future will depend on whether it can scale up renewable energy, develop viable low-carbon technologies, and manage the risks tied to its coal reliance. Its net-zero commitment remains a long-term goal. Yet, the company’s latest moves suggest it is trying to walk a fine line between financial performance and climate responsibility.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2423893263.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 09:56:46.804333

Abu Dhabi is well placed to lead the UAE’s next wave of climate innovation, particularly in scaling hardware-intensive technologies at the intersection of climate, infrastructure and manufacturing. While the UAE has made global progress in clean energy and sustainability, a critical gap remains: the absence of infrastructure and mechanisms to pilot and scale climate-deep tech solutions. These include innovations such as green construction materials, energy storage systems, low-carbon industrial processes and other technologies vital to the future of infrastructure.

On 21 May 2025, a closed-door roundtable was held under Chatham House Rules during Make it in the Emirates (MIITE) Week to explore how Abu Dhabi could lead the development of a national piloting programme. The session brought together key stakeholders from government, industry, academia and finance. Participants reached a clear consensus: the UAE must create real-world testing environments, align regulatory pathways and de-risk capital-intensive innovation. These steps are essential to bridge the “valley of death” that many startups face as they move from prototype to deployment.

This brief presents the outcomes of that roundtable discussion and has been created in collaboration with Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW), Global Climate Financial Centre (GCFC), UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators (UICCA), Hub71 and PwC Middle East. It identifies the infrastructure, capital and policy gaps that currently constrain scale-up and offers a three-pillar action framework for Abu Dhabi to lead this transformation, building on existing programmes by Hub71, Masdar City and ADIO and aligning with national industrial and climate goals such as the Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology’s (MOIAT) Operation 300bn.

Defining the focus

“Climate-deep tech” refers to hardware- and systems-intensive technologies that address climate mitigation or adaptation and are relevant to the future of infrastructure, including energy storage, green construction materials, carbon capture and industrial process decarbonisation. This brief does not cover general software-based climate solutions or consumer apps.

1. Key findings and gaps

1.1 Piloting infrastructure: What’s missing?

Abu Dhabi provides strong support for incubation and now has the opportunity to enhance its infrastructure for real-world piloting and light manufacturing.

Specific gaps include:

High OPEX for pilot sites, including real estate and utilities. One startup reported annual costs of Dhs150m for a modest pilot site

Insufficient number of climate-tech tailored zones (e.g. Hub71 + ClimateTech that was launched during COP28 to accelerate startups developing climate solutions), especially for industrial decarbonisation and grid-related innovation

Insufficient number of testing environments or regulatory sandboxes for first-of-a-kind (FOAK) technologies

These additions would help startups move beyond lab-scale validation. Without purpose-built zones and environments that support experimentation, Abu Dhabi risks losing commercially promising innovations to other markets.",https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/zz-test-brand-assets-pages-25/l2-l3-primary-context/desktop/pwc_digital-banner_1600x900_gettyimages-1092342600.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 10:56:50.696383

The latest revision of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), favours green hydrogen over blue hydrogen, helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally.
""European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,"" said Alan Gelder.
Average green hydrogen costs dropped 18% in the latest EU auctions, with German bids falling more than 55%.
But it requires policy intervention to lower green hydrogen production costs and increase the refineries' offtake.","High costs have kept green hydrogen projects from taking off, but new regulations in the EU’s refining sector offers a solution to launching this carbon friendly technology at scale, according to a new Horizons report from Wood Mackenzie.

According to the report, “Isn’t it ironic? How Europe’s oil refiners could offer a route to scale up green hydrogen”, European refiners are set to require approximately 0.5 million tpy of green hydrogen by 2030 to comply with EU regulations, replacing about 30% of current CO2 emitting hydrogen production. Refining represents one of the largest hydrogen opportunities globally, which, alongside ammonia and methanol production, accounts for 98% of current demand.

The latest revision of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), favours green hydrogen over blue hydrogen, helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally.

""European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,"" said Alan Gelder. ""Numerous green hydrogen projects have already targeted the sector.""

The report finds that of the 6 million tpy of low-carbon hydrogen capacity that has taken a final investment decision (FID), European refineries have already committed more than US$5 billion of capital.

Refiners demonstrate strongest market appetite

Recent EU Hydrogen Bank auction results reveal refineries' commitment to green hydrogen adoption, with the sector showing the highest willingness to pay premium prices at an average levelised cost of hydrogen of US$9.23/kg – demonstrating their requirement to meet regulatory mandates. This compares favourably with Wood Mackenzie's asset-level modelling of refinery-targeted projects, which produces costs of US$7.04 - 8.30/kg.

The encouraging market signals extend beyond pricing. Average green hydrogen costs dropped 18% in the latest EU auctions, with German bids falling more than 55%. However, progress remains uneven across the bloc, with slow national adoption of RED III legislation hampering project development in many member states.

Long-term growth lies in transport fuels

While refinery decarbonisation offers the strongest near-term investment case, the marine and aviation sectors present massive long-term growth opportunities for green hydrogen derivatives. The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation framework alone requires sustainable aviation fuel to power 6% of the jet pool by 2030, with 1.2% coming from green hydrogen-based e-fuels.

By 2050, sustainable aviation fuel mandates could require 8 million t of green hydrogen – representing a compound annual growth rate of over 15% for this sector alone. Similarly, Europe's FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the International Maritime Organisation's Net Zero Framework are driving interest in hydrogen-derived marine fuels.

""The opportunities for low-carbon hydrogen have come full circle,"" said Murray Douglas, Vice President of Hydrogen Research at Wood Mackenzie. ""The traditional sectors of refining, ammonia and methanol are showing the most progress, ahead of the many other new demand sectors being touted for hydrogen. Parts of the refining sector can be decarbonised quickly – and at an acceptable cost. But it requires policy intervention to lower green hydrogen production costs and increase the refineries' offtake.

""Marine and aviation hold much of the long-term potential for hydrogen derivatives, as these sectors are the most challenging to electrify. The challenge lies in competing fuels, the costs of production and the final shape of the policies providing support.""

Policy gaps remain key barrier

Despite the progress, significant hurdles remain. Current EU policy requires RFNBOs to account for only 1% of transport sector energy use by 2030 - a modest target that reflects the challenges in expanding supply. Member states have been slow to transpose RED III into national legislation, creating regulatory uncertainty that has slowed project development across most of the EU.

The report concludes that while European refiners could play a critical role in scaling up the green hydrogen industry, success depends on continued cost reductions and stronger policy support to fully kick-start demand across the continent.",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/oil-refinery-plant-01.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:06.874459

Those firms, like most in the field, are pure electric. But Canadian start-up Horizon is taking a different approach, which it hopes could secure a sizeable chunk of the market.

“We saw a decent gap in the marketplace opening up for a longer-range, all-weather, faster machine that could carry more and had several other layers of safety and redundancy on board,” said CEO and co-founder Brandon Robinson to Professional Engineering. “We thought it was smart to have a power source on board that is 30 to 40 times as dense as even the best aerospace-grade batteries.”

For the Cavorite X7, that power source will be jet fuel or potentially sustainable aviation fuel in future. With 800km (500 miles) forecast range and a maximum speed of 450km/h (280mph), the six-passenger, one-pilot aircraft could fly much further than pure electric eVTOLs and much faster than helicopters.

The hybrid approach is not the only unusual feature of the X7 – unlike other flying taxis it has fixed wings, lined with battery-powered ducted fans. These will be uncovered for electrically powered ascent and descent before the aircraft switches to a fossil-fuelled rear propeller for horizontal flight, and the ducted fans are covered by sliding panels.

Stressing a “very operational and engineering-focused background”, Robinson said the company was wary of the challenges and strict manufacturing tolerances involved with tilt rotors, tilt wing mechanisms and open rotors.

“We wanted the simplest possible way to transition from hover to forward flight,” he said. The approach avoids significant aerodynamics challenges from variable pitch articulating mechanisms, he added, with a half-scale prototype already demonstrating successful transitions between hovering and horizontal flight.

The X7’s performance advantages could draw attention in the next eVTOL hype cycle – but it remains to be seen if they will be significant enough for customers to overlook ongoing fossil fuel consumption.",,N,,2025-08-26 09:56:56.812750

This initiative aims to integrate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into its procurement practices, thereby promoting cleaner transportation solutions.

The MoU outlines a systematic collaboration framework targeting low-carbon solutions.

Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment at SHEIN, believes this partnership highlights sustainable choices in logistics: ""Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide SHEIN with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.""

SHEIN's goal through this venture is to progressively expand the use of SAF, aiming to significantly alleviate the carbon footprint inherent in its delivery processes.

Integrating SAF in supply chains

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) represents a crucial step forward in supply chain management.

Derived from renewable feedstocks, SAF offers a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, delivering reduced lifecycle carbon emissions.

In this collaborative effort, Lufthansa Cargo will supply SHEIN with SAF, supporting this commitment with 'Proof of Sustainability' certificates established on verified standards. These will quantify the emissions saved through the switch from fossil-based fuels to SAF, embodying a tangible step in sustainable procurement strategies.

Lufthansa's expertise in sourcing and deploying SAF is integral to this partnership. The exchange of knowledge and practices between Lufthansa and SHEIN will help optimise the logistics behind greener freight operations.

This agreement treats SAF not just as a standalone solution but as a part of a broader environmental initiative within logistics procurement.

Data transparency and sustainability

Transparency in data is pivotal for evaluating and fostering sustainability across procurement functions.

Lufthansa Cargo’s CEO, Ashwin Bhat remarked on the significance of the deal: “Signing this memorandum with SHEIN represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence.”

By focusing on shared approaches to traceability, the pair aim to develop systems that foster accountability, optimise fleet efficiency and enhance overall supply chain resilience.

The agreement extends beyond SAF usage to include cooperation on environmental reporting and data sharing. Both companies are delving into traceability partnerships, examining ways in which data can be utilised to track and improve emissions as well as the broader ecological footprint.

Commitment to sustainable logistics

While SHEIN and Lufthansa Cargo's agreement does not enforce mandatory emissions targets, the partnership signals a joint commitment to trialling innovative solutions within logistics procurement.

By leveraging this experience, they aim to implement lessons across their broader logistics operations.

Ethan adds: ""While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonisation strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency and exploring other low-carbon solutions.”

SHEIN relies extensively on air freight for swift delivery from manufacturers to consumers, making this partnership critical for reducing their transportation carbon emissions.

LanzaTech Global's stock experienced a significant shift in momentum on August 25th, 2025, with a KDJ Death Cross and a Bearish Marubozu at 14:45. This technical indicator suggests a potential downtrend, with sellers gaining control of the market. The bearish momentum is expected to continue, indicating a decrease in the stock's value.

The company's Q2 2025 earnings report, released on August 19, 2025, provides insights into its financial health. LanzaTech's revenue fell 48% to $9.1 million, driven by the absence of sublicensing income and project completions. However, the CarbonSmart segment saw a rise to $3.8 million, signaling progress in scaling its carbon accounting software [1].

The company's strategic restructuring includes workforce cuts and a shift to licensing, supported by a £6.4 million UK grant for sustainable aviation fuel projects. Despite a $40 million equity raise, cash reserves remain low at $39.6 million, with $128.3 million in liabilities, raising liquidity concerns [1].

Long-term success hinges on scaling carbon tech partnerships and cost control amid high execution risks and regulatory uncertainties. The UK's Project Dragon, funded by a £6.4 million grant, aims to leverage LanzaTech's ethanol-to-jet technology in the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market [1].

Analysts project $57.8 million revenue for 2025 but warn of a high-risk profile due to operational inefficiencies and competitive pressures in the SAF market [2]. The company's ability to monetize its technology and secure partnerships will be critical for its long-term viability.

For investors, the key question is whether LanzaTech can sustain its pivot to commercial execution without further dilution or strategic overreach. The company's strategic direction is sound, but the path to profitability remains uncertain.

""This advancement indicates that our SAF can meet the toughest performance standards without sacrificing scalability or quality, and has technical credibility in the eyes of industry experts.""

The ASTM D4054 evaluation process is the aviation industry’s framework for ensuring that new fuels can safely power aircraft engines. It includes multiple tiers of testing, data collection, and technical review by experts from leading aerospace companies. Acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse requires demonstrating, by independent testing, that a fuel is not only technically credible and can be produced at a meaningful scale, but also that it has met strict quality and safety criteria.

""We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,"" said Dr. Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director. ""This marks a significant milestone for Universal Fuel Technologies towards their goal of commercial acceptance.”

The acceptance follows a successful five-month pilot project where the company produced nearly 100 liters of sample material for four different SAF pathways under stable process conditions. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol, and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), into SAF. The samples then underwent comprehensive testing by Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, the world-leading authority on SAF research.

""The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse confirms that Flexiforming can produce high-quality synthetic aviation turbine fuel with a clear route to ASTM qualification,"" said Denis Pchelintsev, Co-Founder of Universal Fuel Technologies. ""We're positioned to support the aviation industry's urgent need for cost-effective synthetic aviation turbine fuel that doesn't compromise on performance or safety.""

Following Unifuel’s D4054 Clearinghouse acceptance, the company will proceed with producing larger fuel samples for detailed Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing required for ASTM qualification. The initial qualification could come as soon as the end of 2026 as a blend component with fossil jet. From there, further testing is planned, with the goal of leading to a 100% drop-in fully synthetic jet fuel in the future.

Unifuel's advancement through the qualification process is supported by Flexiforming's unique capabilities, which upgrade various renewable feedstocks—including ethanol, methanol, renewable naphthas, and liquefied petroleum gas—into high-quality SAF. In ethanol-to-jet applications, Flexiforming uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other processes, cutting production costs by up to 50%. The technology is also valuable as a complementary process, upgrading low-value naphtha byproduct from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, creating new revenue opportunities for renewable fuel producers.

- Long-term (2030+): Position in firms developing hybrid systems and long-haul hydrogen aircraft (e.g., Airbus).","The aviation industry is undergoing a seismic shift as it races to meet global net-zero emissions targets. At the heart of this transformation lies a technology poised to redefine propulsion: hydrogen-electric fuel cells. With the aircraft fuel cell market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.07% from 2025 to 2030 (reaching $3.3 billion by 2030), the sector is attracting strategic capital from investors seeking to capitalize on decarbonization. While the headline CAGR may fall short of the oft-cited 28.4% figure, the underlying drivers—hydrogen innovation, regulatory tailwinds, and eVTOL demand—suggest a far more dynamic opportunity, particularly in the fastest-growing subsegments.

The Triple Catalyst: Innovation, Regulation, and Urban Mobility

The propulsion fuel cell market is being propelled by three interlocking forces:

Hydrogen-Electric Innovation:

Hydrogen fuel cells offer a gravimetric energy density of ~1,500 Wh/kg, far outpacing lithium-ion batteries (300–400 Wh/kg). This makes them ideal for eVTOLs and regional aircraft, where range and payload capacity are critical. Breakthroughs in low-temperature proton exchange membrane (LTPEM) and high-temperature PEM (HTPEM) technologies are reducing costs and improving efficiency. For instance, ZeroAvia's ZA600 propulsion system, now in FAA certification, promises 40% lower operating costs than turbine engines.

Regulatory Tailwinds:

The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates 2% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, scaling to 63% by 2050. While SAF is a near-term solution, hydrogen-electric systems are the long-term answer. The FAA and EASA are fast-tracking certification pathways, with EASA's 2030 target for electric VTOL certification and the FAA's 2024 Hydrogen-Fueled Aircraft Safety Roadmap. These frameworks reduce uncertainty for investors, enabling firms to scale R&D with confidence.

eVTOL and Urban Mobility Demand:

The eVTOL market is forecasted to grow at 54.9% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, with hydrogen-electric propulsion expected to dominate the fastest-growing segment (66% CAGR). Urban air mobility (UAM) and cargo eVTOLs require zero-emission, long-range solutions—hydrogen's refueling speed and energy density make it the clear winner. Companies like Airbus and H2MOF are pioneering hydrogen storage systems that could enable 24–36 hour endurance for drones and helicopters.

Strategic Capital Allocation: Prioritizing R&D-Backed Firms

Investors should focus on firms with robust R&D pipelines and partnerships with aerospace giants. Three stand out:

ZeroAvia (ZAVIY):

The UK-based firm has secured provisional type certification for its 600 kW hydrogen-electric engine and is in conditional talks with major airlines. Its ZA2000 project for larger aircraft, using liquid hydrogen, positions it as a leader in scaling propulsion systems.

Airbus (AIR.PA):

The aerospace giant is leveraging its scale to integrate hydrogen into its A320neo and A350 XWB variants. Its NEWBORN project (a €44.8M EU initiative) aims to develop scalable fuel cell systems for regional and long-haul aircraft. Airbus's 2030 target to launch a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft underscores its commitment.

Plug Power (PLUG):

While best known for industrial hydrogen solutions, Plug's collaboration with eVTOL startups and its modular fuel cell stacks position it to supply propulsion systems for urban mobility. Its recent partnership with Gloyer-Taylor Laboratories to develop lightweight LH2 tanks could be a game-changer.

The Investment Case: Balancing Risk and Reward

The propulsion fuel cell market is still nascent, with challenges including hydrogen infrastructure gaps and supply chain bottlenecks. However, the alignment of regulatory, technological, and market forces creates a compelling risk-reward profile. For instance, H2MOF's metal-organic framework (MOF) storage technology could reduce hydrogen delivery costs by 50–80%, addressing a key barrier to adoption.

Investors should adopt a phased approach:

- Short-term (2025–2027): Allocate capital to firms with FAA/EASA certification milestones (e.g., ZeroAvia).

- Mid-term (2028–2030): Target companies scaling hydrogen storage and infrastructure (e.g., Plug Power).

- Long-term (2030+): Position in firms developing hybrid systems and long-haul hydrogen aircraft (e.g., Airbus).

Conclusion: A Net-Zero Imperative

The transition to hydrogen-electric propulsion is not just an environmental imperative—it's a $40.7 billion market by 2030. For investors, the key is to back firms that combine technical innovation with regulatory agility. ZeroAvia, Airbus, and Plug Power exemplify this, but the sector's breadth also includes niche players like H2MOF and PowerCell Group (which is developing 300 kW ITPEM stacks).

As the FAA and EASA finalize certification standards, the next 12–18 months will be pivotal. Those who act now—allocating capital to R&D-backed innovators—will be well-positioned to ride the hydrogen-electric wave shaping the future of flight.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-26 05:56:08.925139
