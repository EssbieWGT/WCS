The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL.
Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends. Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.",,N,,2025-10-30 10:56:11.152487

Professor Irene Tracey, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, said: ‘I am delighted to welcome to Oxford the General Secretary of Vietnam and our colleagues from there to affirm and deepen the ties between our University and Vietnam’s leading institutions. Oxford has a proud tradition of global partnership — of sharing knowledge across borders to advance education, discovery and public good. These new agreements reflect our shared commitment to nurturing talent, supporting innovation, and addressing the challenges that face our world today. We look forward to working together in the spirit of friendship and mutual learning, strengthening the bridge between Oxford and Vietnam for years to come.’

The Tam Anh Research Institute has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the International Health and Tropical Medicine Group from the Nuffield Department of Medicine, establishing the Tam Anh Oxford Partnership (TOP). The partnership promotes equitable collaboration through joint training, research and capacity building, with a focus on innovations in diagnostics and preventive healthcare for non-communicable diseases.

TOP redefines global health collaboration by putting local leadership and needs priorities at the heart of its design, with Oxford contributing world-class research expertise and training to inform national policies and programmes.

Professor Proochista Araiana, Programme Director, International Health and Tropical Medicine, said: ‘We are delighted to be launching this innovative partnership between Tam Anh, one of Vietnam’s leading private healthcare and vaccine establishments, and Oxford University. This is an exciting time for such a collaboration given Vietnam’s rapid economic growth, epidemiological transition, and national prioritisation for healthcare innovations. TOP exemplifies Oxford’s agenda to extend our research excellence while cultivating strategic and equitable international partnerships to tackle global challenges.’

A further partnership between VietJet and Oxford Net Zero, led by Professor Myles Allen, supports the Net Zero Aviation Project — a £1.6 million research collaboration running until mid-2026.

The project, conducted with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), investigates geologically balanced fuels (GBFs) — a novel approach to offsetting aviation emissions by capturing and permanently storing equivalent CO₂ in geological formations. Emissions from aviation are projected to increase steadily in the coming years, and they are currently some of the hardest emissions to abate. The aim of the Net Zero Aviation Project is to look at a potential new way of tackling this challenge by looking at the feasibility, public perception and impact of GBFs, alongside equity and justice implications. It ultimately aims to develop policies and reporting standards which support gradually increasing the fraction of emissions captured and stored over time through cooperation between the aviation sector and their fuel suppliers.

Professor Myles Allen, Principal Investigator of Oxford Net Zero, said: ‘The Oxford Net Zero initiative is delighted to be working with VietJet and the International Air Travel Association, IATA, on strategies for neutralising the climate impact of aviation. We are specifically exploring the concept of “geologically balanced fuels” as potentially an affordable, scalable, and responsible complement to sustainable aviation fuel. Working with a low-cost carrier with a commitment to both sustainability and affordability that is based in South East Asia, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, brings together in microcosm all the challenges faced by the global aviation sector.’

At the same time, Oxford and Vietnamese entrepreneur and philanthropist Dr Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao launched the Pioneer Scholarship Scheme, providing fully funded postgraduate scholarships for outstanding Vietnamese students.

Global Sustainability Airline Group of the Year: IAG Group

Considering the balance of operational performance, financial metrics and progress around sustainability and environmental matters, IAG Group is the standout airline group in 2024/2025.

In particular, several of the group's major airlines - including British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus - are taking leading positions around the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and supporting sustainable aviation by making long-term investments to support future SAF production.

At the group level, IAG has established a progressive position to meet the EU's SAF mandate ahead of time, with a group target to account for 10% of total fuel use by 2030 target. The group is also investing to support start-ups through its Accelorator programme, which identifies and collaborates with scale-up businesses to help accelerate the industry's energy transition.

Asia/Pac Sustainability Airline of the Year: Air New Zealand

There are few airlines in the world that are able to marry talk and actions in terms of sustainability as well as Air New Zealand.

Despite the airline's own acknowledge issues around aircraft availability, and groundings impacting its sustainability targets, the airline's 2030 Emissions Guidance still projects a 20% to 25% percent reduction in net emissions from jet fuel by 2030 (against a 2019 baseline).

Air New Zealand is also among the most active airlines in the Asia-Pacific when it comes to the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For the year to Jun-2025, 1.7% of total fuel upload was SAF (up from 0.4% in 2024) and the carrier is looking ahead to a target of 10% SAF use by 2030. Beyond this, Air New Zealand is taking a realistic and detailed approach to its efforts to reduce emissions and meet its other commitments around environmental, social and governance efforts.

European Sustainability Airline of the Year: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines

The Dutch national carrier, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, has been a recognised global leader in terms of sustainability initiatives.

The airline was among the first to make long-term commitments around sustainability and other environmental efforts in order to reduce waste, improve efficiency and embrace novel strategies to improve its performance. Sustainability considerations are included across all elements of the business and passenger journey.

In recent years KLM has redoubled its efforts, and is refining its long-term sustainability vision by including it as a core part of business and operating strategy.

The airline is also open to embracing more radical solutions. This includes playing leading roles in efforts to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel and eFuels development, investing to support supply-chain innovation and exploring other more radical ways to reduce emissions.

Few airlines have shown the commitment to the decarbonisation of air travel and have pushed for local, regional and global policies that will support this in the way that KLM has.

Latin American Sustainability Airline of the Year: Volaris

The Mexican LCC Volaris boasts one of the most efficient fleets and highest efficiency airline operations across Central and South America.

A previous winner of CAPA's Latin American Environmental Sustainability Airline of the Year, the airline continues to impress with its practical actions around sustainability - such as rolling out digital tools to improve the efficiency of its flights and minimise environmental impacts.

While maintaining its ultra-low cost operating model Volaris also stands out from LCC peers through its looking forward approach. The airline is one of only a handful of LCCs globally that are investing to support the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Volaris is also engaging in partnerships and investments to accelerate the development of SAF in Mexico.

North America Sustainability Airline of the Year: Air Transat

What is the SAF RCM and why is the consultation significant?

Back in May 2025, the UK government confirmed its intention to introduce – alongside the demand-driver of the SAF Mandate on which more details are available in our article here – an RCM for SAF with the aim of providing investors with the confidence needed to invest time and capital in the development of SAF projects.

The RCM is proposed to take the form of a government-backed ‘revenue certainty contract’ and it is rumoured that the contract counterparty will be the government’s Low Carbon Contracts Company (the counterparty to electricity market Contracts for Difference (CFD)). The RCM contract will guarantee a fixed price (or strike price) for SAF and like the electricity market CFD, SAF producers would receive top up payments where the SAF price received is less than the strike price and would be obliged to make difference payments where they receive a market price above the strike price. It is still to be determined quite how the market price will be calculated.

The government was clear that the costs of the RCM should be borne by the sector through a new variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers that sits alongside existing obligations under the SAF and this consultation seeks views on both the levy’s design and administration.

The Design of the Aviation Fuel Supplier Levy

The consultation sets out several key intended design features of the Aviation Fuel Supplier Levy, namely:

Market share-based contributions: suppliers will be subject to pay proportional charges based on their individual contribution to the volume of fossil aviation fuel supplied in the UK.

Minimum thresholds: suppliers supplying volumes of fossil aviation fuel below 15.9TJ (equivalent to 468,000 litres annually) will be exempt. This is the only exemption proposed to the levy at present.

Forecasting: A rolling 12-month forecast of levy rates is proposed to aid business planning – although this may be subject to change following scheme maturity.

The consultation also seeks views on: (1) the length of the period over which contributions are assessed; (2) the frequency at which levies collected; and (3) the sequencing of the levy’s assessment, collection and billing periods.

Risks and Enforcement

Contingency planning

As the levy will fund the actual cost of the operation of the RCM, the government has decided that the levy will need to be calculated and collected based on forecasts of the scheme costs and then reconciled when actuals become available. This presents the risk that the forecast levy amounts imposed on a supplier are insufficient to cover their proportion of the total scheme costs. To mitigate this under-collection risk, the consultation proposes applying an additional contingency amount on the levy to compensate for uncertainty in the scheme cost forecasts and help to cover any unforeseen costs.

The consultation also includes proposals in relation to over-collection (i.e. when the counterparty levies a greater amount on a supplier than required to cover their proportion of the total scheme costs) and how these will be repaid.

Supplier default

To address the risk of a supplier defaulting on its levy payment obligations, the consultation suggests two mechanisms:

Credit cover: this is a requirement for suppliers to provide a “back-up” for their levy obligations. The consultation suggests that this could be done either through standby letters of credit, cash or a mixture of the two which are placed on either a monthly or quarterly period.

Mutualisation: this refers to the process of spreading the outstanding levy contributions amongst the remaining compliant suppliers where the credit cover is insufficient.

Enforcement Actions

The consultation outlines several potential enforcement tools to ensure compliance with obligations under the Aviation Fuel Supplier Levy based on those which have proved successful in other schemes, including:

Notices of non-compliance: the counterparty will, where necessary, issue formal notices where the supplier has failed to meet its obligations under the levy. This will include information on remedial actions and further enforcement which may be required;

Reporting of compliance and enforcement: publicly reporting on non-compliance to ensure there is transparency, accountability, proportionate enforcement and ensure there is a reputational deterrent;

Interest on late payments: to incentivise timely payments;

Financial penalties: a power for the Secretary of State to issue a supplier with a financial penalty (currently stated in the SAF Bill to be the lesser of either £100,000 or 10% of annual turnover of the supplier).

Next Steps

The consultation offers a crucial opportunity for key stakeholders such as project developers, fuel suppliers, airlines and airports to influence the levy’s design and implementation. The consultation period is open until 8 January 2026. The consultation document and details on how to respond can be found here.

The government’s consultation response is expected later in 2026. That response will inform the development of secondary legislation which will provide the detail of the RCM. The SAF Bill, which will provide the legislative framework for those regulations is going through parliamentary process (with its second reading in the House of Lords scheduled for the end of November 2025) and is expected to receive Royal Assent (and become law) before the end of 2026.

For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF.
As electric vehicles replace gasoline-powered cars, this ethanol can be redirected to jet fuel production without impacting food production or requiring new agricultural investment.
Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient.
By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.","In an exclusive AgroSpectrum interview, Alexei Beltyukov, CEO and Co-founder of Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel), elucidates how the company’s proprietary Flexiforming process transcends the constraints of conventional waste-oil-based biofuels, converting alcohols and low-value refinery byproducts into truly drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). By delivering the elusive aromatic fraction required for jet engine performance — something HEFA and Fischer–Tropsch routes cannot independently supply — Unifuel simultaneously augments yield and slashes both energy and hydrogen inputs.

Beltyukov underscores that Flexiforming’s modularity and compatibility with existing refineries and ethanol facilities offer a capital-efficient scale-up pathway at a time when the SAF markets are beleaguered by feedstock scarcity and punishing production costs. Policy acceleration toward 100 per cent synthetic SAF approval, coupled with long-term airline offtake agreements, he argues, will unlock the confidence necessary for global deployment. Ultimately, Unifuel positions itself not as a solitary panacea but as a catalytic enabler of a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation future, where complementary pathways collaborate to maximise every molecule of renewable carbon.

I. Technology & Production

From Waste to Jet Fuel:

Can you explain the core technology behind Unifuel’s conversion of waste oils and fats into SAF, and what differentiates it from conventional biofuel pathways?

Unifuel doesn’t directly convert waste oils and fats into SAF. Rather, our Flexiforming technology complements existing processes that do. We convert alcohols like ethanol and methanol into high-quality SAF, and we upgrade the low-value byproducts—naphtha and LPG—from Hydroprocessed Esthers and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes that use waste oils and fats.

The key differentiator is our single-step, all-gas phase reaction using a proprietary catalyst. This design reduces energy consumption by 75 per cent and hydrogen requirements by 33 per cent compared to alternative ethanol-to-jet processes, positioning our technology at approximately half the cost. Additionally, we produce aromatic SAF components that HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch cannot, which are essential for jet engine performance and achieving true drop-in capability.

Performance and Sustainability:

How do Unifuel’s SAF products perform in terms of energy density, combustion efficiency, and lifecycle carbon intensity compared to fossil-based jet fuels?

Flexiforming produces SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel, containing the 8-25 per cent aromatics that today’s aircraft engines require. Our SAF has undergone comprehensive testing at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab—the world-leading authority on SAF research—and has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse for qualification. This acceptance demonstrates that our fuel meets strict quality and safety criteria and shows strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully.

In terms of lifecycle carbon intensity, depending on the specific chemical pathway, our energy-efficient process has a carbon intensity 10-31 per cent that of the incoming feedstock—a significant reduction beyond the inherent benefits of using renewable feedstocks.

II. Scaling Challenges

Feedstock Constraints:

Waste oils and fats are finite and geographically dispersed. What strategies is Unifuel pursuing to secure a consistent, scalable feedstock supply, and how do logistics impact production economics?

Rather than competing for limited HEFA feedstocks, our strategy is to make the best of what’s available and diversify. For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF. Apart from making the product a potentially fully synthetic fungible jet fuel (subject to ASTM approvals), this produces 20 per cent more SAF from the same amount of feedstock. Flexiforming works with any alcohol or ether, renewable naphthas, and LPG. This versatility allows plant operators to adapt to feedstock availability and pricing fluctuations.

For ethanol specifically, we see significant opportunity. The U.S. already produces billions of gallons of ethanol annually for gasoline blending. As electric vehicles replace gasoline-powered cars, this ethanol can be redirected to jet fuel production without impacting food production or requiring new agricultural investment. Flexiforming offers ethanol plant operators an economically viable ethanol-to-jet pathway, 50 per cent less expensive than existing ETJ options.

Refinery and Conversion Economics:

What are the key technical and economic bottlenecks in scaling SAF production from laboratory or pilot-scale to commercial refinery operations, and how is Unifuel addressing them ?

The primary bottlenecks are cost (SAF currently costs 2 to 4 times more than conventional jet fuel) and feedstock limitations. Our single-reactor design dramatically reduces capital and operational costs. Flexiforming is also designed for scalable deployment at various sizes, from small bolt-on units for Fischer-Tropsch plants to large refinery-scale installations. This flexibility allows producers to match their investment to their specific circumstances rather than requiring massive upfront capital. Critically, we integrate with existing infrastructure, minimizing deployment costs and accelerating time to market. Our successful 2024 five-month pilot campaign demonstrates we’ve moved beyond laboratory concepts closer to commercially proven, reproducible technology.

III. Policy & Market Dynamics

Regulatory Alignment:

How do government incentives, blending mandates, and carbon credit schemes influence SAF adoption, and where do you see regulatory gaps that need urgent attention to accelerate deployment ?

Similar to how EVs initially depended on government incentives before becoming mainstream, SAF needs policy support to offset the current cost premium and give producers confidence to invest.

The next step we are awaiting in the regulatory area is the adoption of a standard for 100 per cent drop-in, fully synthetic SAF. Currently, ASTM standards allow most SAF to be blended with conventional jet fuel up to 50 per cent . The industry anticipates approval for 100 per cent synthetic SAF by the end of 2026, but this requires addressing the aromatics requirement—something HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch alone cannot provide.

Technologies that can produce aromatic SAF components should receive accelerated regulatory review and support, as they’re essential for eliminating the need for continued blending with fossil fuels.

Global Market Readiness:

With airlines increasingly committing to SAF targets, what is your perspective on the readiness of global supply chains and airport infrastructure to handle large-scale SAF integration?

Infrastructure is largely in place to support greater use of SAF, since it is a “drop-in” replacement that works with today’s aircraft. Once the fully synthetic SAF standard is adopted, common-carrier pipelines and all other infrastructure will be accessible to SAF. The real challenge is scaling production to meet growing demand. SAF currently represents less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel consumption, and closing that gap will depend on both technologies that make existing production pathways more efficient and cost-effective, as well as the regulatory approach.

A lot of capacity and feedstock that can be used to make SAF are presently targeting renewable diesel. This is a partial result of how the tax incentives are set up, and also of the fact that when making SAF, the producers inevitably make significant quantities of naphtha – a byproduct that, in the absence of Flexiforming, has a relatively low value.

Flexiforming helps in exactly that way. By upgrading low-value byproducts such as naphtha and LPG into additional SAF, our technology enables producers to generate more fuel from the same feedstock. This increases total output while improving project economics, which in turn helps airlines and fuel suppliers meet their sustainability commitments more quickly and affordably.

IV. Strategic Outlook

Investment and Partnership Models:

What role do strategic airline partnerships, venture capital, and private equity play in enabling SAF scale-up, and what frameworks have you found most effective for attracting long-term investment?

Strategic partnerships are critical, especially between technology providers, fuel producers, and airlines. Airlines’ long-term offtake agreements provide the demand certainty investors look for, while venture and private equity partners can fund early deployment.

Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient. Our customers can integrate Flexiforming into their existing plants with relatively low CapEx, creating a more distributed, resilient SAF supply network. This model appeals to investors because it allows them to participate across multiple facilities and feedstocks, reducing risk while accelerating market penetration.

Beyond Waste Oils:

As SAF demand grows, how is Unifuel preparing for feedstock diversification — for example, algae, municipal waste, or other renewable sources — and what technical or economic hurdles remain in that transition ?

Feedstock diversification is at the heart of Flexiforming’s value proposition. We can already process any naphtha, alcohol or ether, so as new pathways to these feeds emerge—from algae, cellulosic sources, or other biomass—we can potentially integrate them.

For municipal and agricultural waste, we complement Fischer-Tropsch processing. By upgrading FT’s naphtha and LPG byproducts into aromatic SAF, we can increase plant revenue by 10-20 per cent, making waste-to-SAF projects more financially viable.

The main challenge is not chemistry, but logistics and preprocessing costs. That’s why our technology can be deployed at different scales, even near the source of biomass or waste conversion. By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.

Vision for Net-Zero Aviation:

Looking ahead 5–10 years, how do you see Unifuel contributing to a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation sector, and what are the key milestones the industry must hit to achieve that vision?

We envision three major use cases: bolt-ons to Fischer-Tropsch and HEFA plants processing waste feedstocks; partnerships with ethanol plants transitioning from selling ethanol for gasoline blending to SAF; and retrofitting existing oil refineries for SAF production.

The key industry milestones include ASTM approval for 100 per cent drop-in synthetic SAF by end of 2026; achieving economic parity or near-parity with conventional jet fuel through technology improvements and policy support; and successfully diversifying beyond limited HEFA feedstocks.

Our goal is for Flexiforming to become a mainstream enabling technology—recognizing that no single pathway will meet 100 per cent of demand, but that complementary technologies working together can maximize resource utilization and make sustainable aviation the norm rather than the exception.

The agreement makes United the first commercial airline to procure SAF for flights leaving George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Dulles International Airport in Washington DC.

The development represents a critical step in sourcing alternative fuels within the aviation sector.

Lauren Riley, Chief Sustainability Officer at United, emphasised the importance of taking action: ""In this moment, we'll be judged by our actions – not our words. And at United Airlines, progress is everything.

""Last week marked a milestone for advancing sustainable aviation fuel: for the first time ever, SAF is now flowing to three new airports – Newark, Dulles and Houston.""

According to the agreement, Neste began deliveries to Houston in July for a term ending in October 2025. Deliveries to Newark and Dulles started in September and are set to continue until the end of 2025.

Leveraging infrastructure for SAF delivery

The deployment of the SAF relies on existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste's SAF terminal facilities in Houston.

From there, neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is blended with conventional jet fuel to meet the required aviation specifications.

While aviation represents a smaller portion of global emissions compared to other industries, it is considered one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise.

This is due to the need for technological innovation across low-emission fuel production, aircraft and engine improvements and operational optimisation.

Policy incentives and market growth

Securing a stable and scalable supply of SAF remains a major challenge, with government support often playing a crucial role.

Lauren acknowledges the sector's dependence on policy incentives to aid its decarbonisation efforts.

""While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognise that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments,"" she explains.

The coordination required to achieve this supply milestone was substantial.

Lauren adds: ""This didn't happen easily or overnight. It took relentless coordination, innovation and a team that refused to settle for 'good enough.' But we did it – because meaningful change demands action.""

For procurement executives, the main concerns in the SAF market centre on availability and cost alongside geopolitical tensions and tariffs linked to growing protectionism.

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President of Commercial Renewable Products at Neste, stresses the necessity of supportive policies: ""It is crucial that more states enact proven incentive policy frameworks to accelerate the production of SAF and support the aviation industry towards its net-zero carbon emission goal by 2050.""

Production capacity and emissions reduction

This partnership builds on previous collaboration between United and Neste.

Neste has supplied SAF to United at Chicago O'Hare International Airport since August 2024 after Illinois enacted a SAF purchase credit. The fuel has also been used at San Francisco International Airport, where California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard supports the adoption of renewable fuels.

Neste's current global SAF production capability stands at 1.5 million tons, or approximately 515 million gallons, per year.

Neste has plans to expand this capacity to 2.2 million tons (around 750 million gallons) by 2027.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/e3d2a8518a6d3ed6408b9bb7e751544c:8ced8d92e3889b0bf173ff61d31debbc/united-airlines.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 09:56:45.887376

(""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), today shared its perspective on the rapidly evolving global policy landscape shaping the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

The scale of the challenge - and opportunity - is immense. According to the International Air Transport Association (""IATA""), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions. In 2024, global SAF production totalled only ~330 million gallons - about 0.3% of total jet-fuel demand. Meeting 2050 decarbonization targets will require an estimated 27% compound annual growth rate in production capacity and the construction of 5,000 - 7,000 new facilities worldwide. This gap represents one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition, with analysts projecting the SAF market could exceed ~$25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050.

Governments are responding. Across major markets, policymakers are using mandates and incentive schemes to accelerate SAF adoption. Today, more than 2 billion people globally live in countries with SAF blending mandates or strong incentives, such as tax credits - by 2030, this number is expected to grow to more than 4 billion people.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge aims to expand domestic consumption of SAF to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.

In Europe,the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates that SAF make up 2% of all jet fuel by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050, creating one of the largest mandated clean-fuel markets globally.

The UK has coupled mandates starting from 2% in 2025 and increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 with revenue-certainty mechanisms that help cover the price premium between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Across Asia-Pacific, countries including Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and Singapore are developing frameworks that combine blending targets, tax incentives, and infrastructure funding to stimulate both production and demand.

""Global demand for SAF is shifting from 'if' to 'how fast,'"" said Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF. ""Mandates, incentives, and procurement are converging to drive volume. These dynamics underscore the value of XCF's early-mover advantage and modular design, which we're now extending globally through partnerships such as with New Rise Australia, a venture that is expected to develop three SAF sites across the continent to meet Australia's growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.""

XCF highlighted three dynamics that will shape the next phase of growth:

Diverse toolkits, common direction. Regions may use different policy levers - mandates, subsidies, tax credits, or procurement - but they all point toward accelerating adoption.

Technology mix evolution. HEFA remains the dominant pathway in the near-term, while policy frameworks are creating headroom for emerging pathways to scale toward 2050 targets.

System reliability. Airlines and fuel suppliers need dependable volumes, transparent carbon accounting, and logistics that work across borders. Producers with operational capacity and credible expansion plans will lead.

""As SAF adoption transitions from pilot programs to long-term supply, reliability and verifiability become the new currency of trust,"" Dange added. ""XCF is building the backbone of that transition by advancing the infrastructure and partnerships needed to make SAF the new standard across global aviation.""

For airports worldwide, a top priority is scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for all aircrafts. SAF has the potential to dramatically reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% per lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuels. As one of the busiest airports on the West Coast, PDX is committed to leading this transition in cooperation with the international airports in Seattle and Vancouver, BC, who we have a joint decarbonization agreement with. By implementing SAF, we can significantly decrease our airport operation’s carbon footprint and set an example for global aviation. This shift not only supports our local and global climate goals but also encourages airlines to adopt greener practices. The widespread adoption of SAF would be a game-changer, reducing the aviation industry's overall impact on climate change and fostering a more sustainable future for air travel.

What’s one sustainability effort you personally will try to adopt in the next year?

Portland, Oregon, has a world-renowned food scene—from our fresh seafood and fruit to our revered chefs and wine, I truly live in foodie heaven. Now, my family and I are committing to using our unrivaled options to land on a more climate-friendly diet. This means reducing the number of meat-centric meals I eat in a week, seeking out locally grown products to minimize transportation, and prioritizing organic and sustainable farming practices. Supporting local farmers not only reduces the environmental impact of transporting food over long distances, but it also strengthens our local economy. Adopting these practices allows us to make a meaningful contribution to the fight against climate change, one meal at a time.

What is a climate solution that isn't getting the attention or funding it deserves?

I live in the American West, and for my community the clear climate crisis that urgently needs attention is the rise of increasingly devastating wildfires and the dangerous smoke they produce. The deadly 2020 Labor Day Fires in Oregon ripped through more than a million acres, burning several towns to the ground. That same year in neighboring California, the state emitted more greenhouse gases in just one year than it had previously eliminated through 18 years of carbon-reduction efforts—effectively erasing nearly two decades of progress. Yet, despite their scale and impact, emissions from wildfires are often excluded from official inventories. Wildfire smoke is also emerging as the deadliest climate-related health threat in the U.S.

It is impossible to overstate the personal and economic toll these fires are taking across the West, and our leaders must meet the moment. That means seriously prioritizing wildfire mitigation, forest resilience, smoke mitigation, and emissions accounting. Investing in these wildfire reduction efforts is not optional—it is essential in our fight against climate change.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

Local innovations fueling creative climate solutions. This was the Port of Portland’s North Star as we united the talents of people from across the Pacific Northwest to build PDX’s new state-of-the-art terminal. Together, we are doubling the airport’s size, yet cutting our energy use in half by using the latest in local, sustainably sourced designs and upgrades.

For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF.
As electric vehicles replace gasoline-powered cars, this ethanol can be redirected to jet fuel production without impacting food production or requiring new agricultural investment.
Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient.
By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.","In an exclusive AgroSpectrum interview, Alexei Beltyukov, CEO and Co-founder of Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel), elucidates how the company’s proprietary Flexiforming process transcends the constraints of conventional waste-oil-based biofuels, converting alcohols and low-value refinery byproducts into truly drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). By delivering the elusive aromatic fraction required for jet engine performance — something HEFA and Fischer–Tropsch routes cannot independently supply — Unifuel simultaneously augments yield and slashes both energy and hydrogen inputs.

Beltyukov underscores that Flexiforming’s modularity and compatibility with existing refineries and ethanol facilities offer a capital-efficient scale-up pathway at a time when the SAF markets are beleaguered by feedstock scarcity and punishing production costs. Policy acceleration toward 100 per cent synthetic SAF approval, coupled with long-term airline offtake agreements, he argues, will unlock the confidence necessary for global deployment. Ultimately, Unifuel positions itself not as a solitary panacea but as a catalytic enabler of a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation future, where complementary pathways collaborate to maximise every molecule of renewable carbon.

I. Technology & Production

From Waste to Jet Fuel:

Can you explain the core technology behind Unifuel’s conversion of waste oils and fats into SAF, and what differentiates it from conventional biofuel pathways?

Unifuel doesn’t directly convert waste oils and fats into SAF. Rather, our Flexiforming technology complements existing processes that do. We convert alcohols like ethanol and methanol into high-quality SAF, and we upgrade the low-value byproducts—naphtha and LPG—from Hydroprocessed Esthers and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes that use waste oils and fats.

The key differentiator is our single-step, all-gas phase reaction using a proprietary catalyst. This design reduces energy consumption by 75 per cent and hydrogen requirements by 33 per cent compared to alternative ethanol-to-jet processes, positioning our technology at approximately half the cost. Additionally, we produce aromatic SAF components that HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch cannot, which are essential for jet engine performance and achieving true drop-in capability.

Performance and Sustainability:

How do Unifuel’s SAF products perform in terms of energy density, combustion efficiency, and lifecycle carbon intensity compared to fossil-based jet fuels?

Flexiforming produces SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel, containing the 8-25 per cent aromatics that today’s aircraft engines require. Our SAF has undergone comprehensive testing at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab—the world-leading authority on SAF research—and has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse for qualification. This acceptance demonstrates that our fuel meets strict quality and safety criteria and shows strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully.

In terms of lifecycle carbon intensity, depending on the specific chemical pathway, our energy-efficient process has a carbon intensity 10-31 per cent that of the incoming feedstock—a significant reduction beyond the inherent benefits of using renewable feedstocks.

II. Scaling Challenges

Feedstock Constraints:

Waste oils and fats are finite and geographically dispersed. What strategies is Unifuel pursuing to secure a consistent, scalable feedstock supply, and how do logistics impact production economics?

Rather than competing for limited HEFA feedstocks, our strategy is to make the best of what’s available and diversify. For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF. Apart from making the product a potentially fully synthetic fungible jet fuel (subject to ASTM approvals), this produces 20 per cent more SAF from the same amount of feedstock. Flexiforming works with any alcohol or ether, renewable naphthas, and LPG. This versatility allows plant operators to adapt to feedstock availability and pricing fluctuations.

For ethanol specifically, we see significant opportunity. The U.S. already produces billions of gallons of ethanol annually for gasoline blending. As electric vehicles replace gasoline-powered cars, this ethanol can be redirected to jet fuel production without impacting food production or requiring new agricultural investment. Flexiforming offers ethanol plant operators an economically viable ethanol-to-jet pathway, 50 per cent less expensive than existing ETJ options.

Refinery and Conversion Economics:

What are the key technical and economic bottlenecks in scaling SAF production from laboratory or pilot-scale to commercial refinery operations, and how is Unifuel addressing them ?

The primary bottlenecks are cost (SAF currently costs 2 to 4 times more than conventional jet fuel) and feedstock limitations. Our single-reactor design dramatically reduces capital and operational costs. Flexiforming is also designed for scalable deployment at various sizes, from small bolt-on units for Fischer-Tropsch plants to large refinery-scale installations. This flexibility allows producers to match their investment to their specific circumstances rather than requiring massive upfront capital. Critically, we integrate with existing infrastructure, minimizing deployment costs and accelerating time to market. Our successful 2024 five-month pilot campaign demonstrates we’ve moved beyond laboratory concepts closer to commercially proven, reproducible technology.

III. Policy & Market Dynamics

Regulatory Alignment:

How do government incentives, blending mandates, and carbon credit schemes influence SAF adoption, and where do you see regulatory gaps that need urgent attention to accelerate deployment ?

Similar to how EVs initially depended on government incentives before becoming mainstream, SAF needs policy support to offset the current cost premium and give producers confidence to invest.

The next step we are awaiting in the regulatory area is the adoption of a standard for 100 per cent drop-in, fully synthetic SAF. Currently, ASTM standards allow most SAF to be blended with conventional jet fuel up to 50 per cent . The industry anticipates approval for 100 per cent synthetic SAF by the end of 2026, but this requires addressing the aromatics requirement—something HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch alone cannot provide.

Technologies that can produce aromatic SAF components should receive accelerated regulatory review and support, as they’re essential for eliminating the need for continued blending with fossil fuels.

Global Market Readiness:

With airlines increasingly committing to SAF targets, what is your perspective on the readiness of global supply chains and airport infrastructure to handle large-scale SAF integration?

Infrastructure is largely in place to support greater use of SAF, since it is a “drop-in” replacement that works with today’s aircraft. Once the fully synthetic SAF standard is adopted, common-carrier pipelines and all other infrastructure will be accessible to SAF. The real challenge is scaling production to meet growing demand. SAF currently represents less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel consumption, and closing that gap will depend on both technologies that make existing production pathways more efficient and cost-effective, as well as the regulatory approach.

A lot of capacity and feedstock that can be used to make SAF are presently targeting renewable diesel. This is a partial result of how the tax incentives are set up, and also of the fact that when making SAF, the producers inevitably make significant quantities of naphtha – a byproduct that, in the absence of Flexiforming, has a relatively low value.

Flexiforming helps in exactly that way. By upgrading low-value byproducts such as naphtha and LPG into additional SAF, our technology enables producers to generate more fuel from the same feedstock. This increases total output while improving project economics, which in turn helps airlines and fuel suppliers meet their sustainability commitments more quickly and affordably.

IV. Strategic Outlook

Investment and Partnership Models:

What role do strategic airline partnerships, venture capital, and private equity play in enabling SAF scale-up, and what frameworks have you found most effective for attracting long-term investment?

Strategic partnerships are critical, especially between technology providers, fuel producers, and airlines. Airlines’ long-term offtake agreements provide the demand certainty investors look for, while venture and private equity partners can fund early deployment.

Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient. Our customers can integrate Flexiforming into their existing plants with relatively low CapEx, creating a more distributed, resilient SAF supply network. This model appeals to investors because it allows them to participate across multiple facilities and feedstocks, reducing risk while accelerating market penetration.

Beyond Waste Oils:

As SAF demand grows, how is Unifuel preparing for feedstock diversification — for example, algae, municipal waste, or other renewable sources — and what technical or economic hurdles remain in that transition ?

Feedstock diversification is at the heart of Flexiforming’s value proposition. We can already process any naphtha, alcohol or ether, so as new pathways to these feeds emerge—from algae, cellulosic sources, or other biomass—we can potentially integrate them.

For municipal and agricultural waste, we complement Fischer-Tropsch processing. By upgrading FT’s naphtha and LPG byproducts into aromatic SAF, we can increase plant revenue by 10-20 per cent, making waste-to-SAF projects more financially viable.

The main challenge is not chemistry, but logistics and preprocessing costs. That’s why our technology can be deployed at different scales, even near the source of biomass or waste conversion. By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.

Vision for Net-Zero Aviation:

Looking ahead 5–10 years, how do you see Unifuel contributing to a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation sector, and what are the key milestones the industry must hit to achieve that vision?

We envision three major use cases: bolt-ons to Fischer-Tropsch and HEFA plants processing waste feedstocks; partnerships with ethanol plants transitioning from selling ethanol for gasoline blending to SAF; and retrofitting existing oil refineries for SAF production.

The key industry milestones include ASTM approval for 100 per cent drop-in synthetic SAF by end of 2026; achieving economic parity or near-parity with conventional jet fuel through technology improvements and policy support; and successfully diversifying beyond limited HEFA feedstocks.

Our goal is for Flexiforming to become a mainstream enabling technology—recognizing that no single pathway will meet 100 per cent of demand, but that complementary technologies working together can maximize resource utilization and make sustainable aviation the norm rather than the exception.",https://agrospectrumindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Flexiforming_SAF_Wallpaper_Alternative.png,N,,2025-10-30 09:57:01.133363

The urgency of this innovation cannot be overstated, as increased air travel has escalated the demand for jet fuel, which is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. The study, published in the esteemed journal Nature Communications, elucidates their unique approach to addressing the aviation sector’s environmental challenges while ensuring that the resulting fuel meets rigorous industry standards without the need for fossil fuel blends.

At the heart of this research is a thermochemical conversion technique known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). This innovative process replicates the natural formation of crude oil, applying high heat and pressure to wet biomass, specifically food waste, to synthesize biocrude oil. The versatility of HTL allows it to utilize a broad spectrum of organic materials, making it a promising solution for converting various waste products into valuable energy sources. The successful transformation of food waste into usable fuel exemplifies a crucial step toward sustainability in transportation.

Food waste itself is an alarming global issue, with over 30% of edible food discarded each year across the supply chain—from agricultural production to household waste. This not only exacerbates food insecurity but also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, especially when waste decomposes in landfills and contaminates water sources. By harnessing this waste through HTL, the researchers not only provide a method for reducing environmental impact but also promote the concept of sustainability in the aviation industry.

The research team meticulously crafted a three-step process to refine biocrude into aviable transport fuel. Initially, impurities such as moisture, ash, and salts are eliminated from the crude oil. Following this purification stage, catalytic hydrotreating is employed to remove unwanted constituents like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The result is a refined hydrocarbon mix suitable for aviation fuel. This breakthrough not only reutilizes food waste but also addresses the pressing need for cleaner energy alternatives in the aviation sector.

Lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently earned her doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, emphasizes that the effectiveness of their approach is rooted in the selection of suitable catalysts. After experimenting with various options, the researchers designated cobalt molybdenum as the most effective catalyst for facilitating the necessary reactions to refine biocrude into jet fuel. This strategic selection sets this research apart, showcasing the importance of catalyst efficiency in future developments within this field.

Their rigorous testing revealed that the sustainable aviation fuel produced from food waste passed advanced pre-screening tests set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Impressively, this SAF sample adhered to all the specifications required for conventional jet fuel without the need for any additive or blending with fossil fuels. This not only validates their methodology but also positions their innovation as a legitimate contender for commercial aviation fuel.

The scalable nature of this technology bolsters its potential for widespread commercialization. Yuanhui Zhang, a co-author of the study and a professor in the same department, asserts that agriculture will play a critical role in providing the diverse renewable feedstocks necessary to meet aviation’s decarbonization goals. Their method can be utilized to produce various forms of sustainable fuels beyond just jet fuel, paving the way for a broader impact on the energy landscape.

In an era where sustainability is a primary concern, this research contributes meaningfully to the concept of the circular bioeconomy. Unlike conventional processes that adhere to a linear pattern of production and disposal, the approach employed by Zhang and Summers encapsulates the essence of circularity—taking waste materials and converting them into energy and usable products. This not only mitigates waste but also enhances resource efficiency in multiple industries, from aviation to plastics.

The implications of this research extend beyond immediate environmental concerns; they open doors for extensive commercial opportunities. As industry stakeholders grapple with climate change and the imperative to adopt greener practices, innovations like the conversion of food waste into aviation fuel could redefine how we perceive waste and energy production. The potential for growth in this sector is immense, especially as policymakers and the public become increasingly supportive of sustainable initiatives.

Moving forward, the expected impact of this study hinges on continued collaboration between academia and industry. The transition from laboratory successes to commercial viability involves addressing engineering and economic challenges that will arise during the scale-up of such processes. This transition is essential not only for the advancement of SAF but also for broader initiatives aimed at establishing a more sustainable energy economy.

In conclusion, the research conducted at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign stands as a beacon of hope for a future where aviation can coexist harmoniously with environmental sustainability. By harnessing food waste and turning it into a viable energy source, they have not only tackled an existing problem but have also positioned sustainable aviation fuel as a feasible option for the aviation industry’s future. As the world increasingly stands at the crossroads of climate action, innovations such as these are vital roadmaps showing the way forward.

The paper detailing this groundbreaking research, titled “From food waste to sustainable aviation fuel: cobalt molybdenum catalysis of pretreated hydrothermal liquefaction biocrude,” is published in Nature Communications, further legitimizing the methods and impacts discussed. With the backing of the U.S. Department of Energy and support from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, this research highlights the integral role that funding and collaboration play in driving scientific advancements.

As we navigate through the challenges posed by climate change, the importance of converting waste into valuable resources cannot be understated. The work at the University of Illinois is a prime example of how innovation and sustainability can blend seamlessly, forging a path toward a cleaner, more sustainable future.

Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang noted.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.

Zhang has developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, and he said SAF provides a valuable contribution to circularity.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” he concluded.",https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2025/10/29/690230eb16670_SabrinaSummers.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 09:57:19.198305

In this study, it was shown that cobalt molybdenum catalyst effectively upgraded food waste-derived HTL biocrude oil into drop-in SAF.
Despite the improved circularity through producing SAF from food waste, it is apparent that food waste alone will only be part of the solution to provide feedstocks for SAF.
Specifically, municipal solid waste and wet waste (including food waste) is just a fraction of the potential sustainable biomass supply for production of liquid transportation fuels.
Overall, increased recovery of food waste from other waste management practices would most greatly improve the circularity of this HTL-SAF pathway.","Rising energy demand and the negative impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have hastened efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). To achieve the United States’s SAF Grand Challenge of meeting 100% domestic demand for aviation fuel and net-zero carbon emissions, a significant uptake in SAF is required. SAF can form a circular carbon loop that utilizes carbon emissions during production, transportation, and combustion, effectively reducing aviation’s carbon footprint1. Further, aviation represents 2–3% of global GHG emissions and 11% of U.S. GHG emissions2,3. However, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel3,4,5, largely due to the use of biogenic waste material, which allows uptake of feedstock to offset combustion carbon emissions from SAF3.

Currently, there are eight SAF production pathways and three co-processing pathways approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)6. Synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) is the most mature and least expensive pathway, but it is severely constrained by feedstock availability7. HEFA-SPK hydroprocesses lipid feedstocks, including FOGs, algae, vegetable oils like soybean oil, and seed oils like jatropha. Furthermore, synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed hydrocarbons, esters, and fatty acids (HC-HEFA-SPK) utilizes an additional feedstock, algae oil from Botryococcus braunii, to produce SAF. Fischer-Tropsch hydroprocessed synthesized paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK) converts woody biomass (e.g., municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, forest/wood residues, energy crops) into syngas through gasification, followed by production of hydrocarbons through FT, and hydroprocessing. The additional production of aromatics (FT-SPK/A) addresses the low aromatics content of FT-SPK fuel through the alkylation of light aromatics with FT-derived olefins. Synthesized isoparaffins from hydroprocessed fermented sugars (HFS-SIP) utilizes microbial conversion of sugars from cellulosic biomass (e.g., corn stover, non-woody biomass, pretreated FOGs), to produce farnesene, which can then be hydroprocessed into isoparaffins. Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) synthetic paraffinic kerosene produces isobutanol or ethanol via fermentation or gasification of cellulosic biomass, which then undergo dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation to form jet-range hydrocarbons. ATJ synthetic paraffinic kerosene with aromatics (ATJ-SKA) also addresses the low aromatic content of ATJ SAF, deriving aromatics from C2-C5 alcohols through additional dehydration and aromatization steps. Lastly, hydrothermal conversion of fatty acid esters and fatty acids (CHJ) treats waste and energy oils through catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction and hydroprocessing. The blend limit is 50% for all approved pathways, except for HFS-SIP and HC-HEFA SPK, which are limited to 10%. For co-processing, esters and fatty acids, FT hydrocarbons, and HEFA hydrocarbons are hydroprocessed with petroleum in a conventional refinery, limited to 5%, 5%, and 10% blends, respectively.

The utilization of waste biomass plays a significant role in the production of biofuels for the transportation sector and reduction of GHG emissions. Biofuels can be defined as first-generation (edible oil seeds), second-generation (non-edible oil seeds, waste materials), third-generation (algae), and fourth-generation (genetically engineered oil crops) according to their feedstock8. In particular, second-generation feedstocks avoid land use and enable the recovery of carbon and energy from waste streams, presenting a sustainable feedstock for fuel production. Approximately 11% of bio-based energy and chemicals in the U.S. are produced from waste biomass9. Potential biomass feedstocks from waste streams include waste lipids like FOGs (fat, oil, and grease), food waste, algal blooms, sewage sludge, and agricultural and forestry residues. While catalytic hydroprocessing of lipid feedstocks, such as waste cooking oils, is currently the most competitive pathway for renewable diesel and SAF, feedstock sustainability is limited by availability and cost10. One promising feedstock for SAF is food waste, an impactful biomass stream that represents reusable carbon sources for renewable energy applications. In the United States, food waste is the most common discarded material for landfill and incineration11. Over 30% of food is wasted or lost in the global supply chain each year; In 2021, it was reported that 13.2% was lost in the chain from farm to consumer, while an additional 17% was wasted at the consumer level, including households, food service, and retail12. Furthermore, disposal of food waste in landfills has further environmental impacts through GHG emissions during decomposition11. Food waste is an ideal feedstock for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a thermochemical conversion method that reacts wet biomass under high heat and pressure to produce biocrude oil, along with aqueous, char, and gaseous byproducts. Compared to other thermochemical technologies, HTL has an economic advantage by using the inherent water content of feedstocks as a reaction medium, thereby avoiding the time-consuming and cost-prohibitive drying pretreatment step13. Moreso, it can convert a broad range of feedstock, including non-lipid components of biomass, such as proteins and carbohydrates14. While HTL biocrude is a promising substitution for liquid petroleum products such as transportation fuels, it possesses several undesirable physicochemical properties that make it unsuitable as a drop-in fuel, including high oxygen content; high viscosity and acidity; and low heating value13,15. Furthermore, biocrude oil derived from biogenic feedstocks contain alkali impurities and sulfur that can cause catalyst deactivation over time16. Nonetheless, HTL’s ability to convert a broad range of feedstocks gives it an advantage over other SAF conversion technologies, such as HEFA-SPK, which is sensitive to feedstock volatility, price, and availability7. For example, the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of HEFA-SPK in the United States ranged from $1.84–9.40/GGE, depending on feedstock source7. Comparatively, the MFSP of SAF from HTL has been reported from $2.77/GGE for sewage sludge feedstock17, $3.34/GGE for food waste18, and up to $5.42/GGE for cultivated algae19. Furthermore, 8-18% of costs were associated with the required upgrading of HTL biocrude oil, including hydrotreating and hydrocracking17,19. For feedstocks requiring deeper heteroatom removal, the addition of a hydrodenitrogenation unit only added $0.02/GGE19.

Valorization of biowaste feedstocks like food waste into renewable transportation fuels such as SAF promotes both feedstock and energy sustainability, as well as a zero-waste circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, this waste-to-energy paradigm contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 7, 12, and 13. In the 2023 SDG Report, it was found that although 28.2% of electricity came from renewable energy sources, growth in clean energy for the transportation sector has been much more limited, with only 4.0% from renewable sources12. The aviation industry, like most of the transportation sector, is difficult to electrify, so HTL represents a potential solution to pivot away from fossil fuels and achieve SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy. Furthermore, SAF from food waste directly serves SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production by providing a renewable alternative to alleviate fossil fuel consumption, as well as utilizing a feedstock that helps the goal to decrease food waste and loss 50% by 203012. Lastly, SAF production and consumption improves carbon circularity, therefore working toward SDG 13 Climate Action to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate global warming12.

HTL biocrude must be upgraded to remove inorganic components and improve its fuel properties. Depending on the feedstock, different challenges and upgrading routes exist. For example, HTL feedstocks with high protein content, such as algae, typically produce nitrogenous biocrude that may require deeper heteroatom removal with more severe or multi-stage hydrotreating20,21. Lignocellulosic oil contains a significant amount of aromatics desirable for SAF, but the complex composition of lignin compounds make them recalcitrant to hydrotreating, necessitating reaction engineering and catalyst development for efficient hydrodeoxygenation22. Furthermore, HTL of high-lipid feedstocks typically produces heavier biocrude compounds due to repolymerization reactions, requiring hydrocracking during upgrading23. Common technologies used for biocrude upgrading include distillation, esterification, emulsification, hydrotreating, hydrocracking, and steam reforming15,24,25. Catalytic hydrotreating can target removal of heteroatoms, as well as improve hydrogen content and fuel quality of the biocrude, while avoiding carbon loss from decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions20. Previous studies have explored hydrotreating biocrude from various feedstocks including lignocellulose, agricultural waste, algae, sewage sludge, waste cooking oil, and food waste. Molybdenum-based catalysts are desirable for their low cost, comparable activity to noble-metal catalysts, and effectiveness toward deoxygenation (de-O). Cobalt molybdenum catalysts have been shown to be slightly more effective for denitrogenation (de-N) compared to nickel molybdenum. For example, 99% de-N was achieved for hydrotreated HTL biocrude using CoMo26, while NiMo achieved up to 80% using single-stage hydrotreating27, and 92.5% using two-stage hydrotreating21. Additionally, Cronin et al. found that CoMo led to increased removal of heterocyclic nitrogenates, such as pyridine and pyrimidine28. Catalysts with higher metal loads exhibit improved yield and de-O29, and while organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol can act as hydrogen donors, they may also cause competing reactions between hydrogenating the solvent and biocrude oil30.

Hydrotreating temperatures for HTL biocrude typically range from 350 to 400 °C and pressures of 4–10 MPa20,27,28. The use of lower temperatures (200-325 °C) has also been explored to improve biocrude stabilization for increased demetallization31,32 and de-N21. Depending on the reactor configuration (batch vs. continuous), the catalyst load and retention time (RT) may be defined individually or as a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV, h−1). In batch reactors, the equivalent WHSV can be defined as the ratio of biocrude to catalyst mass divided by the RT. For continuous hydrotreating, the 0.3–1.0 h−1 WHSV was used, with 0.5 h−1 the most common27,28,31,32. Meanwhile, batch reactors applied catalyst:oil mass ratios of 0.5 and RTs of 4 h, yielding an equivalent WHSV of 0.5 h−1, making them comparable to conditions in a continuous reactor20,21,32. Existing studies showed that temperature and pressure are significant factors for de-O and de-N, while also influencing fuel quality and product yields29,33. Although higher temperature increased oil recovery and is required for further de-N, it may also lead to polymerization, condensation, and cracking reactions due to instability of reactive oxygenates32,34. At higher hydrogen pressure, the extent of de-O increased, while coking and decarboxylation reactions were minimized and there was improved hydrogenation of heterocyclic nitrogenates20,27,30. However, at severe pressures, polymerization of small molecules may also occur, decreasing the final oil yield29. Meanwhile, low pressures may result in the diffusion of gases formed during hydrocracking reactions, causing biocrude oil to be increasingly converted into gas and lighter molecules29. The RT also influenced product yields and fuel quality, with longer times allowing for further de-O and hydrocracking reactions29,30. But at extended reaction times (>4 h), polymerization reactions occured and increased coke formation caused catalyst deactivation29,30.

Although previous works have also produced SAF candidates through the catalytic treatment of food waste-derived precursors, their resulting fuel viability was restricted by blending limits, nitrogen, and sulfur levels. For example, Cronin et al. hydrotreated biocrude from HTL of food waste using CoMo and NiMo, but 0.86–1.34 wt% nitrogen and 0.02–0.03 wt% sulfur remained28. Meanwhile, catalytic upgrading of volatile fatty acids (VFA) from the anaerobic digestion of food waste produced a neat SAF candidate, i.e., unblended, with 26–68 ppm nitrogen, slightly above the ASTM limit of 15 ppm16. Additionally, the VFA-SAF candidate was limited by its flash point and low temperature viscosity, requiring at least 70% blending with Jet A to meet ASTM specification limits in Tier α and β tests16. In this study, it was shown that cobalt molybdenum catalyst effectively upgraded food waste-derived HTL biocrude oil into drop-in SAF. Through parameter screening and optimization, a neat SAF candidate was produced that met preliminary ASTM qualifications for jet fuel properties, possessing low nitrogen and sulfur levels, thereby advancing circularity of the aviation sector.

Hydrotreating parameter screening

The products yields, elemental composition, and parameter screening results are displayed in Fig. 1. It was seen that oil yield generally decreased with combinations of higher parameter levels (Fig. 1A). This was mainly due to polymerization reactions occurring during extended RTs that increased char formation, as well as increased hydrocracking and gasification reactions at high pressure and temperature. Greater amounts of aqueous and char products were seen at the low and medium temperatures, indicating that at higher severity, less polymerization and recondensation occurs over gasification. Lack of aqueous product at higher temperatures suggested decarboxylation and decarbonylation pathways over hydrodeoxygenation, yielding gaseous products rather than water. In general, higher de-O resulted in increased higher heating values (HHV) (Fig. 1A, B). 76–100% de-O was achieved, with up to 2.21 wt% remaining oxygen in the oil. Hydrotreated oil with remaining oxygen were treated at lower temperature and RT, indicating the importance of these parameters for de-O. Desulfurization (de-S) was effective at higher severities, with up to 94% sulfur removal and 20 ppm remaining. De-N was least efficient, ranging from 7 to 23% with 0.55–0.66 wt% nitrogen remaining in the hydrotreated oil.

Improved fuel quality and heteroatom removal were obtained at the expense of carbon and energy recovery (Cr and Er), especially due to carbon losses from gasification at severe hydrotreating conditions. The most significant parameters affecting de-O, Er, and Cr were determined using Taguchi delta values, the difference between the highest and lowest mean of response (Fig. 1C). For de-O, the most significant parameters were catalyst-to-oil ratio (cat:oil) > temperature (T) > hydrogen load-to-biocrude oxygen ratio (H:O) > retention time (RT), while for Cr and Er they were T > cat:oil > RT > H:O. Though H:O was more important for oxygen removal than carbon and energy recovery, the highest average de-Os were obtained at 15:1 H:O ratios. Therefore, T, cat:oil, and RT were selected as the parameters to undergo optimization for SAF production while the H:O ratio was held constant.

Improved boiling point distribution and hydrocarbon composition was also observed across changes in hydrotreating temperature and catalyst ratio. Temperature was the most significant factor affecting the boiling point distribution of the hydrotreated biocrude oil (Fig. S1A). At lower temperatures, light fractions <250 °C increased compared to PT biocrude oil, but the amount of mid-range fractions from 250 to 350 °C decreased while the amount of heavier fuel fractions >350 °C increased. Therefore, at mild hydrotreating conditions, polymerization and coking reactions may decrease the yield of viable distillates in the transportation fuel range. Notably, at the highest temperatures, the hydrotreated biocrude oil contained >99% distillate fractions <250 °C, with H9 exhibiting extremely similar boiling point distribution to Jet-A. At the mildest conditions (H1), the amount of n-alkanes significantly increased from 19.91% in the PT biocrude oil to 84.72% after hydrotreating, indicating de-O and hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and O-containing compounds such as fatty acids (Fig. S1B). With increased catalyst ratio (H2-3), alkenes were further hydrogenated, and small increases in aromatics and cycloalkanes were seen. At higher temperatures, isomerization and cracking reactions are favored, while n-alkanes can also undergo dehydrocyclization to form aromatics35,36. This caused the hydrocarbon distribution to further broaden and include more cycloalkanes, isoalkanes, and aromatics. At elevated temperature, higher oil yield and de-O also improved the Cr and Er of the hydrotreated HTL biocrude (Fig. S1C).

Hydrotreating parameter optimization and fuel properties

Average carbon number and hydrocarbon type are significant properties in predicting the properties of SAF37,38. Having an average carbon number closer to conventional jet fuel’s is desirable to stay within ASTM specification limits for SAF. Contour heat maps elucidated the effect of T, RT, and cat:oil on the average carbon number of hydrotreated biocrude oil (Fig. 2A–C and Table S5). It was seen that T had a greater effect than RT on average carbon number, with decreased carbon number correlated with increased hydrotreating T (Fig. 2A). The slight tilt of the contour lines toward the left also reflected decreased carbon number at longer RT, indicating breakdown of the carbon chains with limited repolymerization. Similar trends were seen for T and cat:oil, with decreased carbon number with increased T at all levels of cat:oil (Fig. 2B). Meanwhile, the change in carbon number across RT and cat:oil was less pronounced (Fig. 2C). A diagonal of slightly higher average carbon numbers was observed from high cat:oil and low RT to low cat:oil and high RT, showing that at mild combinations of cat:oil and RT, less cracking occurred. The diagonal pattern across the axis ranges was mainly attributed to the greater effect of T on average carbon number. For example, points on the contour line where average carbon number ~13, were those where different T (350 vs. 450 °C) were used at the same RT and cat:oil. Therefore, the change in T caused deviations in the average carbon number. Compared to T, RT, and cat:oil had less effect on carbon number. Overall, the average carbon number further decreased at combinations of higher T, RT, and cat:oil. Therefore, while a higher temperature was required to achieve an average carbon number closer to jet fuel, consideration should be taken in its combination with RT and cat:oil to avoid SAF products with carbon chains that are too light.

The modified Van Krevelen diagrams exhibit effective de-O and de-S during hydrotreating, but varying de-N (Fig. 2D–E). A majority of the SAF samples yielded complete oxygen and sulfur removal, with O/C and S/C molar ratios of 0. The H/C molar ratio of Jet-A and other conventional jet fuels depend on their specific composition. In this case, the obtained Jet-A sample was measured to have an H/C ratio of 1.93. Nearly all the hydrotreated HTL biocrude had H/C > 1.90 and some had H/C > 2.00, reflecting their comparable elemental composition to Jet-A, high HHV, and potential for improved combustion. A wide range of de-N was observed, indicating the importance of hydrotreating parameter tuning on nitrogen removal. Considering the cold-weld CHN method used, the variation may also be due to systematic (instrumental or measurement) errors. With a nitrogen detection limit of 0.1%, at least 87% de-N was achieved in a few cases. High de-N in a single hydrotreating step may be a result of the HTL biocrude pretreatment, where the removal of salt and ash prevents catalyst plugging and deactivation39. Furthermore, up to 40% oxygen, 55% sulfur, and 22% nitrogen could be removed during pretreatment, enabling additional stabilization of the biocrude prior to hydrotreating39. Notably, compared to a previous study that used CoMo and NiMo catalysts to hydrotreat HTL biocrude oil derived from food waste, improved de-O, de-S, and de-N was achieved in this work28. However, in comparison to reported hydrocarbon composition of approved SAFs from FT-, HEFA-, and ATJ-SPK, the H/C value from HTL still has room to improve16.

Comparing the hydrocarbon type, carbon number distribution, and boiling point distribution of HTL biocrude oil before and after hydrotreating, it was confirmed that hydrotreating at high temperature produced SAF samples with composition closest to Jet-A (Fig. 3). Hydrotreating successfully improved the hydrocarbon composition, indicated by an increase in the n-alkane content of all samples (Fig. 3A). Like the trend seen in the parameter screening tests, hydrotreating at combinations of higher temperature, RT, and catalyst load further improved the hydrocarbon type to contain increased amounts of aromatics, isoalkanes, and cycloalkanes. Notably, several of the SAF samples contained similar or higher amounts of isoalkanes and cycloalkanes compared to Jet-A, along with lower aromatic content. This could lead to improved cold flow properties and decreased contrails40. Notably, the Jet-A sample contained 35% aromatics and synthesized jet fuel must have 8-25% aromatics content. All samples hydrotreated at 450 °C (B2, B4, B6, B8) met the low level aromatics requirement of at least 8%, ranging from 9 to 13%. As seen in our SAF candidate, this value is also expected to increase after taking the jet cut from the whole hydrotreated biocrude due to the higher abundance of aromatics in the C8–C16 range. Recent work has also indicated that cycloalkanes can replace the volume swell properties of aromatics in jet fuel41.

HTL biocrude oil consistently became lighter after hydrotreating. This was reflected in the boiling point distribution, where hydrotreating increased the fraction of distillate ranges <250 °C (Fig. 3B). Like what was seen during the parameter screening, hydrotreating at the lowest parameter levels (e.g., B5) caused polymerization reactions that formed heavier compounds with boiling points above 350 °C. On the other hand, hydrotreating at higher temperatures and combinations of increased RT and cat:oil produced samples mainly composed of fractions with distillate ranges <250 °C. Specifically, all samples hydrotreated at the highest temperature level had a boiling point distribution most similar to Jet-A.

The carbon number range in Jet-A is typically C8–C16. This was confirmed in the commercial Jet-A sample tested, where 95% of its compounds were within the C8-C16 range and its average carbon number was 11.2 (Fig. 3C). Chemical compounds were also grouped into <C8, C17–C20, and >C20, to represent potential distillates in the ranges for gasoline, diesel, and heavy oils, respectively. All samples that had an average carbon number similar to or less than Jet-A (<11.5) were those produced at high temperature during hydrotreating (450 °C). However, since they still contained fractions outside the C8–C16 range, their average carbon number will likely change after distillation to obtain the SAF cut. Due to the importance of average carbon number on the chemical and handling properties of jet fuel, regression of the RSM data was used to predict the average carbon number and compare it to the experimental values (Fig. 3D). The predicted and experimental values were highly correlated, with an R2 of 0.97. A 95% confidence band and prediction band also demonstrated the ability of the model to predict new values within the experimental parameters.

SAF candidacy: Tier α tests for hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil

Based on the parameter screening and optimization, the HTL biocrude was hydrotreated to obtain a SAF candidate for Tier α prescreening of jet fuel properties that are critical for combustor operability limit. The SAF candidate achieved a carbon and energy recovery of 85.2 and 90.2%, respectively. Complete de-O and de-N was achieved, along with a final sulfur content of 10 ppm, meeting the 15 ppm maximum42. The physicochemical properties were further listed in Table S6. Compared to conventional jet fuel, the SAF candidate from this work contained higher amounts of light hydrocarbons, was within ASTM specification limits for critical bulk properties, and had a comparable distillation range predicted within specification limits (Fig. 4). The hydrocarbon compositions of both the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil and SAF cut were mainly n-alkanes, followed by cycloalkanes, aromatics, and isoalkanes (Fig. 4A, B). Compared to the average jet fuel carbon distribution, the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil contained high amounts of lighter (<C9) and heavier (>C13) hydrocarbons (Fig. 4A). The greater amount of heavy compounds in the whole hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil caused the average carbon number to be 12.7, slightly higher than jet fuel’s 11.4. However, after taking the SAF cut from C9 to C13, the average carbon number was more similar to jet fuel, decreasing to 10.7 (Fig. 4B). This SAF cut represented 31.5 wt% of the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil. Meanwhile, the light and heavy ends are also potential candidates for biobased gasoline and diesel.

It was observed that the surface tension (σ), density (ρ), kinematic viscosity (ν), lower heating value (LHV), flash point, derived cetane number, and freeze point were all within ASTM specification limits (Fig. 4C). Notably, the density and freeze point of the SAF candidate were near, but still, within ASTM specification limits, which was attributed to the high amount of heavy-end n-alkanes. At the same time, LHV was even higher than conventional jet fuel, likely due to the higher concentration of n-alkanes, which have high specific energy43. Although n-alkanes have high energy content and thermal stability, light n-alkanes (<nC7) can cause flash point violations and heavy n-alkanes (>nC14) can cause freeze point violations43. Since the SAF cut contained >50% n-alkanes, the fuel likely has a high smoke point, preventing soot formation and enabling cleaner combustion. However, there were few isoalkanes present in the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil and SAF cut. Lightly branched isoalkanes are desirable for jet fuel because they improve cold flow properties, specific energy, thermal stability, and freeze point43,44,45. Isoalkanes improve the pour point and cloud point of jet fuel, which are especially important for the operability and performance of jet fuel at high altitude and low temperature46,47. Meanwhile, the high content of cycloalkanes and aromatics (~44%) also help to improve performance and handling properties of the SAF. For instance, monocycloalkanes improve the density, freeze point, and specific energy of the fuel, while polycycloalkanes increase energy density, specific energy, and thermal stability43. Aromatics are needed to promote seal swelling in jet engines, but they have high particulate emissions and cause significant sooting during burning. Lastly, the predicted ASTM D86 distillation curve of the SAF candidate was similar to the conventional jet range (Fig. 4D). Although the light and heavy ends fell slightly below the jet range, it was still within ASTM specification limits. The final boiling point for the SAF cut was set lower than the typical range for conventional jet fuel to address concerns about the freezing point. To further mitigate the freezing point issue, an additional isomerization step could be implemented to convert linear alkanes into lightly branched alkanes. This adjustment would allow the final boiling point to be increased to the conventional jet fuel range, resulting in a higher SAF yield. This food waste-derived HTL-SAF candidate was predicted to meet key ASTM specifications without blending. However, it is noted that some parameters, such as density and freeze point, are close to the specification limits. Therefore, blending may be required if any variations in feedstock composition cause deviations in the resulting fuel properties. The mass, carbon, and energy yields for this SAF candidate (Table S7) provided implications for scale-up and future areas of direction. After HTL biocrude pretreatment, hydrotreating, and distillation to obtain the SAF cut, the final mass yield from food waste was 6.94 wt%. For instance, improved mass transfer during hydrotreating could increase the oil yield and decrease losses to char and gaseous products. As mentioned before, increased alkane branching can also help improve the hydrotreated biocrude’s final boiling point, resulting in a higher SAF yield. Therefore, continuous hydrotreating, reaction tuning, and catalyst development present potential areas of work to improve viability of the HTL-SAF route.

Circularity index

Sustainability analysis using a circularity index (CI) demonstrated improved circularity in the U.S. aviation industry when implementing a HTL-SAF pathway. CI is a single value, between 0 and 1, that measures the circularity of concern in terms of consumable, renewable, and recoverable resources48. In this case, the energy and carbon CI was determined for the entire existing U.S. aviation industry’s jet fuel consumption and potential for SAF production from disposed food waste. Average consumption and production data for petroleum products, food waste, and the HTL process was collected for eight value chain categories: extraction, refining, distribution, consumption, disposal, recovery, remake, and reuse (Tables S8 and S9). In the existing U.S. aviation industry, jet fuel is mainly derived from petroleum products, with very little SAF consumption. In the first half of 2024, an average of 1,657,000 barrels of jet fuel were consumed per day49. Meanwhile, just 15.8 million gallons of SAF were consumed in 202250. In 2019, it was estimated that 66.2 million wet tons of food waste was managed in the U.S., with 39.6 million tons going to landfills51.

After implementing the use of HTL and hydrotreating for food waste recoverable from landfills, the CIs improved significantly. Energy CI increased from 1.35 to 32.51% and carbon CI increased from 0.13% to 17.12%. Despite the improved circularity through producing SAF from food waste, it is apparent that food waste alone will only be part of the solution to provide feedstocks for SAF. Specifically, municipal solid waste and wet waste (including food waste) is just a fraction of the potential sustainable biomass supply for production of liquid transportation fuels. Other emerging biomass feedstocks, such as algae, energy crops, forestry, agricultural, vegetable oil, and starch supplies, also have potential for SAF production52. Additionally, HTL biocrude from food waste can produce other bioproducts besides SAF (such as gasoline, diesel, and biobinders), so the potential CI of the overall system could be much higher53. Thereby, while food waste alone can help increase energy and carbon CI of the aviation industry by nearly 20%, utilization of other biomass feedstocks for SAF production can fill the gap to create a fully circular bioeconomy in the aviation industry and beyond.

The pathway from food waste to SAF via HTL and hydrotreating is complicated, involving many factors and variations. To consider the uncertainty in CI under changes in pathway conditions, including amount of disposed and recoverable food waste, carbon and energy contents of food waste and SAF, and mass yields during hydrotreating and distillation, a Monte Carlo analysis with 1,000 simulations was conducted. A larger range of uncertainty was depicted for energy circularity, ranging from 28.26% to 48.73% compared to 14.05–26.93% for carbon circularity (Fig. 5A). For both CIs, higher circularity was observed at increased food waste recovery, which was reflected in its high Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Fig. 5B). In the U.S., 59.84% of food waste is managed by landfills, with the other ~40% managed by combustion, donation, sewer/wastewater treatment, composting, biochemical processing, animal feed, anaerobic digestion, and land application51. Therefore, the production of SAF and value of CI for the aviation industry could continue to increase if food waste management beyond landfills was targeted for recovery in HTL and biorefinery processes. The carbon and energy content of the food waste also had a relatively high correlation to their respective CIs, indicating the importance of the feedstock’s biochemical composition. Overall, increased recovery of food waste from other waste management practices would most greatly improve the circularity of this HTL-SAF pathway.

HTL is a promising pathway to produce SAF. Although HTL can valorize food waste into biocrude oil, hydrotreating is still required to remove disadvantageous heteroatoms. It was determined that temperature, catalyst:oil ratio, and RT were the most impactful parameters on hydrotreating for de-O, carbon recovery, and energy recovery. These parameters were optimized to achieve high de-O and de-N, producing a SAF sample that met ASTM specification limits for several fuel properties without blending. Future work may explore parametric tuning and catalyst development to promote isomerization during hydrotreating for improved cold flow properties and higher SAF yield. Furthermore, this pathway also demonstrated improved energy and carbon circularity in the U.S. aviation sector, which could be further increased by changing food waste management practices for higher food waste recovery. In all, it was shown that HTL of food waste is a potential pathway to produce drop-in SAF for a decarbonized aviation industry.

HTL biocrude oil

Food waste from a local food processing plant in Champaign, IL was processed in a pilot-scale continuous plug flow HTL reactor at 20 wt% solids content, 300 °C and 12.4 MPa for a 20 min RT23. Prior to hydrotreating, multi-stage pretreating was performed to desalt the biocrude using a water wash at 100 °C for 60 min; dewater according to ASTM D2892 Annex X1; and deash through isolation of fraction <350 °C via distillation39. The physicochemical characterization of the food processing waste feedstock, initial (BC), and pretreated (PT) HTL biocrude oil are in Table S2.

Hydrotreating experiments

Commercial catalyst CoMo/Al2O3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to hydrotreat HTL biocrude oil. First, experiments were completed in triplicate for a Taguchi design L9 orthogonal array (Table S3) to screen the significance of temperature, catalyst-to-oil ratio (cat:oil w/w), RT, and hydrogen load-to-biocrude oxygen ratio (H:O mol:mol). Then, experiments were completed in duplicate using a Box-Behnken design to optimize the parameter levels using response surface methodology (Table S4). Designated amounts of biocrude oil and catalyst were loaded into a 100 ml Series 4590 Micro Stirred Reactor (Parr Instrument Company, IL, USA). The reactor was purged to remove air, pressurized with hydrogen, then heated to desired reaction conditions with a stir rate of 350 rpm throughout the RT. After completion of the hydrotreating reaction, the reactor was quenched with water to cool. The oil and aqueous phases were collected in a pre-weighed container and separated by centrifugation. The catalyst and char products were collected separately, rinsed with DCM, and vacuum filtered. The gaseous phase was sampled in a gas bag (Sigma-Aldrich) for analysis. The reactor was rinsed with DCM to recover any residual oil, char, or catalyst. The DCM evaporated overnight at 60 °C and the final oil and char mass was recorded. The oil recovered from the solvent rinse was not analyzed. A commercial Jet-A sample was obtained from Willard Airport at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Savoy, IL, USA).

The mass yields, carbon recovery, and energy recovery were calculated according to Eqs. 1–3, respectively.

$${m}_{x}=\frac{{m}_{x}}{{m}_{b}}\times 100\%$$

(1)

$${C}_{r}=\frac{{C}_{o}}{{C}_{b}}\times {m}_{o}\times 100\%$$

(2)

$${E}_{r}=\frac{{{HHV}}_{o}}{{{HHV}}_{b}}\times {m}_{o}\times 100\%$$

(3)

where m = mass of product, x = product type (o = oil, w = water, g = gas, c = char, b = biocrude), C = carbon content (r = recovered), Er = energy recovery, and HHV = higher heating value. Oil and aqueous products were directly measured, while char was calculated by subtracting catalyst mass from the collected solids product, and gas was calculated by difference.

Heteroatom removal (de-X) was calculated based on the elemental composition of the HTL biocrude (Eq. 4):

$${de}-X=1-\frac{{X}_{{\mathrm{final}}}}{{X}_{{\mathrm{initial}}}}$$

(4)

where X = heteroatom element (ex. oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), or sulfur (S)), Xfinal = content in the upgraded biocrude, and Xinitial = content in the initial HTL biocrude.

Analytical methods

CE440 CHN analyzer (Exeter Analytical, Coventry, UK) was used to determine the elemental composition (carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen content). Triplicate measurements were taken from each sample, where tins were cold-weld shut prior to purging to minimize loss of volatiles. Due to the presence of air in the sample, nitrogen content was recalculated based on a blank. The detection limit was 0.10% for all elements. Oxygen was determined by difference. A PerkinElmer ICP-MS (Model NexION 350D) was used to measure sulfur content. Due to sample volume limitations, this was performed once per sample. Dulong’s formula54 (Eq. 5) was used to calculate the higher heating value (HHV).

$${HHV}\,\left({{\mathrm{MJ}}}/{\mathrm{kg}}\right)=0.3516\,{{C}}+1.16225\,{{H}}-0.1109\,{{O}}+0.0628\,{{N}}$$

(5)

The weight loss curves and boiling point distribution were determined with a Q50 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) (TA Instruments, DE, USA). 15 mg of sample was heated from 20 to 600 °C at 20 °C/min and nitrogen flow rate of 60 mL/min. The temperatures for boiling point ranges were selected based on literature55. It is important to note that thermal degradation may occur due to atmospheric conditions during TGA, making boiling points less accurate. The total acid number (TAN) was determined according to ASTM D974, in which oil sample dissolved in a solution of toluene, 2-propanol, and water was titrated with phenolphthalein indicator and 0.1 M KOH56. Chemical composition was determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using a Micromass 70-VSE (Waters Corporation, MA, USA). 2 μL sample injected split mode in a ZB-5MS column. 30–80 °C at 25 °C/min and 2 min hold, then increased to 220 °C at 8 °C/min, then to 280 °C at 25 °C/min. A 70 eV electron ionization voltage was used, scanning from 30 to 800 m/z. Peaks were analyzed using MassLynx Mass Spectrometry Software according to the NIST08 Mass Spectral Database57.

The jet fuel cut (150–230 °C) of hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil from this work was characterized using Tier α tests as a precursor to ASTM D4054 evaluation. Viability of the SAF candidate was prescreened by comparing its chemical composition, distillation, and fuel properties to conventional jet fuel and ASTM D7566 specifications. Specifically, a 2D-GC method developed by the Heyne group at Washington State University was used to determine the hydrocarbon type and distribution, a distillation curve was obtained from the 2D-GC data to show ASTM D86 results, and the 2D-GC results were used to predict jet fuel properties37,38,42.

The circularity index (CI, Eq. 6) of the system was calculated according to methods previously described48:

$${CI}=\frac{{Y}_{R}}{Y}=\frac{{\sum }_{{{\rm{i}}}=1}^{{{\rm{n}}}}{R}_{i}{X}_{i}+\left[{a}_{{ij}}\right]\left[{X}_{i}\right]}{{\sum }_{{{\rm{i}}}=1}^{{{\rm{n}}}}\left({C}_{i}+{R}_{i}\right){X}_{i}}$$

(6)

SAF is essentially lab-grown jet fuel, made from carbon already in the environment, rather than pumped up from oil wells.
It will account for just 0.7% of all jet fuel in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association.
In 2010, LanzaTech and the U.S. Department of Energy started collaborating on technology to transform ethanol into jet fuel.
“You’re not getting a ton of greenhouse gas savings relative to just using [traditional] jet fuel,” he says.","A first-of-its-kind refinery has been in the works for a decade and half. Set to be completed this year, the facility is design to produce climate-friendly jet fuel, a material in increasing demand in response to climate commitments and regulations around the world. The refinery—called the Freedom Pines Fuels—was designed to showcase new methods of producing the fuel, and was receiving government support to help clean up air travel.

Now, a year behind schedule due to a hurricane and equipment glitches, the project hit another roadblock this summer, when a major shift in U.S. energy policy under the new administration threw a wrench into the business model. It’s now a story of a company quickly adapting under pressure, and an illustration of the challenges—and continued opportunity—of clean energy in a more hostile political environment.

The goal of the company behind the project, Illinois-based LanzaJet, is to produce a close facsimile of the kerosene-based fuel that powers jets and many helicopters and propeller planes today—without using petroleum. Instead, the Freedom Pines Fuels plant in the forest hamlet of Soperton, Georgia, will use ethanol to make what’s known as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. LanzaJet was ready to start with ethanol made from Brazilian sugarcane, until a new U.S. law forced a quick shift to midwestern corn.

The fuels that make modern travel possible—kerosene, gasoline, and diesel—are typically refined from crude oil, rich in hydrocarbon molecules that release copious energy when burned. But burning them also inundates the atmosphere with heat-trapping carbon dioxide.

SAF is essentially lab-grown jet fuel, made from carbon already in the environment, rather than pumped up from oil wells. It’s a tweaked formulation—for instance, with less sulfur—designed to burn cleaner. Sugarcane and corn are two of many possible carbon sources, along with cornstalks, twigs, vegetable oil, factory exhaust, and even garbage. The CO2 released by making and burning SAF should, in theory, be offset by the carbon captured to make more SAF, forming a closed loop.

The Freedom Pines Fuels plant is a mini version of a typical refinery, slated to produce nine million gallons of SAF and a million of green diesel fuel in its first year. (A standard crude-oil refinery could churn a billion or more gallons of fuels.)

But the Georgia plant is meant to be big enough to show the technology can work at scale. “Most process technology companies . . . almost never build plants of this magnitude,” says Jimmy Samartzis, a climate-focused airline industry veteran who became CEO when LanzaJet was founded in 2020. “It’s expensive, it’s big. But we thought and felt—accurately, looking back on it today—it was the right move to make.” Before the 2024 election, the federal government was also promising generous financial support for Freedom Pines.

A Potential Market Boom

LanzaJet is backed by companies that are counting on, or stand to benefit from, the shift to carbon-neutral jet fuel, including All Nippon Airways, British Airways, Southwest Airlines, and plane maker Airbus.

The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has committed the industry to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In addition, laws and regulations, such as in Singapore, the U.K., and the European Union, have started requiring airlines or suppliers to blend SAF into the jet fuel supply, beginning at around 1–2%, then ramping up in later years. More such requirements are in the works in India, Indonesia, and Japan. The European Union is by far the most ambitious. From a mere 2% SAF blend required today, quotas rise steeply about every five years, hitting 70% in 2050.

There’s further demand from companies, such as LanzaJet backer Microsoft, striving to meet aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals. In addition to reducing its own footprint, Microsoft has announced plans to buy “SAF Certificates,” which subsidize the cost of the fuel to boost its usage. SAF has a long way to go in making a dent. It will account for just 0.7% of all jet fuel in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association.

“Obviously, if you look at the size of the overall aviation fuel space, in theory the [SAF] market is potentially huge for those that can offer a product at a competitive price,” says John MacDonagh, senior research analyst at capital markets research firm PitchBook.

LanzaJet has raised “approximately” $400 million, according to Samartzis, from these companies and other backers, including energy producers Shell and Suncor, the U.S. Department of Energy, airport operator Groupe ADP, and Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy fund.

Another backer is LanzaTech. Founded in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Skokie, Illinois, in 2014. The company has engineered microbes to convert waste such as carbon monoxide and dioxide from factories into ethanol, as another route to carbon-neutral fuel and other chemicals. In 2010, LanzaTech and the U.S. Department of Energy started collaborating on technology to transform ethanol into jet fuel. In 2020, LanzaTech spun out LanzaJet as a new company to continue the work.

LanzaJet is dipping a toe into the SAF market with Freedom Pines, with plans to build more plants, such as a collaboration with British Airways to open a facility in the U.K. by 2028. LanzaJet has also announced partnerships in India, Japan, and Kazakhstan to build additional facilities. But as it continues to announce expansion overseas, things have gotten messy back at home.

SAF Meets MAGA

The U.S. has no SAF requirements for aviation companies. Instead, the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act introduced tax credits to subsidize fledgling SAF operations to scale up production and bring down prices. (Various estimates put SAF from two to five times as expensive as traditional jet fuel.) While the Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act didn’t scrap SAF incentives completely, as it did for many other clean technologies, it did complicate LanzaJet’s plans just as it was completing the Freedom Pines plant.

LanzaJet had obtained EPA approval to use traditional ethanol to make its fuel. The company was focused on Brazilian sugarcane, which Samartzis says would cut CO2 emissions by more than the 50% threshold to qualify for credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. The new Republican legislation cut maximum subsidies from $1.75 to $1 per gallon—and limited them to fuels made with resources from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

So LanzaJet has shifted focus to ethanol made from U.S. corn, which is more carbon intensive, for a number of reasons, says Samartzis. Sugarcane tends to have higher yields per acre, with less fertilizer, according to LanzJet, and of course it provides sugar that can be fermented directly into ethanol. Corn provides starch that first has to be converted to sugar, which takes energy. Brazilian ethanol producers also make use of crop leftovers, burning them to provide energy for their operations. U.S. producers often use natural gas or even coal.

Given all that, using corn won’t cut overall greenhouse gas emissions anywhere near the 50% target, without longer-term changes such as more sustainable farming practices and capturing the carbon released in making the ethanol, he says.

Despite all these challenges, Samartzis says that Freedom Pines will start churning out fuel soon. “Yeah, I’ve faltered in the past, right?”, he says with a chuckle. “But my expectation is that it’s certainly this year . . . How soon? I don’t want to speculate on that at this point.”

Meanwhile, LanzaJet has to compete with an established technology, called HEFA, that is already making jet fuel from fats such as used cooking oil. “Most [SAF demand] right now can be met, or all of it initially can be met, with the HEFA fuels that are less costly to produce,” says Andy Navarrete, coauthor of a recent study on sustainable aviation fuel by the International Council on Clean Transportation.

A New Starting Point

However, HEFA can’t scale up for the boom in demand coming in the next decades, he says, without turning to environmentally destructive options like clearing land for palm oil plantations. Navarrete is also circumspect about corn ethanol. “You’re not getting a ton of greenhouse gas savings relative to just using [traditional] jet fuel,” he says.

“And then there’s this bigger question of food versus fuel. And how sustainable is it, in general, to be using farmland to produce a fuel?”

Samartzis cites USDA estimates of U.S. ethanol supplies exceeding domestic demand and frames SAF as a new market for American farmers. But beyond corn and sugarcane, there can be bigger climate benefits in making ethanol from the cellulose in agricultural leftovers—like corn stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs—that might otherwise release CO2 when they rot.

This approach was always part of LanzaJet’s strategy, and it had already submitted its plan to the EPA for approval. (The U.K. plant is meant to begin operations with this “cellulosic” ethanol when it opens in 2028.) But U.S. politics are creating another roadblock. “All of these things take time, and with the government shutdown on top of it, rest assured, those processes are not moving forward right now,” says Samartzis.

Navarrete is skeptical, noting that makers of green auto fuels also foresaw a progression to using cellulose from agricultural waste. “It relied on a completely different set of technologies . . . that never quite got figured out,” he says. “[Starting with] conventional ethanol wasn’t really a useful bridge forward.”

Technology has progressed since then, with new incentives to fill the growing SAF market. Samartzis remains optimistic about a transition for the longer term. “Maybe it’s a 10 or 20% improvement rather than a 50 or 60 or 70% improvement,” he says of initial CO2 reductions using corn ethanol. “We can start to capture the improvement and then continue to invest in the changes that are required to further improve that carbon [reduction] intensity.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/10/p-1-91427868-headline-green-jet-fuel-maker-lanzajet-reroutes-for-the-trump-era.jpg",N,,2025-10-30 06:00:57.187689

SAFCo will help Singapore meet its goal for sustainable fuel to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030, CAAS said in a statement.

Director-general of CAAS Han Kok Juan, who will chair SAFCo, told journalists at a media conference that the company will bring together stakeholders such as airlines, fuel producers and carbon market platforms to “get them organised”, which could indirectly lower fuel costs.

“If we have an aggregated and a more efficient way of procuring sustainable aviation fuel, we are able to send a stronger demand signal to producers,” he said.

“That would hopefully stimulate investments and production, and therefore have a dampening effect on prices.”

Last year, CAAS estimated that sustainable aviation fuel costs around three to five times more than conventional jet fuel.

Former global head of marketing and sustainability at Shell Low Carbon Solutions, Ms Tan Seow Hui, has been appointed SAFCo’s chief executive officer.

Responding to a question about how SAFCo’s approach differs from current procurement practices, she said the company allows for purchasing at a greater scale.

“(SAFCo) will give us a certain scale in terms of the ability to anchor longer term and bigger contracts, give us the ability to negotiate for more competitive prices versus any individual airline or companies are able to do so,” she said.

PROCUREMENT AND FUNDING MODEL

Mr Han said procurement, targeted to begin in 2026, will be carried out through a “transparent, competitive tender process” involving suppliers that meet international sustainability standards.

SAFCo has begun engaging businesses and airlines interested in the procurement mechanism, with discussions ongoing.

In its first year, the company plans to hire about 10 staff members, with headcount to be “gauged and sized accordingly thereafter”. It is also in the process of looking for office premises. Initial startup costs will be fully funded by CAAS.

The establishment of SAFCo follows the recent passage of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, which empowers CAAS to collect a sustainable aviation fuel levy and appoint a central procurement entity.

TARGET NOT A MANDATE

Mr Han emphasised that the 1 per cent target is not a mandate, and that the actual proportion could be higher or lower depending on market prices.

He said SAFCo will adopt a “fixed cost envelope approach”, meaning it will spend a predetermined amount on sustainable aviation fuel regardless of prevailing prices.

“If tomorrow, the price of coffee increases, I will still spend S$2. What it means is that I don’t drink a full cup, I drink a bit less than a full cup.”

Similarly, while the target is 1 per cent, the actual proportion will depend on sustainable aviation fuel prices at the time of procurement.

“This is very different from a system where ‘I want to buy a cup of coffee regardless of what the price of coffee is’,” Mr Han said, adding that the approach is designed to manage volatility.

“The market is still very nascent, the price is volatile … we want to be able to cap our exposure for the entire aviation ecosystem.”","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--H8i01_Ql--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/10/30/llt_7947_2.jpg?itok=8MNBFRaX",N,,2025-10-30 05:00:51.858456

The non-profit company will be wholly owned by CAAS, with Tan Seow Hui – who previously worked on low-carbon solutions at Shell – as chief executive. CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan will be on its board.

The central procurement of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by SAFCo will give airlines operating to and from Singapore the ability to negotiate as an aggregate, instead of as individual companies, said CAAS. This will help the company secure a more stable quantity and price amid “relatively volatile” prices.

SAFCo will supply the fuel to Changi and Seletar airports and will “support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy”, CAAS said on Thursday (Oct 30).

Such central procurement is novel in aviation, and CAAS said it has shared the concept with the International Civil Aviation Organization.

SAFCo’s initial costs will be fully funded by CAAS and its office premises are currently being identified.

CAAS pointed out that its “fixed cost envelope” approach means that only funds collected by the mandatory levy on sustainable aviation fuel will be used to procure the fuel. Therefore, the quantity of fuel purchased can vary depending on the price at the time of purchase.

The sustainable aviation fuel levy must be paid to CAAS for all outbound passenger and cargo flights per passenger based on distance. In 2024, CAAS gave some examples: A direct economy-class flight from Singapore would be S$3 to Bangkok, S$6 to Tokyo and S$16 to London. The fees will be higher for more premium seat classes.

CAAS will collect the levy from air transport users, including airlines, business and general aviation users, before disbursing the monies to SAFCo.

The company will then aggregate the mandatory and voluntary demand, based on a sustainable aviation fuel registry, through a “transparent” and “competitive” tender process involving both local and foreign suppliers. The fuel will then be delivered to customers at Changi and Seletar airports.

“With predictable cash flows from the SAF levy, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still-nascent SAF market,” said CAAS.

With the aim to build an integrated demand market for such fuel, CAAS said SAFCo will be reaching out to airlines and businesses to encourage partnerships with the company. More details are expected at the Singapore Airshow in February 2026.

Han said: “Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF levy collected and activate a SAF ecosystem which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

He said there was “very, very strong interest” from airlines and businesses around voluntary sustainable aviation fuel purchases, but declined to comment on individual names.

Singapore aims to have sustainable fuel comprise 1 per cent of all the fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026. The target will rise to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Sustainable aviation fuel is created from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops. This is unlike conventional aviation fuel, which is made from fossil fuels.

CAAS said SAFCo’s immediate focus will be on establishing robust governance and procurement frameworks, as well as setting up levy collection systems and process to build manpower and procurement capability.

The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) will use a levy collected from passengers to buy the green jet fuel, which will be blended with traditional aviation fuel and used to refuel planes at Changi and Seletar airports.

This comes about two weeks after

Parliament passed a Bill

allowing Singapore to collect a fixed levy on all departing flights to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel by airlines.

The target is for such fuel to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, with the goal raised to 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030. Sustainable aviation fuel is mostly made from waste materials, such as used cooking oil.

Travellers flying out of Singapore will pay a sustainable aviation fuel levy from 2026, which SAFCo will use to buy the fuel needed to meet the target.

CAAS wholly owns SAFCo, with the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan chairing SAFCo’s board.

Ms Tan Seow Hui, a veteran in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed chief executive of SAFCo.

Early CAAS estimates suggested that economy-class passengers may incur a $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights. Short-haul flights include routes to places such as Bangkok, medium haul to destinations like Tokyo, and long haul to cities such as London.

More details about the levy, including the confirmed amounts, will be announced by end-2025, CAAS said.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry, as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without costly modifications.

At a press conference on Oct 30, Mr Han and Ms Tan said SAFCo will centrally procure the fuel based on the levy collected. The money will be collected into a central pool, which SAFCo will use to buy the fuel.

Ms Tan said SAFCo’s immediate priorities are to establish strong governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy collection systems and processes and build its team and procurement capability.

It will have a team of 10 in its first year.

The company will also engage parties such as airlines and cargo operators ahead of the first procurement round in 2026, she said.

Beyond using the levy to buy the fuel, the company will also pool voluntary demand from organisations that seek to purchase sustainable jet fuel to reduce their corporate air travel or supply chain carbon footprint, Mr Han added.

Aggregating demand for the fuel and centralising procurement will help the company to secure longer-term contracts and allow it to negotiate more competitive prices, compared with individual buyers, Ms Tan noted.

The cost of sustainable aviation fuel is among the major barriers that have limited its widespread adoption. Green jet fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel.

This manner of procurement will send a stronger demand signal to producers of sustainable jet fuel, Mr Han said. “That will, hopefully, stimulate sustainable aviation fuel investments and production, and… have a dampening effect on prices.”

He said the procurement of sustainable aviation fuel would be done through a transparent, competitive tender process that meets international sustainability standards.

Green jet fuel prices are relatively volatile because of supply and demand conditions, which is why Singapore has adopted a fixed levy approach, Mr Han said. A fixed levy amount will allow SAFCo to estimate how much sustainable aviation fuel it can afford to buy, given fluctuating prices.

This method will allow “certainty and stability, and we actually cap the cost of sustainable aviation fuel adoption for the entire aviation ecosystem”, Mr Han noted.

SAFCo will “help to encourage sustainable aviation fuel production through clear demand signals, while ensuring that costs remain contained, predictable and fairly shared,” he added.

“(This will) allow us to meet our environmental responsibilities, while safeguarding the competitiveness of our air hub.”

CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng had said earlier in October that if market conditions are not ideal, the

1 per cent target in 2026 may not be met

, which the authorities are prepared for.

“Our approach is one where we pay what we can afford. We are not planning to be sustainable at all cost because the sustainable aviation fuel market is still very small. The price fluctuations are quite dramatic sometimes,” he noted.

Under Singapore’s sustainable air hub blueprint, launched in February 2024, Singapore will work with the aviation industry to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20 per cent from 2019 levels in 2030 and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/504ab20a411f6b33148f76654cc43b2a9dccb82402c5be32d04ec08585288bb6,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:04.386891

The fund was established in 2020 as part of Microsoft's wider sustainability initiative to become a carbon-negative, water-positive and zero-waste company by 2030.

The US$1 billion CIF was created to accelerate the development and use of new climate technologies through both equity and debt capital.

In its five-year progress report, Microsoft stated its core belief that its business thrives when the world thrives.

When launching the fund, Microsoft had to support innovations that were not yet fully developed.

Melanie Nakagawa, Microsoft Chief Sustainability Officer, explained the necessity of this approach, saying: “Big goals need bold bets. When we launched Microsoft’s US$1bn Climate Innovation Fund in 2020, we knew the road to reaching our ambitious sustainability goals would need to be paved in part with new and innovative solutions. We needed to invest in technologies that weren't yet at commercial scale or in some cases didn’t yet exist.”

Catalytic capital and market growth

The initial hope was that these early-stage investments would generate wider interest and build momentum for scaling necessary climate solutions. According to Melanie, this is now becoming a reality.

“We’ve allocated more than US$800 million to date across 67 portfolio investors. On average, every dollar we’ve invested has attracted 15 more catalysing billions in follow-on funding. This kind of multiplier effect is helping move markets and scale innovation,” she says.

Melanie adds: “From carbon removal and recycling innovation to low-carbon building materials and sustainable aviation fuel, we’re helping turn bold ideas into tangible solutions.”

The report identifies five key conclusions that guide its ongoing strategy. These include pushing the frontiers of technology, bridging the gap to mainstream capital, delivering catalytic impact and partnering to amplify its efforts.

One example of the fund's impact is its investment in Twelve, a company using electrochemical technology to convert captured CO2 and water into synthetic fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

CIF’s investment supported the expansion of Twelve's facility in Moses Lake, Washington and resulted in a SAF offtake agreement for Microsoft.

This partnership with Alaska Airlines introduced a book-and-claim model for SAF procurement, enabling Microsoft to report lower emissions from its business travel without needing direct physical delivery of the fuel.

Following this initial support, Twelve secured an additional US$645 million in follow-on funding.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/6083205b43c0a133519ed8887b4ac715:c6d45ffc2ca0875e041aff32fc28a185/melanie-nakagawa-cso-at-microsoft-speaking-at-websummit-2023.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:09.014977

Even if all current, under-development, and announced projects operate at full capacity, AJF production would cover only about 5% of global jet fuel demand and less than half of the projected growth in total consumption.

The analysis highlights that high costs, limited sustainable feedstocks, and weak bankability will constrain AJF’s impact in the coming decade.

Seven Barriers to Scaling AJF

Carbon Tracker identifies seven structural hurdles limiting the scale-up of AJF. The first four apply to all types of alternative jet fuels, while the last three specifically affect truly sustainable options:

Costs and price premiums – AJF is more expensive than fossil jet fuel, reducing demand and slowing adoption.

Regulatory uncertainty – Fragmented rules across jurisdictions hinder market growth.

Lack of long-term offtake commitments – Limited long-term agreements reduce revenue visibility for producers.

Weak bankability – Technology, feedstock, and policy risks make financing new AJF projects difficult.

Feedstock availability – Sustainable wastes and residues are scarce and challenging to collect.

Feedstock sustainability – Lifecycle emissions, land-use impacts, and biodiversity concerns restrict eligible supply.

Opportunity costs – Scarce sustainable feedstocks might achieve greater emission reductions in other sectors where mitigation is faster or cheaper.

Saidrasul Ashrafkhanov, Carbon Tracker analyst and lead report author, said:

“Beyond high costs, hesitant offtakers, and financing barriers, many alternative jet fuels also carry environmental downsides. While AJF could play a larger role in decarbonising aviation in the future, the industry must demonstrate a pathway to fuels that are truly sustainable, abundant, and feasible.”

The Need for Policy Coherence

Despite numerous support schemes, investors and environmental outcomes are not seeing clear results. Rich Collett-White, Carbon Tracker energy analyst and co-author, explained:

“A confusing mix of policies aimed at scaling alternative jet fuels, with differing definitions and eligibility rules across regions, is creating uncertainty. Consistent regulations are essential to prioritise fuels with strong environmental integrity and avoid unintended consequences.”

Short-Haul Offers Faster Gains

Significant emission reductions may be achievable sooner on short-haul routes. Nearly half of all flights cover less than 270 nautical miles (500 km). Battery-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft carrying 5–100 passengers are nearing entry into service, offering a direct route to zero-emission operations on regional legs. Hydrogen-electric aircraft could extend medium-haul operations from the mid-2030s.

This presents a clearer near-term investment opportunity while preserving scarce sustainable AJF for long-haul flights. However, funding for new-propulsion aircraft remains low compared with AJF investments.

Right-Sizing AJF’s Role

AJF will remain important for long-haul decarbonisation, where batteries cannot match the range or payload of conventional aircraft, but its role is smaller than often assumed. Carbon Tracker recommends a pragmatic, portfolio-based approach:

Manage AJF expectations – Focus on pathways with strong sustainability credentials and predictable costs, avoiding options with poor lifecycle performance or food-security risks.

Support zero-emission short-haul – Invest in battery-electric, hydrogen-electric, and hybrid-electric aircraft for sub-500 km routes, where readiness is advancing fastest.

Design smarter policy and finance – Strengthen sustainability criteria, implement revenue-certainty mechanisms, and reward genuine emissions reductions.

Bottom Line

AJF is part of the solution but not the silver bullet. Treating it as the main avenue for emission reductions risks misallocating capital and consuming finite feedstocks without significantly reducing fossil jet fuel use this decade. A balanced strategy—accelerating zero-emission aircraft on short-haul routes, conserving sustainable AJF for long-haul, and aligning policy with climate goals—offers a faster, more cost-effective, and credible path to decarbonising aviation.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:15.625583

This follows the launch of Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), a government-owned non-profit company that will oversee the acquisition and distribution of SAF, as well as implementation of the country’s SAF policies.

To fund the procurement of SAF, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will also be implementing a SAF levy on all departing travellers from 2026. The levy, first announced in 2024, will also cover cargo flights, as well as business and general aviation passengers.

CAAS says details of the levy – including its quantum and roll-out date – will be announced later. It is expected the levy will be rolled out first before SAFCo begins procuring SAF.

The agency gave examples in 2024 on how much the levy could cost: an economy-class passenger flying to Bangkok could pay S$3 ($2.31), while those flying to London could pay S$16.

The funds collected will be managed by CAAS, then disbursed to SAFCo, which will source the SAF “through a transparent competitive tender process…that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA”.

CAAS director general Han Kok Juan, who speaking at a briefing on 30 October, says the “centralised pool” of funds means there is “predictable cash flow”, which allows SAFCo to “go into longer-term competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and more affordable SAF supply”.

On top of the mandatory levy, SAFCo will also roll out a scalable voluntary demand programme” for SAF and SAF Environmental Attributes. These will involve businesses and airlines looking to voluntarily purchase SAF, and CAAS confirms it is already in talks with a few businesses on the voluntary programme.

CAAS’ Han says Singapore supports SAF adoption through a “pragmatic and balanced approach calibrated to our own circumstances”.

For instance, the procurement of SAF will be done with a fixed-cost envelopment model, where the SAF levy – and the central funds – will be a fixed rate regardless of the price of SAF.

Adds Han: “It helps to encourage self-production, to send clear demand signals while ensuring that costs remain contained, predictable and fairly shared.

Artificial intelligence (AI) Automation and digital aviation will also play a crucial role in modern airports and the future of aviation.","The aviation sector is a driving force in the current globalised society. Every day, airports see hundreds of flights, and the European airspace is busier than ever. According to aviation professionals and stakeholders, the industry must innovate quickly, not only in its sustainable practices but also in terms of digitising airport processes and streamlining the passenger experience.

Tourism growth

“The summer of 2025 saw an average of 35,000 flights per day across the European network, which is one per cent higher than the pre-pandemic levels of 2019,” highlighted Tânia Cardoso Simões, Director Aviation Transformation at EUROCONTROL, during the Global Tourism Forum (GTF) that took place in Brussels last 20-21 October.

Simões noted that, according to EUROCONTROL’’s latest report, the European airspace is expected to handle around 11 million flights by the end of 2025. The figure is projected to rise further in 2026, reaching approximately 11.4 million flights. By 2031, Eurocontrol anticipates around 12.4 million flights across the continent.

Moreover, according to Eurostat, overnight stays in EU tourist accommodation reached 1,279 million in the first half of 2025, marking a 2.3 per cent rise from the 1,249 million recorded during the same period in 2024. Foreign visitors accounted for almost half of the overnight stays, with Malta, Cyprus, and Croatia recording the highest overnight stays.

Airport infrastructure and hospitality

To handle the growing number of passengers and tourists and the pressure on aviation staff, the industry needs transformative changes. One way to do this, according to Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports, is to “merge check-in, immigration, and security into one seamless process.” This would not only improve airport capacity, said Griffiths, but also improve passenger purchasing. “If you have gone through the check-in a few minutes, then you are going to be far more predisposed to spend money,” Griffiths noted with humour. Such a move would help airports achieve better financial sustainability.

Besides airport infrastructure, hospitality also has to improve in order to provide travellers with a better customer experience. Regardless of the technological advancements of the 21st century, human interaction and experience are what make a difference for regular flyers. “If people are trained properly, we can be a genuine hospitality experience,” remarked Griffiths. “We need to communicate with travellers on an individual basis and to make absolutely sure we are reassuring them.”

Sustainability Aviation Fuel

With thousands of daily flights, cutting emissions is one of aviation’s top priorities, making the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), is a fuel used in commercial aviation that reduces carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent. It can be produced from various sources such as waste oil and fats, green and municipal waste, and non-food crops.

Both Griffiths and Simões agree that this is something that should change in the current aviation operations. “We have to incentivise production. Our idea is by 2032 to have sustainable fuel to represent a significant share of aviation’s fuel,” Griffiths explained.

To support SAF development and deployment, in July 2025, the aviation industry, represented by DESTINATION 2050 partners, fuel suppliers, and cargo and express delivery operators released a call for accelerated policy that would help de-risk investment, bridge the cost gap between conventional and sustainable fuel, and create the regulatory and financial conditions needed to scale up the production and deployment of SAF.

Simões not only highlighted the importance of SAF but also added other important components of sustainable flights. She noted that hydrogen combustion and electric batteries can also be utilised for standardising more sustainable aviation operations. Hydrogen combustion in this context works like jet fuel – it is burned to generate thrust.

Hydrogen-powered airplane would emit only water vapour instead of carbon dioxide, but storing hydrogen requires cryogenic tanks capable of maintaining temperatures as low as –253 °C, since hydrogen must remain in a liquid state at such extremes. The tanks require significant space, which would mean the aircraft would have to be redesigned.

Despite these difficulties, Airbus has made publicly available its designs for an electric, hydrogen-powered airplane. Airbus initially indicated that the aircraft was scheduled for its first flight in 2035, but according to new data, this won’t happen until later in the decade.

In the future, airports also need to become greener and energy self-sufficient. Soon, Griffiths pointed out, “every single surface of Dubai Airports will be covered with solar panels.” In this way, airports would be able to produce the necessary energy they need to operate independently.

Artificial intelligence (AI)

Automation and digital aviation will also play a crucial role in modern airports and the future of aviation. Currently, in the United Arab Emirates, AI is used when an aircraft arrives at an airport gate, according to Frederico Fernandes, CEO of WIZE. Fernandes explained that the technology monitors the different teams working around the plane – refuelling, baggage, maintenance, security, and boarding. He also added that AI identifies what is happening and helps the operations centre manage everything in real time.

Moreover, AI has also been deployed for luggage monitoring, which decreased the number of mishandled luggage in 2024. Another use of the model was piloted in the UK, where London Heathrow Airport tested an AI air traffic system. This aims to support air traffic controllers, while they remain “at the heart of the operation.”

While AI could be used to optimise many processes in the industry, many are still worried about AI taking over human operations. “One of the most important questions I get is whether AI is going to be a pilot. And the answer is simple: absolutely not,” he highlighted.

He explained that rather than replacing pilots, AI can complement them. According to Fernandes, his company is the first in the world to offer students pilot training through an AI-based platform. But he explained that he is also aware that people cannot let a “delusional” AI make decisions.

What might the sky of tomorrow look like?

“The future seems bright”, for Tânia Cardoso Simões, from EUROCONTROL. She envisions a “sky where aircraft fly silently, operating with clean energy, as well as airports that generate more power than they consume and flights that waste neither fuel nor time.”",https://traveltomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/global-tourism-forum_.jpg#159865,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:26.061660

The fuel supplier began deliveries to Houston in July and will continue until the end of October 2025. Deliveries to Newark and Dulles started in September and are scheduled to run until the end of 2025.

Policy incentives remain crucial

The deployment relies on existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste's SAF terminal facilities in Houston, where neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is blended with conventional jet fuel to meet aviation specifications.

Aviation accounts for a relatively small share of global emissions but is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise, with technological innovation needed across production of low-emission fuels, improvements in aircraft and engines and operational optimisation.

Lauren has acknowledged that her sector is dependence on government support when it comes to decarbonisation.

""While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments,"" she explains.

""This didn't happen easily or overnight. It took relentless coordination, innovation, and a team that refused to settle for 'good enough.' But we did it — because meaningful change demands action.""

The Growing Need for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Waste to Energy Solutions

The aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Sustainable aviation fuel represents a critical pathway toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from fossil fuels, SAF production utilizes renewable resources to create cleaner alternatives.

The concept of waste to energy has gained significant traction across industries. Agricultural operations, particularly dairy farms, generate enormous amounts of organic waste that traditionally poses disposal challenges. However, this waste contains valuable energy potential in the form of biogas.

Dairy farm biogas emerges from the natural decomposition of manure in waste lagoons. This biogas consists primarily of methane and carbon dioxide—components that can be captured and converted into useful energy products. The challenge has always been developing cost-effective technology to harness this potential.

Traditional SAF production methods often require extensive infrastructure investments and complex supply chains. These barriers have limited widespread adoption, particularly among smaller agricultural operations. The need for innovative technologies that can operate at the farm level has become increasingly apparent.

Renewable fuel production from agricultural waste represents a perfect example of Circular Economy principles. Instead of viewing manure as a waste product requiring disposal, this approach transforms it into a valuable commodity that supports both environmental goals and economic development.

Revolutionary Ouro Reactor Technology for Electric Reforming

Circularity Fuels’ Ouro reactor represents a technological breakthrough in biogas to jet fuel conversion. This compact, electric-powered system can convert raw biogas directly into synthesis gas without requiring combustion or expensive pre-treatment processes.

The Ouro reactor addresses key limitations of conventional reforming systems. Traditional methods require extensive purification of biogas before conversion, adding significant costs and complexity. The electric reforming system operates differently by processing unrefined biogas directly from farm waste lagoons.

This innovative approach eliminates the need for pipeline infrastructure. Farmers can produce synthesis gas on-site and transport it via existing trucking networks. This flexibility removes a major barrier that has prevented many agricultural operations from participating in renewable fuel production.

The Ouro reactor is the first system to electrically convert raw biogas from farm waste lagoons into jet fuel components without combustion, eliminating pre-treatment requirements. This technological advancement enables stable operation despite contaminants that would damage conventional reformers.

The economic impact is substantial. The technology achieves a 100x cost reduction compared to conventional synthesis gas production systems. This dramatic cost improvement makes waste to energy conversion financially viable for farms of various sizes.

Dr. Stephen Beaton, CEO and Founder of Circularity Fuels, explains the significance: “Farmers in the US and around the world are sitting on an untapped gold mine. We are enabling them to turn waste into a profitable product that airlines desperately need. For the first time, farmers will become producers of renewable fuels without waiting for pipeline infrastructure that will never come.”

The reactor’s design facilitates seamless conversion from dairy waste to synthesis gas production. Its plug-and-play functionality allows immediate deployment on farms with standard electrical connections, making adoption straightforward for agricultural operations.

The Complete Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Process from Dairy Farm Biogas

The conversion of dairy farm biogas to jet fuel follows a carefully orchestrated process. It begins with capturing raw biogas from waste lagoons at dairy farms. Currently, less than 6% of available manure waste is captured, highlighting the enormous untapped potential in this market.

The electric reforming system plays a crucial role in this conversion chain. Unlike traditional reformers that require purified biogas, the Ouro reactor processes unrefined biogas directly. This raw biogas contains methane and carbon dioxide from decomposing manure, along with various contaminants that would normally require expensive removal.

Synthesis gas, also known as syngas, serves as the critical intermediate product. This mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen provides the foundation for producing liquid hydrocarbons. The quality and composition of synthesis gas directly impact the efficiency of subsequent fuel production steps.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis represents the final conversion stage. This catalytic chemical reaction transforms synthesis gas into liquid hydrocarbons suitable for aviation fuel. The process has been used commercially for decades, providing a proven pathway from biogas to jet fuel.

The entire process from biogas to jet fuel embodies Circular Economy principles. Agricultural waste that previously created disposal challenges becomes a valuable feedstock for renewable fuel production. This transformation creates economic value while reducing environmental impact.

SAF production through this method offers several advantages over conventional approaches. The distributed nature of production reduces transportation costs and infrastructure requirements. Farmers gain new revenue streams while contributing to sustainable aviation fuel supply chains.

The scalability of this approach depends on biogas availability and processing capacity. With over 20,000 large livestock farms in the United States producing nearly 500 million tons of manure annually, the potential supply of raw materials is substantial.

Quality control throughout the conversion process ensures the final product meets aviation fuel specifications. The synthesis gas produced by the Ouro reactor maintains consistent composition, supporting reliable Fischer-Tropsch synthesis outcomes.

Economic and Environmental Benefits of On-Farm SAF Production

The economic advantages of on-farm sustainable aviation fuel production are compelling. The 100x cost reduction achieved by the Ouro reactor compared to conventional synthesis gas production methods dramatically improves project economics. This cost reduction stems from eliminating expensive pre-treatment requirements and simplifying the overall process.

Infrastructure cost savings represent another significant economic benefit. Traditional biogas projects often require extensive pipeline networks to transport gas from farms to processing facilities. The Ouro reactor eliminates this requirement by enabling on-site production and transportation via existing trucking networks.

Farmers gain new revenue streams from waste products that previously represented disposal costs. This transformation from cost center to profit center can significantly impact farm economics. The reliability of aviation fuel demand provides predictable income streams that support long-term planning.

Environmental benefits extend beyond carbon emission reductions. Converting manure waste into renewable fuel prevents methane emissions that would otherwise occur during natural decomposition. Methane is approximately 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, making this conversion particularly valuable.

The technology supports Circular Economy principles by creating closed-loop systems where waste becomes input for valuable products. This approach reduces dependency on fossil fuels while creating sustainable economic models for agricultural operations.

The environmental impact extends to soil and water quality improvements. Proper management of manure through biogas production reduces runoff risks and odor issues associated with traditional lagoon systems. This improvement enhances community relations and environmental stewardship.

Market potential remains largely untapped. With biogas currently captured from less than 6% of available manure waste, significant growth opportunities exist. The combination of environmental benefits and economic incentives creates favorable conditions for widespread adoption.

Sustainable farming practices benefit from this integrated approach. Farmers can demonstrate environmental leadership while improving their economic position. This alignment of environmental and economic goals supports long-term sustainability in agricultural operations.

The broader impact on renewable fuel markets could be substantial. Distributed production from thousands of farms could contribute significantly to sustainable aviation fuel supply, reducing dependency on centralized production facilities and fossil fuel sources.

The Future of Renewable Fuel Production and Industry Impact

Technologies like the Ouro reactor have the potential to reshape the renewable energy landscape fundamentally. By creating decentralized, on-farm fuel production ecosystems, this approach democratizes renewable fuel production and reduces dependency on large-scale industrial facilities.

The aviation industry faces increasing pressure to meet sustainability targets. Sustainable aviation fuel demand is projected to grow exponentially as airlines commit to net-zero emissions goals. Technologies that enable distributed production from agricultural waste could play a crucial role in meeting this demand.

The scalability of cow manure jet fuel production depends on technology adoption rates and infrastructure development. As more farms implement biogas to jet fuel systems, the cumulative impact on renewable fuel supply could be significant. This distributed approach offers resilience benefits compared to centralized production models.

Innovation in waste to energy technologies continues advancing. The success of the Ouro reactor demonstrates the potential for breakthrough technologies to overcome traditional barriers. This progress encourages investment in similar innovations that could expand renewable fuel production capabilities.

The Circular Economy benefits from technologies that create value from waste streams. As cow manure jet fuel production scales, it establishes new economic models where agricultural waste becomes a valuable commodity. This transformation supports sustainable development goals while creating economic opportunities.

Industry partnerships between technology developers, farmers, and airlines could accelerate adoption. These collaborations can provide the financing, technical support, and market access needed for widespread implementation. Strategic partnerships align stakeholder interests around shared sustainability goals.

Regulatory support for renewable fuel production continues evolving. Government incentives and mandates for sustainable aviation fuel create favorable market conditions for technologies like the Ouro reactor. Policy support can accelerate adoption and investment in on-farm fuel production systems.

The long-term vision includes networks of farms producing renewable fuel that supplies regional aviation hubs. This distributed production model could reduce transportation costs and improve supply chain resilience. Local production also supports rural economic development and energy independence.

Research and development efforts focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs further. Continued innovation in electric reforming systems and biogas processing could expand the range of feedstocks and improve economic viability. These advances support broader adoption across diverse agricultural operations.

“While we are disappointed in the 777 delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making,"" he said.
Ortberg said Boeing was making progress on stabilizing its production.
Boeing also reported that its backlog of orders, including 5,900 commercial planes, had grown to $636 billion in the third quarter.","Boeing reported mixed third-quarter results on Wednesday, as higher aircraft deliveries and a growing backlog of orders were offset by continued certification delays for its 777X jets.

CEO Kelly Ortberg said the first delivery of its next generation of long-haul, wide-body jets is now expected in 2027 instead of 2026, resulting in a $4.9 billion charge in the quarter through September. But Ortberg emphasized in a call with analysts that the delays stemmed from the certification process, and not from any newly discovered technical issues.

“While we are disappointed in the 777 delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making,"" he said.

Ortberg said Boeing was making progress on stabilizing its production. The aerospace giant delivered 160 planes in the third quarter, the most quarterly deliveries since 2018. The same time last year, Boeing said it delivered 116 planes.

Boeing also reported that its backlog of orders, including 5,900 commercial planes, had grown to $636 billion in the third quarter.

“There’s strong demand in our products,” Ortberg said in an interview Wednesday morning with CNBC.

In September, the Federal Aviation Administration restored Boeing's ability to perform final safety checks and certify 737 Max jets for flight more than six years after two crashes of the then-new aircraft killed 346 people.

That decision was followed by the FAA's move this month to raise Boeing's 737 Max production limit that it had set in January 2024, after a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing is now allowed to build 42 Max jets per month, up from 38, and Ortberg said Wednesday that the company expects to raise that cap further once it demonstrates to the FAA that it can do so safely.

If the FAA approves future production boosts, Ortberg said, they'd come in increments of five jets and wouldn't happen more than once every six months.

“We won’t move to higher rates until we reach stability and readiness,” he said.

Boeing also reported $238 million in free cash flow, marking its first cash flow-positive quarter since 2023. But that figure was partly boosted by a delay in a potential $700 million payment to the Justice Department, part of a still-pending deal under consideration by a federal judge that could spare Boeing from criminal prosecution in the two deadly 737 Max crashes.

The crashes off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia happened less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and were later blamed on a new software system that Boeing developed for the aircraft.

Meanwhile, a strike was ongoing at three Midwest plants in the St. Louis area. About 3,200 machinists who build military jets and weapons systems walked off the job on Aug. 4 as negotiations stalled over key issues, including retirement benefits and wage increases.

The workers rejected Boeing's latest contract offer over the weekend. It was the fourth time that the workers voted against a proposed deal.

“If Boeing is serious about culture change and rebuilding its brand, it starts with respecting the people who make its success possible,” the union representing the workers said Wednesday in a statement after Boeing posted its quarterly results.

The strike is smaller in scale than a walkout last year by 33,000 workers who assemble commercial jetliners but still threatens to complicate the company’s progress in regaining its financial footing.

Boeing said Wednesday it was still carrying out its “contingency plan” during the latest strike, which the company has said includes hiring replacement workers and leaning on its non-union workers during the work stoppage.

According to Phillips 66, the facility has the capacity to produce approximately 50,000 barrels per day (800 MMgy) of renewable fuels.
Total renewable fuel sales were 63,000 barrels per day, down from 70,000 barrels per day.
For the first nine months of the year, Phillips 66 produced 40,000 barrels per day of renewables, up from 28,000 barrels per day during the same period of 2024, with sales of 66,000 barrels per day, up from 50,000 barrels per day.
We also anticipate continuing to increase our SAF production in Q4, and we’ve seen strong interest from SAF buyers.","Phillips 66 doubled its production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) during the third quarter of 2025 and expects additional increases in production to be realized during the fourth quarter, according to statements made during the company’s third quarter earnings call on Oct. 29.

The company’s renewable fuels business segment processes renewable feedstocks into renewable fuels at its Rodeo facility in California and the Humber refinery in the U.K. The segment also includes global activities to procure renewable feedstocks, manage certain regulatory credits and market renewable fuels.

Development on the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex began in mid-2022 and the facility reached full processing rates during the second quarter of 2024. The biorefinery began producing SAF in September 2024. According to Phillips 66, the facility has the capacity to produce approximately 50,000 barrels per day (800 MMgy) of renewable fuels.

The third quarter improvement is primarily attributed to improved margins driven by optimized feedstock volumes and higher international credits, partially offset by unfavorable inventory impacts. The decrease for the first nine months of the year was primarily driven by decreased margins as a result of increased feedstock volumes and unfavorable inventory impacts, partially offset by increased credit production.

The company produced 36,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels during the third quarter, down from 44,000 barrels per day produced during the same period of last year. Total renewable fuel sales were 63,000 barrels per day, down from 70,000 barrels per day. For the first nine months of the year, Phillips 66 produced 40,000 barrels per day of renewables, up from 28,000 barrels per day during the same period of 2024, with sales of 66,000 barrels per day, up from 50,000 barrels per day. The company did not break down renewable production and sales volumes by fuel type in its third quarter report.

During a third quarter earnings call, Brian Mandell, executive vice president of marketing and commercial at Phillips 66, noted that overall renewable margins were down in the third quarter, but Phillips 66 was able to benefit through various “self-help” measures. “We reduced costs,” he said. “we improved our logistics, particularly to get more domestic feedstock. We sent more of our renewable products to the Pacific Northwest where fossil basis were strong. We got a lot of value from some new pathways we got. We doubled SAF production, and…we had the timing of the European credits.”

Moving into the fourth quarter, Mandell said renewables margins are improving with weaker soybean prices and relatively stronger credit values. “We think the industry will continue to run at about the same rates as they did in Q3 given the turnaround activity,” he said. “The European market will continue to attract renewable products. We’ve been sending renewable products in that director, both in Q3 and we continue doing that. We also anticipate continuing to increase our SAF production in Q4, and we’ve seen strong interest from SAF buyers. And finally, the new pathways that I mentioned will give us some additional flexibility.” Despite those market improvements, Mandell stressed the need for more clarity on federal and state policy, including the upcoming Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027, the EPA’s small refinery exemption (SRE) reallocation proposal, and the use of foreign feedstocks. He also said additional clarity is needed with regard to European policies.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Phillips66_Q32025_73df6a7ae8.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 21:16:52.994012

Key aviation and aerospace organisations – including ASD – have written to Commissioners Wopke Hoekstra and Apostolos Tzitzikostas, calling for a credible STIP that mitigates market distortions in Europe’s nascent sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) market.

Dear Commissioner Hoekstra, Dear Commissioner Tzitzikostas,

We, the undersigned associations, who jointly represent Europe’s aviation ecosystem, are writing to reiterate the messages set out in our Joint Industry Letter on Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Book & Claim of 17 February 2025, co-signed by manufacturers, airlines, airports, fuel suppliers and logistics partners across Europe, ahead of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) publication next week.

Scaling the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) remains essential to achieve Europe’s climate goals while safeguarding competitiveness. The first months of SAF mandates have demonstrated that the system needs additional flexibility for offtakers to stimulate the SAF market. Current regulatory and market constraints are slowing down investment and deployment. We ask that the STIP explicitly supports the introduction of a Book & Claim (B&C) system and commits to ensuring it is compatible with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as part of its ongoing review. We also call on the STIP to channel EU ETS revenues towards financing SAF production and uptake, and to provide clear political direction on increasing and extending SAF allowances to accelerate the sector’s decarbonisation.

In particular, we call on the Commission to:

Include Book & Claim in the STIP implementation to enable SAF distribution and uptake across all EU airports, regardless of physical availability.

Allow purchase-based claiming of SAF under EU ETS through necessary amendments in the upcoming EU ETS Review, enabling aircraft operators to reduce their EU ETS obligations under the applicable scope by claiming the use of SAF from all Union Airports.

Extend to aircraft operators the flexibility mechanism applicable to fuel suppliers under ReFuelEU Aviation.

Ensure robust accounting and digital traceability of SAF attributes for fuel suppliers and aircraft operators via the Union Database for Biofuels, preventing double counting while unlocking investment in EU SAF projects.

Include in the STIP a political direction on increasing and extending SAF allowance.

Introducing Book & Claim now is crucial to avoid market distortions, accelerate SAF deployment, and deliver on Europe’s climate and competitiveness ambitions. The forthcoming STIP is also a key opportunity to mobilise public and private funding to bridge the price gap for airlines , including through the recycling of EU ETS revenues to finance SAF production and uptake, and by providing political direction on increasing and extending SAF allowances. Together, these measures will enable the industry to competitively decarbonise, strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy, and turn sustainable aviation into an economic success story for the EU.",https://www.asd-europe.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-29 19:56:51.422094

The expansion will see Neste supply SAF to three more major U.S. airports, including George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and Dulles International Airport (IAD). This move reinforces United’s ongoing efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to greener fuel alternatives.

New Airports Join United’s SAF Network

United Airlines, which has been actively involved in the promotion and adoption of sustainable aviation practices, has expanded its SAF supply to these additional airports as part of its sustainability strategy. As of July 2025, Neste began supplying SAF at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, marking a milestone in the airline’s effort to reduce carbon emissions. The SAF deliveries at IAH are scheduled to continue through October 2025.

In September 2025, the collaboration between United and Neste expanded to include both Newark Liberty and Dulles International airports. SAF deliveries will run through the remainder of the year, with plans to continue in the future. By adding these three major airports to the network, United Airlines is taking a further step toward its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The Importance of SAF in Sustainable Aviation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a key component in reducing the aviation sector’s environmental impact. SAF is made from renewable sources, such as waste oils, agricultural residues, or non-food-based crops, and can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

By increasing the use of SAF at more airports, United Airlines is helping to set a new standard for eco-friendly air travel. SAF also plays a crucial role in improving local air quality around airports by reducing the harmful emissions associated with fossil fuels. As more airports adopt SAF, it not only helps the airline meet its sustainability targets but also supports the global goal of lowering carbon emissions in the aviation industry.

United Airlines has been at the forefront of integrating SAF into its operations. Previously, the airline has worked with Neste to provide SAF at other airports, including Chicago O’Hare International and San Francisco International Airport. United’s broader commitment to SAF, seen in this new expansion, is part of its strategic vision to reduce the aviation industry’s reliance on traditional jet fuels.

Benefits for United Airlines and Its Passengers

For United Airlines, expanding SAF usage is not only a step towards sustainability but also a way to address the increasing demand for eco-friendly travel options. Passengers are becoming more conscious of the environmental impact of their travel decisions, and this move by United to provide SAF at more airports signals a commitment to offering greener alternatives.

Brett Hart, President of United Airlines, has emphasized that collaboration is key to accelerating the shift towards SAF. The airline’s partnership with Neste is crucial in making SAF more widely available. Hart also acknowledged the importance of government support, particularly through policies such as SAF tax credits, which have enabled easier access to these sustainable fuel options. United’s use of SAF at its expanded airports will provide more sustainable flight options to passengers, helping the airline meet its carbon reduction goals.

Neste’s Role in Expanding SAF Supply

Neste’s role in providing SAF to United Airlines is critical to the growth of the sustainable aviation fuel industry. Neste has committed to scaling up the production of SAF, with plans to increase its global production capacity. By supplying SAF to key airports in the U.S., Neste is helping pave the way for widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel, making it more accessible to a broader range of airlines.

Neste’s SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks, and the company’s extensive network ensures that airlines like United can efficiently access SAF at key airports. The expansion of SAF availability at major hubs like Houston, Newark, and Dulles is a key milestone in the evolution of green aviation, as it signals that SAF is becoming a viable alternative for fueling commercial flights on a larger scale.

The Bigger Picture: A Shift Toward Sustainable Aviation

The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint as part of the global effort to combat climate change. Aviation accounts for a significant portion of global emissions, and switching to SAF is one of the most effective ways to reduce these emissions without requiring major changes to existing aircraft or airport infrastructure.

United’s partnership with Neste is part of a broader trend in the aviation industry, where many airlines are seeking to integrate SAF into their operations. As governments continue to support the adoption of SAF through tax incentives and regulatory frameworks, the production and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel will continue to grow, making it more affordable and accessible for airlines worldwide.

What’s Next for United Airlines and SAF

Looking ahead, United Airlines plans to further expand its SAF usage across more airports in the coming years. The airline has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050, with SAF playing a pivotal role in meeting these targets. United also aims to increase the percentage of its fleet powered by SAF, helping to lead the way in aviation sustainability.

For passengers, the expansion of SAF at key airports like Houston, Newark, and Dulles ensures that they can travel with a more eco-conscious airline. The move reflects a growing demand for sustainable travel options and shows that airlines are actively responding to the environmental concerns of modern travelers.

Conclusion

The expansion of SAF delivery to three more major U.S. airports is a positive step forward for United Airlines and the aviation industry as a whole. By continuing its partnership with Neste, United is not only advancing its sustainability goals but also helping to set the standard for greener air travel. With SAF reducing emissions and improving local air quality, this initiative represents a crucial part of the aviation industry’s future — one that’s more sustainable and environmentally friendly.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/images-of-united-airlines-planes-at-hous_JmsVKy1TTpWCyL5jYCd6Lg_Shd9NlXXTxOWuNU8MIRdZA.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 17:56:20.546352

The new blend, designed to serve as a direct “drop-in” substitute for conventional jet fuel, will be distributed initially through AEG Fuels’ network, reaching key aviation hubs across Montana, Washington, and Oregon. MaxSAF aims to help regional carriers and fuel suppliers address their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) targets — a framework for measuring corporate sustainability and ethical impact — reduce Scope 1 and 3 emissions, which cover direct operational and value-chain-related greenhouse gas emissions, and demonstrate environmental leadership.

“AEG Fuels is honoured to partner with Montana Renewables on this milestone SAF launch,” said Landon Larson, vice president, Supply NA at AEG Fuels. “This partnership highlights how collaborative innovation can propel the transition to cleaner aviation solutions and provide practical value for operators.”

MaxSAF offers local and regional delivery, opening up the sustainable aviation market to airports beyond major hubs. For aviation customers, the product is engineered to work seamlessly with existing infrastructure while helping meet ambitious decarbonisation goals.

SAF, like MaxSAF, reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and improves air quality relative to traditional Jet A fuel. By supporting the circular economy—from farm to fuel—it also highlights the important role of agriculture and rural communities in the energy transition.

Montana Renewables stands as one of just three SAF producers operating at a commercial scale in North America. The company, based in Great Falls, Montana, produces sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, hydrogen, and naphtha from low-carbon feedstocks, including tallow, distillers’ corn oil, canola oil, used cooking oil, and camelina oil supplied by Pacific Northwest farms. As a major employer and investor in the region, Montana Renewables anchors both local economic and environmental goals.

The agency’s data reveal that national biofuel production capacity increased by just 3% from the start of 2024 to early 2025, primarily due to a marked deceleration in the renewable diesel segment and increased sector rationalisation.

Renewable diesel and other biofuels—including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane—grew only 391 million gallons per year (gal/y). This is less than one-third the annual growth levels seen in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, only two significant capacity additions entered service, both in California: Phillips 66 completed its conversion of the Rodeo refinery exclusively to biofuels, now rated at 767 million gal/y (up from 180 million gal/y the year before), making it the country’s second-largest facility behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana. The new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield also came online with 138 million gal/y of capacity.

However, these gains were partially offset by the closure of four facilities: Monroe Energy and Chevron discontinued renewable diesel co-processing at plants in Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, respectively, while Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy shut down plants in Alabama and Mississippi, respectively. These shutdowns reflect tighter margins for biofuels and robust profitability for petroleum refining, which discouraged new investments for the coming years.

Meanwhile, the SAF segment is gaining momentum. Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can now shift 150 million gal/y of renewable diesel to SAF, while Diamond Green Diesel can reallocate about 235 million gal/y. This refocus aligns with growing demand for low-carbon aviation fuels.

Biodiesel capacity actually fell, with eight plants closing in 2024 due to unfavourable margins, reducing output by roughly 100 million gal/y.

Conversely, U.S. fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in prior years, now comprising 73% of the nation’s total biofuel capacity (nearly 18.5 billion gal/y). Most ethanol production remains centred in the Midwest, with the rise in capacity primarily supporting growing export demand rather than increased domestic use.

Regions such as the PJM Interconnection zone are showing signs of stress, and utilities and grid-operators are already talking about disconnecting large data-center loads during emergencies and seeing sharp wholesale price spikes.

Earlier this year, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association published a report, A Reliable Grid for an Electric Future, that projects that national electricity demand will rise more than 50% by 2050. Some industry observers worry utilities are ill-equipped to handle such fast load growth. Data centers, transportation electrification and manufacturing operations remain at risk from power disruptions. At the same time, much of the US’ transmission and distribution network is decades old. NEMA says those factors make modernization a near-term necessity rather than a long-term aspiration.

The report provided useful information that set the stage for NEMA and the GridWise Alliance’s recent Congressional Grid Innovation Expo, where the industry had a chance to discuss ongoing projects and technological developments that enhance grid reliability. ABB, INDT and other GridWise Alliance members revealed products that suggest the future of grid reliability will succeed based on how well the power system implements data management and predictive control systems. The products support a lofty goal: To extend equipment life and prevent faults and failures before breakdowns happen.

Demand Growth and System Stress

Electricity use in the United States is climbing at the fastest rate in a generation. Data centers alone are expected to increase their consumption by 300% over the next decade, according to NEMA’s analysis. Artificial intelligence workloads generate one-quarter of the total growth in this market. The current requirement for individual facilities exceeds 100 megawatts, which creates excessive pressure on nearby substations and transmission lines.

ABB engineers believe they have solved this problem through the implementation of artificial intelligence technology that now operates within their grid monitoring and fault prediction systems. One system they developed in 2018 uses real-time operational data analysis to detect minor voltage and current irregularities which typically signal upcoming faults. The model achieves 95% confidence in failure precursor detection, which enables utilities to detect and solve potential issues before they cause service disruptions. ABB says it has demonstrated through its European operations that big organizations can achieve major reliability enhancements by implementing data collection and analytics integration at scale.

Another major factor that creates new market demand stems from transportation electrification. NEMA projects that power consumption from electric vehicle charging will grow nearly 9000 percent by mid-century. Roughly 55 million light-duty electric vehicles are expected on US roads by 2035. These vehicles will create new patterns of customer demand by generating more traffic during evening and nighttime hours while creating big consumption zones near charging stations. This requires scheduling charging operations according to renewable power availability and storage capacity to achieve stability.

The process of building and industrial electrification creates an additional level of complexity. The transition to electric heat pumps and induction processes and other non-combustion systems results in higher total energy consumption and produces more concentrated peak demand periods. Installation of rooftop solar systems and behind-the-meter batteries can lead to intermittent backflow that standard distribution networks aren’t designed to handle.

Meanwhile, the regional distribution of growth is uneven. PJM and ERCOT experience fast-growing demand because of data center operations, but northeastern and western states face higher demand from electric vehicle charging and building power consumption. The installation of renewable energy systems will reach more than 50% in multiple regions during 2050, but their unpredictable power output needs stable power sources, including natural gas plants and nuclear reactors and extended storage systems.

Policy Framework and Supply Chain Readiness

Regulatory and supply chain conditions will determine whether modernization can keep pace with demand. NEMA has identified three key areas which need improvement to create immediate results: Permitting processes, tax and trade policy systems, and domestic manufacturing transparency systems.

The process of obtaining permits stands as the main obstacle blocking project development. The review process for transmission projects requires developers to wait multiple years before they can begin construction. NEMA supports federal-state process alignment for environmental requirements and grid-enhancing technology deployment to enhance power grid capacity through existing transmission corridors. The process of expansion would become faster through streamlined procedures which maintain proper monitoring.

The Inflation Reduction Act established financial incentives for grid development, but its unclear implementation procedures have restricted the number of organizations participating in the program. And the unpredictable nature of tariff policies, together with multiple electrical component exemptions, makes it difficult to procure goods and deters businesses from entering into extended contractual agreements.

The US–Mexico–Canada Agreement serves as the main framework for international trade component procurement. The right import policies will help maintain stable transformer and conductor supplies while protecting domestic manufacturing operations. The proposed LEAP Act expansion of technical apprenticeships through its programs would solve the existing skills shortage problem in manufacturing and field maintenance.

NEMA has attempted to address sourcing transparency through its Make It American BABA registry. The program maintains a database of American-made electrical products which fulfill both Buy America and Build America standards. The registry allows public agencies and their contractors to verify compliance status while discovering domestic suppliers through a new system which eliminates conventional certification procedures. The goal is to reduce delays in procurement, strengthen visibility into US manufacturing capacity and turn a regulatory mandate into a practical planning tool.

From Reactive to Preventive Operations

The reliability challenge increasingly depends on visibility. Many outages occur because utilities cannot detect early signs of mechanical or electrical stress. New approaches from ABB and IND Technology (INDT) demonstrate how complementary technologies can close that information gap.

ABB’s predictive fault management platform illustrates how data science can support operational decision-making. The system uses artificial intelligence to analyze real-time measurements of current, phase angle, and power quality. By comparing these data points with historical fault signatures, the software can identify patterns that precede equipment failure. When it detects conditions likely to worsen over the following days or weeks, operators receive alerts that allow targeted maintenance before a disruption occurs.

The value of ABB’s approach lies in its ability to integrate predictive analytics with existing grid management systems. When paired with automated switching and dispatch tools, it enables utilities to isolate faults more quickly and restore service faster. Utilities using this kind of analytics report measurable reductions in both outage frequency and duration, as well as lower maintenance costs from more focused field interventions.

INDT’s technology operates at a different level of the grid. Rather than analyzing system-wide electrical data, it focuses on the physical condition of transmission and distribution lines. The company’s sensor-based monitoring system detects defects such as cracked insulators or loosened fittings that often lead to faults. Sensors installed every few miles along transmission routes capture radio-frequency patterns that shift when small arcing events or mechanical vibrations occur. These changes are processed in the cloud, and the system generates precise geographic coordinates for maintenance crews.

The platform, originally developed and tested in Australia, improved network reliability by roughly 50 percent in long-term trials. It is now deployed across twelve of the twenty largest US utilities and recently completed a 16,000-mile installation in communities with limited previous grid investment. By turning inspection from a periodic task into a continuous process, INDT’s method lowers operational expenses while improving safety and service quality.

Using Existing Infrastructure More Efficiently

NEMA’s study identifies several technologies capable of unlocking substantial capacity increases. The use of advanced materials for reconductoring would enable the generation of 110 gigawatts of additional power. The installation of dynamic line ratings that adjust current limits based on temperature and wind conditions would lead to an additional 80 gigawatts of power generation. The combination of smart grid systems and advanced metering infrastructure would generate approximately 25 gigawatts of power through enhanced monitoring capabilities and better control of electricity usage.

Utilities have started using these methods in their current operations. The sensors from LineVision monitor conductor temperature and sag continuously to establish safe operating limits in real-time which results in a 10 to 20 percent increase in production capacity without requiring additional equipment. The GridWrap system provides mechanical strength to poles and towers through reinforcement which protects them from storms that cause capacity reductions. Organizations can extend their asset lifespan through these methods which delay their need for significant capital expenditures.

Storage and Flexible Resources

Energy storage is expanding faster than any other category of grid infrastructure. NEMA projects that installed storage capacity will grow more than tenfold over the next fifteen years. Short-duration batteries operate to stabilize wind and solar plant power output while long-duration systems function as backup power systems for prolonged power disruptions. Customers who install behind-the-meter systems gain control over their expenses while protecting themselves from power disruptions.

At the Expo, Siemens highlighted the Bronzeville Community Microgrid in Chicago, operated by ComEd. The system combines distributed solar generation, energy storage, and a Siemens controller that allows the microgrid to operate independently during wider grid outages. Similar configurations are being deployed at hospitals, universities, and industrial sites to improve local reliability and reduce peak demand.

Smarter Transformers and Digital Equipment

The power grid contains transformers which represent its most exposed system elements. Many units in service today are more than thirty years old and the supply of new ones is constrained by material and manufacturing limits. The integration of intelligence into these devices creates an efficient solution to boost system dependability until manufacturers can replace them entirely.

Attendees at the expo had an opportunity to see the Prolec-GE smart transformer platform, which contains sensors which track temperature data and vibration patterns and acoustic signals that indicate partial discharge occurrences. The on-board processors analyze data within their system to provide immediate responses when they detect any irregularities. The transformers establish secure connections with utility control systems through standard communication protocols which include MQTT and IEC 61850. The system operates as a bidirectional power flow system which enables distributed generation and microgrid operations.

The transformation allows transformers to take part in system management operations through active system participation. The system provides instant warning alerts about system deterioration while its control system preserves voltage stability through distributed resource power adjustments. Prolec research suggests that predictive maintenance techniques allow transformers to operate for extended periods while minimizing the requirement for new transformer units.

The industry has started to develop new methods which share similarities with these approaches. ABB achieves real-time coordination through direct analytics integration with its switchgear and substation systems. Hitachi Energy has initiated two manufacturing expansion projects in Virginia and Canada while it works to eliminate SF₆ gas from its equipment to achieve environmental sustainability. The modular microgrid systems from Schneider Electric enable faster project completion while providing uniform control systems. Lutron maintains its focus on building automation system development and lighting control solutions which enable users to monitor their energy usage.

Outlook

Electricity demand in the US is rising faster than the capacity of the generation and transmission system. Meeting that growth will depend on how effectively the country links technology, policy and domestic manufacturing.

Many of the necessary tools are already in place. Predictive analytics, sensor networks, grid-enhancing technologies, smart transformers, and advanced storage systems can all be deployed today to deliver measurable gains in reliability and resilience. NEMA’s Make It American BABA registry, along with supporting policy frameworks, strengthens the manufacturing foundation needed to scale those solutions.

Progress will hinge on three areas: streamlined permitting, consistent trade policy, and sustained investment in workforce development. Together, they form the conditions for modernization at the speed the economy now requires.

The grid that results from these efforts will operate with greater visibility and flexibility. It will rely on continuous data rather than scheduled inspection and on predictive maintenance rather than reactive repair. Success will depend on close coordination among utilities, manufacturers, and policymakers, but the essential technologies and methods are already proven. The next step is to apply them with the scope and urgency that a fully electrified economy demands.

For Alexander, the scholarship opened doors that might otherwise have remained closed. It connected him to TransDigm’s network, leading to a summer internship at TA Aerospace, a TransDigm operating unit, where he discovered that “invisible chemistry decides visible safety.”

At TA Aerospace, Alexander tested elastomer seals — flexible, rubber-like materials that prevent fuel leaks in aircraft and spacecraft engines — analyzing how different types of fuel affected their performance. He exposed these specialized rubber seals to both sustainable aviation fuel and military-grade JP8 fuel, then tested whether they could still stretch without breaking, resist tearing and hold up under extreme temperatures and pressures. Using advanced chemical analysis techniques, he identified specific compounds in the fuel mixtures while also researching PFAS — the so-called “forever chemicals” that don’t break down in the environment and pose growing health risks.

“The most rewarding aspect,” Alexander reflected, “was knowing my work fed into a chain of protection that ultimately keeps people alive in the air, from passengers to astronauts.”

Said Michele Starrs, TA Aerospace president: “By offering internships and hands-on experiences, we don’t just view USC students as future hires — we see them as collaborators in solving real engineering challenges. Connecting early helps students understand how different parts of the business operate, and it enables us to nurture talent that is already familiar with our culture, values and technical demands. Jeremy brought specific enthusiasm to the idea of environmental sustainability and helped kick off research into how our industry can begin to phase out PFAS, or ‘forever chemicals.’”

That connection between invisible processes and human survival threads through all of Alexander’s research. In Professor Adam Smith’s environmental engineering lab at USC, he cultivates specialized microbes for nutrient removal in wastewater treatment. Working alongside Ph.D. student Raven Althouse, Alexander has analyzed more than 250 ion chromatography samples and maintained bioreactors at precise conditions to understand how microorganisms can transform nitrogen cycles.

Last May, his poster on membrane biofilm reactors earned second place in a research symposium for the Sonny Astani Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering. When asked to explain his research as a bedtime story, Alexander offers this simple version: “There are tiny bugs in the water, too small to see but strong enough to eat pollution. When we give them the right kind of home, they clean the water for us, turning something dirty into something safe for our health.”

The rice paddy samples Alexander collected last summer are still being analyzed for microbial communities, heavy metals and PFAS contamination. Rice paddies’ waterlogged, oxygen-poor soils create natural environments for organisms like Anammox and n-DAMO — microbes that link nitrogen and methane cycling in ways critical to both agriculture and climate.

PFAS compounds have become a recurring theme in Alexander’s work, appearing both in the high-performance aerospace materials he studied at TA Aerospace and in the environmental samples he analyzes at USC.

“I didn’t choose PFAS as a research focus; its ubiquity in both aerospace and the environment made it impossible to ignore,” he said. “The same chemistry that makes PFAS nearly indestructible for engineering also makes them nearly impossible to remove from the environment.”

Alexander’s research interests extend beyond the laboratory. As a certified scientific diver through USC’s Wrigley Institute on Catalina Island, he has journeyed to the ocean floor, studying invertebrates. His most memorable dives were at night, descending into total darkness to recover lost objects while lobsters crawled over rocks and fish darted through kelp forests.

“That experience captured what I love about research in any setting — whether underwater, in soils, or in reactors,” Alexander says. “The most important discoveries often come when you step into places that feel unfamiliar and find novelty in what others might overlook.”

Looking toward the future, Alexander doesn’t dream of planting flags on Mars, but he does dream of “making sure the person who does can thrive there.” He envisions engineering microbial and natural systems that recycle air and water in closed habitats, developing novel polymers and coatings that resist radiation and volatile fuels.

“For me,” Alexander notes, “space is not a backdrop but a test: how can we protect human health when the environment turns hostile?”

Beyond his research pursuits, Alexander brings an eclectic curiosity to everything he does. He’s interested in toxicology and venoms, conserves ancient artifacts in USC’s archaeology lab, and has earned certifications in everything from pharmacy technology to bear identification from Idaho Fish and Game. He’s also learning guitar, practices early morning swims and admits to drinking two glasses of milk daily.

“One thing I’d say is that I’m a jolly person,” Alexander says with characteristic enthusiasm. “I laugh easily, I’m quick to joy, and I can find fun in just about anything.”

Without the Doug Peacock Scholarship, Alexander believes his curiosity would still be alive, “but my reach wouldn’t be as vast.” The scholarship provided not just financial support, but connections that transformed his academic trajectory — from aerospace internships to research opportunities that span from microscopic organisms to space exploration.

“Whether the system is a reactor, a spacecraft, or another planet, the goal is the same,” Alexander said. “To turn fragile conditions into places where people can survive and thrive.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is a lower-carbon alternative produced from sources such as used cooking oils and fats, municipal waste, or from renewable energy sources.
The UK government currently imposes a ‘SAF mandate’ on the aviation industry that 2% of aviation fuel used in the UK must be SAF.","The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill is a government bill. It was introduced in the House of Commons on 14 May 2025 and completed its third reading on 15 October 2025. The bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 20 October 2025 and is due to receive its second reading on 20 November 2025. The Department for Transport has produced explanatory notes (ENs) for the bill.

The bill would introduce a revenue certainty mechanism to support the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK. It would do this by designating a counterparty (a company wholly owned by the government) to engage in contracts with SAF producers to guarantee the price of the sale of eligible SAF. To finance the revenue certainty mechanism the bill would introduce a levy on conventional aviation fuel suppliers.

Conventional aviation fuel is predominantly made from crude oil. Sustainable aviation fuel is a lower-carbon alternative produced from sources such as used cooking oils and fats, municipal waste, or from renewable energy sources. Development and production of SAF is capital intensive and global supply is limited.

The UK government currently imposes a ‘SAF mandate’ on the aviation industry that 2% of aviation fuel used in the UK must be SAF. This target is set to rise to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Transport accounted for around 30% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, and aviation was the second largest contributor of that figure. The government has said that SAF is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, as SAF is a ‘drop-in fuel’ that does not require modifications to existing aircraft. The government has claimed the bill would support SAF production in the UK by providing revenue certainty and thereby reducing risk to investors in SAF production facilities.

During the bill’s House of Commons stages there was broad cross-party support for the bill, and it passed with only minor, technical government amendments.",https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/Energy.png,N,,2025-10-29 14:56:24.031189

It comes as plans to enlarge key hubs like Heathrow and Gatwick risk compromising the nation’s legally-binding net-zero commitments.

The Commons Environmental Audit Committee has warned that, without new safeguards, these expansions could push the UK beyond its carbon budgets.

The committee's report notes that current government policies are not sufficient to reduce carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with statutory targets.

This is compounded by expectations of rising demand for air travel. further jeopardising national emission plans.

Air freight and economic targets

Following Labour's 2024 general election victory, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves approved new runways at both Heathrow and Gatwick.

For the government, the expansions represent vital components of its economic growth strategy.

The importance of Heathrow for UK trade is considerable, with more than 60% of the nation's air freight passing through the airport. This capacity is essential for connecting manufacturers to global markets.

“Heathrow is at the heart of the UK’s openness as a country,"" notes Reeves.

Reeves also points to Heathrow's ability to connect the UK to emerging markets and the fact it hosted around 15 million business travellers in 2023.

The committee has challenged this perspective, however, stating: ""The government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to.""

John McDonnell, Labour’s MP for Hayes and Harlington, previously wrote on social media that the Heathrow expansion was ""huge political economic and especially environmental mistake"" that could inflict ""irreparable scale of damage on the government"".

Sustainable aviation fuel production concerns

A significant part of the government's aviation decarbonisation plan relies on adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The committee has raised doubts about this strategy, highlighting that SAF is not yet being produced or used at a commercial scale.

This dependency on an emerging technology could pose a risk to achieving emission targets.

The challenge was underlined last year when Air New Zealand had to scrap its 2030 decarbonisation target, citing difficulties in securing a stable supply of SAF.

This brings into question whether the aviation industry can meet its decarbonisation promises without proven and scalable alternatives to conventional jet fuel.

Outdated policy and decarbonisation pressure

The planned expansions are set to begin before the government updates its national policy statement on airports, a document last released in 2018.

The committee argues this allows the government to avoid scrutiny and base decisions on a framework inconsistent with current climate objectives.

Toby Perkins, the Labour Chair of the committee, warns that meeting decarbonisation targets is already a considerable challenge.

""Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder,"" Toby says. ""Under the government's existing 'jet zero' strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk.""

Alethea Warrington, Head of Aviation at climate charity Possible, describes the committee's report as the ""final nail in the coffin"" for the government's case.

She says: ""The government's scrutiny committee has made it clearer than ever that airport growth is a bad option for Britain, and that the government simply doesn't have any economic evidence to justify the environmental devastation this would cause.""

In response, a spokesperson from the Department for Transport said: ""We have been clear that airport expansion will only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change, including net zero, and we will be seeking advice from the independent Climate Change Committee to inform the review.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/015db0eed64dbb49bcf15b3a340517fb:3bd63977912f8defd924cea7dec8e8b2/wagtailsource-heathrow-airport-height-1200-format-webp.webp.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 13:57:18.546572

— Ron Kotrba, Editor and Publisher, Biobased Diesel Daily®

WARREN, MN, UNITED STATES, October 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Biobased Diesel Daily® (biobased-diesel.com), the leading biofuels news outlet specifically focused on the biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and marine biofuel sectors of the global energy economy, is celebrating five years of successful operation since its launch.

Founded amid the changing biofuels landscape of 2020 by veteran industry writer and award-winning editor Ron Kotrba in order to better serve those who manufacture biofuels, develop projects and supply producers with vital equipment, goods and services to do so—as well as the broader market up and down the supply chain—Biobased Diesel Daily® was formed as a purpose-driven outlet covering biobased fuels specifically made for heavy-duty and hard-to-abate segments like trucking, construction, rail, heating, marine and aviation.

Now with more than 20 years of experience in the field as a writer, senior writer, editor, senior editor, editor-in-chief and publisher, Kotrba offers his take on what has made the Biobased Diesel® product line—including Biobased Diesel Daily® (biobased-diesel.com), Biobased Diesel™ Weekly and the Biobased Diesel® print magazine—such a success over the past five years.

“Five years ago, the energy markets were very different than they are today,” Kotrba says. “And the biofuels industries and markets within the larger energy sector have changed drastically too. But what hasn’t seemed to really change is how biofuels media moguls and their sprawling, bloated enterprises do their jobs and operate their businesses. After years covering these evolving markets, and years working within and learning how the biofuels news and magazine establishment operates—including how many of them truly do a disservice to their readers, advertisers and industries they purport to serve—I launched the Biobased Diesel® product line to show there is a better way.”

Shortly after debuting as a startup alternative in this competitive field, Biobased Diesel Daily®, Biobased Diesel™ Weekly and the Biobased Diesel® print journal grew in popularity and gained the trust of readers around the world, as well as dozens of advertising clients representing the largest companies in the space to smaller enterprises as well as various organizations and associations.

The once-alternative source of news, information and perspective for biodiesel, renewable diesel, SAF and marine biofuel is now a leading industry trade publication with nearly 5,000 articles published on Biobased Diesel Daily® since its introduction—despite the lack of an executive team, board members and sales, editorial, marketing and circulation staff.

“The success of the Biobased Diesel® line is precisely because I do not have overpaid, underwhelming executives, a commission-driven sales staff and an unmotivated or inattentive news crew on the payroll,” Kotrba says. “With the exception of an excellent contracted designer for the Biobased Diesel® print publication, I alone own, produce and operate this publication from start to finish—including editorial, sales, circulation and more.”

As a result, the Biobased Diesel® line is able to provide advertising packages to its existing and prospective clients for just a fraction of what its competitors charge, even if they were to provide deep discounts to their high prices.

Plus, with Kotrba’s vast network of industry connections and more than two decades of experience, he is able to assemble and curate the largest collection of original print articles written by the biggest, most well-known names and top experts in the field—issue after issue.

In fact, the Winter 2026 Biobased Diesel® print magazine is currently in development. Sales are open but space is filling up fast. For those interested in being part of the issue, please contact Kotrba to reserve advertising placement by Nov. 10.

The Winter 2026 Biobased Diesel® will receive special bonus distribution at two leading biofuel events this winter—the Clean Fuels Conference in Orlando, Florida, Jan. 19-22, 2026, and a special seat drop at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit in Altoona, Iowa, Feb. 5, 2026.

Don’t miss the chance to put your company and its offerings on full display for its target audience in the leading trade publication serving the biodiesel, renewable diesel, SAF and marine biofuel industries.

“If your company isn’t advertising with Biobased Diesel®, there is a good chance your competitors are,” Kotrba says.

Kotrba adds that 2026 is poised to be a potentially record-breaking year for the biobased diesel sector.

“I firmly believe 2026 will be a monumental year for biodiesel, renewable diesel, SAF and marine biofuel,” he says. “Industry advancements and capacity buildout—particularly for certain subsects of the broader biofuels industries—will continue globally driven by policy, corporate commitments to the environment and the urging of shareholders. In the U.S., EPA signaled earlier this year that it plans to unleash the American biobased diesel sector after years of lackluster volume requirements with its robust Renewable Fuel Standard proposal for 2026 and 2027.”

Furthermore, Kotrba says that with an extension of and significant revisions to the 45Z clean fuel production credit signed into law in July, along with the potential for full reallocation of recently waived RFS gallons from small-refinery exemptions (SREs), these three important pieces of the U.S. biofuel puzzle are falling into place. This is positioning the industries Biobased Diesel® serves to have a record year of production and project development.

“Lastly,” Kotrba says, “I would like to take this special opportunity to thank readers, subscribers, editorial contributors and advertisers for making Biobased Diesel Daily®, Biobased Diesel™ Weekly, and the Biobased Diesel® print journal a success over its five-year journey. I couldn’t have done this without you—thank you.”

The technology, Honeywell UOP’s Biocrude Upgrading, produces lower-carbon marine fuel, gasoline and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from inexpensive and abundant biomass sources such as wood chips and crop residues.

For ship operators, these drop-in fuels could provide a cost-effective and lower-carbon alternative to traditional heavy fuel oil.

With higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives, this renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s range without requiring costly engine upgrades, according to Honeywell.

The breakthrough comes at a time of impasse in shipping when it comes to cutting carbon intensity. This month the International Maritime Organization Marine Environment Protection Committee voted to delay the adoption of the industry’s planned Net Zero Framework.

Ken West, President of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said, “The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from the point of installation through to refining and use.”

The tech means plant and agricultural waste can be converted into lower carbon biocrude at the feedstock collection sites, which keeps transport costs low.

The process technology enables biocrude to then be refined at major facilities to produce marine fuel, gasoline or SAF. This helps solve long-standing challenges with converting biocrudes into fuels with performance comparable to conventional fuel.

Biocrude Upgrading process technology can be delivered in the form of a prefabricated modular plant.

The news also comes shortly after a report from the European Union Safety Agency warns of the challenges in scaling SAF, with supplies concentrated in a small number of member states, although it found production capacity assessments indicate the EU is on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target (6%) in 2030.

While efficiency improvements and electrification will play a part, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains the only scalable option for deep decarbonisation of long-haul flights this side of 2040. As a ‘drop-in’ fuel that works with existing aircraft, it offers the most practical route to near-term emissions reduction.

At the same time, waste disposal continues to pose environmental and financial challenges for local authorities. Could these two problems help solve each other?

Introducing the project

As part of the Heathrow Strategic Planning Group’s “Runway to Net Zero” programme, City Science led a high-level feasibility study exploring whether residual municipal solid waste from across Surrey and the wider Heathrow area could form the basis of a local SAF production system.

The study examined:

Residual waste volumes and composition

Potential SAF yields under different production pathways

Likely impacts of new policies, such as the inclusion of Energy from Waste in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme

Infrastructure requirements to support SAF production including land, water, energy, and waste logistics

It also compared the indicative carbon performance of a waste-to-SAF pathway against current waste disposal via Energy from Waste incineration.

What we found

Through discussions with industry experts, we established that locating a waste-to-SAF plant near Heathrow (rather than in an industrial cluster which has been the focus of developments so far), there are some substantial benefits to be gained, such as a high population density generating large amounts of waste in a relatively small radius, and a significant nearby offtake in Heathrow Airport.

A geospatial analysis conducted using City Science’s Cadence platform mapped key waste infrastructure and existing waste flow routes, helping partners understand both the practical opportunities and the transport feasibility of future supply chains.

City Science used Surrey as a test bed for our analysis, which produces around 185,000 tonnes of residual municipal waste per year. Within this, the SAF-relevant fraction (paper and card, wood, plastics and textiles) totalled approximately 63,000 tonnes.

Depending on conversion efficiency, this material could produce up to 20,000 tonnes of SAF – enough to power hundreds of long-haul flights from Heathrow, while cutting waste disposal emissions by over a third compared with Energy from Waste incineration.

The analysis also showed that a commercial-size SAF facility would need to draw waste from multiple neighbouring authorities to reach viable scale, making the case for regional collaboration across the Heathrow Strategic Planning Group (HSPG) area and beyond.

Conclusions

With Heathrow at the heart of one of the UK’s largest waste-producing regions, there is a unique opportunity to align aviation decarbonisation with local waste and energy planning. Waste-to-SAF offers a compelling alternative to conventional disposal routes such as incineration or landfill, with significant environmental benefits.

Looking Ahead

Through projects like Runway to Net Zero, we’re supporting regions to turn climate ambition into action, contributing to the UK’s drive to be a leader in clean aviation and to deliver on the Jet Zero Strategy.

Phase 2 of Runway to Net Zero has demonstrated the potential for Waste-to-SAF in the HSPG region, showing the need for a regionally coordinated approach to SAF development. Next steps to progress this work should focus on pathways to implementation, including a wider assessment of feedstock availability, identification of SAF production sites, and reviewing the economic case.

This equates to 10% of the world’s transport-related energy consumption and 3% of total global energy consumption (IEA, 2024a).
Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is expected to reach 2.1 million litres in 2025, representing just 0.7% of total jet fuel production (IATA, 2024).
Growth in aviation emissions has been continuous, but it has been partially offset by substantial efficiency improvements.
In addition to carbon emissions, aviation contributes to climate change through the formation of contrails.","Aviation plays a vital role in connecting people, enabling global business, facilitating international trade and tourism, and providing a means of rapid transportation. The sector drives economic growth, shortens travel times and increases global interconnectedness.

One of the main challenges faced by aviation, however, is providing its social and economic benefits while also increasing its environmental responsibility. As one of the most carbon-intensive transport modes, aviation is a significant contributor to global GHG emissions and climate change (DESNZ and BEIZ, 2022). The sector is also responsible for non CO2 emissions (i.e. other gases and aerosol particles) that affect both the atmospheric composition and cloudiness, adding to the impact of the sector’s CO2 emissions (Lee, 2018).

In recent decades, demand for aviation services has steadily grown and could double by 2050 compared with 2022 levels (Graver, 2022; IATA, 2023). Therefore, there is a need to rapidly deploy decarbonisation solutions.

Emissions and energy use

In 2023, the energy consumption of the global aviation sector reached 13 EJ. This equates to 10% of the world’s transport-related energy consumption and 3% of total global energy consumption (IEA, 2024a). This energy demand was met nearly exclusively by fossil fuels. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is expected to reach 2.1 million litres in 2025, representing just 0.7% of total jet fuel production (IATA, 2024).

Dependency on fossil fuels results in aviation contributing significantly to the world’s CO2 emissions and climate change. CO2 emissions from aviation in 2022 reached 0.9 Gt, equivalent to between 2% and 3% of global emissions and 11% of all transport-related emissions (IEA, 2023a). Growth in aviation emissions has been continuous, but it has been partially offset by substantial efficiency improvements. As shown in Figure 10, these improvements have resulted in as much as 11 GtCO2 in emission reductions since 1990 (ATAG, 2021). In addition to carbon emissions, aviation contributes to climate change through the formation of contrails.

Due to the mass and volume limitations of aircraft, aviation depends on highly energy-dense fuels. There are sustainable fuel alternatives, but these come with a cost premium. The limited choice of usable fuels and the immaturity of alternative aircraft technologies, such as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft, therefore limit the decarbonisation pathways available to the sector.

Decarbonisation pathways

One decarbonisation pathway for aviation is the continued deployment of technological and operational energy efficiency improvements. Although the aviation sector has made significant progress in deploying increasingly efficient airframes and engines, there is still potential for further improvement. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) long-term aspirational goal aims for a 2% increase in fuel efficiency annually until 2050. This is higher than the average historically observed, and other projected, improvements of just 1.5% per year (ICAO, 2022a).

According to IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario, demand reduction and energy efficiency improvement are an important part of the sector’s decarbonisation efforts. These measures could account for roughly half of the sector’s emission reductions by 2050 13 (IRENA, 2023c). Further reductions could come from modal shifts in short-distance air travel – for example, replacing short flights with trains, which are much less carbon intensive (European Environment Agency, 2023).

The most technologically straightforward pathway to decarbonise the sector, however, is the use of advanced biofuels, namely biojet, given the maturity of the technology. Biojet can be used as a drop-in fuel on existing and future aircraft, making it a practical and immediately implementable option. Long-term bioenergy potential is not a constraint for the transition of the sector, either. IRENA suggests that the global technical potential for sustainable advanced biofuels is at least 114 EJ (IRENA, 2016b) or roughly eight times the energy demand for aviation. Current global biofuel production is only around 4.5 EJ, however, and is mostly food and feed crop based (90%) and used mainly for road transport (OECD/FAO, 2023).

The main challenges with biofuel are, first, its higher cost compared with conventional jet fuel and, second, the need to scale up its supply sustainably. Indeed, the rapid scale-up of sustainable biomass is complex and cannot be achieved without careful consideration of its potential negative impacts, particularly in terms of land use change and life-cycle GHG emissions. Minimizing these impacts requires strict controls along the entire supply chain, robust certification mechanisms and substantial policy interventions in the agriculture sector. At the same time, the increasing electrification of road transport could allow biofuel production capacity to be redirected towards other sectors, such as aviation and shipping.

Another option is the adoption of synthetic fuels produced from green hydrogen, which is produced from electrolysed water using renewable electricity. This can then be combined with a renewable source of carbon to produce a hydrocarbon fuel. The two options currently being considered are green hydrogen and e-kerosene. Although hydrogen could eliminate exhaust emissions from aviation, hydrogen aircraft technology for large passenger or cargo transport does not exist yet. This technology is also not expected to reach commercial maturity within a time frame compatible with making a material impact on carbon neutrality by mid-century. A fundamental issue revolves around the low volumetric energy density of hydrogen, which would require a fundamental redesign of airframes as well as operational procedures and safety standards. Furthermore, there is no hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in place.

E-kerosene, on the other hand, is chemically identical to its fossil counterpart and could be used in existing aircraft. The use of e-kerosene opens the door for deep emission reductions. However, the fact that the e-kerosene molecule contains carbon adds a layer of complexity. For e-kerosene to be an effective decarbonisation solution, it would have to be low carbon, and this carbon would need to come from a sustainable source (i.e. from biogenic sources such as bioenergy with CO2 capture or captured directly from the atmosphere). The need to build a sustainable supply chain for carbon is a major challenge, particularly given that to achieve cost efficiency, cheap renewable electricity for hydrogen production and a sustainable (and scalable) carbon source would need to be available.

However, if these challenges can be met, biofuels and e-fuels could account for the remaining half of the CO2 reductions needed by 2050, under IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario.

Electric propulsion is another technology pathway that should be considered for aviation. In the past, this has had limited potential as a decarbonisation solution due to the limited energy density of commercially available batteries. However, there has been remarkable progress in battery technologies over the last few years. Breakthroughs in energy density, with some batteries reaching 500 Wh/kg, could open the door the application of such batteries in electric or hybrid small aircraft and short-haul flights (CATL, 2023).

Electric propulsion also offers potential advantages over jet engines in areas such as higher efficiency, lower mechanical complexity and maintenance costs. Yet this pathway is not without its challenges. These challenges include the need to develop and certify new aircraft concepts and the need for further research and development in battery technologies to make them viable for flight as well as ground operations. These challenges also limit the decarbonisation potential of this technological pathway, given that new aircraft concepts can take as long as a decade to be developed and certified (FAA, 2023).",,N,,2025-10-29 13:57:23.936626

The government has been urged to clarify how it will mitigate the environmental impact of new runways at Heathrow and Gatwick airports before construction begins.

A report from the Commons Environmental Audit Committee suggests current policies are not sufficient to reduce carbon emissions from aviation in line with legal targets, particularly as demand for air travel and freight is projected to increase.

This situation creates a conflict between bolstering the UK's supply chain infrastructure and adhering to climate change targets.

Economic growth and air freight capacity

The government's support for expansion projects at Heathrow and Gatwick is rooted in a strategy for economic growth.

Since the 2024 general election, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have endorsed the new runways.

The Chancellor explains the strategic importance of Heathrow, stating: ""It connects us to emerging markets all over the world, opening up new opportunities for growth. Around three quarters of all long haul flights go from Heathrow.

""Over 60% of UK air freight comes through Heathrow. And about 15 million business travellers use Heathrow in 2023.”

However, the committee's report challenges this economic-first approach.

""The government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to,"" the report states.

The critique highlights a central tension for supply chain leaders: while expanded airport capacity could mean more efficient logistics, the associated environmental costs and regulatory risks are significant.

John McDonnell, Labour’s MP for Hayes and Harlington, commented on the Heathrow expansion, calling it a “huge political, economic and especially environmental mistake”.

Sustainable aviation fuel and logistical hurdles

The government's ""jet zero"" strategy for greener aviation relies heavily on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The committee doubts this approach, noting that SAF is not produced at a commercial scale large enough to offset emissions from airport expansion.

These concerns are highlighted by real-world examples, such as Air New Zealand's decision last year to abandon its 2030 decarbonisation target due to difficulties in procuring SAF.

It demonstrates the challenges faced by the global aviation sector in securing a stable and affordable supply of alternative fuels, a critical factor for the long-term sustainability of supply chains.

Outdated policy and investment uncertainty

The expansion projects are set to proceed before the government updates its airports national policy statement, which dates back to 2018.

The committee argues this allows the government to avoid proper scrutiny and base decisions on a framework that is not aligned with current climate objectives.

This policy lag creates uncertainty for businesses that depend on air freight and long-term infrastructure planning.

Toby Perkins, the Labour Chair of the committee, warns that decarbonisation already represents a challenge.

""Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder,"" Toby says. ""Under the government's existing 'jet zero' strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk.""

Alethea Warrington, Head of Aviation at climate charity Possible, describes the report as the ""final nail in the coffin"" for the government's case.

She says: ""The government's scrutiny committee has made it clearer than ever that airport growth is a bad option for Britain, and that the government simply doesn't have any economic evidence to justify the environmental devastation this would cause.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/10f3a912f5b872a0930165add8b4405b:04c0090e6985de475def6ea019635a21/gettyimages-2197839670.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 12:00:17.188446

OJ Sanchez, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, said, ""We are thrilled to achieve the first flight of the X-59. This aircraft is a testament to the innovation and expertise of our joint team, and we are proud to be at the forefront of quiet supersonic technology development.""

The X-59 is a supersonic aircraft designed to demonstrate the ability to fly at supersonic speeds while reducing the sonic boom to a gentle thump. In doing so, the X-59 aims to overcome one of the primary barriers to supersonic commercial flight, which is currently restricted over land due to noise concerns. The X-59's successful development and flight testing will inform the establishment of new data-driven acceptable noise thresholds related to supersonic commercial flight over land, paving the way for a new generation of supersonic aircraft that can efficiently and sustainably transport passengers and cargo twice as fast as aircraft today.

Skunk Works will continue to lead the aircraft's initial flight test campaign, working closely with NASA to expand the X-59's flight envelope over the coming months. Part of this test journey will include the X-59's first supersonic flights, where the aircraft will achieve the optimal speed and altitude for a quiet boom.

As the collaboration matured, ICAO would introduce other financing partners to expand the concept, the report said.

The launch of the Finvest initiative came against a backdrop of growing industry concerns about insufficient production of SAF and other low carbon aviation products, the high costs to airlines of procuring the fuels and uneven access to supplies as global demand for air travel continues to soar, Greenair News wrote.

“This launch marks a significant milestone in aviation’s net zero carbon emission journey,” ICAO’s secretary general Juan Carlos Salazar was quoted as saying.

“It is a … gateway between project developers and financiers.”

The Finvest initiative was part of a four-point Global Framework for SAF, that was agreed by ICAO member states at the third Conference on Aviation and Alternative Fuels (CAAF/3) held in Dubai in 2023.

ICAO member states agreed at the meeting to a 2030 vision of “an aspirational global interim goal” of a 5% reduction in the carbon intensity of aviation fuel. In addition to financing, the plan focused on policy and planning, regulatory frameworks and implementation support.

According to its website, ICAO and its 193 member states develop and implement global aviation strategies, technical standards and capacity building activities to enhance the safety, sustainability and inclusivity of air services worldwide.

IRENA is the primary inter-governmental agency responsible for the global transition to renewable-based energy.

Running from 17 to 21 November at Dubai World Central, the 19th edition will gather airports, OEMs, regulators, operators and energy partners to accelerate adoption of cleaner technology.

Dubai Airports, Airbus, Boeing, the World Economic Forum, Airports Council International and the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority are among the confirmed participants.

Dubai Airports’ Director of Sustainability, Sven Deckers, said the industry has entered a delivery rather than a planning phase, noting that sustainability is “no longer about future ambition, it is a current necessity” and that the Airshow provides the right forum to turn shared goals into action.

Real-world green operations

A new feature will spotlight how lower-carbon aircraft turnaround can work in practice. The oneDXB Sustainability Alliance, led by Dubai Airports with dnata, flydubai and service providers, will run live demonstrations showing near-term solutions for greener ground operations at DXB and DWC.

This guided tour presents equipment and processes expected to be on their way into the market, showing a step-by-step approach to cutting emissions on the apron through joint industry action, rather than isolated initiatives.

SAF and cleaner show operations

Sustainable aviation fuel will once again be available for aircraft taking part in flying and static displays, supplied in partnership with Jetex, the same company, which began offering SAF to private aviation customers in the UAE in 2023.

Chief Executive Adel Mardini noted, that supplying SAF at the Airshow forms part of a collective industry effort to decarbonise aviation, and that strategy stems on reducing emissions through practical adoption of cleaner energy sources.

Show operations are also being adapted. Electric and propane-powered ground support equipment will be used across the site to limit emissions generated during the show’s peformances.

Expanded sustainability conference

The Airshow’s sustainability conference has been extended to two days and will cover topics including SAF scale-up, next-generation fuels, airport decarbonisation, green finance and technology investment.

Confirmed speakers include ACI World Director General Justin Erbacci, GACA Executive Vice President for Aviation Safety and Environmental Sustainability Captain Sulaiman Almuhaimedi, and Dubai Airports’ Sven Deckers.

Airbus said it views the show as an important platform to advance joint pathways, with the company’s Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Carbon Dioxide Removal, Julien Manhes, emphasising the value of partnerships in accelerating the industry’s transition.

Boeing repeats this stance. Jeff Shockey, the company’s Executive Vice President for Government Operations, Public Policy and Corporate Strategy, said Dubai Airshow 2025 comes at a time of progress for the sector in the region, and that Boeing remains focused on commercially viable solutions that support sustainable aviation growth.

Greener exhibition model

Sustainability efforts will extend well beyond the runway and show floor. This year’s edition is set to overhaul how major trade events operate in Dubai, with organisers pushing to make the Airshow itself a working model for lower-impact exhibitions.

The Better Stands Programme returns with a stronger mandate for reusable and modular builds, aiming to reduce single-use construction materials that typically end up in landfill after large events.

Exhibition halls, chalets and feature zones will run on 100% renewable electricity and prioritise recycled or reusable materials throughout.

Operational changes are also being scaled up. Solar-powered maintenance cabins will rise by 50% compared with the last edition, and visitors will be offered lower-emission transport options across the city to reduce event-related travel emissions.

Finally, even attendee habits are being targeted. Airbus-backed hydration stations from Bluewater-Nia will remove single-use plastic bottles from the venue, while Rove Hotels steps in as official partner with LEED Gold-certified accommodation.

The 42nd International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly closed on October 3, 2025.

In the fragmented, competitive world of aviation, the race to harmonize global sustainability policies has never been more vital.

The international aviation community is flying through heavy crosswinds, but its flight path to net zero, for the moment, seems to remain unaltered.

The 42nd International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly closed on October 3, 2025, in Montreal.

During these triennial assemblies, delegations from up to 193 states convene to review and set ICAO priorities, budget and goals. This year’s Assembly has been particularly closely watched as it was the first meeting after the previous Assembly’s landmark commitment for international aviation to achieve net zero by 2050.

During the preceding General Assembly in 2022, ICAO had agreed on a Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It also consolidated the implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as the first global sectoral market-based scheme for international aviation, which has seen the pool of voluntary states’ participation increase from 88 in 2021 to 130 today.

With a shifting geopolitical context that has been de-prioritizing climate policies, concerns that international sustainable aviation ambitions might be toned down were legitimate. This triennial Assembly, however, demonstrated a global consensus on environmental topics and succeeded in reaffirming the commitment of ICAO Member States to the LTAG.

Non-sustainability items were also the Assembly’s core focus. To address emerging risks, such as recent air transport incidents, increased geopolitical tensions and armed conflicts, and the multiplication of new forms of cybersecurity threats, ICAO states committed to enhancing the global safety and security framework for aviation, in line with ICAO’s long-term aspiration of zero fatalities worldwide.

What was agreed on sustainable air transportation during this Assembly?

Following the adoption of the LTAG, the efforts of ICAO over the last three years have been focused on the implementation of pragmatic measures to achieve this goal. These include:

The adoption of new carbon emissions and noise stringent standards for new aircraft type designs and in-production aircraft types.

The adoption of a robust monitoring and reporting methodology to track progress towards the LTAG (LTAG Monitoring and Reporting Methodology).

The Endorsement of the ICAO Global Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) and other Aviation Cleaner Energies, ICAO’s plan to achieve a 5% CO2 emissions reduction in international aviation by 2030 on the path towards this net-zero aspirational goal by 2050.

Support for accelerated investment in clean technology solutions through the operationalization of ICAO’s Finvest Hub, a platform that connects project developers, financiers and government institutions to bridge the gap between aviation decarbonization projects and the required capital to deploy them, with a specific focus on SAF.

The renewed commitment to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), the world’s only global market-based measure for international aviation.

The extension of the ICAO ACT-SAF (its capability building programme to support countries as they explore SAF) to an ACT-LTAG programme, aimed at providing assistance and implementation support for all emissions reduction measures (including operational and infrastructural measures).

The emphasized attention to climate change adaptation and resilience with support to further action on adaptation.

What is the World Economic Forum doing to reduce aviation's carbon footprint?

As other sectors proceed to decarbonize, the aviation sector could account for a much higher share of global greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century than its 2%-3% share today.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) can reduce the life-cycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel by up to 80%, but they currently make up less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption. Enabling a shift from fossil fuels to SAFs will require a significant increase in production, which is a costly investment.

The Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow (CST) Coalition is a global initiative driving the transition to sustainable aviation fuels as part of the aviation industry’s ambitious efforts to achieve carbon-neutral flying.

Loading...

The coalition brings together government leaders, climate experts and CEOs from aviation, energy, finance and other sectors who agree on the urgent need to help the aviation industry reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The coalition aims to advance the commercial scale of viable production of sustainable low-carbon aviation fuels (bio and synthetic) for broad adoption in the industry by 2030.

The Airports of Tomorrow’s priorities were also heard

Airports Council International (ACI) World played a central role in ensuring that airports’ perspectives were fully represented in discussions shaping the future of global aviation, from air connectivity and passenger experience issues, to energy transition and sustainable economic growth. ACI World notably called on states to ensure that airports have access to sufficient reliable, renewable and affordable energy supplies. This appeal underscored the importance of coordinated national policies to help airports meet rising energy needs, while achieving long-term decarbonization targets. As aviation strives towards net-zero goals, ensuring airports can source renewable power is fundamental to maintaining resilient, efficient and sustainable operations.

Concretely, what does that mean for global aviation decarbonization ambitions?

No backtracking on current ambitions can already be considered as a positive message. Additionally, this assembly succeeded in endorsing ambitious progress to continue implementing the measures that will decarbonize the aviation sector.

The implementation of the Global Framework will be key for the future of sustainable fuels, by providing long-term, stable support to attract the necessary investments and demand needed to get them to scale.

On the back of this unaltered commitment, an increasing number of environmentally ambitious regions will likely continue to pursue and adopt decarbonization policies. This alignment is essential to avoid a global patchwork of varying sustainability ambitions.

Europe: Currently leading the way on aviation climate policies, developments on CORSIA – and whether EU legislators will judge it ambitious enough – will impact the upcoming review of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). This might broaden the number of routes subject to carbon pricing, while transportation modes battle each other over which will draw the most support out of the upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).

US: On the other side of the Atlantic, betting on incentives, rather than mandates, the US has instead relaxed some of its SAF feedstock sustainability criteria through the One Big Beautiful Act, opening the door to cheaper, but also less environmentally beneficial, fuel pathways.

Asia-Pacific (APAC): SAF policies are ramping up across several APAC countries (e.g, Singapore’s SAF levy, Australia’s Cleaner Fuels Programme unleashing $1.1 billion in incentives, mandates in Japan, Malaysia, Thailand etc.), though at a slower pace than in Europe, at least at this stage, and with less stringent approaches to feedstock sustainability criteria.

In such a fragmented world of aviation decarbonization policies and a fiercer than ever competitive environment, the race to harmonize global sustainability policies has never felt more essential.

Within an increasingly shifting and unstable geopolitical environment, the international aviation community is increasingly flying through heavy crosswinds, but its flight path to net zero for the moment seems to have remained unaltered.

For ship operators, these “drop-in” fuels offer a cost-efficient, lower-carbon alternative to traditional heavy fuel oil. With a higher energy density than many existing biofuels, the renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s operational range without the need for expensive engine modifications.

“Honeywell continues to innovate in areas where our customers need solutions most,” said Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions. “The maritime sector requires renewable fuels that are both readily available and affordable. Our Biocrude Upgrading technology can be deployed in modular form, delivering savings from installation through refining and end use.”

The technology allows plant and agricultural waste to be converted into lower-carbon biocrude at feedstock collection sites, minimizing transport costs. This biocrude can then be refined at major facilities to produce marine fuel, gasoline, or SAF, overcoming long-standing challenges in achieving fuel performance comparable to conventional products.

Honeywell’s Biocrude Upgrading process can be implemented as a prefabricated modular plant, helping customers reduce risk and speed up project timelines by simplifying construction.

The launch comes as shipping companies face growing pressure from both regulations and customers to cut carbon emissions.

The industry group recently submitted a letter to members of the European Commission arguing that this targeted mechanism is crucial for de-risking investments and accelerating the production of Europe’s most sustainable drop-in aviation fuel.

Background: SASHA and the STIP

The need for this intervention arises from the EU’s overarching goals to decarbonize transport, particularly aviation and maritime sectors, which are hard-to-electrify.

The SASHA Coalition (Skies and Seas Hydrogen-fuels Accelerator Coalition) is an alliance bringing together leading companies across the green shipping and aviation ecosystems. The Coalition advocates for EU and UK policies that support the development and commercialization of sustainable green hydrogen energy solutions. SASHA’s research indicates that green hydrogen is essential for all pathways to truly sustainable fuels in these sectors.

The target of SASHA’s lobbying effort, the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), is expected to be a major pillar of the Clean Industrial Deal, announced in the first half of 2025. The STIP aims to scale and prioritize investments for decarbonizing all EU transport modes. Expected for publication in late 2025, the plan will focus on reducing risks for private investments in renewable and low-carbon fuels and enhancing the EU’s strategic autonomy.

EU Advocacy Manager at the SASHA Coalition, Delphine Kaczorowski, summarized the impact of the STIP by saying:

“The STIP could mark a watershed moment for European clean flight innovation, but only if it targets the most promising solutions including e-kerosene, the most sustainable and scalable drop-in alternative fuel. A book-and-claim system could be a crucial tool for unlocking clean competitive aviation, but including all alternative fuels would dilute impact and divert incentives to biofuels that are less sustainable, less competitive at scale, and less in need of support.

When strategically limited to e-kerosene, book-and-claim can help Europe’s boldest clean aviation innovators overcome the market failures holding them back.”

Book-and-Claim: Unlocking the E-SAF Market

E-kerosene, or synthetic aviation fuel (e-SAF), produced using renewable hydrogen, is recognized as the most scalable and sustainable alternative drop-in jet fuel. Despite Europe holding over half of the global production capacity for this fuel, producers are struggling to secure the final investment decisions (FID) needed to scale up.

This difficulty is exacerbated by high capital costs and a geographical mismatch: producers are often located where renewable energy capacity is abundant, while early buyers are concentrated in larger aviation hubs.

A well-regulated book-and-claim system provides a solution by allowing the physical e-SAF to be sold to one buyer and its certified green attributes (or credentials) to be sold separately to another buyer.

The SASHA Coalition highlights several ways a well-regulated B&C system would improve the European e-SAF market:

De-risking Investment: By widening the pool of viable buyers and allowing producers to overcome geographical restrictions, B&C helps achieve revenue stability, thereby lowering the risk premium on investment and giving investors the financial certainty needed to reach FID.

Increased Market Access and Reduced Costs: Separating the physical fuel from its sustainability characteristics expands market access for producers and reduces the costs and carbon emissions associated with transporting the physical e-SAF over long distances.

Regulatory Compliance: For aircraft operators (offtakers), B&C would increase the pool of e-SAF producers available to them, making compliance with ReFuelEU Aviation targets easier.

Strategic Limitations to Prevent Dilution

In July of this year, the SASHA Coalition emphasized that B&C is not a “silver bullet” but a transformative complement to other revenue certainty mechanisms like Contracts for Difference (CfD). Crucially, the system must be strictly regulated to ensure it drives Europe’s Clean Industrial Deal goals and supports the nascent e-kerosene industry rather than unintentionally boosting less sustainable alternatives.

Accordingly, the letter outlines three necessary criteria for the B&C system:

Exclusively for E-kerosene/E-SAF: This targets support toward the most sustainable but least mature alternative drop-in fuel, ensuring impact is not diluted and incentives are not diverted toward more easily available biofuels. Biofuels are currently more competitive and require less de-risking support than e-SAF.

Operates Only Within the EEA: Limiting the scope to the European Economic Area concentrates competitiveness gains and industrial innovation among European producers, supporting long-term energy security.

Timebound with an End-Date: A fixed end date is necessary to ensure market actors remain incentivized to invest in the physical supply chain infrastructure needed for long-term distributed access to e-SAF across the EU.

The Non-CO2 Climate Impact

While the primary focus of e-SAF adoption is the reduction of CO2 emissions, the broader transition to clean technologies in aviation holds additional environmental benefits. The STIP is encouraged to support the development and adoption of zero-carbon emission technologies by investing in hydrogen infrastructure in airports and green Public Service Obligation (PSO) routes. Investment in alternative propulsion systems, such as electric or hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft, is essential because these technologies offer the additional benefit of mitigating both CO2 and non-CO2 climate impacts. This focus aligns with the objective to clean up and modernize transport to meet future environmental demands.

Cutting aviation taxes, fees and charges would mean throwing away billions in public revenues without a tangible effect on passenger numbers.
But current minor variations in national taxes, charges and fees do not show a strong correlation with demand.","Aviation demand is primarily driven by airline strategies and travel trends, economists say.

A new study by two economists, commissioned by green group T&E, shows that aviation demand depends mostly on airline strategy and market trends, such as changed travel behaviour. This refutes airlines’ claims that national aviation taxes and fees are solely responsible for driving passengers away, says T&E.

The study looks at the relationship between location-based costs and passenger volumes for 101 European airports in 2024 [1]. Findings show that airports with low costs do not guarantee higher passenger numbers. In fact, airports with higher costs tend to have more passengers. Heathrow Airport for example has the highest location-based costs but also the highest passenger numbers in Europe. Consequently, the study finds there is only a weak correlation between costs and passenger numbers in this order of magnitude of taxation [2]. This is also shown by a further analysis of the relationship between changes in ticket prices and changes in passenger numbers to date, which again only found a weak correlation. Hubs, international agreements, and market strategies are more likely to determine whether an airport is important and being served.

Marte van der Graaf, aviation officer at T&E, says: “Airlines are trying to tell an easy story by blaming location costs for decreased demand. But this is just a campaign to cut taxes and fees. Demand for flying is not such a simple numbers game. In reality, strategic decisions by airlines, trends in travel behaviour, and airline business models influence passenger numbers, rather than costs alone.”

Historically, increased prices in air travel have not curbed demand. In Germany, for example, the 2019 jet fuel price was twice as high as in 2000, but in the same period passenger numbers grew by 75%. Demand in aviation is instead mainly determined by supply. Airlines set their flight schedules months in advance and then fill seats by adjusting prices. Associated costs like hotel expenses could also affect demand, the study suggests.

Reduced passenger demand could also be linked to the global decline in business travel after the COVID pandemic. T&E's Travel Smart Campaign finds that business travel by the world’s biggest companies fell by 34% between 2019 and 2023. Meanwhile, leisure travel is growing in dominance. While business travellers usually fly to economic centres, leisure travel is concentrated towards holiday destinations, increasing air travel to southern European countries by 10 to 20% in 2025, compared to 2019. Overall, trends in travel behavior tend to have a greater impact on passenger demand than taxation and other costs.

T&E recommends national governments not to cap or reduce levies. Cutting aviation taxes, fees and charges would mean throwing away billions in public revenues without a tangible effect on passenger numbers. National ticket taxes should be designed to reflect economic externalities, i.e. the most climate-damaging tickets should have the highest taxes. This means higher tax rates for first and business class tickets and higher tax rates for long haul flights.

“Airlines tirelessly blame levies for their billion-dollar business not doing as well as usual. If taxes and fees were lowered now, it would simply be a gift to the airlines, while emptying national budgets from much needed money. The revenue from fair taxation could be invested in sustainable aviation fuel.”, concludes van der Graaf.

[1] The study by economists Prof. Friedrich Thießen and Prof. Christoph Brützel analyzed costs for airports arising from national levies and compared the number of passengers traveling to and from these airports. It was factored in if the airport type changes results. Also, it was verified that a traditional price elasticity analysis is not reliable in aviation. The study amplifies a DLR study from April 2025.

[2] With proper taxation, which would imply another order of magnitude of cost increases, aviation taxation could become a demand management tool.

With air traffic almost back to pre-COVID levels, aviation could account for up to 20% of global emissions by 2050 without stronger decarbonisation measures.

Recognising this challenge, the commercial aviation sector has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, the industry must scale low-carbon fuels alongside efficiency improvements in aircraft and operations. Among these solutions, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as one of the most immediate and scalable pathways to cut emissions from air travel.

This guide unpacks what sustainable aviation fuel is, how it reduces emissions, and where agriculture fits in — as both a source of renewable feedstocks and a driver of regional opportunity.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from non-fossil sources such as:

Oilseeds (e.g., canola, soybeans, sunflower, safflower)

Agricultural residues (e.g., sugarcane trash, stubble)

Dedicated energy crops (e.g., pongamia)

Waste products (e.g., tallow, used cooking oils)

READ MORE: Get on board: Experts urge Australia to prepare for sustainable aviation fuel take-off

Chemically, SAF is almost identical to conventional jet fuel, meaning it can be a drop-in replacement that works with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure. It can also be mixed in with conventional jet fuel with no impact on performance, with the current regulations allowing for up to a 50% blend.

What makes SAF sustainable is its feedstock origin. Instead of drawing carbon from underground fossil reserves, it relies on biogenic carbon (carbon already cycling through plants, residues, or waste streams.) By turning agricultural by-products or renewable crops into fuel, SAF links aviation to the circular bioeconomy: keeping carbon in motion rather than adding new emissions to the atmosphere.

How does Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduce emissions?

SAF lowers aviation emissions across its entire lifecycle, not just at the point of combustion. Lifecycle assessments show it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on feedstock and production pathway.

The key difference lies in its carbon cycle. Fossil fuels release carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years, adding new CO₂ to the atmosphere. SAF reuses carbon already cycling through the biosphere, absorbed by plants during growth.

While most of SAF’s emission savings occur during the feedstock phase, additional reductions come from:

Cleaner production pathways: Renewable conversion technologies (such as HEFA, Fischer–Tropsch, and Alcohol-to-Jet) consume less energy than petroleum refining, lowering upstream emissions.

Avoiding methane emissions from decomposing organic waste.

Integrating feedstock systems with regenerative agriculture: improving soil carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, while linking aviation to broader decarbonisation goals.

By combining lifecycle emissions savings with the practical advantage of drop-in fuel, SAF offers a scalable near-term solution that connects agriculture, innovation, and aviation in a single circular system.

READ MORE: Agriculture’s role as a vital climate solution

Agricultural feedstocks: A new opportunity for farmers?

As demand for renewable aviation fuel grows, agriculture is emerging as a critical enabler. Many SAF pathways rely on bio-based feedstocks, creating new markets for underutilised or undervalued materials produced on farms.

Potential agricultural feedstocks include:

Crop and forestry residues such as stubble, husks, and straw

Waste oils and fats from food processing or livestock rendering

Energy crops like pongamia that can grow on marginal land.

For farmers, this shift opens diversification opportunities, turning waste into value through a new bio-industrial supply chain. In Australia, emerging projects such as Jet Zero’s ‘Regions to the Runway’ are exploring SAF potential through integrated feedstock supply, regional biorefineries, and logistics networks, with the end goal of positioning our country for domestic fuel security and export advantage.

Benefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Climate and emissions reduction

SAF represents one of the most practical near-term pathways for decarbonising long-haul aviation. Each litre of SAF used directly displaces fossil jet fuel, reducing net CO₂ emissions and helping airlines meet their net zero targets and commitments.

Diversification for rural economies

Developing SAF supply chains can stimulate regional industries, from feedstock aggregation and pre-processing to biorefining and logistics. This diversification offers new income streams, creates jobs and strengthens community resilience – and fosters collaboration between the agriculture and energy sectors.

Compatibility with existing infrastructure

Because SAF can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, it integrates seamlessly into today’s fuel systems and aircraft. This drop-in capability gives it a major advantage over alternative technologies that require entirely new engines or refuelling infrastructure.

Challenges and limitations of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF faces several challenges on the route to reaching its potential:

Cost: SAF is currently two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, due largely to the limited availability of sustainable feedstocks, the continuing development of new production technologies, and limited commercial-scale production capacity

Feedstock competition: SAF must deliver around two thirds of the sector’s emissions reductions if it is to reach net zero by 2050. That requires production of around 450 billion litres per year. In 2025, it is expected to reach 2.1 billion litres – just 0.5% of the volume needed by 2050. But scaling production could increase pressure on land and water resources, unless waste and residue-based sources are prioritised.

Scaling uptake: SAF production currently represents less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel use.

Policy uncertainty: Long-term investment depends on stable policy, certification frameworks, clear sustainability criteria, and incentives to de-risk capital flows into new biorefineries.

These challenges underscore the importance of continued innovation in both feedstock supply and fuel conversion technologies – areas where agrifood research and collaboration can deliver transformative breakthroughs.

Powering cleaner skies with agriculture in the driving seat

Renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity increased just 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024, less than one-third of the growth observed in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, only two capacity additions came online, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and the new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield.

With the completed conversion, the Rodeo plant has a capacity of 767 million gal/y, up from 180 million gal/y in last year’s report. This increase makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the United States, behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

U.S. capacity growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138-million-gal/y Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities. Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively. Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy closed plants in Mobile, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, respectively.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at four facilities reflects changes to biofuel margins and petroleum refining margins since 2020. Low refinery margins and rising biofuel credit values in 2020 and 2021 prompted a wave of renewable diesel capacity announcements. As more of those plants started operations, biofuel production began exceeding target volumes, and biofuel credit values and margins decreased in 2023. At the same time, petroleum refinery margins were much stronger than their 2020 lows, resulting in a slowdown in investments to expand renewable diesel capacity for the upcoming years.

A notable shift in 2024 was the increased focus on SAF. SAF is an alternative to petroleum jet fuel that we capture in our other biofuels category. Other biofuels includes SAF, renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels. We combine other biofuels with renewable diesel capacity because other biofuels are mostly produced at renewable diesel plants as byproducts or, often in the case of SAF, in place of renewable diesel. Following the completion of conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can shift about 150 million gal/y of its renewable diesel production capacity to SAF, and Diamond Green Diesel can shift about 235 million gal/y to SAF.

Biodiesel

In addition to slower growth in renewable diesel production capacity, biodiesel production capacity decreased slightly. In 2024, eight biodiesel plants closed due to poor margins, resulting in a loss of about 100 million gal/y of production capacity.

Fuel ethanol

Unlike renewable diesel and biodiesel, U.S. fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in previous years. Fuel ethanol accounts for 73% of all biofuels production capacity, with a total of almost 18.5 billion gallons of capacity per year. Most of this production is concentrated in Midwest states, where corn is produced for feedstock. Because U.S. fuel ethanol consumption has been somewhat flat in recent years, the increased capacity is mostly contributing to growing exports of ethanol.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/agenda/ampliada/b/biofuelchart.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 03:01:45.437270

Sum cited the normalisation of crude oil and jet fuel market structures, which is expected to lift trading profitability, as well as “persistent regional price differentials” that should continue to create arbitrage opportunities.

“Together, these trends underpin our earnings projections, which are 12 to 18 per cent above consensus,” he said in a note.

SPIA is the sole supplier of jet fuel at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and is one-third owned by CAO.

Sum added that the group’s early strategic positioning in sustainable aviation fuel also provides “compelling medium-term growth optionality”.

Thailand’s first standard for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) specifications is expected to be released this month and enforced next year, starting at 1% and increasing to 8% by 2036. The move aims to decarbonize the aviation sector in line with international measures and support the country’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Industry and government align as Thailand prepares for SAF takeoff

As the SAF standard nears launch, the industry is gearing up to build a full supply chain, from raw materials to jet fuel. Thailand’s leading biofuel producer, Bangchak, inaugurated a dedicated facility for 100% neat SAF in April, with an initial production capacity of 1 million liters per day.

The company has signed agreements with local governments and food and beverage companies to collect used cooking oil as feedstock, while its subsidiary, BBGI (Bio-Based Green Innovation), is exploring algae-based SAF to diversify future sources.

PTT Global Chemical (PTTGC), the state-owned petroleum and LNG company, produced its first batch of SAF from used cooking oil in January and plans to expand production to 24 million litres per year in the future. The company has also formed strategic partnerships with Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways to collaborate on the research, development, and adoption of SAF.

Complementing these industry efforts, the Thai government has partnered with private and industrial sectors to strengthen the SAF supply chain. Six companies have joined the initiative, including Central Group, Thai Beverage, Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thai President Foods, the Thai Food Processors Association, and Bangchak Corporation.

Under the country’s Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP 2024), Thailand aims for 675 million liters of SAF consumption by 2037, equivalent to 1.85 million liters per day of neat SAF.

ASEAN joins the global push for SAF

The push for SAF is gaining momentum across ASEAN, with countries advancing at different stages of policy and market readiness. Singapore has emerged as the region’s frontrunner, combining clear policy targets with strategic industrial planning. On Oct. 14, the country passed the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, paving the way for a green fuel levy on all departing passengers to ensure SAF makes up at least 1% of total jet fuel use by 2026.

Malaysia is another key player, leading the region with at least eight active projects in refinery construction and feedstock development. The country delivered its first locally blended SAF in September, marking the start of continuous, scalable production and targeting 1% SAF use by 2027.

Globally, the European Union has set one of the most ambitious benchmarks, mandating 6% SAF use by 2030 under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative. Although SAF currently costs about three times more than fossil-based jet fuel, penalties for non-compliance are roughly three times the cost of compliance, according to an analysis by Carbon Direct, underscoring how seriously governments are enforcing these mandates.

As global momentum for decarbonization builds, Thailand is positioning itself to stay on board the global SAF transition. The country has an abundance of raw materials suitable for SAF production, supporting the government’s ambition to establish Thailand as a regional aviation hub, said Sarawut Kaewtathip, director-general of the Department of Energy Business.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is no longer a speculative solution—it’s now a strategic offering. For United Cargo, expanding access to SAF isn’t a side initiative, but the backbone of its commercial and environmental approach in Asia Pacific.

With the region’s freight volumes rising and regulatory pressure mounting, United is prioritising SAF engagement with enterprise shippers in Southeast Asia. “Our main priority is expanding access to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the most effective tool available today to reduce aviation emissions,” United Cargo told Air Cargo Week.

United’s sustainability pitch to its APAC customer base is grounded in operational tools, not vague targets. “Through United’s Eco-Skies Alliance, we give APAC-based customers the opportunity to participate directly in SAF purchases on both annual and multi-year agreements, allowing them to embed lower-carbon solutions into their supply chains”.

This direct purchasing model reflects growing demand from logistics buyers facing stricter emissions reporting and Scope 3 requirements. In parallel, United is backing SAF production itself. “At the same time, United Airlines Ventures, our corporate venture fund, is investing in innovative SAF producers and technologies, helping ensure that today’s commitments also build the future supply our industry needs.”

SAF access is just one part of a broader emissions strategy now embedded across the cargo business. “United Cargo has launched a dedicated sustainability group to drive progress across our operations. This team is fostering a culture of continuous improvement, advancing initiatives such as recycling programs, incorporating trucking emissions into our reporting, and embedding ESG requirements into our partnerships.”

The airline’s sustainability lens is both pragmatic and infrastructure-focused. “Our approach is both practical and forward-looking: scaling proven solutions like SAF and emissions transparency, while developing the culture, partnerships, and digital tools that will define the next generation of sustainable cargo.”

Southeast Asia network gains

United’s sustainability investments come as its physical footprint in Southeast Asia expands. The carrier is re-entering key offline markets and doubling down on existing ones. “United is continuing its expansion in Southeast Asia by introducing new and additional nonstop services to destinations such as Thailand, Vietnam, and further increasing its presence in the Philippines,” Mirco Renfer, Cargo VP APAC – United Airlines said.

“United is now resuming direct flights to Vietnam and Thailand, transitioning from being offline. Additionally, we are doubling our capacity with twice-daily flights to Manila, Philippines.”

Growth isn’t limited to Southeast Asia. “In Australia, United is launching a new flight to Adelaide from San Francisco on 11th December 2025,” the airline confirmed. Meanwhile, capacity is being adjusted across developed North Asian markets: “The focus remains on enhancing connectivity within Asia, ensuring the right capacity is allocated to key markets like Japan, where larger demand necessitates increased capacity.”

This expansion complements strong revenue performance across the region. “In 2025, United Cargo’s revenue rose 3.8 percent year-over-year. APAC is a large driver of that increase with the growth that the airline has seen across the Pacific region.”

The ramp-up of dedicated service reflects changing cargo patterns and demand. “Regardless of the size or cargo potential, the United network ensures representation and operations within the region.”

Freight mix shifting, ESG rising

The region’s freight profile is also evolving. “The primary drivers of demand in APAC include semiconductors, automotive devices, electronics, apparel, perishables, and most recently, lots of products for AI,” said Renfer.

These verticals, often under investor pressure to decarbonise, are likely to see growing alignment with SAF-based logistics solutions—particularly as international reporting frameworks tighten. United’s pitch is geared towards this shift, offering emissions reduction not just through operations, but through the productisation of SAF.

That approach may differentiate United in a field where many carriers still treat SAF as a long-term goal rather than a near-term deliverable.

The Commercial Court has provided useful clarification on the timing for an appeal against an arbitration award to be brought in the context of a FOSFA arbitration process. The claimant had issued its claim form containing an appeal under section 69 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (“AA 1996”) on 8 May 2025, which was 28 days after the claimant received the award on 10 April 2025. However, the award was issued and dated 26 March 2025. Section 70(3) AA 1996 requires that an appeal be brought within 28 days of the date of the award, or where there has been any arbitral process of appeal or review, the date when the applicant was notified of the result of that process. The award to be challenged was an appeal to the FOSFA Board of Appeal against the FOSFA first tier tribunal decision. The court rejected an argument that time ran from when that decision was received by the claimant. The second limb of section 70(3) only applied where the award to be appealed was the underlying one subject to the appeal process (in this case the first tier decision). Here, the decision to be appealed was the Board of Appeal decision in relation to which the second limb did not arise. Further, the court refused to grant an extension of time on the basis that the error was not forgivable. The appeal was out of time.

Landlord and tenant

Mentmore Greenland Ltd (“Greenland”) was lessee of a golf course, the freeholder and lessor was Mr Gaymer and the mortgagee was Mentmore Golf Investments Ltd (“Investments”). Mr Gaymer sought forfeiture of the lease for breach of repairing obligations and obtained a possession order. Both Greenland and Investments unsuccessfully applied for relief from forfeiture, but only Investments appealed that decision. The Chancery Court held, allowing the appeal on this point, that the application for relief from forfeiture had been made in time as required by section 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925 because it had been made after the possession order was made but before it was executed. However, the court dismissed the appeal overall on the basis that it was an abuse of process. Both Investments and Greenland, and the litigation were controlled by Mr Halabi and there was a pattern of abusive litigation to avoid paying sums owed and to keep the golf course. Investments was not an independent mortgagee protecting its rights and could have taken steps far earlier.

Insurance

In the context of claims for indemnification brought by Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Limited (“RSA”) under reinsurance policies against Equitas Insurance Limited (“Equitas”), the Commercial Court has provided guidance on the relationship between follow the settlements clauses and claims cooperation clauses. Both clauses are common in reinsurance policies. A claims cooperation clause requires the primary insurer (here RSA) to cooperate with the reinsurers (here Equitas) in respect of significant losses likely to fall under the reinsurance policy. A follow the settlement clause binds the reinsurers to follow the settlement agreed by the primary insurers. The court looked at the natural and ordinary meaning of the words and concluded that the two clauses could be read consistently with each other. Equitas was bound by the settlements under the primary policies, but in any event had agreed to the course RSA adopted. Further, it had failed to prove that RSA did not take proper and businesslike steps.

Following Nigeria’s successful application to set aside two arbitration awards made in favour of the appellant (“P&ID”), a costs order was made in Nigeria’s favour. P&ID challenged this order to the UK’s highest court on the basis that it should have been made in naira, Nigeria’s national currency, rather that in sterling. P&ID asserted that awarding the costs in sterling would give Nigeria a significant windfall given the fall in the value of the naira over the last few years. The Supreme Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts and confirmed that it was appropriate to award the costs in sterling. Nigeria’s lawyers had submitted invoices in sterling and been paid in that currency. The court emphasised the discretionary nature of an order for costs and its differences from an award of damages.

Additional information is available on the U.K. Department for Transport website.","The U.K. Department for Transport on Oct. 16 confirmed it will implement a revenue certainty mechanism for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the form of an aviation fuel supplier levy. The agency is currently seeking public comments regarding implementation details.

The revenue certainty scheme aims to reduce financial risks for emerging SAF producers and complements the U.K.’s SAF mandate, which came into force Jan. 1, 2025. By law, SAF must now account for at least 2% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the U.K. The mandate is set to expand to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

The Department for Transport in March 2025 opened a public consultation on the proposed scheme in March 2025. Following that public comment period, the agency confirmed the SAF revenue certainty mechanism will be funded by industry via a variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers, which will be based on their market share of fossil-based aviation turbine fuel. Parties that are subject to an obligation under the SAF mandate will be liable to pay a level to ensure reduced administrative burden.

The Department for Transport is now seeking public comments regarding the specific design features of the aviation fuel supplier levy. This includes how it could be calculated; the length, frequency and sequence of when the levy is calculated, collected and paid; the use forecasts to provide certainty for industry; and actions to address over-collection, surpluses and under-collection of the levy.

The public consultation on the levy design is open through Jan. 8, 2026.

Biofuels capacity growth slowed last year

Capacity growth for U.S. biofuel production slowed in 2024, the Energy Information Administration said in a report this week. It found that production capacity rose by a modest 3% from the start of 2024 to the start of 2025, based on the agency’s latest biofuels production capacity reports.

Most of the slowdown was due to a deceleration in production capacity in renewable diesel and other biofuels. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane make virtually all other biofuels, the EIA said.

Production capacity for renewable diesel and other biofuels increased just 391 million gallons a year in 2024, less than a third of the growth seen in 2022 and 2023, the report said. Only two capacity additions came online in 2024, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and a new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield. The conversion gave the Rodeo plant a capacity of 767 million gallons a year, up from 180 million the previous year, and makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the U.S. after Diamond Green Diesel’s 982 million gallon-a-year plant in Norco, Louisiana.

Growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138 million gallon-a-year Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities, the EIA noted: Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively; Vertex Energy closed its Mobile, Alabama, plant and Jaxon Energy closed its Jackson, Mississippi facility.

The pace of capacity additions for U.S. biofuel production slowed sharply in 2024. According to the latest Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports, production capacity increased by only 3% from the start of 2024 to early 2025. The report covers every category of renewable diesel, biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the country.

EIA analysts said the slowdown was most noticeable in the renewable diesel and other biofuels category. Those two segments accounted for most of the reduced expansion seen last year. The “other biofuels” category includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane, which together make up virtually all additional biofuel types currently produced in the United States.

Renewable Diesel and Other Biofuels See Limited Growth

California Projects Dominate 2024 Capacity Additions

The EIA reported that renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity rose by 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024. That increase was less than one-third of the growth recorded in 2022 and 2023. Only two projects came online during the year, both located in California: the Phillips 66 Rodeo refinery conversion and a new Renewable Fuels LLC facility in Bakersfield.

The Rodeo refinery underwent a complete conversion to produce only biofuels. Following the conversion, the plant’s capacity grew from 180 million gal/y to 767 million gal/y. This change elevated it to the second-largest renewable diesel facility in the United States, surpassed only by Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

However, those gains were partly offset by the loss of production capacity at four facilities nationwide. Monroe Energy and Chevron discontinued renewable diesel co-processing at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries. In addition, Vertex Energy closed its plant in Mobile, Alabama, and Jaxon Energy shut down operations in Jackson, Mississippi.

EIA Data Sources and Market Forces Behind the Shift

Economic Margins and Refining Trends Drive Decisions

According to the EIA’s 2025 Fuel Ethanol Plant Production Capacity Report, 2025 Biodiesel Plant Production Capacity Report, and 2025 Renewable Diesel Fuel and Other Biofuels Plant Production Capacity Report, these changes reflect broader market forces that have evolved since 2020.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at several facilities corresponds to fluctuating biofuel and petroleum refining margins. During 2020 and 2021, low refinery margins combined with high biofuel credit values spurred a wave of renewable diesel announcements. Companies rushed to convert or expand refineries to take advantage of the favorable economics.

As new plants entered production, the balance shifted. Biofuel output began to exceed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) target volumes, and both biofuel credit values and profit margins declined throughout 2023. Meanwhile, petroleum refinery margins strengthened from their 2020 lows. Those conditions prompted many refiners to slow or postpone investment in new renewable diesel projects in 2024 and beyond.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Emerges as a Priority

Refineries Shift Output Toward SAF

A notable trend in 2024 was the increased focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a renewable jet fuel alternative included in the “other biofuels” category. SAF, along with renewable heating oil, renewable gasoline, renewable naphtha, and renewable propane, represents the next phase of biofuel diversification.

The EIA groups SAF with renewable diesel because both are typically produced in the same facilities, either as byproducts or as replacement outputs when production lines shift from renewable diesel to SAF.

Following completion of the conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant gained the flexibility to shift about 150 million gal/y of renewable diesel capacity to SAF production. Likewise, Diamond Green Diesel’s Louisiana plant can divert approximately 235 million gal/y to SAF.

These capacity adjustments reflect the growing recognition that SAF offers significant growth potential as the aviation industry faces rising carbon reduction mandates and seeks scalable low-emission fuel options.

Biodiesel Capacity Contracts While Ethanol Expands

Biodiesel Declines Due to Tight Margins

Alongside renewable diesel’s slowdown, the U.S. biodiesel industry also contracted in 2024. EIA data showed that eight biodiesel plants closed during the year because of poor margins, eliminating about 100 million gal/y of capacity. This marks one of the largest single-year declines in biodiesel history and underscores how volatile feedstock prices and weaker Renewable Identification Number (RIN) values have pressured profitability.

Fuel Ethanol Growth Outpaces Other Biofuels

In contrast, fuel ethanol capacity expanded more in 2024 than in the prior two years combined. Ethanol now accounts for 73% of total U.S. biofuels capacity, reaching nearly 18.5 billion gal/y. Most ethanol plants remain concentrated in Midwestern states, particularly Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, and Minnesota, where corn serves as the dominant feedstock.

Although domestic ethanol consumption has stayed relatively stable, the EIA said the new capacity primarily supports export growth. Foreign demand—especially from Canada, Brazil, and Asia—continues to drive shipments of U.S. ethanol as global markets seek lower-carbon fuel blending components.

Biofuel Industry Outlook for 2025

EIA analysts expect modest capacity growth to continue in 2025, particularly for SAF and renewable diesel projects already under construction. Future expansion will depend heavily on policy support, including federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and on global demand for low-carbon transportation fuels.

While the sector’s 2024 slowdown reflects near-term market corrections, the long-term outlook for biofuels in the U.S. energy transition remains positive, driven by ongoing technology advances and federal decarbonization targets.",,N,,2025-10-28 19:00:21.812625

In a landmark step, the Company's 100%-owned Greenswitch Srl (""Greenswitch"") has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") with one of the World's largest integrated energy companies (the ""Group""), a publicly listed business ranked in the top 10% of the Fortune 500. This entity is a globally recognised, vertically integrated, leader in refining, petrochemicals and logistics.

Under the terms of the MOU, the Group will supply up to 80,000 tonnes per annum (""tpa"") of renewable feedstocks to the Ferrandina plant beginning 1 November 2025. These will include Palm Oil Methyl Ester (""POME""), both crude and refined, as well as Repurposed Used Cooking Oil (""RUCO""), delivered to the port of Taranto, approximately 70 kilometres (""km"") from the facility.

This guaranteed supply strengthens Ferrandina's commercial model, ensuring reliable input for the production of biodiesel and SAF while positioning Greenswitch as a cornerstone in Europe's transition to low-carbon energy.

Tolling MOU with Ludoil Energia - 50% of Plant Capacity Secured:

Greenswitch has signed an MOU with Ludoil Energia S.r.l. (""Ludoil""), based in Civitavecchia, Italy.

The agreement sets the framework for a biodiesel tolling arrangement, under which Ludoil will provide feedstock and HV will generate revenue solely from processing.

No upfront feedstock purchases are required, eliminating working capital risk.

The tolling structure is estimated to generate approximately €8 million net profit per year for HV. The other 50% of the capacity is estimated to be double that for total of €24 million net (assuming full production)

The MOU provides for:

Plant restart planned for December 2025 with full production in January 2026

Annual quantities: 80,000 tpa of biodiesel in the short term, and 40,000 tpa of SAF longer term

With 80,000 tpa already secured under this tolling framework, Ludoil alone covers 50% of the Ferrandina plant's permitted 150,000 tpa capacity, giving the Company clear revenue visibility and validating the site's strategic importance.

MOU with JEnergy S.p.A

Hydrogen Valley has also signed an MOU with JEnergy S.p.A (""JEnergy""), headquartered in Rome, Italy.

Short-term framework for the supply of biodiesel and bioliquids

Longer-term discussions on SAF and HVO supply

Supply schedule:

Start of biodiesel supply: January 2026

SAF/HVO supply: 2027 onwards

Annual agreed quantities: 10,000 tpa of biodiesel, additional bioliquids, and longer-term cooperation on SAF and HVO

Previously Announced MOUs:

NACATA Commodities

80M signed an MOU with NACATA Commodities as announced on 30 July 2025 (""NACATA""), a leading renewable energy distributor, covering:

Up to 120,000 tpa of feedstock supply

Offtake of resulting products: 40,000 tpa of esterified bioliquid and 80,000 tpa of biodiesel

Initial term: 5 years

Tecnoparco Valbasento

Greenswitch has also signed an MOU with Tecnoparco Valbasento (""Tecnoparco"") for the procurement of up to 40,000 tpa of biofuel from Greenswitch, for use in its cogeneration units.

The agreement would shorten Tecnoparco's supply chain, reduce shipping costs, and improve sustainability credentials by moving away from palm oil imports. The initial 40,000 tpa could increase if Tecnoparco's affiliate industrial operators are included.

About 80 Mile Plc:

80 Mile Plc, listed on the London AIM market under the ticker 80M, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the U.S. OTC Market under the ticker BLLYF, is an exploration and development company focused on high-grade critical metals in Tier 1 jurisdictions. With multiple projects in Greenland, as well as a developing industrial gas and biofuels business in Italy, 80 Mile offers both portfolio and commodity diversification focused on base metals, precious metals, and industrial gas while expanding into sustainable fuels and clean energy solutions in Tier 1 jurisdictions. 80 Mile's strategy is centred on advancing key projects while creating value through partnerships and strategic acquisitions.

80 Mile's acquisition of White Flame Energy and the Jameson licenses in East Greenland has positioned the Company in one of the world's most compelling undrilled hydrocarbon basins. Under its agreement with March GL, drilling of two fully funded wells is set to commence, with Pelican Acquisition Corporation's merger with Greenland Exploration valuing 80 Mile's retained 30% interest in Jameson at approximately US$92 million. This acquisition and partnership significantly expand 80 Mile's exposure to the energy sector while advancing its strategy of developing both conventional and sustainable energy opportunities.

The Disko-Nuussuaq nickel-copper-cobalt-PGE project in Greenland is a primary focus for 80 Mile, 100% owned by 80 Mile PLC. Seven priority targets exhibiting spatial characteristics indicative of potential deposits on a scale comparable to renowned mining operations such as Norilsk, Voisey's Bay, and Jinchuan, will be advanced by the Company.

The Dundas Ilmenite Project, 80 Mile's most advanced asset in northwest Greenland, is fully with a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource of 117 Mt at 6.1% ilmenite and an offshore Exploration Target of up to 530 Mt. Dundas is poised to become a major supplier of high-quality ilmenite. Recent discoveries of hard rock titanium mineralisation, with bedrock samples showing nearly double the ilmenite content of previous estimates, further enhance the project's world-class potential. 80 Mile owns 100% of the Dundas Ilmenite Project under its subsidiary Dundas Titanium A/S in Greenland.

80 Mile PLC has executed an asset purchase agreement with Amaroq Minerals Ltd. (AIM, TSXV, NASDAQ Iceland: AMRQ) to divest its 100% interest in the Kangerluarsuk zinc-lead-silver project in Greenland. Under the terms of the agreement, 80 Mile will receive US$500,000 in Amaroq shares upon completion, with a further US$1,500,000 payable in cash or shares upon the discovery of an economic deposit, defined by a JORC or NI 43-101 compliant resource that supports development.

Meanwhile, earlier this month the global warming contribution from business aviation contrails was revealed in new report published by charter broker Victor and sustainability specialist 4AIR.
The inaugural Contrails Analysis Report urges business aviation to modify flight plans to minimise contrails and airlines to publish similar studies.","Ensuring a cleaner, more sustainable business aviation industry means taking greater investment risks with technologies and new enterprises to lower emissions, according to research from University College Dublin Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School.

“Showing that the [business aviation] industry is serious about decarbonisation will make business aviation operators more appealing to lenders, allowing banks and financiers to be able to point to a reduction in emissions from the sector,” Thomas Conlon, professor of Finance from UCD Smurfit School told CJI. “In turn this allows financiers to continue to support the industry. This may help an industry which is prone to market cycles.”

While developing and adopting greener solutions in aviation is risky and expensive, the research reveals that smarter ways of managing investment risk could speed up the shift towards cleaner air travel and other hard-to-decarbonise sectors.

“The technology to support clean aviation exists, but it requires a new way of framing the relationship between risk, return and sustainability,” said Conlon. “Capital needs to flow towards risky innovations that will really move the dial in terms of deep decarbonisation.”

Help investors

To help achieve that progress, Conlon and colleagues have devised a new tool called an Aviation Sustainability Index (ASI), This is a quantitative method to assess how different technologies or investments could help decouple emissions from growth in air travel. The approach is designed to help investors distinguish between projects that only modestly improve efficiency and those that could significantly transform the sector’s climate impact.

Colon said: “The proposed ASI provides a greenwashing resistant way to underpin sustainability linked financing to the sector, allowing investors to identify innovations will truly move the dial.”

It’s a tool that could prove particularly useful for business aviation as scrutiny of its emissions record intensifies. “Regulators may, in future, see this as a low hanging fruit to reduce the overall contribution of emissions to climate change,” Colon told us. “By adopting the approach outlined in this paper, the business aviation sector can quantify and point to success in decarbonisation while also allowing them to obtain capital to support the carbon-neutral growth of the industry.

About $1trn is expected to be invested in aviation over the next decade, with most of that money targetted at making aircraft slightly more efficient, according to the report’s authors Few investors have clear incentives to back the kind of breakthrough technologies, such as hydrogen propulsion, advanced aircraft designs, or large-scale sustainable fuel systems, that could substantially reduce emissions, they claim.

Reduce contrails

Business aviation operators could commit to purchasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and to demanding more fuel-efficient aircraft from OEMs, said Colon. Another, potentially easy, lever available to business operators is to understand and reduce the contrails associated with these aircraft, which may be a low-cost way to reduce climate impact.

The research report’s co-author, David G Victor, professor of Innovation and Public Policy from the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy said: “Cleaner flight is possible, but it requires changing how we think about both risk and return. We need new institutions, incentives, and partnerships that reward innovation, not just incrementalism.”

Developing better tools to test climate-friendly investments and rewarding companies to take calculated risks on breakthrough technologies, governments, investors and industry leaders can accelerate real progress toward decarbonisation, conclude the researchers.

Developed in collaboration with Calumet Montana Refining, the new product is a nominal 50/50 blend of renewable jet fuel and traditional fossil jet fuel.

The blended fuel meets the rigorous aviation industry standards, certified under both ASTM D7566 (for the synthetic paraffinic kerosene component) and ASTM D1655 specifications, confirming its drop-in compatibility with all existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. This eliminates the need for modifications to aircraft engines or airport facilities, overcoming a major logistical hurdle for SAF adoption.

Montana Renewables and Calumet Montana Refining have commissioned dedicated onsite blending and shipping facilities at the Great Falls complex to manage the production and logistics of MaxSAF. The finished product will initially be distributed through the extensive network of AEG Fuels, targeting select aviation hubs in Montana, Washington, and Oregon.

""AEG Fuels is honored to collaborate with Montana Renewables on this landmark SAF inaugural blend,"" stated Landon Larson, Vice President, Supply NA at AEG Fuels. ""Together, we're demonstrating how strategic partnerships can accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation and deliver real value to operators across our fueling network.""

The distribution model focuses on providing a drop-in fuel solution that helps regional customers immediately begin working toward their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) targets and reduce both Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 3 (value chain) emissions.

MaxSAF is positioned as a triple-benefit product for the aviation sector.

• For Montana Renewables: Sales from the truck rack open up regional service opportunities and new customer segments in the sustainable aviation market, extending the reach of their Great Falls operations. MRL's feedstocks, which include agricultural byproducts like tallow, distiller’s corn oil, canola, used cooking oil, and camelina oil sourced from Pacific Northwest farms, contribute to the regional economic impact.

• For Customers: It provides an immediate, practical solution for airlines and operators to meet their carbon reduction goals and enhance their brand leadership in sustainability without incurring capital costs for infrastructure changes.

• For the Environment: SAF significantly reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional Jet A fuel and also offers improvements in local air quality. The use of agricultural byproducts and waste fats supports the concept of a circular economy—transforming waste into high-value, sustainable fuel.

The launch of MaxSAF Blended marks a significant step forward in making sustainable aviation fuel a commercial reality for a broader set of air travel operators across the Western United States.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-28 13:56:28.563675

Researchers at the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI) developed an economic model incorporating spatially varying joint yield and price distributions for multiple farmer crop choices and applied it to examine the incentives for risk-averse, present-biased, and credit-constrained farmers to produce cellulosic feedstocks under various biomass prices.

Annual C payments incentivize higher SAF production largely from corn stover and switchgrass while upfront C payments are more effective in incentivizing lower C intensity SAF production from miscanthus.

The finding that SAF feedstock choice, adoption levels, and spatial patterns depend on the type of C mitigation payments and farmer risk profiles sheds light on potential policy decisions that might incentivize increased bioenergy crop cultivation.

Competition in a crowded field The announcement places Honeywell squarely in competition with a growing roster of renewable-fuel technology developers.","Honeywell has introduced a new process to convert agricultural and forestry waste into renewable fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The US company describes it as a technological breakthrough and a major step toward lowering carbon emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries such as aviation and shipping.

Announced on October 28, 2025, the new Honeywell UOP (Universal Oil Products) Biocrude Upgrading process transforms inexpensive biomass feedstocks — such as wood chips, crop residues, and plant waste — into a renewable biocrude that can be refined into finished fuels. The company said the technology enables cost-effective production of “drop-in” fuels that meet existing performance and infrastructure requirements.

Honeywell described the process as capable of producing SAF, renewable gasoline, and lower-carbon marine fuel more cheaply than most current biofuel production. The resulting biocrude can be refined at standard petroleum facilities, potentially allowing refiners to adapt portions of existing operations to produce renewable fuel without major equipment overhauls.

“As demand for SAF continues to grow, the aviation industry is challenged by limited supplies of traditional SAF feedstocks such as vegetable oils, animal fats and waste oils,” said Ken West, President & CEO of Honeywell Energy & Sustainability Solutions. “When combined with the existing Fischer-Tropsch process, our new technology will expand the feedstock options available in the industry to sources that are more plentiful, ultimately helping improve our customers’ ability to produce SAF.”

The process begins with biomass waste — non-food organic matter such as forest trimmings, agricultural stalks, and sawmill residue. At or near collection sites, this feedstock is converted into a biocrude, a heavy renewable oil with similar handling properties to conventional crude. The biocrude is then shipped to major refineries or renewable fuel plants, where Honeywell’s upgrading modules convert it into finished products such as SAF, the company said.

The process turns waste that would otherwise be discarded into fuel, creating a new renewable source without relying on food crops. Honeywell said its approach produces “high-yield renewable fuels” while keeping transportation costs low by enabling distributed feedstock conversion and centralized refining.

Competition in a crowded field

The announcement places Honeywell squarely in competition with a growing roster of renewable-fuel technology developers. Neste, based in Finland, remains the world’s leading SAF producer, using waste oils and fats as feedstock. LanzaJet, backed by LanzaTech and major airlines, has pioneered ethanol-to-jet conversion at its Freedom Pines facility in Georgia. Other competitors include Fulcrum BioEnergy, which converts municipal solid waste into synthetic crude, and Alder Fuels, which relies on forest residues and agricultural by-products.

Honeywell’s claim of a lower-cost, modular process could differentiate it from these players, particularly if it enables refiners to add SAF capacity incrementally rather than through billion-dollar plant builds. The company emphasized that its UOP division — long a cornerstone of refining and petrochemical process technology — can deliver the new system as a prefabricated modular plant, reducing construction time and project risk.

Honeywell already markets several renewable-fuel technologies, including Ecofining, developed jointly with Eni S.p.A., which converts fats and oils into renewable diesel and SAF; Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) technology, which upgrades ethanol into synthetic paraffinic kerosene; and Fischer-Tropsch Unicracking, which refines synthetic gas into liquid fuels. The new Biocrude Upgrading process, the company said, complements these existing platforms by expanding the range of usable feedstocks to include low-cost lignocellulosic biomass.

While the company has not disclosed specific yields or lifecycle carbon data, analysts say the modular design and ability to use regional feedstocks could make the process a breakthrough for SAF scalability — a persistent challenge for the industry. Current global SAF production represents less than 1% of aviation fuel demand, hindered by high costs, limited feedstock supply, and the need for new refining capacity.

If Honeywell’s process performs as claimed, it could give refiners and energy companies a new pathway to produce certified SAF at lower cost and higher volume, supporting airline commitments to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/06/Aircraft-fueling-process.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:56:31.322690

Honeywell tech could boost maritime decarbonisation drive

Honeywell is launching a new technology that can convert forest and agricultural waste to a lower carbon fuel that could directly replace the carbon-intensive fuel oil used by large ships, helping the maritime and other heavy industries decarbonise.

The US industrial group told Energy Source that the “biocrude upgrading technology” can use biomass, which includes agricultural waste, to create a range of renewable fuels including, sustainable aviation fuel, gasoline, diesel and marine fuel.

Honeywell’s new technology could be a game-changer for the maritime industry. It can produce a direct replacement to heavy fuel oil since it has a high enough energy density to power ships on long voyages around the world.

Ken West, president and chief executive of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, told Energy Source that the fuel is compatible with existing engines and can utilise a wide range of biomass feedstocks.

The announcement comes as the shipping industry faces growing pressure to decarbonise. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, shipping is responsible for 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and is reliant on one of the dirtiest fuels: heavy fuel oil.

The industry is working towards decarbonisation and the International Maritime Organization has said it aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by or around 2050.

Danish shipping company Maersk, which operates in almost 130 countries, hopes to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. CMA CGM, a French shipping company, plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 and 80 per cent by 2040.

Honeywell Energy’s West added that the fuel can help ship owners meet guidelines for reducing carbon emissions because it does not require them to commit to major capital upgrades in order to decarbonise.

Shipping is a global business and fleets typically refuel at ports across the world, making acquiring sustainable fuels at ports in a variety of countries crucial.

“Biomass can be found in many different areas and we can use this technology particularly in countries that may not have access to fossil fuels or may not have access to other forms of renewable power,” West said. “I think we’re going to have customers that are truly going to be global.”

Still, cost remains a barrier for the maritime sector’s transition to renewable fuel. Pure biofuel is about $1,100 to $1,300 a ton, which is roughly 2 to 2.5 times the cost of fuel oil, according to Aparajit Pandey, a principal in the Rocky Mountain Institute’s climate-aligned industries group. He added that as biofuel becomes more popular, the jump in demand could also raise prices.

“Any fuel for maritime is going to be expensive. This is a fuel that is going to be pretty expensive to start off with and will get more expensive over time,” he said.

Biomass is also not abundantly available and some experts have warned that unsustainable management of this resource could lead to deforestation and biodiversity loss.

Still, West at Honeywell Energy said that renewable fuel would not necessarily replace other energy sources but would be simply an addition.

“We’re going to require biomass . . . and we’re going to require transition technologies like liquefied natural gas,” he said. “We know the world needs more energy tomorrow than it needs today. And that’s going to take a number of different technologies to get there.” (Alexandra White)

Zinc mine hosts the ‘world’s deepest marathon’

Dozens of runners from around the world descended 1,120 meters below sea level at the weekend to run what is expected to be confirmed as the world’s deepest marathon.

The race, held in Swedish mining group Boliden’s Garpenberg zinc mine, saw 55 people don high-vis T-shirts, helmets and head torches and run for hours around a 4km circuit in near darkness in the hope of raising more than $1mn for charity.

The runners — including Boliden chief executive Mikael Staffas, Rohitesh Dhawan, the chief executive of the International Council on Mining and Metals, and Jonathan Price, the boss of Canadian miner Teck Resources — endured subterranean temperatures in the mid 20s Celsius and high humidity.

“Without the head torch, you wouldn’t have seen anything,” said Staffas, who successfully completed the race alongside the other 54 runners.

The circuit was located in the lower part of the zinc mine, in an “exploration drift”, a tunnel built for underground drilling teams to explore the earth and rock further below them.

Getting there required taking a lift down 1km — an ear-popping two-minute journey — and then a 10-minute underground minibus to the race’s starting line.

The slowest runner completed the race in under eight hours, with regular marathon runners saying the challenging conditions added about an hour to their normal times.

“I’ve run 15 marathons and this was by far the hardest,” said Dhawan. “You go through every emotion. You go to a pretty dark place because you’re alone with your thoughts in a dark tunnel.” But he added that it had been a “once in a lifetime” experience.

About $570,000 has been raised so far for the BecomingX Foundation, an educational charity, and Wild at Heart Foundation, which aims to reduce the world’s stray dog population. (Camilla Hodgson)

I’m having minor surgery this week. After cataract surgery in both eyes more than 10 years ago, my left eye was sharp, bright, and clear — and still is. My right eye was blurry — and still is.

I’ve waited much too long to get this issue addressed. I thought, “It’s not that big a deal. My left eye is perfect!”

Poor vision inhibits confidence and erodes prompt, aligned action. So this week I’m having YAG laser surgery. It’s quick (literally a couple of minutes) and typical results are fantastic.

Business leaders face similar challenges with poor vision. If leaders don’t pay attention to how formal leaders treat employees each day, those business leaders won’t see the negative impact such treatment has on results and respect.

Here’s an example. A client had been coaching a middle manager who supervised a remote office. That manager wasn’t modeling the organization’s values and behaviors. He was rude, dismissive and abrupt with staff members. Complaints continued, including from customers, about this manager’s rude behavior.

The CEO told us, “We thought everything was doing fine. We didn’t keep an eye on this leader.” They realized that they had been hoping things were okay rather than consistently observing, monitoring and measuring the quality of interactions by this middle manager.

How can leaders stay “in tune” with how formal leaders treat others?

One client created an effective system to keep abreast of good things happening and of less-than-good things happening. Every email that goes out has a “tell us how we’re doing” link, which opens a simple contact form on their website. Customers and staff members can post feedback — and they do.

The administration team reviews all submissions. When positive recognition is posted, that team shares the good news with the staff member — or the team being praised — and their team leader. When missed deadlines or frustrations are shared, that team shares the issue with the staff member or team and their team lead.

This low-tech system works because it’s easy — customers and employees can post items from their phones — and because real humans respond promptly and effectively.

Every formal leader must champion your organization’s desired work culture every day, in every interaction. How can leaders know if respect and validation are communicated effectively? By keeping an eye on customer and employee perceptions.

BlueLight launches first humanitarian airline

BlueLight Humanitarian Airlines (BlueLight) has officially taken off as the world’s first non-profit airline devoted to humanitarian missions. Based in Geneva, the hub of global aid diplomacy, the airline aims to fill a long-standing gap in crisis response — rapid, neutral, and affordable air transport for relief operations.

Its fleet will unite cargo, passenger, and air ambulance functions under one system. Each aircraft can carry more than 50 tonnes of aid, transport 200 responders, and operate as a flying trauma unit. Co-founder Pierre Bernheim says the airline was built to end dangerous delays in crisis relief, stressing that speed and neutrality are vital when lives hang in the balance.

BlueLight’s initial fleet will include Airbus A340-300 and A321P2F aircraft. It also plans an uncrewed aerial system capable of flying 800 kilometres with 500 kg of supplies, designed for regions where runways are inaccessible.

Co-founder Waleed Rawat describes BlueLight as “a humanitarian infrastructure for the 21st century,” combining the efficiency of commercial aviation with the compassion of aid work.

The founders bring deep aviation and leadership expertise. Bernheim previously led Geneva Airport and advised at Vontobel Bank, while Rawat, head of WAIR Global and part of the HM Rawat Group, has wide experience in aviation and sustainable ventures. Together, they have assembled an international team of aviation, medical, and humanitarian professionals.

BlueLight plans full-scale operations by 2026, after raising US$55 million to acquire and convert three wide-body aircraft. Backed by the Swiss Federal Government and the Canton of Geneva, the project has also drawn partners such as Airbus, Geneva Airport, and JORAMCO.

Operating on a fixed-rate, transparent model, BlueLight promises fair access for all relief partners. The airline also integrates sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsets from the start, aligning with UN and Swiss sustainability goals.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Annual Technical Report found that 0.6% of Europe’s supplied aviation fuel for 2024 was SAF. This percentage needs to increase rapidly, but nevertheless saved 714 kilotonnes of carbon emissions, the equivalent of around 10,000 flights between Madrid and Paris.

Overall, EASA believes the EU is on track to achieve its 6% blending target in the next five years. Whether the bloc hits its interim target of 2% SAF in 2025 will be assessed at the close of this calendar year.

China is Europe’s biggest supplier of biofuel

EASA’s findings also highlight the ongoing cost obstacles to SAF adoption. Currently, the average price of SAF sits at €2,085/tonne, compared to €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel. Until the cost becomes more competitive, it is difficult to see how SAF use can scale successfully. Earlier this year, Airlines for Europe (A4E) criticised the EU for imposing SAF mandates without taking action to create a viable SAF market. Nevertheless, EASA’s report affirms progress on the 6% target.

Europe’s biggest producer of SAF is currently Finland, responsible for 10% of supply. However, 69% of feedstock originates outside of the EU, with China the biggest supplier.

Maria Rueda, EASA’s safety management, sustainability and global outreach director, said:

This first annual technical report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps.

A functioning reporting system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states. This report sets an important benchmark for our sustainability efforts in the future.

The annual contest, presented by the California Manufacturing & Technology Association during Manufacturing Month, highlights innovation and manufacturing success across the state.

“Manufacturing continues to be foundational to California’s economic growth — creating good-paying jobs and shaping the industries of the future,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news release Monday. “This competition, and the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works X-59, is evidence that the country’s top talent and innovation is in California.”

The association announced the award Oct. 23.

NASA and Lockheed Martin’s Palmdale facility are teaming up to develop the X-59. The jet is designed to tackle one of supersonic flight’s long-standing challenges: the loud sonic boom. By separating shockwaves, the X-59 is capable of producing a much softer sonic “thump,” potentially paving the way for future commercial supersonic flights over populated areas.

NASA will collect data from communities about the acceptability of the jet’s noise. The results could help inform new regulations that might one day allow passengers to travel long distances much faster than current commercial aircraft permit.

“We’re honored that Californians chose the X-59 as the Coolest Thing Made in California,” Patrick LeBeau, X-59 program manager, said in a statement. “This recognition celebrates the groundbreaking technology and precision engineering behind the X-59, and the incredible dedication of our Palmdale team and partners.

With mounting pressure to decarbonize and a growing demand for sustainable supply chains, India’s logistics sector is undergoing a sideways shift. The sector aims to integrate sustainability into daily operations, while shaping the future of freight through strategic direction for green logistics in the country.

Green and digital corridors have been hailed as engines of economic growth, innovation, and sustainability as they accelerate the adoption of low-emission technologies, transform maritime operations, and strengthen digital tools. The India-Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor is an important leverage for India as it builds bilateral relationships and establishes global trade dynamics that are green and sustainable.

Promoting Sustainable Logistics Through Technology

Recognising the importance of sustainable logistics for India’s environmental well-being and economic growth, several initiatives have been taken by the Government. The Government is promoting a sustainable logistics industry by leveraging digitization and automation.

The PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan (PMGS- NMP) relies on the GIS-based platform that uses geospatial data for better infrastructure planning and creating multimodal connectivity across the lengths and breadths of the country.

Similarly, the National Logistics Plan (NLP) aims to modernize logistics through adoption of digital technology. Digital platforms like Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and Logistics Data Bank (LDB) are being increasingly used for digitalizing, tracking, and monitoring of logistics movement in the country.

The Freight Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Calculator is a digital intervention that has been created to promote sustainability in the freight transport planning process and shift to low-carbon modes of transport. It helps the user make an informed modal choice based on the environmental cost and total emissions estimates to advance sustainable and green logistics in India.

Use of Cleaner Fuels

Sustainability in the transport sector is largely driven by green fuel such as green hydrogen, methanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) , along with other blended fuel.

Under The National Green Hydrogen Mission, the government has initiated a pilot project to use hydrogen in buses, trucks and other commercially viable modes for utilizing hydrogen into transport sector and adding supporting infrastructure like hydrogen refuelling stations.

Initiatives like Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) promotes compressed biogas (CBG) as an alternative green transport fuel as it is based out of organic waste and also helps in efficient management of biomass.

India is also targeting 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as mandated by The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA. With more than 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residues, India has the capacity to meet its SAF demand as well as emerge as a global leader and exporter for carbon offsetting in the aviation industry.

M-15 fuel blending (15 % methanol and 85 % Gasoline) has also shown a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 5- 10% thereby improving air quality.

Building A Green Shipping & Maritime Sector

Sustainability in logistics cannot be achieved by focusing only on road or air transport. A green shipping and maritime sector forms an important part of India’s international decarbonisation goal and achieving IMO’s 2023 Revised GHG Strategy.

Sustainable maritime practices through initiatives like the Green Tug Transition Programme and Harid Nauka Initiative focus on adopting low-emission and alternative fuel-powered ships. The Alang Ship Recycling Programme is another global effort in sustainable ship recycling. With ₹25,000 crore in Maritime Development Fund, India is also catalysing green investments, positioning itself as a leader in sustainable shipping and maritime infrastructure.

Furthermore, the Maritime India Vision 2030 is a comprehensive framework for the holistic development of India’s maritime sector through focus on innovation, sustainability, and skill development. It aims to develop ports, shipping, and waterways aimed to propel India to global maritime leadership. This expansion aligns seamlessly with the broader aspiration of Viksit Bharat 2047, contributing to employment generation, global competitiveness, and economic resilience.

Propelling the Green Engine in Railways

Railways is another sector which has immense potential for transforming the sustainability and environmental landscape of India. Government initiatives like National Rail Plan and Rail Sagar Corridor aim to improve freight share from the current 35-36% to 45% by 2030. It also aims to improve modal shift for railways, contribute to cleaner ways of freight movement and accelerate growth of railways cargo traffic.

Addressing Key Barriers

As we transition to modes of transport that emit lower carbon and are less harmful to the environment, there are also some systemic and infrastructural barriers that have to be addressed collectively by the industry and the Government. One of the key barriers to this is infrastructure, especially for alternative fuels.

There is a need for LNG infrastructure and implementing green channelling initiatives that strengthen the entire logistics sector. Another key factor for the green freight landscape is driver training. With properly trained drivers, we can better fuel mileage and efficiency as these are newer vehicles and roads for the drivers.

As the transport sector moves towards EVs, there is also a need to use renewable energy for the purpose of charging these new vehicles for personal, commercial, and transport purposes.",https://ciiblog.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cover-25-Oct-The-Future-Of-Green-Freight-In-India-01.png,N,,2025-10-28 11:57:40.484580

The COP30 SAFc platform is available to all COP30 attendees, including those who are not currently SABA members, as part of a concentrated effort to raise the visibility of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and scale funding and adoption of this key climate technology. It empowers conference attendees to calculate and address their aviation-related emissions by supporting SAF meeting SABA’s world-leading sustainability criteria - directly engaging in real-world deployment of a crucial decarbonization technology.

SABA’s COP30 SAFc platform gives conference-goers all the resources they need to decarbonize their COP air travel. Attendees first estimate their flight emissions using one of two methods. For commercial flights, travelers will use Google’s Travel Impact Model, an industry-leading calculation tool, while travelers on private jets will use the Eurocontrol Small Emitters Tool. Next, attendees purchase a corresponding quantity of high-integrity SAF certificates pre-vetted by SABA; and later receive a retirement statement from the SAFc Registry, which ensures the transaction meets best-in-class chain of custody requirements. The platform supports those traveling via commercial and private aircraft – crucial flexibility given that as many as 65 private jets travel to COP in a given year.

The high-integrity SAF supported through the new platform is sourced from SkyNRG as the result of a streamlined, competitive procurement process initiated by SABA earlier this year.

The Asia-Pacific region has fundamentally shifted its approach to sustainable aviation fuel over the past year. Since 2024, multiple APAC governments have moved from tentative goals to concrete blending targets and mandates. Japan is finalising a 10% SAF mandate by 2030, India has set targets starting in 2027, and several Southeast Asian nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) have introduced SAF blending roadmaps beginning around 2027. Singapore stands out with a confirmed near-term goal of 1% SAF by 2026, potentially rising to 3-5% by 2030, making it an early adopter in the region. In short, 2025 is the year APAC moved from aspiration to action on SAF policy, laying the regulatory groundwork that was largely missing in 2024.

APAC's SAF production capacity has grown and diversified since last year. The region is now home to one of the world's largest SAF production hubs: Neste's expanded Singapore refinery, which began pumping out SAF in commercial volumes and supplying carriers and logistics companies in the region. New domestic production projects have been announced or advanced in multiple countries. Australia is pursuing its first commercial SAF plants (one project in Queensland aims to produce around 100 million litres per year from ethanol by 2026-2027, backed by Qantas, Airbus and government funding), and Japan's major energy firms have completed pilot facilities for synthetic e-fuels. In China, state-owned producers achieved initial SAF outputs and the government set a 50,000-tonne SAF production target by 2025. Regional supply chains are also maturing: airlines like All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines in late 2024 began using domestically-blended SAF on commercial flights for the first time, and Hong Kong saw its first large corporate SAF purchase (3,400 tonnes by HSBC/Cathay Pacific). Compared to a year ago, these developments mean APAC now has some SAF flowing into aircraft engines rather than SAF being purely theoretical.

Since 2024, there has been a notable rise in funding commitments and joint ventures to kickstart APAC's SAF industry. Government incentives have emerged where none existed before. Notably, in September 2025 Australia announced a A$1.1 billion (US$735 million) 'Cleaner Fuels' programme, a ten-year fund to support domestic production of biofuels and e-fuels with the aim of having projects producing fuel by 2029. This marks the first major APAC government subsidy programme for SAF. Private-sector investment alliances have grown. Qantas and Airbus's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance (SAFFA) had around US$200 million committed by mid-2024 to invest in SAF production projects globally. Through such alliances, APAC airlines are co-financing new SAF technologies and securing future supply. Airlines are also signing long-term offtake agreements: Japan Airlines, for instance, agreed to a 10-year SAF supply MOU with US-based Raven SR, starting with 50,000 tonnes in 2025 and scaling to 200,000 tonnes per year within a decade. The past 12 months saw APAC governments and companies putting real money on the table, a clear sign that the business case for SAF is being taken seriously in the region.

The global SAF landscape has also shifted in ways that affect APAC. Europe's SAF blending mandate kicked in on 1 January 2025 (starting at 2%), and the United States' tax credit incentives under the 2022 IRA are now spurring dozens of new SAF projects. Over the past year, SAF produced in Asia has tended to flow to Europe where mandates create a price premium, raising concerns that APAC might face local shortages or higher costs if it lags behind in policy. IATA reports that most SAF supply in 2025 is headed to Europe, and warns that Europe's approach has driven SAF prices to five times that of conventional jet fuel. This external pressure is a key reason APAC policymakers have hastened their own SAF agendas since 2024. APAC's response through mandates, partnerships, and capacity-building will determine whether it remains a net importer of SAF credits to meet climate goals, or becomes a competitive producer.

APAC's SAF landscape in 2025 is defined by emerging policy frameworks, initial production capacity, and mobilised financing, a notable evolution from 2024's landscape of voluntary airline pledges and theoretical potential. We now see the first concrete mandates on the horizon (most starting latest by 2027), significant capital being directed into SAF ventures, and early adoption mechanisms like book-and-claim gaining traction. Still, the region faces familiar hurdles: high SAF costs, limited near-term supply, feedstock logistics, and the need for broader infrastructure. This report will examine these developments in detail, outline the key challenges and opportunities as the region navigates the pivotal 2025-2027 period on its journey toward cleaner aviation fuel.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/68ff5b2a03a33c3c44a429da/1761641576150/2.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-10-28 11:57:55.795794

Travelers around the world are becoming more conscious of their environmental impact, and the aviation industry is responding with bold moves. Europe and the UK are leading the global charge in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a key solution in the fight against climate change. With robust policies like ReFuelEU and the SAF Mandate, Europe is positioning itself as a hub for cleaner, greener skies. This transition isn’t just good for the planet; it’s also an exciting development for travelers seeking eco-friendly travel options.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a revolutionary fuel source that aims to reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, plants, and even algae. SAF can significantly lower carbon emissions when used in place of conventional aviation fuel, making it a crucial component in global decarbonization efforts.

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation is a landmark regulation that mandates a growing percentage of aviation fuel supplied at EU airports to be SAF. Starting at just 2% in 2025, this requirement will rise to 70% by 2050. This commitment aligns with the EU’s ambitious climate goals and ensures that travelers can enjoy a cleaner flight experience as SAF becomes more widely adopted.

Europe and the UK’s Role in the SAF Revolution

Both the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have embraced the need for cleaner aviation fuel, creating frameworks and incentives that encourage SAF production. The EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) sets a target of 42.5% renewable energy across the bloc by 2030. With a focus on sustainable transportation fuels, including SAF, the EU is positioning itself as a global leader in the transition to cleaner energy.

In the UK, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) requires at least 14.6% of fuels used in road transport to be renewable by 2025. This has spurred demand for advanced biofuels, including SAF, made from waste products. Additionally, the UK’s SAF Mandate calls for 2% SAF to be blended into aviation fuel by 2025, gradually increasing to 22% by 2040. This policy reflects the UK’s commitment to reducing aviation-related carbon emissions and improving fuel sustainability.

Tourists and Travelers: What Does SAF Mean for You?

For global travelers, the shift towards SAF offers an exciting prospect: flying with a lighter environmental footprint. Airlines operating out of European airports are increasingly incorporating SAF into their fuel mix. As SAF production scales up, travelers can expect to board planes powered by cleaner fuels, helping to reduce the aviation sector’s contribution to global warming.

Tourists visiting Europe will see firsthand how the continent is embracing sustainable energy, not just in aviation but across all sectors. Many European airlines are expected to meet SAF mandates in the coming years, making flights more eco-friendly for everyone.

Aviation Decarbonization and Its Global Impact

The push for SAF is part of a broader strategy to decarbonize aviation—a sector that has long been difficult to electrify. In fact, aviation contributes significantly to global carbon emissions. The adoption of SAF will be a game-changer, offering a renewable alternative to fossil-based jet fuel. This will help achieve global climate goals, including those set by the Paris Agreement.

As SAF production grows, it will play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions from air travel, which is one of the most carbon-intensive forms of transport. However, the production of SAF is still in its early stages, and Europe is expected to lead the way in scaling up its availability. In fact, eSAF (electro-fuel SAF), which is made using renewable electricity and captured carbon, is expected to become a cornerstone of Europe’s aviation decarbonization efforts.

The Challenges: Supply, Costs, and Investment

While the transition to SAF is promising, there are challenges ahead. One of the primary concerns is the availability of feedstocks. As countries like China increase their domestic use of waste oils, the supply of renewable materials for SAF production could become constrained. Additionally, scaling up SAF production requires significant investment in infrastructure and technology.

Despite these challenges, Europe remains committed to overcoming these barriers, and governments are working alongside private industry to create a more sustainable aviation sector. Investment in technologies like Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and synthetic fuels is expected to accelerate, paving the way for a future where SAF is the norm, not the exception.

Looking Ahead: SAF’s Role in Global Travel

As the world becomes more eco-conscious, travelers can expect to see more sustainable options on their flight bookings. The EU and UK are proving that a transition to renewable aviation fuels is not just possible, but necessary. For tourists visiting Europe, it’s an opportunity to experience first-hand how forward-thinking policies can shape a cleaner, greener future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Aircrft-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 04:56:08.529719

The company says it will operate as a fully scheduled carrier rather than a charter service, but with the space, service, and privacy typically associated with private jets and semi-private air travel.

At its launch, Magnifica plans to have a fleet of six Airbus aircraft, including four A220-300s and two A321neos. However, the planes will have far fewer seats than standard versions—roughly 45 to 54 instead of more than 120. The leather lie-flat seats will be arranged in two-by-two rows, and planes will have two to four enclosed “private suites,” complete with banquette seating and sliding doors, as well as a bar area at the tail end of the plane. The planes will have a sleek, minimalist look; the whole design concept evokes the aesthetic of luxury around-the-world charters, like those operated by Four Seasons and Aman.

The airline plans to offer a door-to-door experience that begins with chauffeured transfers and private-terminal check-ins and ends with expedited baggage handling upon arrival. Travelers will reportedly be able to check in 30 minutes before departure—an experience designed to seem frictionless compared to commercial air travel and the long security lines and crowded airport boarding gates that come with it. The company has also stated that sustainability is a core part of its brand. Magnifica has pledged to use a 50 percent blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from the start (with 100 percent SAF usage by 2030) and operate newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce emissions.

Initial routes are expected to link major U.S. business and leisure markets, including New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, and Houston, along with seasonal flights to Napa and the Caribbean. The company says it will operate as a fully scheduled airline rather than a charter service, targeting travelers who want the consistency and reliability of commercial aviation but the intimacy and speed of private flying. “We’re offering a fully private, seamless experience for a fraction of what you’d pay to charter a jet,” Magnifica wrote in a blog post. Ticket pricing, however, has not yet been announced.

In recent years, the market for more premium travel has grown exponentially, as travelers look for greater comfort, more personal space, and less time spent in crowded terminals.

New Green Fee Takes Off in 2026

Singapore introduced a fixed levy on all departing flights to support cleaner aviation practices starting in 2026. The levy will fund the purchase and management of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for airlines refueling in Singapore.

Authorities aim for SAF to make up 1% of all jet fuel by 2026 and 3–5% by 2030. This initiative strengthens Singapore’s leadership in sustainable aviation and long-term emissions reduction.

Funding Sustainable Air Travel

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will collect the levy from all departing flights. Funds will be used to manage bulk SAF procurement and ensure stable supply for airlines.

The levy will remain fixed to protect airlines and passengers from price fluctuations in the SAF market. Authorities believe this approach will drive demand for SAF and support global sustainability goals.

Impact on Airfares

Officials expect only a small fare increase shared by all travellers and operators.

A short-haul economy flight to Bangkok may rise by S$3 (US$2.30).

A long-haul flight to London could increase by S$16 (US$11.80).

Authorities emphasise that the contribution is minor compared to the environmental benefits achieved.

Industry Debate Over Green Costs

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned the levy could discourage air travel. IATA prefers government incentives or subsidies instead of direct passenger levies.

Singapore’s former Temasek CEO, Ho Ching, called IATA’s criticism “wrong headed” and short-sighted. She argued that shared financial responsibility is essential for aviation’s sustainable future.

A Step Toward Cleaner Skies

The levy reinforces Singapore’s position as a sustainability leader in Asian aviation. It balances environmental responsibility with long-term economic growth in the travel sector.

Senior Researcher Young-hoon Kim, POSCO Research Institute

Rapidly Expanding SAF Market

In the past, the automotive industry rose to the challenge of reducing its carbon footprint, resulting in the widespread presence of eco-friendly vehicles on today’s roads. Today, the aviation industry accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon emissions and, much like the automotive sector in the past, is now grappling with the challenge of reducing them. It is no exaggeration to say that the aviation sector’s sustainability increasingly hinges on SAF. SAF is a fuel developed to replace conventional jet fuel, produced from raw materials such as used cooking oil; vegetable and animal oils/fats; biomass; animal manure; waste wood; municipal solid waste; and captured carbon dioxide (CO2). It delivers performance equivalent to conventional jet fuel while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from the production process by up to about 80%.

The first use of SAF in the aviation industry took place in 2008, but usage was negligible at the time. A major shift began in 2021, when the International Air Transport Association (IATA) adopted a resolution at its 77th Annual General Meeting to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050. Following this decision, the share of SAF in global jet fuel consumption rose steadily: 0.1% in 2022, 0.2% in 2023, and 0.3% in 2024, increasing by approximately 0.1 percentage points each year.

The global SAF market is growing rapidly as countries around the world gradually increase mandatory SAF blending requirements. By 2030, the United States, Japan, and Singapore plan to require SAF to account for 10% of total jet fuel use. The European Union (EU) has set a target of 6%, and Indonesia aims for 2.5%. Korea is also aligning with these global efforts. In August 2024, the government announced a policy that will make a 1% SAF blend mandatory for all international departing flights starting in 2027. As a result of these policy shifts, the global SAF market is expected to grow to around USD 67 billion (approximately KRW 92.4 trillion) by 2030 — roughly 30 times its current size.

If the SAF market is formed, various raw materials including biomass will be required, and there is a high possibility that the global raw material supply chain will be reorganized. Therefore, countries that possess raw materials or have strengths in raw material development are paying close attention to SAF as a new growth industry. In the past, the aviation fuel market was a monopoly and oligopoly market based on crude oil as a single raw material. However, because SAF uses various raw materials such as oils and fats, herbaceous and lignocellulosic biomass*, and industrial off-gases (CO, CO2, H2), the market has shifted to an intensely competitive one.

*Herbaceous and lignocellulosic biomass refers to trees and herbaceous plants containing cellulose, as well as products and waste derived from them. It is mainly used as a raw material for the production of biofuels, bioplastics, and biochemical substances.

U.S. Eyes SAF as a New Growth Industry

The United States is emerging as an optimal location for SAF production, leveraging its competitive advantage in producing bioethanol, a next-generation SAF raw material, from agricultural crops such as soybeans, corn, and sugarcane, as well as from agricultural byproducts. The Trump administration has also expressed interest in fostering the domestic SAF industry, pledging to maintain support under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

In May 2025, the administration announced a restructuring plan to dramatically reduce or terminate clean energy tax credits. However, it maintained the Section 45Z Clean Transportation Fuel Credit for SAF, which provides up to USD 1.75 per gallon (approximately KRW 2,419) in incentives, and extended its expiration date by five years, from 2027 to 2032. In particular, while continuing to support fuels that achieve at least a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions, the U.S. framework, unlike global standardization efforts, excludes Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC)* CO2 emissions from its calculation boundary. This approach has enabled corn-based bioethanol to be included as an eligible fuel for federal support.

*Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) refers to land-use changes that occur when farmland or pasture previously used for food or feed crops is converted to biofuel crop production, and to meet the displaced demand, forests or grasslands that had been used for other purposes are cleared and converted into cropland.

In other words, when corn in the United States is used for bioethanol, the supply of corn for food decreases, leading other countries to convert forests into cropland to meet that demand. Because corn has high ILUC emissions, it is a crop with a low CO2 reduction rate. However, in the United States, because ILUC emissions are excluded from the CO2 calculation boundary, corn’s CO2 reduction rate rises to more than 50% compared with conventional jet fuel, and it has therefore been included as an eligible fuel for support programs.

Japan Takes an Active Role in Building the SAF Market

How is Japan responding? At the U.S.–Japan summit in February 2025, Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that securing a stable supply of resources such as bioethanol, in addition to LNG, from the United States would bring great national benefit to Japan. President Trump also noted his close relationship with the farming community and expressed strong interest in building a bilateral supply chain based on bioethanol.

Japan, leveraging the resource development capabilities of its general trading companies, is establishing a supply network for SAF raw materials such as used cooking oil, vegetable oils, and bioethanol. To encourage investment in domestic SAF production, the government provides subsidies covering between one-third and one-half of capital costs. To meet its mandate requiring 10% SAF use by 2030, Japan will need about 1.3 million tons of SAF per year. Four major refiners are currently reviewing six SAF production projects, and the government plans to cover between one-third and one-half of the investment depending on the technology. Japanese trading companies are participating as reliable raw material suppliers for SAF production in Japan through two of these projects, importing bioethanol from the United States and Brazil. As Japan’s domestic SAF production increases, they are expected to expand their role from supplying the domestic market to exporting SAF.

China and India are Transitioning from Raw Material Exporters to SAF Producers

China is shifting toward producing and exporting SAF domestically as the United States has strengthened import tariffs on Chinese used cooking oil, making it more difficult to export raw materials, and as demand for SAF has expanded mainly in the European Union (EU). One of China’s SAF producers, Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech, has received government approval to export up to 370,000 tons of SAF and has already exported 13,400 tons this year.

India also has abundant SAF raw materials, including used cooking oil and crop residues, and it is expected that the country will be able to produce up to 24 million tons of SAF by 2030. As the domestic aviation market continues to grow rapidly, up to 10 million tons are expected to be consumed domestically, and the remainder will be directed toward exports.

POSCO Group Secures Diverse Core Raw Materials for SAF Production

Korean companies are also actively pursuing the SAF market. POSCO possesses a range of raw materials that can serve as a foundation for expanding into the SAF business, making it possible to enter the market through collaboration with refiners.

POSCO International began developing plantations on Papua Island, Indonesia, in 2011 and started commercial palm oil production in 2016. In the palm oil refining process, various byproducts such as palm oil mill effluent and empty fruit bunches are generated, and since they are recognized as SAF raw materials, refiners’ interest is high. Sugarcane and corn, which are drawing attention as next-generation SAF raw materials, and bioethanol made by saccharifying them, can also be secured through POSCO International’s trading capabilities.

POSCO International has already laid the groundwork for growth in the eco-friendly business market, including SAF, by obtaining two international certifications in October 2024. The certifications obtained are ISCC EU*, a global certification that ensures the sustainability of biofuel production in accordance with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, and ISCC CORSIA**, a certification that guarantees the sustainability of aviation fuels. Through the acquisition of these international certifications, POSCO International has secured both the qualification to export biofuels and raw materials to the European market and the eligibility to supply raw materials for SAF production. This achievement is anticipated to provide substantial opportunities for growth in the EU and the international aviation industry.

*ISCC EU (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification EU) is an international certification program that verifies the sustainability of biofuels in accordance with the European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive.

**ISCC CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) is a program that certifies Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) that meets the standards of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Various by-product gases are generated at POSCO’s steel mills. Among these, carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 are regarded as next-generation SAF raw materials due to the absence of supply limitations. This technology involves producing SAF by converting CO into bioethanol and refining it into aviation fuel, or by reforming* CO2 into CO and synthesizing it with clean hydrogen. The Future Technology Research Laboratories of POSCO Holdings, in collaboration with LG Chem, plans to initiate a large-scale carbon capture and utilization (CCU) mega project in 2026, aimed at capturing CO2 and converting it into SAF raw materials. Upon successful completion of the demonstration project, POSCO is expected to enter the next-generation SAF market.

*Reforming is a technology that uses a metal catalyst to react CO2 and hydrocarbons such as methane to produce synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and CO).

Preemptive Entry into the SAF Market to Seize Opportunities

So, is the transition of the aviation fuel market to SAF an opportunity or a threat for Korean companies? As Korea is the world’s leading exporter of aviation fuel, the global shift to SAF is seen more as a threat than an opportunity for Korean companies. For domestic aviation and refining industries, slowing down the speed of the transition to the SAF market may be advantageous in the short term.

However, since SAF is a strategic item that can change the structure of the multi-trillion-won aviation fuel market, it is important to note that major countries are recognizing it as a new industry and are actively participating in market creation. In particular, considering that the United States, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and the Netherlands, which are actively participating in SAF market creation, are Korea’s major aviation fuel export destinations, the market should be reviewed from a comprehensive perspective of defending the existing aviation fuel market and creating new SAF industries.

POSCO Group needs to review ways to participate in the SAF market in advance by utilizing POSCO International’s resource development capabilities and POSCO’s CCU technology using carbon dioxide. It is especially important to review various business models, including preemptively participating in overseas markets, which are expanding relatively quickly, beyond the domestic model, where the pace is expected to be slower.",https://newsroom.posco.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251027_en_img_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 00:56:22.030794

This is because they are passing on the cost of compliance with EU and UK SAF mandates to their airline customers.

This adds even further to the cost of SAF, already much more expensive than jet fuel.

Moreover, through the law of unintended consequences, it acts as a disincentive to the development of the embryonic SAF market that the mandates are aimed at stimulating.

Mr Walsh argues that European regulators should eliminate SAF mandates.

He may have a point.

Summary

IATA’s Willie Walsh says SAF suppliers are extracting “additional profit from airlines” and “price gouging”.

The EU and UK place SAF mandates on fuel suppliers, who pass compliance costs on to airlines, slowing the development of an efficient SAF market.

The production of SAF, crucial to aviation’s 2050 net zero, is low but rising.

Biomass feedstocks for SAF are available, but will also be needed for other applications.

eSAF, or PtL (power-to-liquid technology, will be very important. PtL projects are mainly in the development phase, but numbers are growing.

IATA's Walsh: fuel suppliers are extracting ""additional profit from airlines"" and ""price gouging""

In an interview with Reuters (13-Oct-2025) IATA director general Willie Walsh argued that fuel suppliers were inflating the cost of SAF at EU and UK airports by charging airlines a compliance surcharge.

He argued that suppliers were extracting ""additional profit from airlines"".

Moreover, he reasoned, the SAF mandates ""...have, in effect, facilitated price gouging by fuel suppliers in the name of the environment, and that's completely unacceptable"".

Why did he make this claim?

The EU and UK place SAF mandates on fuel suppliers…

The EU and the UK require fuel suppliers to include a mandated percentage of SAF in their jet fuel mix, rising over time.

Both require 2% in 2025, with the UK mandate rising to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040. Under the EU mandate, called 'ReFuelEU Aviation', the requirement rises to 6% in 2030, 34% in 2040, and 70% in 2050.

…who pass on the cost of compliance to airlines…

The mandate falls on fuel suppliers, rather than airlines, as does the cost of compliance with it.

However, according to IATA, most fuel suppliers pass on the cost of complying with the regulation through a compliance fee charged to airlines.

The market price of SAF varies significantly, but in 2024 it averaged USD2,350 per tonne, which is 3.1 times the price of jet fuel derived from fossil fuels (source: IATA).

With the addition of compliance fees in Europe, the effective price of SAF is nearly double its market price, according to IATA.

…working against the development of an efficient SAF market

In analysis published in May-2025, IATA observed that fuel suppliers' pricing behaviour ""works against the development of a global, liquid, and transparent SAF market, as suppliers avoid contracting for the supply of mandated SAF with airlines"".

The airline trade body estimated that airlines in the EU would face an additional cost of USD1.3 billion in 2025 as a result of excess compliance fees. IATA added that this sum could purchase an additional 1.2 million tonnes of SAF and cut an additional 2.7 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

It estimated that the UK mandate would lead to a missed opportunity to cut an additional 0.8 million tonnes of CO2.

IATA's May-2025 analysis concluded: ""Paying more to abate less is unacceptable"".

In his recent interview with Reuters, Mr Walsh's language was more forthcoming.

The production of SAF, crucial to aviation's 2050 net zero, is low but rising

SAF is crucial to achieving aviation's goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Production remains at low levels, at just 0.3% of jet fuel consumption in 2024 - but it is increasing.

In absolute terms, 2024 SAF production of 1Mt was twice the volume of 2023. IATA expects it to double again in 2025 to 2Mt, or 0.7% of world jet fuel use of 311Mt.

Moreover, the number of airlines entering into off-take agreements with SAF suppliers is growing.

According to IATA, from a standing start in 2013, 81 airlines had announced 170 deals by Jun-2025.

Almost 40% of those airlines had more than one agreement.

Biomass feedstocks for SAF are available, but will also be needed for other applications

There are a number of feedstocks (sources) of SAF under the broad heading of biomass, which refers to matter from recently living organisms.

Biomass feedstocks include agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, forestry residues and wood waste and crop-based feedstocks and waste oils.

A Sep-2025 study by IATA and Worley Consulting found that, while biomass availability is substantial, only a small proportion of it is likely to find its way into SAF production.

According to the study, unconstrained feedstock availability will exceed 12,000Mt by 2050 - but only 4,200Mt will be available for bioenergy and biofuels after allocations to other sectors.

Furthermore, after applying a large amount of this to power, heat and biochemicals, only 1,580Mt will be available for SAF production in 2050 (but this is estimated to be a 30% increase from 2030).

Potential availability of global biomass feedstocks for SAF production by 2050

Source: IATA Sustainability and Economics, Worley Consulting.

This feedstock volume converts into 300Mt of SAF in 2050, while 500Mt will be needed to meet the net zero target.

The gap can be closed, in part, if conversion efficiencies improve further - through technology, improved feedstock logistics and better infrastructure.

eSAF, or PtL (power-to-liquid technology) will be very important in reaching targets

A key factor in closing the gap will also be the use of eSAF, which is derived from power-to-liquid (PtL) technology.

PtL fuels are synthetic liquid hydrocarbon fuels produced from renewable electricity, water and carbon dioxide (CO2).

The hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water using renewable electricity ('green hydrogen'), and the CO2 needs to be captured from the atmosphere or come from sources that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere.

Synthetic fuels are regarded as more scalable, deriving from renewable electricity as their source of energy. They are less dependent on feedstocks than SAF derived from biomass, and lead to greater emissions reductions.

PtL projects are mainly in the development phase, but numbers are growing

PtL projects are mainly still in the development phase.

At the time of IATA's AGM in Jun-2025, 90% of the 60 PtL projects scheduled by 2030 were still at the announcement stage, and only one commercial scale project was under construction (in the US).

Both the EU and UK SAF mandates include targets for PtL, and these have helped to stimulate the growth of PtL projects.

Policies to incentivise SAF, rather than mandate it, could be more effective

Mr Walsh's call on EU and UK regulators to abandon their SAF mandates is not a call to abandon the net zero target.

Rather, it is a plea to remove market distortions that make this already very expensive fuel even more expensive, adding to the cost burden of airlines and dissuading them from purchasing more.

Policy aimed at facilitating and incentivising the supply of SAF, rather than mandating it, could be more effective.

For example, US policy in this area includes SAF production targets, but these are not mandatory. Rather, it features credits and funding opportunities to encourage and reward SAF production.

Jay Inslee on ideas to develop the state’s sustainable aviation fuel industry.","Washington regulators would like your thoughts on aviation fuel that could be made from things like oilseeds or greases.

Sustainable aviation fuels are blended with conventional jet fuel. Right now, most of the ways to make the fuel need more study. Only one type — traditionally using things like fatty acids — are used commercially. Hundreds of thousands of flights have used this type of fuel, according to the State Department of Ecology.

In the last legislative session in Olympia, lawmakers directed the department to study potential — or likely — environmental impacts of making and distributing sustainable aviation fuels. And ways to avoid those issues.

The department is in the very beginning stages of its review. But leaders would like help figuring out the scope of the study. The study won’t approve or deny any specific projects. It is eventually meant to be a resource for possible future biofuels projects in Washington.

The state’s goal is to lower greenhouse gas emissions from flying. However, at a recent public comment session, Longview resident Diane Dick called many proposals for this type of jet fuel in her area “boondoggles.”

“It will never be sustainable. The only way to reduce jet fuel emissions is for people to understand they need to fly less,” Dick said.

The plant is expected to produce 50 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel each year, starting in 2030.

“ (Sustainable aviation fuels) production in Washington state is also important because it contributes to energy independence, improves air quality for local communities near airports, and delivers significant economic benefits,” Morgan said.

According to the governor’s office, the Port of Seattle has set a goal to use 60 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel per year. That’s roughly 10% of the annual aviation fuel used at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

“Sustainable aviation fuels are central to the evolving global aerospace industry, and we’re proud to be leading the way here in Washington state,” said Gov. Bob Ferguson in a news release about the planned Walla Walla facility.

In 2020, a Washington State University workgroup sent recommendations to then-Gov. Jay Inslee on ideas to develop the state’s sustainable aviation fuel industry.

The new laws, SB 253 and SB 261, were approved by Governor Newsom in 2023, and signed into law in October 2024.
The new laws will introduce climate-related reporting requirements for most large companies in the U.S., even as other climate disclosure regulations, such as the SEC’s climate reporting rule, appear increasingly less likely to be implemented.
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) recently issued a preliminary list of more than 4,000 U.S. companies likely to be required to comply with the new climate reporting laws.
The suit asks the court to declare that each of the new laws violate the First Amendment, and that SB 261 is preempted by the NSMIA, and to enjoin California from enforcing the laws.","Energy giant ExxonMobil filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court challenging new California laws requiring large companies to disclose their value chain greenhouse gas emissions and report on climate-related risks.

According to the suit, ExxonMobil is asking the court to declare that California’s new climate-related reporting laws violate First Amendment free speech rights – claiming that their main goal is to “embarrass” large companies and compel speech in support of the state’s ideological goals – and to prevent the state from enforcing them.

Notably, the new laws have already survived a series of First Amendment-based court challenges brought by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, including a recent decision by the court denying a motion to block enforcement of the laws on free speech grounds, although that case is still proceeding to trial, currently scheduled for October 2026.

The new laws, SB 253 and SB 261, were approved by Governor Newsom in 2023, and signed into law in October 2024. SB 253 requires companies with revenues greater than $1 billion that do business in California to report annually on their direct Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and Scope 3 value chain emissions, including those associated with supply chains, business travel, employee commuting, procurement, waste, and water usage. SB 261 applies to U.S. companies that do business in California and with revenues greater than $500 million to prepare a report disclosing their climate-related financial risk, as well as measures to reduce and adapt to that risk.

Disclosures of Scope 1 and 2 emissions under the new law is scheduled to begin in 2026, covering the previous fiscal year, while Scope 3 emissions reporting will begin in 2027, while the first climate-related risk reports are to be published by January 1, 2026.

The new laws will introduce climate-related reporting requirements for most large companies in the U.S., even as other climate disclosure regulations, such as the SEC’s climate reporting rule, appear increasingly less likely to be implemented. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) recently issued a preliminary list of more than 4,000 U.S. companies likely to be required to comply with the new climate reporting laws.

In its lawsuit, ExxonMobil said that it already discloses its greenhouse gas emissions and its climate-related business risks, but the company argued that the reporting frameworks required to be used by companies under the new laws will force the company to “speak in service” of California’s “ideological premise,” that “that large companies are uniquely responsible for climate change no matter how efficiently they satisfy societal demand for energy, goods, and services.”

The suit notes, for example, that SB 253 requires disclosure of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions based on the GHG Protocol standards and guidance, which the company argues focuses on absolute emissions rather than emissions intensity, which effectively makes large companies look worse than small companies. ExxonMobil also argues that the GHG Protocol framework fails to account for avoided emissions achieved by making a product more carbon efficient, and that by requiring reporting on all emissions scopes, overcounts emissions, with the lawsuit noting that “an energy producer’s Scope 2 emissions would be the same as its power company’s Scope 1 emissions, and its Scope 3 emissions would be the same as its customers’ Scope 1 emissions.”

SB 261 requires reporting on climate-related financial risk in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) or an equivalent framework, which the suit argues goes beyond the SEC’s requirements to detail all material financial risks, and will require companies to “create and publicly disclose a detailed, speculative risk report.” The suit argues that the law “deprives ExxonMobil of the option not to speak on any of the speculative topics” from the framework, and requires the company to explain why it chooses not to publish climate targets.

Additionally, the lawsuit argues that the National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA) preempts SB 261 from requiring disclosure of more detailed information on risks than those already covered by SEC requirements.

The suit asks the court to declare that each of the new laws violate the First Amendment, and that SB 261 is preempted by the NSMIA, and to enjoin California from enforcing the laws.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Exxon2.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 15:00:27.014262

Joni Ernst, along with U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisconsin, urged a “coordinated action” across the Trump administration to prioritize soybeans in a trade deal with China and to finalize renewable fuel guidelines.

The GOP lawmakers addressed a letter Monday on behalf of soybean producers and related industries who have been “priced out of the market” due to the impacts of the ongoing trade disputes with China.

China, a major soybean importer, has not placed an order with U.S. producers this year. Instead, the country has turned to Argentina for several shiploads of soybeans in a move similar to the country’s actions during the trade wars of the first Trump administration when China looked to Brazil for its soybeans.

President Donald Trump is set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday, though news reports from the weekend indicated the leaders have established a framework for a trade deal that includes purchases of agricultural materials.

Resolving the trade dispute with China was a key request in the letter from congressional delegates Monday.

“The United States should make soybean market access a central priority in trade discussions with China and work toward the suspension or removal of retaliatory duties that are distorting global competition,” the letter said.

Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam said in a statement related to the letter that agriculture “prospers” when America can lead in global trade.

“The longer trade tensions persist, the greater the damage of permanently weakening relationships with key markets—turning the U.S. into a secondary rather than preferred supplier of soybeans,” Adam said.

Nunn said producers are “flying blind” and asking what the administration’s plan is to fix the situation.

“Right now, bins are full, prices are underwater, and the ongoing government shutdown is adding even more uncertainty to an already tough situation,” Nunn said. “Iowa farmers deserve to compete on fair terms, and I look forward to hearing back from the administration.”

Calls for renewable fuels guidance

In addition to a trade deal with China, the letter asks for finalization on 45z tax credit guidelines and renewable volume obligations, or RVOs, that industry leaders say will grow the renewable fuel industry and domestic demand for soybeans.

“Agencies should work together to identify and expand alternative markets for soybeans and soybean meal, remove unnecessary barriers to trade, and deploy the full suite of tools to help U.S. farmers remain competitive,” the letter said.

The 45z tax credit, which was initiated during the Biden administration and extended under the Republican-led “one big beautiful” law, encourages the production of low-emission biofuels, like sustainable aviation fuel.

While the U.S. Department of the Treasury has released initial guidelines on the tax credit, the renewable fuel industry continues to call for finalized guidelines to produce fuels within the eligible emission ranges.

Devin Mogler, the National Oilseed Processors Association president and CEO, said the soybean processing industry has invested more than $6 billion to expand capacity by more than 25% by selling into the biofuels industry.

“But we need certainty on biofuels policy to ensure the industry can run at capacity, particularly coming off a record harvest,” Mogler said in a statement. “We greatly appreciate Congressman Nunn’s leadership in working with the administration to finalize strong RVOs and 45Z so these policies translate into value at the farmgate.”

Renewable volume obligations are part of the renewable fuel standards issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that establish standards for the quantities of biofuels to be blended into U.S. transportation fuels.

In June, the agency proposed historic standards for the industry, including a substantial jump in the amounts of biomass-based diesel standards, of which soybeans are a feedstock.

The letter calls for these proposed rates to be finalized.

Finally, lawmakers in the letter wrote that farmers need communication and a strategy from the administration in order to plan for the future.

“We’ve appreciated the openness of the Administration to meet with stakeholders and hear their concerns,” the letter reads. “However, we’ve reached a point where our producers need clear signals, not continued uncertainty, to make informed marketing and planting decisions.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Iowa-cultivator-1181123755.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 15:00:35.404967

This is not a single-technology story; it includes biofuels, biogases, and low-emissions hydrogen — and it would reshape transport, shipping, aviation, and parts of industry over the next decade.

The Headline Numbers: What “Quadruple” Means in Practice

The IEA’s Delivering Sustainable Fuels analysis finds that global consumption of liquid and gaseous sustainable fuels could quadruple by 2035 compared with 2024 if policies already proposed or enacted are fully implemented. Under that pathway, sustainable fuels would supply roughly 10% of global road transport demand, 15% of aviation demand, and 35% of shipping fuel demand by 2035 — dramatic increases from today’s shares.

Those rises are driven by several components: scaling biofuels and biogases, rapid growth in low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels, and policy mandates (e.g., blending requirements and procurement rules) that push markets toward cleaner liquid and gaseous fuels.

Which Fuels and Sectors Will Grow Fastest?

Transport is the principal near-term driver of demand for sustainable fuels to 2035, with heavy industry and power-sector uses expanding after 2030 as low-emissions hydrogen becomes more available.

Aviation (SAF): Sustainable aviation fuel production is expanding quickly — IATA expected SAF production to double in 2025 to about 2 million tonnes, though that still represents a tiny fraction of total jet-fuel demand.

Shipping: The IEA projects sustainable fuels could cover an estimated 35% of shipping fuel demand by 2035 under the fully-implemented policy scenario.

Road transport: Sustainable fuels could supply around 10% of road transport demand by 2035 in the IEA pathway.

The IEA stresses that scaling requires investment, supply-chain diversification, and strong sustainability safeguards to avoid unintended consequences (land use change, biodiversity loss).

Investment, Industry Moves, and Policy Signals

Meeting a fourfold rise will demand large capital flows and industry commitments. IEA and related analyses point to increased investment in low-emissions fuels as part of a broader surge in clean energy spending: energy-sector capital flows are projected to be over USD 3.3 trillion in 2025, with substantial shares directed to clean technologies, including low-emissions fuels.

Oil majors are already placing big bets on biofuels and SAF: a 2024/25 industry survey reported 40+ major projects by 2030 and potential capacity additions equivalent to hundreds of thousands of barrels per day of biofuel feedstock processing. Meanwhile, several countries (Brazil, India, Italy, Japan, and others) have publicly pledged or signalled ambition to scale sustainable fuels in line with IEA recommendations.

Policy examples also matter: Indonesia is considering SAF blending requirements (starting at 1% in 2026 and rising to 5% by 2035) to spur domestic production, illustrating how national mandates can seed local industries.

Risks, Sustainability, Constraints, and Trade-Offs

A rapid push to quadruple sustainable fuel use is technically feasible but not risk-free. The main caveats the IEA highlights include supply-chain bottlenecks, feedstock competition with food and ecosystems, permitting and financing delays, and the current higher cost of many sustainable fuels relative to fossil equivalents.

Environmental safeguards are crucial: large-scale biofuel rollouts without protections can drive deforestation and biodiversity loss. Critics warn that ambitious pledges (e.g., rapid biofuel expansion) must include strict land-use, biodiversity, and social safeguards to avoid repeating past mistakes.

What the IEA Says Needs to Happen Now

The IEA frames the pathway toward quadrupling as policy-dependent. Key near-term actions include: stronger mandates and procurement targets for SAF and renewable fuels, incentives for low-emissions hydrogen production and electrolyser deployment, clearer sustainability criteria and certification systems, and public-private finance mechanisms to de-risk early projects.

The agency also underlines international cooperation; for technology transfer, harmonised standards and cross-border trade in sustainable fuels, and robust monitoring to ensure greenhouse-gas benefits are real across life cycles.

Why This Matters: Climate and Economic Implications

If sustainable fuels scale as the IEA projects, their uptake could be a critical bridging solution for hard-to-electrify sectors (aviation, shipping, some industrial processes), reducing lifecycle emissions where direct electrification is slow or impractical.

Economically, a growing sustainable-fuel industry could create value chains in feedstock collection (waste oils, residues), hydrogen production hubs, green ammonia, and e-fuel manufacturing — but those benefits depend on well-designed policies that steer investments toward low-emissions pathways and protect ecosystems.

Final Thoughts

“Sustainable fuel use by 2035” as a global objective is within sight under the IEA’s scenario — but it is conditional. The quadrupling outcome is not automatic; it requires coherent policy packages, substantial investment, and rigorous sustainability governance. If those pieces fall into place, sustainable fuels could be a major pillar of decarbonisation in the coming decade — especially where electrification alone cannot deliver deep emissions cuts.

FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

1. What exactly does “sustainable fuel” mean in the IEA analysis?

The IEA uses “sustainable fuels” to cover a range of low-emissions liquid and gaseous fuels, including advanced biofuels, biogases, and hydrogen-derived fuels produced with low lifecycle emissions — subject to sustainability criteria.

2. How realistic is a fourfold increase by 2035?

Technically feasible under the IEA’s modelling, but it depends on fully implementing current and announced policies, scaling investments, and resolving feedstock and sustainability constraints. The IEA explicitly describes the pathway as conditional on those policy actions.

3. Will sustainable fuels make a big dent in global emissions?

They can significantly reduce emissions in sectors that are hard to electrify (aviation, shipping, some industries), but their climate benefit hinges on lifecycle emissions — and on avoiding land-use and biodiversity harms. Proper lifecycle accounting and safeguards are essential.

4. Who is investing in this shift?

Governments and major energy companies are increasing commitments: clean energy investment is rising (IEA projects USD 3.3 trillion in energy flows in 2025 with large clean allocations), and oil majors have announced dozens of biofuel/SAF projects toward 2030.

5. What are the main policy levers to accelerate sustainable fuel uptake?

Key tools include blending mandates and procurement targets (e.g., SAF mandates), low-carbon fuel standards, investment incentives for hydrogen and electrolysers, feedstock sustainability rules, and international cooperative frameworks for standards and trade.",https://sigmaearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-79488-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 16:00:04.655814

United Airlines has committed to fully reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 without relying on carbon offsets. Investments in SAF are a key tool identified by the airline to reach its goal. Under the new agreement, United will become the first commercial airline to purchase SAF for use on flights from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey, and Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington D.C.

Lauren Riley, United Chief Sustainability Officer, said:

“Introducing sustainable aviation fuel for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone in United’s sustainability journey. While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments. We will continue collaborating with stakeholders, like Neste, across the aviation value chain to encourage policymakers to implement sensible market incentives that promote lower-carbon energy.”

An annual report by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) into the uptake of alternative fuels, known as “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF) by the industry, said that the new ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation has “stimulated increased SAF production” within the EU.

The regulation established the “blending mandate”, which sets the mandatory minimum percentage for the use of alternative aviation fuels by airlines. This came into force at 2 per cent of all fuel used in 2025 and is due to increase to 6 per cent by 2030 before accelerating to 20 per cent in 2035 and 70 per cent by 2050.

Earlier this month, leading European airlines warned that without increased support for alternative aviation fuels from the EU there would be rising costs - leading to reduced air travel accessibility and connectivity across Europe.

But the EU is striking a more optimistic tone, with sustainable transport and tourism commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas emphasising that it was “making steady progress in adopting sustainable aviation fuels”.

“The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is already helping to increase SAF production and use across member states,” added Tzitzikostas. “Our focus now is on supporting the industry and member states to ensure a smooth and fair transition to cleaner aviation fuels.""

The EASA report found that nearly all SAF used in the EU during 2024 was biofuel, with 81 per cent produced from used cooking oil and another 17 per cent from waste animal fat.

But the agency noted that the alternative aviation fuel market “remains concentrated” with 25 suppliers providing SAF to 33 airports in 12 countries during 2024. Airports in just five member states - France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden – received 99 per cent of all supply.

Alternative fuel accounted for only 0.6 per cent of all aviation fuel supplied at EU airports last year, which reduced CO2 emissions by around 714 kilotonnes – equivalent to 10,000 flights between Madrid and Paris. But the average price of SAF (€2,085 per tonne) was nearly three times higher than conventional jet fuel (€734 per tonne).

EASA’s next annual report will use 2025 data to assess whether the first blending mandate target of 2 per cent has been achieved.

Maria Rueda, EASA’s safety management, sustainability and global outreach director, said: “This first annual technical report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps.

By Victoria Heath

Earlier this week, plans to fast-track Heathrow’s third runway were announced. While there has been much conjecture on the increased emissions and air pollution that such an upgrade will bring, there’s another source of pollution that, for many, slips under the environmental protection radar: noise.

According to the Airports Commission, a third runway at Heathrow would expose 12,000 to 28,000 more people to noise impacts exceeding 70 decibels. As well as this, a third runway would lead to 300,000 people experiencing being flown over by aircraft for the first time.

Already, reports state Heathrow has noise levels classified as ‘significantly annoying’ that impact more people than any other airport in Europe.

Enjoying this article? Check out our related reads:

Despite these vast numbers and clear implications, aircraft noise is not currently a statutory nuisance in the UK. That means that local authorities do not have the legal power to take action on matters of aircraft noise, and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) does not have the legal power to prevent aircraft flying over a particular location or at a particular time for environmental reasons.

Although maximum noise limits are set for occupational noise exposure, there is no defined limit for environmental noise, including aviation noise.

However, in order to assess the adverse impact of aircraft noise in the UK, government policy has established that the lowest observed adverse level effect is 51dB for an average summer day, and 45 dB for a summer night.

Crucially, this doesn’t mean that noise above these levels will not be allowed. But it does mean that noise will play an important role as a factor in planning decisions within that area (such as airport expansion). There may also be support available for residents for noise mitigation, such as double glazing.

What are the impacts of aircraft noise pollution?

Aircraft noise is a serious public health issue. In the UK, more than one million people are exposed to aircraft noise above levels recommended for the protection of health.

Around 460 schools around Heathrow are exposed to aircraft noise that ‘impede memory and learning’.

As well as this, one large-scale study around Heathrow found people living under the flight path were 10 to 20 per cent more at risk of stroke and heart disease than those not living under the flight path.

Another study by UCL found that those who lived in areas with higher than recommended aircraft noise levels had stiffer and thicker heart muscles that contracted and expanded less easily and were less efficient at pumping blood around the body, compared to those who lived in lower aircraft noise areas.

Emerging studies also link aircraft noise to poor mental health, such as increases in stress and anxiety.

How is noise pollution mitigated?

The UK Government have a framework used to ensure aviation noise remains at a limit. Its main aim is ‘to limit, and where possible, reduce the number of people in the UK significantly affected by aircraft noise’.

To do this, a range of measures is in place. Through planning decisions, governments aim to limit the impact of noise in any new development. As well as this, plans to work with the aviation industry to encourage the development of quieter aircraft are already in place.

As engines become sleeker, noise pollution reduces. For example, Airbus’s A320neo reduces noise with a new engine, lowering it by 50 per cent from the maximum 85dB of the previous A320 model.

While these measures may help to reduce some aviation noise, for the thousands of individuals living below flight paths, it may not be enough. Ultimately, they are still subjected to loud, disturbing and health-impacting noises.",https://geographical.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/heathrow-2.webp,N,,2025-10-27 16:00:13.041271

Held during Manufacturing Month in October, the contest celebrates California’s world-class manufacturing sector and its vital role in driving innovation and economic growth across the state.

A global leader in aerospace and defense

California is home to one-third of the nation’s space technology companies and employs more aerospace engineers and defense personnel than any other state. Global security and aerospace leader Lockheed Martin supports thousands of highly-skilled jobs across multiple facilities dedicated to advanced research, design, manufacturing, and flight testing – including its renowned Skunk Works site in Palmdale, where the X-59 is being developed.

For more than a decade, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works and NASA have collaborated to solve one of the most persistent challenges of supersonic flight – the sonic boom. Skunk Works is leading the design, build, and flight testing of the X-59 quiet supersonic technology aircraft, which will be used to collect community responses to its low-noise sonic “thump”. The findings will provide NASA with the critical data required to help approve new rules that will allow quiet commercial supersonic flight over land. This milestone could unlock a new global market for aircraft manufacturers and enable passengers to travel anywhere in the world in half the time it takes today.

California’s manufacturing strength

As underscored in the California Jobs First Blueprint, California’s manufacturing sector spans several industry verticals, including aerospace & defense, clean tech, high-tech, life sciences, and working lands & water. Home to more than 45,000 manufacturing establishments employing over 1.24 million Californians, the Golden State drives more innovation than anywhere else in the country.

A total of 170 prospective investors and representatives from various national government agencies, local government units, investment promotion agencies, and nongovernment organizations attended the event.

Finland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided support through the BOI-Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI)’s Green Transition Investment Program (GTIP).

The forum facilitated dialogue among government, industry, and development partners to boost the Philippine SAF ecosystem.

SAF is a low-carbon aviation fuel made from non-petroleum sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and captured carbon. It is called a “drop-in“ fuel — blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without major modifications.

It reduces the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of air travel compared to fossil fuels, in some cases able to achieve a net-negative carbon footprint.

Officials of some of its early proponents, such as SAFAsia’s Ditmar Gorges Alcom’s Prateek Tiwari, and Cavitoil Basura Power’s Bart Cassineli, joined a panel discussion on opportunities and challenges in local SAF production.

“For the Philippines, SAF offers an opportunity to demonstrate our leadership in the global effort to combat climate change, transforming a worldwide challenge into a national economic opportunity,” BOI Executive Director Ma. Corazon Halili-Dichosa said.

The BOI is encouraging SAF investments through the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (Create) Act and the Renewable Energy (RE) Law.

The Create Act lowers corporate income taxes to 25 percent, and those of small, medium and micro enterprises to 20 percent.

RE projects using solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass sources are granted a maximum of seven years’ income tax holiday, special corporate income tax rate or enhanced deductions, value added tax and duty perks, among other benefits.

Partnerships

In the second panel discussion, representatives from BOI, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Asian Development Bank, and Central Luzon State University provided insights on development pathways and partnership opportunities for SAF in the Philippines.

BOI Resource-Based Industries Service (RBIS) Acting Director Francis Peñaflor expounded on fiscal incentives for SAF investments.

The Department for Transport (DfT) proposes a variable levy on suppliers in the consultation published this month, with the costs passed “through the supply chain and on to consumers”.

It notes the extent to which costs are passed on will depend on “consumers’ sensitivity to price changes” and the level of competition, suggesting: “It will be a commercial decision for aviation fuel suppliers whether they pass on some or all costs to airlines.”

However, it assumes they “will pass on 100%” of the cost, calculating this will lead to “a small impact on ticket prices”.

An indicative table of levy payments based on 2024 data suggests the costs will amount to more than £55 million a year for large fuel suppliers, £22 million for medium-size producers and £5.5 million for small producers.

The government proposes an additional amount to cover unforeseen costs and to mitigate the risk of under-collection, noting a need for cash reserves and mutualisation of the costs of supplier failures or defaults.

It estimates the costs of a large supplier failure in a single year at £21 million.

These costs will be on top of the price of SAF itself, which Iata reported was more than three times the cost of jet fuel last year, adding $1.6 billion to carriers’ fuel bills.

Iata estimates the cost of SAF in Europe this year at $1.2 billion, with an additional $1.7 billion in ‘compliance fees’, for which it blames the UK and EU’s SAF mandates suggesting these “have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel”.

Airlines must purchase one million tonnes of SAF to meet the requirements of the mandates this year.

Iata notes the cost of SAF in Europe has doubled since the mandates were introduced in January owing to “the compliance fees SAF producers or suppliers are charging” to cover their potential costs.

The UK and EU mandates require SAF to comprise 2% of fuel on all departing flights over the course of this year, rising to 6% in the EU and 10% in the UK by 2030.

High level of compliance critical

The DfT Levy Design Consultation sets out the arrangements for and potential impact of the levy to fund its SAF Revenue Certainty Mechanism, with supplier contributions based on market share and fuel volumes.

It proposes a ‘forecast levy rate’ to provide a guide on future costs and options for mitigating financial risks, administering the levy and enforcing compliance.

The government notes: “It is critical the design of the levy promotes a high level of compliance and responds to non-compliance effectively.”

It proposes “regular public reporting on the extent of non-compliance and actions taken in response” arguing this will act as “a reputational deterrent” but also advocates “a suite of enforcement measures”.

The secretary of state would have the power to impose fines of up to £100,000 or 10% of annual turnover on companies in breach of the levy requirements.

The consultation is due to close on January 8. The DfT said it expects to publish a response next year and is committed to passing “all necessary legislation” for the mechanism to be in place by the end of 2026.",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/074/Shutterstock-airline-fuel_Main.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:00:55.779948

The COP30 climate summit will be held between November 10 and 21 in Belem, Brazil, which is a global leader in biofuels production and use.

“I think there will be more focus on the social aspect of the transition and also on the sustainable use of biomass,” La Camera said at an energy conference in Singapore on Monday, as carried by Reuters.

The participants in the summit would debate biofuels and potentially include a biofuels target in the final declaration, according to IRENA’s chief. The goal could be boosting biofuels production four times by 2035 or setting a target for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) share in the global energy mix, La Camera said.

Brazil last month launched the Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels—known as Belém 4x—an initiative aimed at building high-level political support for the global goal of quadrupling the production and use of sustainable fuels by 2035.

Last month, IRENA and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) launched a financing initiative to support SAF and clean aviation energy projects globally.

The push toward increased biofuel production and use comes amid major oil firms ditching biofuel projects. Shell last month abandoned plans to proceed with the construction of a biofuels facility at its Shell Energy and Chemicals Park in Rotterdam, amid challenging market conditions that makes the project uncompetitive.

BP also cancelled plans for a major biofuels facility at its Rotterdam refinery, scoring another setback for Europe’s drive to scale advanced biofuels.

Earlier this month, IRENA, the COP30 Brazilian Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) said in a report that the world is falling behind on its renewable energy and efficiency goals despite record progress last year.

The global progress report flagged bottlenecks in investment, grids, and supply chains, and urged governments for bolder renewable targets before COP30.

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong on the sidelines of the IATA World Sustainability Symposium at a ceremony hosted by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan and Airbus President Asia-Pacific Anand Stanley.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will collaborate to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technology maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF requires deep collaboration across the value chain, including from policymakers and investors to SAF producers and customers. This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

“SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our decarbonization goals,” said Alex McGowan, Chief Operations & Service Delivery Officer, Cathay. “This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to building a stronger, more scalable SAF industry. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity needed for the future, including our recent investment in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile we are expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organizations.”

“This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference,” said Anand Stanley, President Asia Pacific, Airbus. “The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyze production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The joint commitment also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Airbus and Cathay aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Airbus and Cathay have a long-standing partnership dating back to 1989, when the airline signed its first order for Airbus aircraft. Today, the Cathay Group operates 86 Airbus aircraft with > 70 more on order for future delivery.

GGRs useful for preventing GHGs from entering atmosphere

Greenhouse gas removal technologies, also known as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), are being deployed in the UK to enable the continued burning of natural gas without releasing the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere, which would otherwise accelerate climate breakdown.

While there are plenty of technological solutions to replacing natural gas as a source of electricity generation, such as renewable energy and battery storage, CCUS is also used to mitigate the GHG emissions of hard-to-abate sectors such as cement production.

In September 2025, Heidelberg Materials UK’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) project to decarbonise a cement works achieved its final investment decision (FID).

GGRs critical to achieving net zero – review

Introducing the report, Whitehead said: “Do we need GGRs to get us to net zero? All the evidence points to a firm ‘yes’, unless we can contemplate a low-carbon future with no industry, little transport and difficult-to-swallow mass behaviour change.

“Estimates of the ‘gap’ left after all reasonable steps to decarbonise have been taken vary, but all conclude that the only way to overcome the ‘emissions gap’ is to deploy to varying degrees the sheaf of removal technologies now being developed.”

The review concluded that “without GGRs we cannot meet net zero, and the value of doing so in a way that achieves geological net zero”, however, it added “that there is no silver bullet” to decarbonising the economy.

It presented a series of recommendations to the government. It said the “government should develop a GGR Strategy to outline the contribution of GGR solutions required to meet carbon budgets and net zero”.

In addition, the review said the government should “establish an Office for Greenhouse Gas Removals to produce more coordinated action on GGRs, and to enable quicker and more efficient rollout of policy and project deployment”.

The government has recently said that it wants to reduce the number of quangos (quasi-autonomous non-government organisations). That didn’t stop it from recently creating the Office for Clean Energy Jobs (OCEJ) to help deliver the 400,000 new clean energy jobs by 2030 which it says are needed for the journey to net zero.

The review added that the government “should adopt a strategic aim to minimise the use of imported biomass feedstocks” and it should “amend and rename the SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] Mandate to become a Net Zero Aviation Mandate, with a trajectory that means that by 2045 all flights taking off from the UK are made climate neutral.

“The amended Mandate should drive procurement of both SAF and permanent GGRs, with competition between these solutions.”

The final recommendation was that the government should “exploit UK growth opportunities” by making the UK a leader in deploying and promoting GGR technologies.

CCUS industry welcomes review and pledges to promote the technology

CCSA (Carbon Capture and Storage Association) UK director Mark Sommerfeld said: “The Independent Review of Greenhouse Gas Removals marks a pivotal step in the UK’s net zero journey.

“Technologies such as Bioenergy with CCS, Direct Air Capture with Storage and Energy from Waste with CCS are essential to tackling residual emissions, addressing industrial decarbonisation and securing a reliable, low-carbon energy system.

“The Review outlines a clear path to scale these solutions, with success hinging on a credible business model, investment certainty and robust CO₂ transport and storage infrastructure.

“With vast CO₂ storage potential, established CCUS infrastructure and world-leading low-carbon expertise, the UK has a real opportunity to be a global leader in high-integrity carbon removals.

“We look forward to working with the government and industry to deliver 5 Mtpa of engineered removals by 2030, rising to 23 Mtpa by 2035 – boosting growth, energy security and addressing climate change as global demand for GGR credits surges.”

Review ‘blinkered by a silo mentality’ – anti-CCUS campaign

Scrap Carbon Capture campaign lead campaigner Andrew Boswell said: “Dr Whitehead’s review is blinkered by a silo mentality.

“It treats greenhouse-gas removals (GGRs) as a standalone fix while ignoring the huge externalities built into relying on the Government’s CCS network to deliver them.

“Every UK cluster is front-loaded with fossil-fuel anchor projects that lock in decades of methane-leaking LNG imports and billions in public subsidies ultimately paid by consumers.

“Whitehead calls for faster CCUS expansion but never counts the carbon or economic cost of that dependence.

“He also sidesteps the Drax issue — the UK’s biggest emitter being re-badged as our flagship BECCS [Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage] project, fuelled by imported forest biomass.

“And his proposal to use GGRs to offset aviation growth misuses scarce removal capacity: these technologies should be for cleaning the atmosphere, not for licensing airport expansion.

“Until we decouple GGR policy from fossil and aviation interests, we’re subsidising the problem, not the solution.”

Minister says government will continue to improve GGR deployment

Energy minister Michael Shanks said: “Greenhouse Gas Removal technologies have the potential to propel us towards our climate targets, as the UK continues to be a world leader on climate action, protecting current and future generations.

“The report recognises the important role GGR technologies can play in delivering clean power and net zero. Already, we are investing in first-of-a-kind carbon capture projects in the UK, – creating thousands of jobs in North Wales, the North West and Teesside.

“We will take the time to carefully consider these findings and consider how best to use these technologies to deliver climate action, good jobs and energy security for the country.”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2009/05/carbon.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 12:02:59.704072
